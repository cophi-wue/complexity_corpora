  
Phineas
Finn
Proposes
to
Stand
for
Loughshane
 
Dr.
Finn
,
of
Killaloe
,
in
county
Clare
,
was
as
well
known
in
those
parts
,
 
<EOS>
the
confines
,
that
is
,
of
the
counties
Clare
,
Limerick
,
Tipperary
,
and
Galway
,
 
as
was
the
bishop
himself
who
lived
in
the
same
town
,
and
was
as
much
respected
.
<EOS>
Many
said
that
the
doctor
was
the
richer
man
of
the
two
,
and
the
practice
of
his
profession
was
extended
over
almost
as
wide
a
district
.
<EOS>
Indeed
the
bishop
whom
he
was
privileged
to
attend
,
although
a
Roman
Catholic
,
always
spoke
of
their
dioceses
being
conterminate
.
<EOS>
It
will
therefore
be
understood
that
Dr.
Finn
,
 
Malachi
Finn
was
his
full
name
,
 
had
obtained
a
wide
reputation
as
a
country
practitioner
in
the
west
of
Ireland
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
a
man
sufficiently
well
to
do
,
though
that
boast
made
by
his
friends
,
that
he
was
as
warm
a
man
as
the
bishop
,
had
but
little
truth
to
support
it
.
<EOS>
Bishops
in
Ireland
,
if
they
live
at
home
,
even
in
these
days
,
are
very
warm
men
;
and
Dr.
Finn
had
not
a
penny
in
the
world
for
which
he
had
not
worked
hard
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
moreover
,
a
costly
family
,
five
daughters
and
one
son
,
and
,
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
,
no
provision
in
the
way
of
marriage
or
profession
had
been
made
for
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
Of
the
one
son
,
Phineas
,
the
hero
of
the
following
pages
,
the
mother
and
five
sisters
were
very
proud
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
accustomed
to
say
that
his
goose
was
as
good
as
any
other
man
's
goose
,
as
far
as
he
could
see
as
yet
;
but
that
he
should
like
some
very
strong
evidence
before
he
allowed
himself
to
express
an
opinion
that
the
young
bird
partook
,
in
any
degree
,
of
the
qualities
of
a
swan
.
<EOS>
From
which
it
may
be
gathered
that
Dr.
Finn
was
a
man
of
common
-
sense
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
come
to
be
a
swan
in
the
estimation
of
his
mother
and
sisters
by
reason
of
certain
early
successes
at
college
.
<EOS>
His
father
,
whose
religion
was
not
of
that
bitter
kind
in
which
we
in
England
are
apt
to
suppose
that
all
the
Irish
Roman
Catholics
indulge
,
had
sent
his
son
to
Trinity
;
and
there
were
some
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Killaloe
,
 
patients
,
probably
,
of
Dr.
Duggin
,
of
Castle
Connell
,
a
learned
physician
who
had
spent
a
fruitless
life
in
endeavouring
to
make
head
against
Dr.
Finn
,
 
who
declared
that
old
Finn
would
not
be
sorry
if
his
son
were
to
turn
Protestant
and
go
in
for
a
fellowship
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
was
a
Protestant
,
and
the
five
Miss
Finns
were
Protestants
,
and
the
doctor
himself
was
very
much
given
to
dining
out
among
his
Protestant
friends
on
a
Friday
.
<EOS>
Our
Phineas
,
however
,
did
not
turn
Protestant
up
in
Dublin
,
whatever
his
father
's
secret
wishes
on
that
subject
may
have
been
.
<EOS>
He
did
join
a
debating
society
,
to
success
in
which
his
religion
was
no
bar
;
and
he
there
achieved
a
sort
of
distinction
which
was
both
easy
and
pleasant
,
and
<EOS>
which
,
making
its
way
down
to
Killaloe
,
assisted
in
engendering
those
ideas
as
to
swanhood
of
which
maternal
and
sisterly
minds
are
so
sweetly
susceptible
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
half
a
dozen
old
windbags
at
the
present
moment
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
who
were
great
fellows
at
debating
clubs
when
they
were
boys
.
"
<EOS>
"
Phineas
is
not
a
boy
any
longer
,
"
said
Mrs.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
windbags
do
n't
get
college
scholarships
,
"
said
Matilda
Finn
,
the
second
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
papa
always
snubs
Phinny
,
"
said
Barbara
,
the
youngest
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
snub
you
,
if
you
do
n't
take
care
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
taking
Barbara
tenderly
by
the
ear
;
 
for
his
youngest
daughter
was
the
doctor
's
pet
.
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
certainly
did
not
snub
his
son
,
for
he
allowed
him
to
go
over
to
London
when
he
was
twenty
-
two
years
of
age
,
in
order
that
he
might
read
with
an
English
barrister
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
doctor
's
wish
that
his
son
might
be
called
to
the
Irish
Bar
,
and
the
young
man
's
desire
that
he
might
go
to
the
English
Bar
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
so
far
gave
way
,
under
the
influence
of
Phineas
himself
,
and
of
all
the
young
women
of
the
family
,
as
to
pay
the
usual
fee
to
a
very
competent
and
learned
gentleman
in
the
Middle
Temple
,
and
to
allow
his
son
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
per
annum
for
three
years
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
,
however
,
was
still
firm
in
his
intention
that
his
son
should
settle
in
Dublin
,
and
take
the
Munster
Circuit
,
 
believing
that
Phineas
might
come
to
want
home
influences
and
home
connections
,
in
spite
of
the
swanhood
which
was
attributed
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
sat
his
terms
for
three
years
,
and
was
duly
called
to
the
Bar
;
but
no
evidence
came
home
as
to
the
acquirement
of
any
considerable
amount
of
law
lore
,
or
even
as
to
much
law
study
,
on
the
part
of
the
young
aspirant
.
<EOS>
The
learned
pundit
at
whose
feet
he
had
been
sitting
was
not
especially
loud
in
praise
of
his
pupil
's
industry
,
though
he
did
say
a
pleasant
word
or
two
as
to
his
pupil
's
intelligence
.
<EOS>
Phineas
himself
did
not
boast
much
of
his
own
hard
work
when
at
home
during
the
long
vacation
.
<EOS>
No
rumours
of
expected
successes
,
 
of
expected
professional
successes
,
 
reached
the
ears
of
any
of
the
Finn
family
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
there
came
tidings
which
maintained
those
high
ideas
in
the
maternal
bosom
of
which
mention
has
been
made
,
and
which
were
of
sufficient
strength
to
induce
the
doctor
,
in
opposition
to
his
own
judgment
,
to
consent
to
the
continued
residence
of
his
son
in
London
.
<EOS>
Phineas
belonged
to
an
excellent
club
,
 
the
Reform
Club
,
 
and
went
into
very
good
society
.
<EOS>
He
was
hand
in
glove
with
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
the
youngest
son
of
Lord
Claddagh
.
<EOS>
He
was
intimate
with
Barrington
Erle
,
who
had
been
private
secretary
,
 
one
of
the
private
secretaries
,
 
to
the
great
Whig
Prime
Minister
who
was
lately
in
but
was
now
out
.
<EOS>
He
had
dined
three
or
four
times
with
that
great
Whig
nobleman
,
the
Earl
of
Brentford
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
been
assured
that
if
he
stuck
to
the
English
Bar
he
would
certainly
do
well
.
<EOS>
Though
he
might
fail
to
succeed
in
court
or
in
chambers
,
he
would
doubtless
have
given
to
him
some
one
of
those
numerous
appointments
for
which
none
but
clever
young
barristers
are
supposed
to
be
fitting
candidates
.
<EOS>
The
old
doctor
yielded
for
another
year
,
although
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
he
was
called
upon
to
pay
a
sum
of
three
hundred
pounds
,
which
was
then
due
by
Phineas
to
creditors
in
London
.
<EOS>
When
the
doctor
's
male
friends
in
and
about
Killaloe
heard
that
he
had
done
so
,
they
said
that
he
was
doting
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
the
Miss
Finns
was
as
yet
married
;
and
,
after
all
that
had
been
said
about
the
doctor
's
wealth
,
it
was
supposed
that
there
would
not
be
above
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
among
them
all
,
were
he
to
give
up
his
profession
.
<EOS>
But
the
doctor
,
when
he
paid
that
three
hundred
pounds
for
his
son
,
buckled
to
his
work
again
,
though
he
had
for
twelve
months
talked
of
giving
up
the
midwifery
.
<EOS>
He
buckled
to
again
,
to
the
great
disgust
of
Dr.
Duggin
,
who
at
this
time
said
very
ill
-
natured
things
about
young
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
three
years
Phineas
was
called
to
the
Bar
,
and
immediately
received
a
letter
from
his
father
asking
minutely
as
to
his
professional
intentions
.
<EOS>
His
father
recommended
him
to
settle
in
Dublin
,
and
promised
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
for
three
more
years
,
on
condition
that
this
advice
was
followed
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
absolutely
say
that
the
allowance
would
be
stopped
if
the
advice
were
not
followed
,
but
that
was
plainly
to
be
implied
.
<EOS>
That
letter
came
at
the
moment
of
a
dissolution
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
,
the
Conservative
Prime
Minister
,
who
had
now
been
in
office
for
the
almost
unprecedentedly
long
period
of
fifteen
months
,
had
found
that
he
could
not
face
continued
majorities
against
him
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
had
dissolved
the
House
.
<EOS>
Rumour
declared
that
he
would
have
much
preferred
to
resign
,
and
betake
himself
once
again
to
the
easy
glories
of
opposition
;
but
his
party
had
naturally
been
obdurate
with
him
,
and
he
had
resolved
to
appeal
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
When
Phineas
received
his
father
's
letter
,
it
had
just
been
suggested
to
him
at
the
Reform
Club
that
he
should
stand
for
the
Irish
borough
of
Loughshane
.
  
<EOS>
This
proposition
had
taken
Phineas
Finn
so
much
by
surprise
that
when
first
made
to
him
by
Barrington
Erle
it
took
his
breath
away
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
he
stand
for
Parliament
,
twenty
-
four
years
old
,
with
no
vestige
of
property
belonging
to
him
,
without
a
penny
in
his
purse
,
as
completely
dependent
on
his
father
as
he
was
when
he
first
went
to
school
at
eleven
years
of
age
!
<EOS>
And
for
Loughshane
,
a
little
borough
in
the
county
Galway
,
for
which
a
brother
of
that
fine
old
Irish
peer
,
the
Earl
of
Tulla
,
had
been
sitting
for
the
last
twenty
years
,
 
a
fine
,
high
-
minded
representative
of
the
thorough
-
going
Orange
Protestant
feeling
of
Ireland
!
<EOS>
And
the
Earl
of
Tulla
,
to
whom
almost
all
Loughshane
belonged
,
 
or
at
any
rate
the
land
about
Loughshane
,
 
was
one
of
his
father
's
staunchest
friends
!
<EOS>
Loughshane
is
in
county
Galway
,
but
the
Earl
of
Tulla
usually
lived
at
his
seat
in
county
Clare
,
not
more
than
ten
miles
from
Killaloe
,
and
always
confided
his
gouty
feet
,
and
the
weak
nerves
of
the
old
countess
,
and
the
stomachs
of
all
his
domestics
,
to
the
care
of
Dr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
How
was
it
possible
that
Phineas
should
stand
for
Loughshane
?
<EOS>
From
whence
was
the
money
to
come
for
such
a
contest
?
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
dream
,
a
grand
idea
,
lifting
Phineas
almost
off
the
earth
by
its
glory
.
<EOS>
When
the
proposition
was
first
made
to
him
in
the
smoking
-
room
at
the
Reform
Club
by
his
friend
Erle
,
he
was
aware
that
he
blushed
like
a
girl
,
and
that
he
was
unable
at
the
moment
to
express
himself
plainly
,
 
so
great
<EOS>
was
his
astonishment
and
so
great
his
gratification
.
<EOS>
But
before
ten
minutes
had
passed
by
,
while
Barrington
Erle
was
still
sitting
over
his
shoulder
on
the
club
sofa
,
and
before
the
blushes
had
altogether
vanished
,
he
had
seen
the
improbability
of
the
scheme
,
and
had
explained
to
his
friend
that
the
thing
could
not
be
done
.
<EOS>
But
to
his
increased
astonishment
,
his
friend
made
nothing
of
the
difficulties
.
<EOS>
Loughshane
,
according
to
Barrington
Erle
,
was
so
small
a
place
,
that
the
expense
would
be
very
little
.
<EOS>
There
were
altogether
no
more
than
307
registered
electors
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
were
so
far
removed
from
the
world
,
and
were
so
ignorant
of
the
world
's
good
things
,
that
they
knew
nothing
about
bribery
.
<EOS>
The
Hon
.
<EOS>
George
Morris
,
who
had
sat
for
the
last
twenty
years
,
was
very
unpopular
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
near
the
borough
since
the
last
election
,
he
had
hardly
done
more
than
show
himself
in
Parliament
,
and
had
neither
given
a
shilling
in
the
town
nor
got
a
place
under
Government
for
a
single
son
of
Loughshane
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
has
quarrelled
with
his
brother
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
The
devil
he
has
!
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
they
always
swore
by
each
other
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
's
at
each
other
they
swear
now
,
"
said
Barrington
;
<EOS>
"
George
has
asked
the
Earl
for
more
money
,
and
the
Earl
has
cut
up
rusty
.
<EOS>
"
Then
the
negotiator
went
on
to
explain
that
the
expenses
of
the
election
would
be
defrayed
out
of
a
certain
fund
collected
for
such
purposes
,
that
Loughshane
had
been
chosen
as
a
cheap
place
,
and
that
Phineas
Finn
had
been
chosen
as
a
safe
and
promising
young
man
.
<EOS>
As
for
qualification
,
if
any
question
were
raised
,
that
should
be
made
all
right
.
<EOS>
An
Irish
candidate
was
wanted
,
and
a
Roman
Catholic
.
<EOS>
So
much
the
Loughshaners
would
require
on
their
own
account
when
instigated
to
dismiss
from
their
service
that
thorough
-
going
Protestant
,
the
Hon
.
<EOS>
George
Morris
.
<EOS>
Then
"
the
party
,
"
 
by
which
Barrington
Erle
probably
meant
the
great
man
in
whose
service
he
himself
had
become
a
politician
,
 
required
that
the
candidate
should
be
a
safe
man
,
one
who
would
support
"
the
party
,
"
 
not
a
cantankerous
,
red
-
hot
semi
-
Fenian
,
running
about
to
meetings
at
the
Rotunda
,
and
such
-
like
,
with
views
of
his
own
about
tenant
-
right
and
the
Irish
Church
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
views
of
my
own
,
"
said
Phineas
,
blushing
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
you
have
,
my
dear
boy
,
"
said
Barrington
,
clapping
him
on
the
back
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
come
to
you
unless
you
had
views
.
<EOS>
But
your
views
and
ours
are
the
same
,
and
you
're
just
the
lad
for
Galway
.
<EOS>
You
might
n't
have
such
an
opening
again
in
your
life
,
and
of
course
you
'll
stand
for
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
"
Then
the
conversation
was
over
,
the
private
secretary
went
away
to
arrange
some
other
little
matter
of
the
kind
,
and
Phineas
Finn
was
left
alone
to
consider
the
proposition
that
had
been
made
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
To
become
a
member
of
the
British
Parliament
!
<EOS>
In
all
those
hot
contests
at
the
two
debating
clubs
to
which
he
had
belonged
,
this
had
been
the
ambition
which
had
moved
him
.
<EOS>
For
,
after
all
,
to
what
purpose
of
their
own
had
those
empty
debates
ever
tended
?
<EOS>
He
and
three
or
four
others
who
had
called
themselves
Liberals
had
been
pitted
against
four
or
five
who
had
called
themselves
Conservatives
,
and
night
after
night
they
had
discussed
some
ponderous
subject
without
any
idea
that
one
would
ever
persuade
another
,
or
that
their
talking
would
ever
conduce
to
any
action
or
to
any
result
.
<EOS>
But
each
of
these
combatants
had
felt
,
 
without
daring
to
announce
a
hope
on
the
subject
among
themselves
,
 
that
the
present
arena
was
only
a
trial
-
ground
for
some
possible
greater
amphitheatre
,
for
some
future
debating
club
in
which
debates
would
lead
to
action
,
and
in
which
eloquence
would
have
power
,
even
though
persuasion
might
be
out
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
certainly
had
never
dared
to
speak
,
even
to
himself
,
of
such
a
hope
.
<EOS>
The
labours
of
the
Bar
had
to
be
encountered
before
the
dawn
of
such
a
hope
could
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
gradually
learned
to
feel
that
his
prospects
at
the
Bar
were
not
as
yet
very
promising
.
<EOS>
As
regarded
professional
work
he
had
been
idle
,
and
how
then
could
he
have
a
hope
?
  
<EOS>
And
now
this
thing
,
which
he
regarded
as
being
of
all
things
in
the
world
the
most
honourable
,
had
come
to
him
all
at
once
,
and
was
possibly
within
his
reach
!
<EOS>
If
he
could
believe
Barrington
Erle
,
he
had
only
to
lift
up
his
hand
,
and
he
might
be
in
Parliament
within
two
months
.
<EOS>
And
who
was
to
be
believed
on
such
a
subject
<EOS>
if
not
Barrington
Erle
?
<EOS>
This
was
Erle
's
special
business
,
and
such
a
man
would
not
have
come
to
him
on
such
a
subject
<EOS>
had
he
not
been
in
earnest
,
and
had
he
not
himself
believed
in
success
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
opening
ready
,
an
opening
to
this
great
glory
,
 
if
only
it
might
be
possible
for
him
to
fill
it
!
  
<EOS>
What
would
his
father
say
?
<EOS>
His
father
would
of
course
oppose
the
plan
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
opposed
his
father
,
his
father
would
of
course
stop
his
income
.
<EOS>
And
such
an
income
as
it
was
!
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
a
man
should
sit
in
Parliament
and
live
upon
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
?
<EOS>
Since
that
payment
of
his
debts
he
had
become
again
embarrassed
,
 
to
a
slight
amount
.
<EOS>
He
owed
a
tailor
a
trifle
,
and
a
bootmaker
a
trifle
,
 
and
something
to
the
man
who
sold
gloves
and
shirts
;
and
yet
he
had
done
his
best
to
keep
out
of
debt
with
more
than
Irish
pertinacity
,
living
very
closely
,
breakfasting
upon
tea
and
a
roll
,
and
dining
frequently
for
a
shilling
at
a
luncheon
-
house
up
a
court
near
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
Where
should
he
dine
if
the
Loughshaners
elected
him
to
Parliament
?
<EOS>
And
then
he
painted
to
himself
a
not
untrue
picture
of
the
probable
miseries
of
a
man
who
begins
life
too
high
up
on
the
ladder
,
 
who
succeeds
in
mounting
before
he
has
learned
how
to
hold
on
when
he
is
aloft
.
<EOS>
For
our
Phineas
Finn
was
a
young
man
not
without
sense
,
 
not
entirely
a
windbag
.
<EOS>
If
he
did
this
thing
the
probability
was
that
he
might
become
utterly
a
castaway
,
and
go
entirely
to
the
dogs
before
he
was
thirty
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
of
penniless
men
who
had
got
into
Parliament
,
and
to
whom
had
come
such
a
fate
.
<EOS>
He
was
able
to
name
to
himself
a
man
or
two
<EOS>
whose
barks
,
carrying
more
sail
than
they
could
bear
,
had
gone
to
pieces
among
early
breakers
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
would
it
not
be
better
to
go
to
pieces
early
than
never
to
carry
any
sail
at
all
?
<EOS>
And
there
was
,
at
any
rate
,
the
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
He
was
already
a
barrister
,
and
there
were
so
many
things
open
to
a
barrister
with
a
seat
in
Parliament
!
<EOS>
And
as
he
knew
of
men
who
had
been
utterly
ruined
by
such
early
mounting
,
so
also
did
he
know
of
others
whose
fortunes
had
been
made
by
happy
audacity
when
they
were
young
.
<EOS>
He
almost
thought
that
he
could
die
happy
if
he
had
once
taken
his
seat
in
Parliament
,
 
if
he
had
received
one
letter
with
those
grand
initials
written
after
his
name
on
the
address
.
<EOS>
Young
men
in
battle
are
called
upon
to
lead
forlorn
hopes
.
<EOS>
Three
fall
,
perhaps
,
to
one
who
gets
through
;
but
the
one
who
gets
through
will
have
the
Victoria
Cross
to
carry
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
forlorn
hope
;
and
as
he
had
been
invited
to
undertake
the
work
,
he
would
not
turn
from
the
danger
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
he
again
saw
Barrington
Erle
by
appointment
,
and
then
wrote
the
following
letter
to
his
father
:
    
Reform
Club
,
Feb.
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FATHER
,
  
I
am
afraid
that
the
purport
of
this
letter
will
startle
you
,
but
I
hope
that
when
you
have
finished
it
you
will
think
that
I
am
right
in
my
decision
as
to
what
I
am
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
are
no
doubt
aware
that
the
dissolution
of
Parliament
will
take
place
at
once
,
and
that
we
shall
be
in
all
the
turmoil
of
a
general
election
by
the
middle
of
March
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
invited
to
stand
for
Loughshane
,
and
have
consented
.
<EOS>
The
proposition
has
been
made
to
me
by
my
friend
Barrington
Erle
,
Mr.
Mildmay
's
private
secretary
,
and
has
been
made
on
behalf
of
the
Political
Committee
of
the
Reform
Club
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
that
I
should
not
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
with
a
less
thorough
promise
of
support
than
this
gives
me
,
nor
should
I
think
of
it
<EOS>
now
had
I
not
been
assured
that
none
of
the
expense
of
the
election
would
fall
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
could
not
have
asked
you
to
pay
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
such
a
proposition
,
so
made
,
I
have
felt
that
it
would
be
cowardly
to
give
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
but
regard
such
a
selection
as
a
great
honour
.
<EOS>
I
own
that
I
am
fond
of
politics
,
and
have
taken
great
delight
in
their
study
  
(
"
Stupid
young
fool
!
"
<EOS>
his
father
said
to
himself
as
he
read
this
)
 
<EOS>
and
it
has
been
my
dream
for
years
past
to
have
a
seat
in
Parliament
at
some
future
time
.
<EOS>
(
"
Dream
!
<EOS>
yes
;
I
wonder
whether
he
has
ever
dreamed
what
he
is
to
live
upon
.
"
)
<EOS>
The
chance
has
now
come
to
me
much
earlier
than
I
have
looked
for
it
,
but
I
do
not
think
that
it
should
on
that
account
be
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
Looking
to
my
profession
,
I
find
that
many
things
are
open
to
a
barrister
with
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
that
the
House
need
not
interfere
much
with
a
man
's
practice
.
<EOS>
(
"
Not
if
he
has
got
to
the
top
of
his
tree
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
)
  
<EOS>
My
chief
doubt
arose
from
the
fact
of
your
old
friendship
with
Lord
Tulla
,
whose
brother
has
filled
the
seat
for
I
do
n't
know
how
many
years
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
that
George
Morris
must
go
;
or
,
at
least
,
that
he
must
be
opposed
by
a
Liberal
candidate
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
not
stand
,
some
one
else
will
,
and
I
should
think
that
Lord
Tulla
will
be
too
much
of
a
man
to
make
any
personal
quarrel
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
to
lose
the
borough
,
why
should
not
I
have
it
as
well
as
another
?
  
<EOS>
I
can
fancy
,
my
dear
father
,
all
that
you
will
say
as
to
my
imprudence
,
and
I
quite
confess
that
I
have
not
a
word
to
answer
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
myself
more
than
once
,
since
last
night
,
that
I
shall
probably
ruin
myself
.
<EOS>
(
"
I
wonder
whether
he
has
ever
told
himself
that
he
will
probably
ruin
me
also
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
)
<EOS>
But
I
am
prepared
to
ruin
myself
in
such
a
cause
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
one
dependent
on
me
;
and
,
as
long
as
I
do
nothing
to
disgrace
my
name
,
I
may
dispose
of
myself
as
I
please
.
<EOS>
If
you
decide
on
stopping
my
allowance
,
I
shall
have
no
feeling
of
anger
against
you
.
<EOS>
(
"
How
very
considerate
!
"
said
the
doctor
.
)
<EOS>
And
in
that
case
I
shall
endeavour
to
support
myself
by
my
pen
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
done
a
little
for
the
magazines
.
  
<EOS>
Give
my
best
love
to
my
mother
and
sisters
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
receive
me
during
the
time
of
the
election
,
I
shall
see
them
soon
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
will
be
best
for
me
to
say
that
I
have
positively
decided
on
making
the
attempt
;
that
is
to
say
,
if
the
Club
Committee
is
as
good
as
its
promise
.
<EOS>
I
have
weighed
the
matter
all
round
,
and
I
regard
the
prize
as
being
so
great
,
that
I
am
prepared
to
run
any
risk
to
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
to
me
,
with
my
views
about
politics
,
the
running
of
such
a
risk
is
no
more
than
a
duty
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
keep
my
hand
from
the
work
now
that
the
work
has
come
in
the
way
of
my
hand
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
most
anxious
to
get
a
line
from
you
in
answer
to
this
.
  
<EOS>
Your
most
affectionate
son
,
  
PHINEAS
FINN
.
  
<EOS>
I
question
whether
Dr.
Finn
,
when
he
read
this
letter
,
did
not
feel
more
of
pride
than
of
anger
,
 
whether
he
was
not
rather
gratified
than
displeased
,
in
spite
of
all
that
his
common
-
sense
told
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
daughters
,
when
they
heard
the
news
,
were
clearly
on
the
side
of
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
immediately
expressed
an
opinion
that
Parliament
would
be
the
making
of
her
son
,
and
that
everybody
would
be
sure
to
employ
<EOS>
so
distinguished
a
barrister
.
<EOS>
The
girls
declared
that
Phineas
ought
,
at
any
rate
,
to
have
his
chance
,
and
almost
asserted
that
it
would
be
brutal
in
their
father
to
stand
in
their
brother
's
way
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
that
the
doctor
tried
to
explain
that
going
into
Parliament
could
not
help
a
young
barrister
,
whatever
it
might
do
for
one
thoroughly
established
in
his
profession
;
that
Phineas
,
if
successful
at
Loughshane
,
would
at
once
abandon
all
idea
of
earning
any
income
,
 
that
the
proposition
,
coming
from
so
poor
a
man
,
was
a
monstrosity
,
 
that
such
an
opposition
to
the
Morris
family
,
coming
from
a
son
of
his
,
would
be
gross
ingratitude
to
Lord
Tulla
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
and
the
girls
talked
him
down
,
and
the
doctor
himself
was
almost
carried
away
by
something
like
vanity
in
regard
to
his
son
's
future
position
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
wrote
a
letter
strongly
advising
Phineas
to
abandon
the
project
.
<EOS>
But
he
himself
was
aware
that
the
letter
which
he
wrote
was
not
one
from
which
any
success
could
be
expected
.
<EOS>
He
advised
his
son
,
but
did
not
command
him
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
threats
as
to
stopping
his
income
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
tell
Phineas
,
in
so
many
words
,
that
he
was
proposing
to
make
an
ass
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
argued
very
prudently
against
the
plan
,
and
Phineas
,
when
he
received
his
father
's
letter
,
of
course
felt
that
it
was
tantamount
to
a
paternal
permission
to
proceed
with
the
matter
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
he
got
a
letter
from
his
mother
full
of
affection
,
full
of
pride
,
 
not
exactly
telling
him
to
stand
for
Loughshane
by
all
means
,
for
Mrs.
Finn
was
not
the
woman
to
run
openly
counter
to
her
husband
in
any
advice
given
by
her
to
their
son
,
 
but
giving
him
every
encouragement
which
motherly
affection
and
motherly
pride
could
bestow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
come
to
us
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
you
do
make
up
your
mind
to
be
member
for
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
We
shall
all
of
us
be
so
delighted
to
have
you
!
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
had
fallen
into
a
sea
of
doubt
after
writing
to
his
father
,
and
who
had
demanded
a
week
from
Barrington
Erle
to
consider
the
matter
,
was
elated
to
positive
certainty
by
the
joint
effect
of
the
two
letters
from
home
.
<EOS>
He
understood
it
all
.
<EOS>
His
mother
and
sisters
were
altogether
in
favour
of
his
audacity
,
and
even
his
father
was
not
disposed
to
quarrel
with
him
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
you
at
your
word
,
"
he
said
to
Barrington
Erle
at
the
club
that
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
word
?
<EOS>
"
said
Erle
,
who
had
too
many
irons
in
the
fire
to
be
thinking
always
of
Loughshane
and
Phineas
Finn
,
 
or
who
at
any
rate
did
not
choose
to
let
his
anxiety
on
the
subject
be
seen
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
Loughshane

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
All
right

old

we

Phineas
Finn
Is
Elected
for
Loughshane
 
<EOS>
One
great
difficulty
about
the
borough
vanished
in
a
very
wonderful
way
at
the
first
touch
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
,
who
was
a
man
stout
at
heart
,
and
by
no
means
afraid
of
his
great
friends
,
drove
himself
over
to
Castlemorris
to
tell
his
news
to
the
Earl
,
as
soon
as
he
got
a
second
letter
from
his
son
declaring
his
intention
of
proceeding
with
the
business
,
let
the
results
be
what
they
might
.
<EOS>
Lord
Tulla
was
a
passionate
old
man
,
and
the
doctor
expected
that
there
would
be
a
quarrel
;
 
but
he
was
prepared
to
face
that
.
<EOS>
He
was
under
no
special
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
lord
,
having
given
as
much
as
he
had
taken
in
the
long
intercourse
which
had
existed
between
them
;
 
and
he
agreed
with
his
son
in
thinking
that
if
there
was
to
be
a
Liberal
candidate
at
Loughshane
,
no
consideration
of
old
pill
-
boxes
and
gallipots
should
deter
his
son
Phineas
from
standing
.
<EOS>
Other
considerations
might
very
probably
deter
him
,
but
not
that
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
probably
would
be
of
a
different
opinion
,
and
the
doctor
felt
it
to
be
incumbent
on
him
to
break
the
news
to
Lord
Tulla
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
devil
he
is
!
"
said
the
Earl
,
when
the
doctor
had
told
his
story
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Finn
,
I
'll
support
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
support
him
,
Lord
Tulla
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
why
should
n't
I
support
him
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
's
not
so
bad
with
me
in
the
country
that
my
support
will
rob
him
of
his
chance
!
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
one
thing
for
certain
,
I
wo
n't
support
George
Morris
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
my
lord
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
;
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
never
taken
much
part
in
politics
myself
,
as
you
know
;
but
my
boy
Phineas
is
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
a
 
for
sides
.
<EOS>
What
has
my
party
done
for
me
?
<EOS>
Look
at
my
cousin
,
Dick
Morris
.
<EOS>
There
's
not
a
clergyman
in
Ireland
stauncher
to
them
than
he
has
been
,
and
now
they
've
given
the
deanery
of
Kilfenora
to
a
man
that
never
had
a
father
,
though
I
condescended
to
ask
for
it
for
my
cousin
.
<EOS>
Let
them
wait
till
I
ask
for
anything
again
.
"
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
,
who
knew
all
about
Dick
Morris
's
debts
,
and
who
had
heard
of
his
modes
of
preaching
,
was
not
surprised
at
the
decision
of
the
Conservative
bestower
of
Irish
Church
patronage
;
but
on
this
subject
he
said
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
for
George
,
"
continued
the
Earl
,
"
I
will
never
lift
my
hand
again
for
him
.
<EOS>
His
standing
for
Loughshane
would
be
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
My
own
tenants
would
n't
vote
for
him
if
I
were
to
ask
them
myself
.
<EOS>
Peter
Blake
"
 
Mr.
Peter
Blake
was
the
lord
's
agent
 
"
told
me
only
a
week
ago
that
it
would
be
useless
.
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
is
gone
,
and
for
my
part
I
wish
they
'd
disenfranchise
the
borough
.
<EOS>
I
wish
they
'd
disenfranchise
the
whole
country
,
and
send
us
a
military
governor
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
such
members
as
we
send
?
<EOS>
There
is
n't
one
gentleman
among
ten
of
them
.
<EOS>
Your
son
is
welcome
for
me
.
<EOS>
What
support
I
can
give
him
he
shall
have
,
but
it
is
n't
much
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
had
better
come
and
see
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
promised
that
his
son
should
ride
over
to
Castlemorris
,
and
then
took
his
leave
,
 
not
specially
flattered
,
as
he
felt
that
were
his
son
to
be
returned
,
the
Earl
would
not
regard
him
as
the
one
gentleman
among
ten
whom
the
county
might
send
to
leaven
the
remainder
of
its
members
,
 
but
aware
that
the
greatest
impediment
in
his
son
's
way
was
already
removed
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
had
not
gone
to
Castlemorris
with
any
idea
of
canvassing
for
his
son
,
and
yet
he
had
canvassed
for
him
most
satisfactorily
.
<EOS>
When
he
got
home
<EOS>
he
did
not
know
how
to
speak
of
the
matter
otherwise
than
triumphantly
to
his
wife
and
daughters
.
<EOS>
Though
he
desired
to
curse
,
his
mouth
would
speak
blessings
.
<EOS>
Before
that
evening
was
over
the
prospects
of
Phineas
at
Loughshane
were
spoken
of
with
open
enthusiasm
before
the
doctor
,
and
by
the
next
day
's
post
a
letter
was
written
to
him
by
Matilda
,
informing
him
that
the
Earl
was
prepared
to
receive
him
with
open
arms
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
has
been
over
there
and
managed
it
all
,
"
said
Matilda
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
told
George
Morris
is
n't
going
to
stand
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
to
Phineas
the
night
before
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
brother
wo
n't
support
him
.
<EOS>
His
brother
means
to
support
me
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
can
hardly
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
you
it
is
.
<EOS>
My
father
has
known
the
Earl
these
twenty
years
,
and
has
managed
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Finn
,
you
're
not
going
to
play
us
a
trick
,
are
you
?
"
said
Mr.
Erle
,
with
something
like
dismay
in
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
trick
?
"
  
"
You
're
not
coming
out
on
the
other
side
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
I
know
it
,
"
said
Phineas
,
proudly
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
assure
you
I
would
n't
change
my
views
in
politics
either
for
you
or
for
the
Earl
,
though
each
of
you
carried
seats
in
your
breeches
pockets
.
<EOS>
If
I
go
into
Parliament
,
I
shall
go
there
as
a
sound
Liberal
,
 
not
to
support
a
party
,
but
to
do
the
best
I
can
for
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
so
,
and
I
shall
tell
the
Earl
the
same
.
"
  
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
turned
away
in
disgust
.
<EOS>
Such
language
was
to
him
simply
disgusting
.
<EOS>
It
fell
upon
his
ears
as
false
maudlin
sentiment
falls
on
the
ears
of
the
ordinary
honest
man
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
was
a
man
ordinarily
honest
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
been
untrue
to
his
mother
's
brother
,
William
Mildmay
,
the
great
Whig
Minister
of
the
day
,
for
any
earthly
consideration
.
<EOS>
He
was
ready
to
work
with
wages
or
without
wages
.
<EOS>
He
was
really
zealous
in
the
cause
,
not
asking
very
much
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
some
undefined
belief
that
it
was
much
better
for
the
country
that
Mr.
Mildmay
should
be
in
power
than
that
Lord
de
Terrier
should
be
there
.
<EOS>
He
was
convinced
that
Liberal
politics
were
good
for
Englishmen
,
and
that
Liberal
politics
and
the
Mildmay
party
were
one
and
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
unfair
to
Barrington
Erle
to
deny
to
him
some
praise
for
patriotism
.
<EOS>
But
he
hated
the
very
name
of
independence
in
Parliament
,
and
when
he
was
told
of
any
man
,
that
that
man
intended
to
look
to
measures
and
not
to
men
,
he
regarded
that
man
as
being
both
unstable
as
water
and
dishonest
as
the
wind
.
<EOS>
No
good
could
possibly
come
from
such
a
one
,
and
much
evil
might
and
probably
would
come
.
<EOS>
Such
a
politician
was
a
Greek
to
Barrington
Erle
,
from
whose
hands
he
feared
to
accept
even
the
gift
of
a
vote
.
<EOS>
Parliamentary
hermits
were
distasteful
to
him
,
and
dwellers
in
political
caves
were
regarded
by
him
with
aversion
as
being
either
knavish
or
impractical
.
<EOS>
With
a
good
Conservative
opponent
he
could
shake
hands
almost
as
readily
as
with
a
good
Whig
ally
;
but
the
man
who
was
neither
flesh
nor
fowl
was
odious
to
him
.
<EOS>
According
to
his
theory
of
parliamentary
government
,
the
House
of
Commons
should
be
divided
by
a
marked
line
,
and
every
member
should
be
required
to
stand
on
one
side
of
it
or
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
If
not
with
me
,
at
any
rate
be
against
me
,
"
he
would
have
said
to
every
representative
of
the
people
in
the
name
of
the
great
leader
whom
he
followed
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
debates
were
good
,
because
of
the
people
outside
,
 
because
they
served
to
create
that
public
opinion
which
was
hereafter
to
be
used
in
creating
some
future
House
of
Commons
;
but
he
did
not
think
it
possible
that
any
vote
should
be
given
on
a
great
question
,
either
this
way
or
that
,
as
the
result
of
a
debate
;
and
he
was
certainly
assured
in
his
own
opinion
that
any
such
changing
of
votes
would
be
dangerous
,
revolutionary
,
and
almost
unparliamentary
.
<EOS>
A
member
's
vote
,
 
except
on
some
small
crotchety
open
question
thrown
out
for
the
amusement
of
crotchety
members
,
 
was
due
to
the
leader
of
that
member
's
party
.
<EOS>
Such
was
Mr.
Erle
's
idea
of
the
English
system
of
Parliament
,
and
,
lending
semi
-
official
assistance
as
he
did
frequently
to
the
introduction
of
candidates
into
the
House
,
he
was
naturally
anxious
that
his
candidates
should
be
candidates
after
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
When
,
therefore
,
Phineas
Finn
talked
of
measures
and
not
men
,
Barrington
Erle
turned
away
in
open
disgust
.
<EOS>
But
he
remembered
the
youth
and
extreme
rawness
of
the
lad
,
and
he
remembered
also
the
careers
of
other
men
.
  
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
was
forty
,
and
experience
had
taught
him
something
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
seconds
,
he
brought
himself
to
think
mildly
of
the
young
man
's
vanity
,
 
as
of
the
vanity
of
a
plunging
colt
who
resents
the
liberty
even
of
a
touch
.
<EOS>
"
By
the
end
of
the
first
session
the
thong
will
be
cracked
over
his
head
,
as
he
patiently
assists
in
pulling
the
coach
up
hill
,
without
producing
from
him
even
a
flick
of
his
tail
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
to
an
old
parliamentary
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
were
to
come
out
after
all
on
the
wrong
side
,
"
said
the
parliamentary
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Erle
admitted
that
such
a
trick
as
that
would
be
unpleasant
,
but
he
thought
that
old
Lord
Tulla
was
hardly
equal
to
so
clever
a
stratagem
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
went
to
Ireland
,
and
walked
over
the
course
at
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
He
called
upon
Lord
Tulla
,
and
heard
that
venerable
nobleman
talk
a
great
deal
of
nonsense
.
<EOS>
To
tell
the
truth
of
Phineas
,
I
must
confess
that
he
wished
to
talk
the
nonsense
himself
;
but
the
Earl
would
not
hear
him
,
and
put
him
down
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
We
wo
n't
discuss
politics
,
if
you
please
,
Mr.
Finn
;
because
,
as
I
have
already
said
,
I
am
throwing
aside
all
political
considerations
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
therefore
,
was
not
allowed
to
express
his
views
on
the
government
of
the
country
in
the
Earl
's
sitting
-
room
at
Castlemorris
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
a
good
time
coming
;
and
so
,
for
the
present
,
he
allowed
the
Earl
to
ramble
on
about
the
sins
of
his
brother
George
,
and
the
want
of
all
proper
pedigree
on
the
part
of
the
new
Dean
of
Kilfenora
.
<EOS>
The
conference
ended
with
an
assurance
on
the
part
of
Lord
Tulla
that
if
the
Loughshaners
chose
to
elect
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
he
would
not
be
in
the
least
offended
.
<EOS>
The
electors
did
elect
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
,
 
perhaps
for
the
reason
given
by
one
of
the
Dublin
Conservative
papers
,
which
declared
that
it
was
all
the
fault
of
the
Carlton
Club
in
not
sending
a
proper
candidate
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
deal
said
about
the
matter
,
both
in
London
and
Dublin
,
and
the
blame
was
supposed
to
fall
on
the
joint
shoulders
of
George
Morris
and
his
elder
brother
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
our
hero
,
Phineas
Finn
,
had
been
duly
elected
member
of
Parliament
for
the
borough
of
Loughshane
.
  
<EOS>
The
Finn
family
could
not
restrain
their
triumphings
at
Killaloe
,
and
I
do
not
know
that
it
would
have
been
natural
had
they
done
so
.
<EOS>
A
gosling
from
such
a
flock
does
become
something
of
a
real
swan
by
getting
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
had
his
misgivings
,
 
had
great
misgivings
,
fearful
forebodings
;
but
there
was
the
young
man
elected
,
and
he
could
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
refuse
his
right
hand
to
his
son
or
withdraw
his
paternal
assistance
because
that
son
had
been
specially
honoured
among
the
young
men
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
So
he
pulled
out
of
his
hoard
what
sufficed
to
pay
off
outstanding
debts
,
 
<EOS>
they
were
not
heavy
,
 
and
undertook
to
allow
Phineas
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
as
long
as
the
session
should
last
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
widow
lady
living
at
Killaloe
who
was
named
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
,
and
she
had
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
son
also
,
born
to
inherit
the
property
of
the
late
Floscabel
Flood
Jones
of
Floodborough
,
as
soon
as
that
property
should
have
disembarrassed
itself
;
but
with
him
,
now
serving
with
his
regiment
in
India
,
we
shall
have
no
concern
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
was
living
modestly
at
Killaloe
on
her
widow
's
jointure
,
 
Floodborough
having
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
pretty
nearly
fallen
into
absolute
ruin
,
 
and
with
her
one
daughter
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
Now
on
the
evening
before
the
return
of
Phineas
Finn
,
Esq
.
,
M.P.
,
to
London
,
Mrs.
and
Miss
Flood
Jones
drank
tea
at
the
doctor
's
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
make
a
bit
of
change
in
him
,
"
Barbara
Finn
said
to
her
friend
Mary
,
up
in
some
bedroom
privacy
before
the
tea
-
drinking
ceremonies
had
altogether
commenced
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
must

"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
it
wo
n't

my
dear
;
he
is
so
good
and
so
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
is
good
,
Barbara
;
and
as
for
truth
,
there
is
no
question
about
it
,
because
he
has
never
said
a
word
to
me
that
he
might
not
say
to
any
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
,
Mary
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
has
,
then
,
as
sure
as
the
blessed
Virgin
watches
over
us

only
you
do
n't
believe
she

Never

about

Virgin

never

nothing

I
hope
he
will
be

walking
with

all
yesterday

the
day

"
Why
should
n't
he
,
 
and
we
that
have
known
each
other
all
our

But
,
Barbara

pray
,
pray
never

this

<EOS>

Is
it
I

Would
n't
I
cut
out
my
tongue
first

<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
I
let
you
talk
to
me
in
this
way

There
has
never
been
anything
between

Phineas

your
brother

mean

<EOS>

I
know

well

<EOS>
"
And
I
feel
quite
sure
that
there
never
will
be

<EOS>
Why
should
there
?
<EOS>
He
'll
go
out
among
great
people
and
be
a
great
man
;
and
I
've
already
found
out
that
there
's
a
certain
Lady
Laura
Standish
whom
he
admires
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Laura
Fiddlestick

<EOS>
"
A
man
in
Parliament
,
you
know
,
may
look
up
to
anybody
,
"
said
Miss
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
Phin
to
look
up
to
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
n't
be
looking
up
.
<EOS>
Placed
as
he
is
now
,
that
would
be
looking
down
;
and
he
is
so
proud
that
he
'll
never
do
that
.
<EOS>
But
come
down
,
dear
,
else
they
'll
wonder
where
we
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
Flood
Jones
was
a
little
girl
about
twenty
years
of
age
,
with
the
softest
hair
in
the
world
,
of
a
colour
varying
between
brown
and
auburn
,
 
for
sometimes
you
would
swear
it
was
the
one
and
sometimes
the
other
;
and
she
was
as
pretty
as
ever
<EOS>
she
could
be
.
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
those
girls
,
so
common
in
Ireland
,
whom
men
,
with
tastes
that
way
given
,
feel
inclined
to
take
up
and
devour
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
;
and
when
she
liked
her
lion
,
she
had
a
look
about
her
which
seemed
to
ask
to
be
devoured
.
<EOS>
There
are
girls
so
cold
-
looking
,
 
<EOS>
pretty
girls
,
too
,
ladylike
,
discreet
,
and
armed
with
all
accomplishments
,
 
whom
to
attack
seems
to
require
the
same
sort
of
courage
,
and
the
same
sort
of
preparation
,
as
a
journey
in
quest
of
the
north
-
west
passage
.
<EOS>
One
thinks
of
a
pedestal
near
the
Athenaeum
as
the
most
appropriate
and
most
honourable
reward
of
such
courage
.
<EOS>
But
,
again
,
there
are
other
girls
to
abstain
from
attacking
whom
is
,
to
a
man
of
any
warmth
of
temperament
,
quite
impossible
.
<EOS>
They
are
like
water
when
one
is
athirst
,
like
plovers
'
eggs
in
March
,
like
cigars
when
one
is
out
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
No
one
ever
dreams
of
denying
himself
when
such
temptation
comes
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
It
often
happens
,
however
,
that
in
spite
of
appearances
,
the
water
will
not
come
from
the
well
,
nor
the
egg
from
its
shell
,
nor
will
the
cigar
allow
itself
to
be
lit
.
<EOS>
A
girl
of
such
appearance
,
so
charming
,
was
Mary
Flood
Jones
of
Killaloe
,
and
our
hero
Phineas
was
not
allowed
to
thirst
in
vain
for
a
drop
from
the
cool
spring
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
girls
went
down
into
the
drawing
-
room
Mary
was
careful
to
go
to
a
part
of
the
room
quite
remote
from
Phineas
,
so
as
to
seat
herself
between
Mrs.
Finn
and
Dr.
Finn
's
young
partner
,
Mr.
Elias
Bodkin
,
from
Ballinasloe
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Finn
and
the
Miss
Finns
and
all
Killaloe
knew
that
Mary
had
no
love
for
Mr.
Bodkin
,
and
when
Mr.
Bodkin
handed
her
the
hot
cake
<EOS>
she
hardly
so
much
as
smiled
at
him
.
<EOS>
But
in
two
minutes
Phineas
was
behind
her
chair
,
and
then
she
smiled
;
and
<EOS>
in
five
minutes
more
she
had
got
herself
so
twisted
round
that
she
was
sitting
in
a
corner
with
Phineas
and
his
sister
Barbara
;
and
in
two
more
minutes
Barbara
had
returned
to
Mr.
Elias
Bodkin
,
so
that
Phineas
and
Mary
were
uninterrupted
.
<EOS>
They
manage
these
things
very
quickly
and
very
cleverly
in
Killaloe
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
off
to
-
morrow
morning
by
the
early
train
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
soon
;
 
and
when
will
you
have
to
begin
,
 
in
Parliament
,
I
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
take
my
seat
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
back
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
shall
we
hear
of
your
saying
something
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Never
,
probably
.
<EOS>
Not
one
in
ten
who
go
into
Parliament
ever
do
say
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
;
wo
n't
you
?
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
.
<EOS>
I
do
<EOS>
so
hope
you
will
distinguish
yourself
;
 
because
of
your
sister
,
and
for
the
sake
of
the
town
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
that
all
,
Mary
?
"
  
"
Is
n't
that
enough
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
care
a
bit
about
myself
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
Have
n't
we
been
friends
ever
since
we
were
children
?
<EOS>
Of
course
it
will
be
a
great
pride
to
me
that
a
person
whom
I
have
known
so
intimately
should
come
to
be
talked
about
as
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
talked
about
as
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
great
man
to
me
already
,
being
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Only
think
;
 
I
never
saw
a
member
of
Parliament
in
my
life
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
seen
the
bishop
scores
of
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
in
Parliament
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
not
like
you
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
come
to
be
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
and
one
never
reads
anything
about
him
in
the
newspapers
.
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
to
see
your
name
,
very
often
,
and
I
shall
always
look
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
paired
off
with
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
meaning
of
pairing
off
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
explain
it
all
to
you
when
I
come
back
,
after
learning
my
lesson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
you
do
come
back
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
suppose
you
ever
will
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
going
somewhere
to
see
Lady
Laura
Standish
when
you
are
not
wanted
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Laura
Standish
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
should
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Of
course
,
with
your
prospects
,
you
should
go
as
much
as
possible
among
people
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
Is
Lady
Laura
very
pretty
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
about
six
feet
high
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
look
as
though
she
were
,
standing
by
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
so
insignificant
and
small
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
your
figure
is
perfect
,
and
because
she
is
straggling
.
<EOS>
She
is
as
unlike
you
as
possible
in
everything
.
<EOS>
She
has
thick
lumpy
red
hair
,
while
yours
is
all
silk
and
softness
.
<EOS>
She
has
large
hands
and
feet
,
and
 
"
  
"
Why
,
Phineas
,
you
are
making
her
out
to
be
an
ogress
,
and
yet
I
know
that
you
admire
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
do
,
because
she
possesses
such
an
appearance
of
power
.
<EOS>
And
after
all
,
in
spite
of
the
lumpy
hair
,
and
in
spite
of
large
hands
and
straggling
figure
,
she
is
handsome
.
<EOS>
One
ca
n't
tell
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
One
can
see
that
she
is
quite
contented
with
herself
,
and
intends
to
make
others
contented
with
her
.
<EOS>
And
so
she
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
are
in
love
with
her
,
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
in
love
,
 
not
with
her
at
least
.
<EOS>
Of
all
men
in
the
world
,
I
suppose
that
I
am
the
last
that
has
a
right
to
be
in
love
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
I
shall
marry
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
hope
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
not
till
I
'm
forty
or
perhaps
fifty
years
old
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
not
fool
enough
to
have
what
men
call
a
high
ambition
<EOS>
I
might
venture
to
be
in
love
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
'm
very
glad
that
you
've
got
a
high
ambition
.
<EOS>
It
is
what
every
man
ought
to
have
;
and
I
've
no
doubt
that
we
shall
hear
of
your
marriage
soon
,
 
very
soon
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
 
if
she
can
help
you
in
your
ambition
,
we
 
shall
 
all
 
be
so
 
glad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
say
a
word
further
then
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
some
commotion
among
the
party
broke
up
the
little
private
conversation
in
the
corner
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
not
alone
with
Mary
again
till
there
came
a
moment
for
him
to
put
her
cloak
over
her
shoulders
in
the
back
parlour
,
while
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
was
finishing
some
important
narrative
to
his
mother
.
<EOS>
It
was
Barbara
,
I
think
,
who
stood
in
some
doorway
,
and
prevented
people
from
passing
,
and
so
gave
him
the
opportunity
which
he
abused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
said
he
,
taking
her
in
his
arms
,
without
a
single
word
of
love
-
making
beyond
what
the
reader
has
heard
,
 
"
one
kiss
before
we
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Phineas
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
But
the
kiss
had
been
taken
and
given
before
she
had
even
answered
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Phineas
,
you
should
n't
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
.
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
I
?
<EOS>
And
,
Mary
,
I
will
have
one
morsel
of
your
hair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
;
indeed
you
shall
not
!
"
<EOS>
But
the
scissors
were
at
hand
,
and
the
ringlet
was
cut
and
in
his
pocket
before
she
was
ready
with
her
resistance
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
further
;
 
not
a
word
more
,
and
Mary
went
away
with
her
veil
down
,
under
her
mother
's
wing
,
weeping
sweet
silent
tears
which
no
one
saw
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
love
her
;
do
n't
you
,
Phineas
?
"
asked
Barbara
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bother
!
<EOS>
Do
you
go
to
bed
,
and
do
n't
trouble
yourself
about
such
trifles
.
<EOS>
But
mind
you
're
up
,
old
girl
,
to
see
me
off
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Everybody
was
up
to
see
him
off
in
the
morning
,
to
give
him
coffee
and
good
advice
,
and
kisses
,
and
to
throw
all
manner
of
old
shoes
after
him
as
he
started
on
his
great
expedition
to
Parliament
.
<EOS>
His
father
gave
him
an
extra
twenty
-
pound
note
,
and
begged
him
for
God
's
sake
to
be
careful
about
his
money
.
<EOS>
His
mother
told
him
always
to
have
an
orange
in
his
pocket
when
he
intended
to
speak
longer
than
usual
.
<EOS>
And
Barbara
in
a
last
whisper
begged
him
never
to
forget
dear
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
   
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
Takes
His
Seat
 
<EOS>
Phineas
had
many
serious
,
almost
solemn
thoughts
on
his
journey
towards
London
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
must
assure
my
female
readers
that
very
few
of
them
had
reference
to
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
very
carefully
packed
up
the
tress
,
and
could
bring
that
out
for
proper
acts
of
erotic
worship
at
seasons
in
which
his
mind
might
be
less
engaged
with
affairs
of
state
than
it
was
at
present
.
<EOS>
Would
he
make
a
failure
of
this
great
matter
which
he
had
taken
in
hand
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
tell
himself
that
the
chances
were
twenty
to
one
against
him
.
<EOS>
Now
that
he
looked
nearer
at
it
all
,
the
difficulties
loomed
larger
than
ever
,
and
the
rewards
seemed
to
be
less
,
more
difficult
of
approach
,
and
more
evanescent
.
<EOS>
How
many
members
were
there
who
could
never
get
a
hearing
!
<EOS>
How
many
who
only
spoke
to
fail
!
<EOS>
How
many
,
who
spoke
well
,
who
could
speak
to
no
effect
as
far
as
their
own
worldly
prospects
were
concerned
!
<EOS>
He
had
already
known
many
members
of
Parliament
to
whom
no
outward
respect
or
sign
of
honour
was
ever
given
by
any
one
;
and
it
seemed
to
him
,
as
he
thought
over
it
,
that
Irish
members
of
Parliament
were
generally
treated
with
more
indifference
than
any
others
.
<EOS>
There
were
O'B---
and
O'C---
and
O'D
 
,
for
whom
no
one
cared
a
straw
,
who
could
hardly
get
men
to
dine
with
them
at
the
club
,
and
yet
they
were
genuine
members
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
ever
be
better
than
O'B
 
,
or
O'C
 
,
or
O'D
 
?
<EOS>
And
in
what
way
should
he
begin
to
be
better
?
<EOS>
He
had
an
idea
of
the
fashion
after
which
it
would
be
his
duty
to
strive
that
he
might
excel
those
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
give
any
of
them
credit
for
much
earnestness
in
their
country
's
behalf
,
and
he
was
minded
to
be
very
earnest
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
to
his
work
honestly
and
conscientiously
,
determined
to
do
his
duty
as
best
he
might
,
let
the
results
to
himself
be
what
they
would
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
noble
resolution
,
and
might
have
been
pleasant
to
him
,
 
had
he
not
remembered
that
smile
of
derision
which
had
come
over
his
friend
Erle
's
face
when
he
declared
his
intention
of
doing
his
duty
to
his
country
as
a
Liberal
,
and
not
of
supporting
a
party
.
<EOS>
O'B---
and
O'C---
and
O'D---
were
keen
enough
to
support
their
party
,
only
they
were
sometimes
a
little
astray
at
knowing
which
was
their
party
for
the
nonce
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
Erle
and
such
men
would
despise
him
if
he
did
not
fall
into
the
regular
groove
,
 
and
if
the
Barrington
Erles
despised
him
,
what
would
then
be
left
for
him
?
  
<EOS>
His
moody
thoughts
were
somewhat
dissipated
when
he
found
one
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
 
the
Honourable
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
 
a
special
friend
of
his
own
,
and
a
very
clever
fellow
,
on
board
the
boat
as
it
steamed
out
of
Kingston
harbour
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
also
just
been
over
about
his
election
,
and
had
been
returned
as
a
matter
of
course
for
his
father
's
county
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
sat
in
the
House
for
the
last
fifteen
years
,
and
was
yet
well
-
nigh
as
young
a
man
as
any
in
it
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
a
man
altogether
different
from
the
O'B
 
s
,
O'C
 
s
,
and
O'D
 
s.
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
could
always
get
the
ear
of
the
House
if
he
chose
to
speak
,
and
his
friends
declared
that
he
might
have
been
high
up
in
office
long
since
if
he
would
have
taken
the
trouble
to
work
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
welcome
guest
at
the
houses
of
the
very
best
people
,
and
was
a
friend
of
whom
any
one
might
be
proud
.
<EOS>
It
had
for
two
years
been
a
feather
in
the
cap
of
Phineas
that
he
knew
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
And
yet
people
said
that
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
nothing
of
his
own
,
and
men
wondered
how
he
lived
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
youngest
son
of
Lord
Claddagh
,
an
Irish
peer
with
a
large
family
,
who
could
do
nothing
for
Laurence
,
his
favourite
child
,
beyond
finding
him
a
seat
in
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Finn
,
my
boy
,
"
said
Laurence
,
shaking
hands
with
the
young
member
on
board
the
steamer
,
"
<EOS>
so
you
've
made
it
all
right
at
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
"
Then
Phineas
was
beginning
to
tell
all
the
story
,
the
wonderful
story
,
of
George
Morris
and
the
Earl
of
Tulla
,
 
how
the
men
of
Loughshane
had
elected
him
without
opposition
;
how
he
had
been
supported
by
Conservatives
as
well
as
Liberals
;
 
how
unanimous
Loughshane
had
been
in
electing
him
,
Phineas
Finn
,
as
its
representative
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
seemed
to
care
very
little
about
all
this
,
and
went
so
far
as
to
declare
that
those
things
were
accidents
which
fell
out
sometimes
one
way
and
sometimes
another
,
and
were
altogether
independent
of
any
merit
or
demerit
on
the
part
of
the
candidate
himself
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
marvellous
and
almost
painful
to
Phineas
that
his
friend
Fitzgibbon
should
accept
the
fact
of
his
membership
with
so
little
of
congratulation
,
 
with
absolutely
no
blowing
of
trumpets
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
elected
a
member
of
the
municipal
corporation
of
Loughshane
,
instead
of
its
representative
in
the
British
Parliament
,
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
could
not
have
made
less
fuss
about
it
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
disappointed
,
but
he
took
the
cue
from
his
friend
too
quickly
to
show
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
And
when
,
half
an
hour
after
their
meeting
,
Fitzgibbon
had
to
be
reminded
that
his
companion
was
not
in
the
House
during
the
last
session
,
Phineas
was
able
to
make
the
remark
as
though
he
thought
as
little
about
the
House
as
did
the
old
-
accustomed
member
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
can
see
as
yet
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
,
"
we
are
sure
to
have
seventeen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Seventeen
?
"
said
Phineas
,
not
quite
understanding
the
meaning
of
the
number
quoted
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
majority
of
seventeen
.
<EOS>
There
are
four
Irish
counties
and
three
Scotch
which
have
n't
returned
as
yet
;
but
we
know
pretty
well
what
they
'll
do
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
doubt
about
Tipperary
,
of
course
,
but
whichever
gets
in
of
the
seven
who
are
standing
,
it
will
be
a
vote
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
Now
the
Government
ca
n't
live
against
that
.
<EOS>
The
uphill
strain
is
too
much
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
According
to
my
idea
,
nothing
can
justify
them
in
trying
to
live
against
a
majority
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
gammon
.
<EOS>
When
the
thing
is
so
equal
,
anything
is
fair
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
they
do
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
there
are
some
among
them
as
hungry
as
we
are
;
and
Dubby
would
give
his
toes
and
fingers
to
remain
in
.
<EOS>
"
Dubby
was
the
ordinary
name
by
which
,
among
friends
and
foes
,
Mr.
Daubeny
was
known
:
Mr.
Daubeny
,
who
at
that
time
was
the
leader
of
the
Conservative
party
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
"
<EOS>
But
most
of
them
,
"
continued
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
"
prefer
the
other
game
,
and
if
you
do
n't
care
about
money
,
upon
my
word
<EOS>
it
's
the
pleasanter
game
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
country
gets
nothing
done
by
a
Tory
Government
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
that
,
it
's
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
I
never
knew
a
government
yet
that
wanted
to
do
anything
.
<EOS>
Give
a
government
a
real
strong
majority
,
as
the
Tories
used
to
have
half
a
century
since
,
and
as
a
matter
of
course
it
will
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
Why
should
it
?
<EOS>
Doing
things
,
as
you
call
it
,
is
only
bidding
for
power
,
 
for
patronage
and
pay
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
is
the
country
to
have
no
service
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
country
gets
quite
as
much
service
as
it
pays
for
,
 
and
perhaps
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
The
clerks
in
the
offices
work
for
the
country
.
<EOS>
And
the
Ministers
work
too
,
if
they
've
got
anything
to
manage
.
<EOS>
There
is
plenty
of
work
done
;
 
but
of
work
in
Parliament
,
the
less
the
better
,
according
to
my
ideas
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
little
that
ever
is
done
,
and
that
little
is
generally
too
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
people
 
"
  
"
Come
down
and
have
a
glass
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
leave
the
people
alone
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
The
people
can
take
care
of
themselves
a
great
deal
better
than
we
can
take
care
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
's
doctrine
as
to
the
commonwealth
was
very
different
from
that
of
Barrington
Erle
,
and
was
still
less
to
the
taste
of
the
new
member
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
considered
that
his
leader
,
Mr.
Mildmay
,
should
be
intrusted
to
make
all
necessary
changes
in
the
laws
,
and
that
an
obedient
House
of
Commons
should
implicitly
obey
that
leader
in
authorising
all
changes
proposed
by
him
;
 
but
according
to
Barrington
Erle
,
such
changes
should
be
numerous
and
of
great
importance
,
and
would
,
if
duly
passed
into
law
at
his
lord
's
behest
,
gradually
produce
such
a
Whig
Utopia
in
England
as
has
never
yet
been
seen
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Now
,
according
to
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
the
present
Utopia
would
be
good
enough
,
 
if
only
he
himself
might
be
once
more
put
into
possession
of
a
certain
semi
-
political
place
about
the
Court
,
from
which
he
had
heretofore
drawn
£
1,000
per
annum
,
without
any
work
,
much
to
his
comfort
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
secret
of
his
ambition
,
and
was
chagrined
simply
at
the
prospect
of
having
to
return
to
his
electors
before
he
could
enjoy
those
good
things
which
he
expected
to
receive
from
the
undoubted
majority
of
seventeen
,
which
had
been
,
or
would
be
,
achieved
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
all
change
as
a
rule
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
;
"
but
,
upon
my
word
,
we
ought
to
alter
that
.
<EOS>
When
a
fellow
has
got
a
crumb
of
comfort
,
after
waiting
for
it
years
and
years
,
and
perhaps
spending
thousands
in
elections
,
he
has
to
go
back
and
try
his
hand
again
at
the
last
moment
,
merely
in
obedience
to
some
antiquated
prejudice
.
<EOS>
Look
at
poor
Jack
Bond
,
 
the
best
friend
I
ever
had
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
was
wrecked
upon
that
rock
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
spent
every
shilling
he
had
in
contesting
Romford
three
times
running
,
 
and
three
times
running
<EOS>
he
got
in
.
<EOS>
Then
they
made
him
Vice
-
Comptroller
of
the
Granaries
,
and
I
'm
shot
if
he
did
n't
get
spilt
at
Romford
on
standing
for
his
re
-
election
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
became
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
knows
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
heard
that
he
married
an
old
woman
and
settled
down
somewhere
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
never
came
up
again
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
call
that
a
confounded
shame
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
'm
safe
down
in
Mayo
,
but
there
's
no
knowing
what
may
happen
in
these
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
they
parted
at
Euston
Square
,
Phineas
asked
his
friend
some
little
nervous
question
as
to
the
best
mode
of
making
a
first
entrance
into
the
House
.
<EOS>
Would
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
see
him
through
the
difficulties
of
the
oath
-
taking
?
<EOS>
But
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
made
very
little
of
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
;
 
you
just
come
down
,
and
there
'll
be
a
rush
of
fellows
,
and
you
'll
know
everybody
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
hang
about
for
an
hour
or
so
,
and
then
you
'll
get
pushed
through
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
time
for
much
ceremony
after
a
general
election
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
reached
London
early
in
the
morning
,
and
went
home
to
bed
for
an
hour
or
so
.
<EOS>
The
House
was
to
meet
on
that
very
day
,
and
he
intended
to
begin
his
parliamentary
duties
at
once
if
he
should
find
it
possible
to
get
some
one
to
accompany
him
;
He
felt
that
he
should
lack
courage
to
go
down
to
Westminster
Hall
alone
,
and
explain
to
the
policeman
and
door
-
keepers
that
he
was
the
man
who
had
just
been
elected
member
for
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
So
about
noon
he
went
into
the
Reform
Club
,
and
there
he
found
a
great
crowd
of
men
,
among
whom
there
was
a
plentiful
sprinkling
of
members
.
<EOS>
Erle
saw
him
in
a
moment
,
and
came
to
him
with
congratulations
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
're
all
right
,
Finn
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
'm
all
right
,
 
I
did
n't
have
much
doubt
about
it
when
I
went
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
of
a
fellow
with
such
a
run
of
luck
,
"
said
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
one
of
those
flukes
that
occur
once
in
a
dozen
elections
.
<EOS>
Any
one
on
earth
might
have
got
in
without
spending
a
shilling
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
did
n't
at
all
like
this
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
any
one
could
have
got
in
,
"
said
he
,
"
without
knowing
Lord
Tulla
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lord
Tulla
was
nowhere
,
my
dear
boy
,
and
could
have
nothing
to
say
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
never
mind
that
.
<EOS>
You
meet
me
in
the
lobby
at
two
.
<EOS>
There
'll
be
a
lot
of
us
there
,
and
we
'll
go
in
together
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
Fitzgibbon
?
"
<EOS>
Then
Barrington
Erle
went
off
to
other
business
,
and
Finn
was
congratulated
by
other
men
.
<EOS>
But
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
congratulations
of
his
friends
were
not
hearty
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
some
men
,
of
whom
he
thought
that
he
knew
they
would
have
given
their
eyes
to
be
in
Parliament
;
 
and
yet
they
spoke
of
his
success
as
being
a
very
ordinary
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
boy
,
I
hope
you
like
it
,
"
said
one
middle
-
aged
gentleman
whom
he
had
known
ever
since
he
came
up
to
London
.
<EOS>
"
The
difference
is
between
working
for
nothing
and
working
for
money
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
work
for
nothing
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
about
it
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
the
House
is
a
comfortable
club
,
"
said
the
middle
-
aged
friend
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
confess
that
I
should
n't
like
being
rung
away
from
my
dinner
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
two
punctually
Phineas
was
in
the
lobby
at
Westminster
,
and
then
he
found
himself
taken
into
the
House
with
a
crowd
of
other
men
.
<EOS>
The
old
and
young
,
and
they
who
were
neither
old
nor
young
,
were
mingled
together
,
and
there
seemed
to
be
very
little
respect
of
persons
.
<EOS>
On
three
or
four
occasions
there
was
some
cheering
when
a
popular
man
or
a
great
leader
came
in
;
but
the
work
of
the
day
left
but
little
clear
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
young
member
.
<EOS>
He
was
confused
,
half
elated
,
half
disappointed
,
and
had
not
his
wits
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
found
himself
constantly
regretting
that
he
was
there
;
and
as
constantly
telling
himself
that
he
,
hardly
yet
twenty
-
five
,
without
a
shilling
of
his
own
,
had
achieved
an
entrance
into
that
assembly
which
by
the
consent
of
all
men
is
the
greatest
in
the
world
,
and
which
many
of
the
rich
magnates
of
the
country
had
in
vain
spent
heaps
of
treasure
in
their
endeavours
to
open
to
their
own
footsteps
.
<EOS>
He
tried
hard
to
realise
what
he
had
gained
,
but
the
dust
and
the
noise
and
the
crowds
and
the
want
of
something
august
to
the
eye
were
almost
too
strong
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
managed
,
however
,
to
take
the
oath
early
among
those
who
took
it
,
and
heard
the
Queen
's
speech
read
and
the
Address
moved
and
seconded
.
<EOS>
He
was
seated
very
uncomfortably
,
high
up
on
a
back
seat
,
between
two
men
whom
he
did
not
know
;
and
he
found
the
speeches
to
be
very
long
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
in
the
habit
of
seeing
such
speeches
reported
in
about
a
column
,
and
he
thought
that
these
speeches
must
take
at
least
four
columns
each
.
<EOS>
He
sat
out
the
debate
on
the
Address
till
the
House
was
adjourned
,
and
then
he
went
away
to
dine
at
his
club
.
<EOS>
He
did
go
into
the
dining
-
room
of
the
House
,
but
there
was
a
crowd
there
,
and
he
found
himself
alone
,
 
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
was
afraid
to
order
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
The
nearest
approach
to
a
triumph
which
he
had
in
London
came
to
him
from
the
glory
which
his
election
reflected
upon
his
landlady
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
kindly
good
motherly
soul
,
whose
husband
was
a
journeyman
law
-
stationer
,
and
who
kept
a
very
decent
house
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
.
<EOS>
Here
Phineas
had
lodged
since
he
had
been
in
London
,
and
was
a
great
favourite
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
my
soul
,
Mr.
Phineas
,
"
said
she
,
"
only
think
of
your
being
a
member
of
Parliament
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
'm
a
member
of
Parliament
,
Mrs.
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
'll
go
on
with
the
rooms
the
same
as
ever
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
never
thought
to
have
a
member
of
Parliament
in
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
really
had
realised
the
magnitude
of
the
step
which
her
lodger
had
taken
,
and
Phineas
was
grateful
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Standish
 
Phineas
,
in
describing
Lady
Laura
Standish
to
Mary
Flood
Jones
at
Killaloe
,
had
not
painted
her
in
very
glowing
colours
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
admired
Lady
Laura
very
much
,
and
she
was
worthy
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
It
was
probably
the
greatest
pride
of
our
hero
's
life
that
Lady
Laura
Standish
was
his
friend
,
and
that
she
had
instigated
him
to
undertake
the
risk
of
parliamentary
life
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
was
intimate
also
with
Barrington
Erle
,
who
was
,
in
some
distant
degree
,
her
cousin
;
and
Phineas
was
not
without
a
suspicion
that
his
selection
for
Loughshane
,
from
out
of
all
the
young
liberal
candidates
,
may
have
been
in
some
degree
owing
to
Lady
Laura
's
influence
with
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
unwilling
that
it
should
be
so
;
for
though
,
as
he
had
repeatedly
told
himself
,
he
was
by
no
means
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
 
who
was
,
as
he
imagined
,
somewhat
older
than
himself
,
 
nevertheless
,
he
would
feel
gratified
at
accepting
anything
from
her
hands
,
and
he
felt
a
keen
desire
for
some
increase
to
those
ties
of
friendship
which
bound
them
together
.
<EOS>
No
;
 
he
was
not
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
the
remotest
idea
of
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
So
he
told
himself
,
both
before
he
went
over
for
his
election
,
and
after
his
return
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
found
himself
in
a
corner
with
poor
little
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
he
had
kissed
her
as
a
matter
of
course
;
but
he
did
not
think
that
he
could
,
in
any
circumstances
,
be
tempted
to
kiss
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
supposed
that
he
was
in
love
with
his
darling
little
Mary
,
 
after
a
fashion
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
it
could
never
come
to
anything
,
because
of
the
circumstances
of
his
life
,
which
were
so
imperious
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
and
yet
he
hoped
that
his
intimacy
with
her
might
come
to
much
.
<EOS>
He
had
more
than
once
asked
himself
how
he
would
feel
when
somebody
else
came
to
be
really
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
 
for
she
was
by
no
means
a
woman
to
lack
lovers
,
 
when
some
one
else
should
be
in
love
with
her
,
and
be
received
by
her
as
a
lover
;
but
this
question
he
had
never
been
able
to
answer
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
questions
about
himself
which
he
usually
answered
by
telling
himself
that
it
was
his
fate
to
walk
over
volcanoes
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
I
shall
be
blown
into
atoms
some
fine
day
,
"
he
would
say
;
"
but
after
all
,
that
is
better
than
being
slowly
boiled
down
into
pulp
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
House
had
met
on
a
Friday
,
again
on
the
Saturday
morning
,
and
the
debate
on
the
Address
had
been
adjourned
till
the
Monday
.
<EOS>
On
the
Sunday
,
Phineas
determined
that
he
would
see
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
She
professed
to
be
always
at
home
on
Sunday
,
and
from
three
to
four
in
the
afternoon
her
drawing
-
room
would
probably
be
half
full
of
people
.
<EOS>
There
would
,
at
any
rate
,
be
comers
and
goers
,
who
would
prevent
anything
like
real
conversation
between
himself
and
her
.
<EOS>
But
for
a
few
minutes
before
that
he
might
probably
find
her
alone
,
and
he
was
most
anxious
to
see
whether
her
reception
of
him
,
as
a
member
of
Parliament
,
would
be
in
any
degree
warmer
than
that
of
his
other
friends
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
had
found
no
such
warmth
since
he
came
to
London
,
excepting
that
which
had
glowed
in
the
bosom
of
Mrs.
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Standish
was
the
daughter
of
the
Earl
of
Brentford
,
and
was
the
only
remaining
lady
of
the
Earl
's
family
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
had
been
long
dead
;
and
Lady
Emily
,
the
younger
daughter
,
who
had
been
the
great
beauty
of
her
day
,
was
now
the
wife
of
a
Russian
nobleman
whom
she
had
persisted
in
preferring
to
any
of
her
English
suitors
,
and
lived
at
St.
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
aunt
,
old
Lady
Laura
,
who
came
up
to
town
about
the
middle
of
May
;
but
she
was
always
in
the
country
except
for
some
six
weeks
in
the
season
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
Lord
Chiltern
,
the
Earl
's
son
and
heir
,
who
did
indeed
live
at
the
family
town
house
in
Portman
Square
;
but
Lord
Chiltern
was
a
man
of
whom
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
's
set
did
not
often
speak
,
and
Phineas
,
frequently
as
he
had
been
at
the
house
,
had
never
seen
Lord
Chiltern
there
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
nobleman
of
whom
various
accounts
were
given
by
various
people
;
but
I
fear
that
the
account
most
readily
accepted
in
London
attributed
to
him
a
great
intimacy
with
the
affairs
at
Newmarket
,
and
a
partiality
for
convivial
pleasures
.
<EOS>
Respecting
Lord
Chiltern
Phineas
had
never
as
yet
exchanged
a
word
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
With
her
father
he
was
acquainted
,
as
he
had
dined
perhaps
half
a
dozen
times
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
point
in
Lord
Brentford
's
character
which
had
more
than
any
other
struck
our
hero
,
was
the
unlimited
confidence
which
he
seemed
to
place
in
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
seemed
to
have
perfect
power
of
doing
what
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
She
was
much
more
mistress
of
herself
than
if
she
had
been
the
wife
instead
of
the
daughter
of
the
Earl
of
Brentford
,
 
and
she
seemed
to
be
quite
as
much
mistress
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
declared
at
Killaloe
that
Lady
Laura
was
six
feet
high
,
that
she
had
red
hair
,
that
her
figure
was
straggling
,
and
that
her
hands
and
feet
were
large
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
fact
about
five
feet
seven
in
height
,
and
she
carried
her
height
well
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
of
nobility
in
her
gait
,
and
she
seemed
thus
to
be
taller
than
her
inches
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
in
truth
red
,
 
of
a
deep
thorough
redness
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
's
hair
was
the
same
;
and
so
had
been
that
of
her
father
,
before
it
had
become
sandy
with
age
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
's
had
been
of
a
soft
auburn
hue
,
and
hers
had
been
said
to
be
the
prettiest
head
of
hair
in
Europe
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
in
these
days
we
have
got
to
like
red
hair
,
and
Lady
Laura
's
was
not
supposed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
her
being
considered
a
beauty
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
very
fair
,
though
it
lacked
that
softness
which
we
all
love
in
women
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
,
which
were
large
and
bright
,
and
very
clear
,
never
seemed
to
quail
,
never
rose
and
sunk
or
showed
themselves
to
be
afraid
of
their
own
power
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Lady
Laura
Standish
had
nothing
of
fear
about
her
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
was
perfectly
cut
,
but
was
rather
large
,
having
the
slightest
possible
tendency
to
be
aquiline
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
also
was
large
,
but
was
full
of
expression
,
and
her
teeth
were
perfect
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
was
very
bright
,
but
in
spite
of
its
brightness
she
never
blushed
.
<EOS>
The
shades
of
her
complexion
were
set
and
steady
.
<EOS>
Those
who
knew
her
said
that
her
heart
was
so
fully
under
command
that
nothing
could
stir
her
blood
to
any
sudden
motion
.
<EOS>
As
to
that
accusation
of
straggling
which
had
been
made
against
her
,
it
had
sprung
from
ill
-
natured
observation
of
her
modes
of
sitting
.
<EOS>
She
never
straggled
when
she
stood
or
walked
;
but
she
would
lean
forward
when
sitting
,
as
a
man
does
,
and
would
use
her
arms
in
talking
,
and
would
put
her
hand
over
her
face
,
and
pass
her
fingers
through
her
hair
,
 
after
the
fashion
of
men
rather
than
of
women
;
 
and
she
seemed
to
despise
that
soft
quiescence
of
her
sex
in
which
are
generally
found
so
many
charms
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
and
feet
were
large
,
 
as
was
her
whole
frame
.
<EOS>
Such
was
Lady
Laura
Standish
;
and
Phineas
Finn
had
been
untrue
to
himself
and
to
his
own
appreciation
of
the
lady
when
he
had
described
her
in
disparaging
terms
to
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
he
had
spoken
of
Lady
Laura
in
disparaging
terms
,
he
had
so
spoken
of
her
as
to
make
Miss
Flood
Jones
quite
understand
that
he
thought
a
great
deal
about
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
early
on
the
Sunday
,
he
made
his
way
to
Portman
Square
in
order
that
he
might
learn
whether
there
might
be
any
sympathy
for
him
there
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
had
found
none
.
<EOS>
Everything
had
been
terribly
dry
and
hard
,
and
he
had
gathered
as
yet
none
of
the
fruit
which
he
had
expected
that
his
good
fortune
would
bear
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
he
had
not
as
yet
gone
among
any
friends
,
except
those
of
his
club
,
and
men
who
were
in
the
House
along
with
him
;
 
and
at
the
club
it
might
be
that
there
were
some
who
envied
him
his
good
fortune
,
and
others
who
thought
nothing
of
it
because
it
had
been
theirs
for
years
.
<EOS>
Now
he
would
try
a
friend
who
,
he
hoped
,
could
sympathise
;
and
therefore
he
called
in
Portman
Square
at
about
half
-
past
two
on
the
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
 
Lady
Laura
was
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
hall
-
porter
admitted
as
much
,
but
evidently
seemed
to
think
that
he
had
been
disturbed
from
his
dinner
before
his
time
.
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
care
a
straw
for
the
hall
-
porter
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Laura
were
not
kind
to
him
,
he
would
never
trouble
that
hall
-
porter
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
especially
sore
at
this
moment
because
a
valued
friend
,
the
barrister
with
whom
he
had
been
reading
for
the
last
three
years
,
had
spent
the
best
part
of
an
hour
that
Sunday
morning
in
proving
to
him
that
he
had
as
good
as
ruined
himself
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
first
heard
it
,
of
course
I
thought
you
had
inherited
a
fortune
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
inherited
nothing
,
"
Phineas
replied
;
 
"
not
a
penny
;
and
I
never
shall
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Low
had
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
,
and
shaken
his
head
very
sadly
,
and
had
whistled
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
you
have
come
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
meeting
Phineas
half
-
way
across
the
large
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thanks
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
took
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
manage
to
see
me
before
any
one
else
was
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
have
wished
it
;
though
I
can
hardly
tell
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
tell
you
why
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
But
never
mind
;
 
come
and
sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
very
glad
that
you
have
been
successful
;
 
so
very
glad
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
told
you
that
I
should
never
think
much
of
you
if
you
did
not
at
least
try
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
I
did
try
.
"
  
"
And
have
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Faint
heart
,
you
know
,
never
did
any
good
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
a
man
's
duty
to
make
his
way
into
the
House
;
 
that
is
,
if
he
ever
means
to
be
anybody
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
is
not
every
man
who
can
get
there
by
the
time
that
he
is
five
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Every
friend
that
I
have
in
the
world
says
that
I
have
ruined
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
do
n't
say
so
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
worth
all
the
others
put
together
.
<EOS>
It
is
such
a
comfort
to
have
some
one
to
say
a
cheery
word
to
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
hear
nothing
but
cheery
words
here
.
<EOS>
Papa
shall
say
cheery
words
to
you
that
shall
be
better
than
mine
,
because
they
shall
be
weighted
with
the
wisdom
of
age
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
him
say
twenty
times
that
the
earlier
a
man
goes
into
the
House
the
better

<EOS>
There
is
much
to
learn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
your
father
was
thinking
of
men
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
<EOS>
;
 
of
younger
brothers
,
and
barristers
,
and
of
men
who
have
their
way
to
make
,
as
you
have
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
,
 
can
you
dine
here
on
Wednesday
?
<EOS>
There
will
be
no
party
,
of
course
,
but
papa
will
want
to
shake
hands
with
you
;
and
you
legislators
of
the
Lower
House
are
more
easily
reached
on
Wednesdays
than
on
any
other
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
,
"
said
Phineas
,
feeling
,
however
,
that
he
did
not
expect
much
sympathy
from
Lord
Brentford
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
dines
here
;
 
you
know
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
of
Loughlinter
;
and
we
will
ask
your
friend
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
nobody
else
.
<EOS>
As
for
catching
Barrington
Erle
,
that
is
out
of
the
question
at
such
a
time
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
going
back
to
my
being
ruined
 
"
said
Phineas
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
of
anything
so
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
suppose
that
I
am
afraid
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
say
that
there
are
worse
things
than
ruin
,
 
or
,
at
any
rate
,
than
the
chance
of
ruin
.
<EOS>
Supposing
that
I
have
to
emigrate
and
skin
sheep
,
what
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
I
myself
,
being
unencumbered
,
have
myself
as
my
own
property
to
do
what
I
like
with
.
<EOS>
With
Nelson
it
was
Westminster
Abbey
or
a
peerage
.
<EOS>
With
me
it
is
parliamentary
success
or
sheep
-
skinning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
shall
be
no
sheep
-
skinning
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
will
guarantee
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
be
safe
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
,
and
a
man
entered
with
quick
steps
,
came
a
few
yards
in
,
and
then
retreated
,
slamming
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
with
thick
short
red
hair
,
and
an
abundance
of
very
red
beard
.
<EOS>
And
his
face
was
red
,
 
and
,
as
it
seemed
to
Phineas
,
his
very
eyes
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
countenance
of
the
man
which
struck
him
almost
with
dread
,
 
something
approaching
to
ferocity
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
a
moment
after
the
door
was
closed
,
and
then
Lady
Laura
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
brother
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
you
have
ever
met
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Low
 
<EOS>
That
terrible
apparition
of
the
red
Lord
Chiltern
had
disturbed
Phineas
in
the
moment
of
his
happiness
as
he
sat
listening
to
the
kind
flatteries
of
Lady
Laura
;
and
though
Lord
Chiltern
had
vanished
as
quickly
as
he
had
appeared
,
there
had
come
no
return
of
his
joy
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
said
some
word
about
her
brother
,
and
Phineas
had
replied
that
he
had
never
chanced
to
see
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Then
there
had
been
an
awkward
silence
,
and
almost
immediately
other
persons
had
come
in
.
<EOS>
After
greeting
one
or
two
old
acquaintances
,
among
whom
an
elder
sister
of
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
was
one
,
he
took
his
leave
and
escaped
out
into
the
square
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Fitzgibbon
is
going
to
dine
with
us
on
Wednesday
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
says
she
wo
n't
answer
for
her
brother
,
but
she
will
bring
him
if
she
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
're
a
member
of
Parliament
now
too
,
they
tell
me
,
"
said
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
holding
up
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
everybody
will
be
in
Parliament
before
long
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
knew
some
man
who
was
n't
,
that
I
might
think
of
changing
my
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
Phineas
cared
very
little
what
Miss
Fitzgibbon
said
to
him
.
<EOS>
Everybody
knew
Aspasia
Fitzgibbon
,
and
all
who
knew
her
were
accustomed
to
put
up
with
the
violence
of
her
jokes
and
the
bitterness
of
her
remarks
.
<EOS>
She
was
an
old
maid
,
over
forty
,
very
plain
,
who
,
having
reconciled
herself
to
the
fact
that
she
was
an
old
maid
,
chose
to
take
advantage
of
such
poor
privileges
as
the
position
gave
her
.
<EOS>
Within
the
last
few
years
a
considerable
fortune
had
fallen
into
her
hands
,
some
twenty
-
five
thousand
pounds
,
which
had
come
to
her
unexpectedly
,
 
a
wonderful
windfall
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
was
the
only
one
of
her
family
who
had
money
at
command
.
<EOS>
She
lived
in
a
small
house
by
herself
,
in
one
of
the
smallest
streets
of
May
Fair
,
and
walked
about
sturdily
by
herself
,
and
spoke
her
mind
about
everything
.
<EOS>
She
was
greatly
devoted
to
her
brother
Laurence
,
 
so
devoted
that
there
was
nothing
she
would
not
do
for
him
,
short
of
lending
him
money
.
  
<EOS>
But
Phineas
when
he
found
himself
out
in
the
square
thought
nothing
of
Aspasia
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
to
Lady
Laura
Standish
for
sympathy
,
and
she
had
given
it
to
him
in
full
measure
.
<EOS>
She
understood
him
and
his
aspirations
if
no
one
else
did
so
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
She
rejoiced
in
his
triumph
,
and
was
not
too
hard
to
tell
him
that
she
looked
forward
to
his
success
.
<EOS>
And
in
what
delightful
language
she
had
done
so
!
"
<EOS>
Faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
thus
,
or
almost
thus
,
that
she
had
encouraged
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
well
that
she
had
in
truth
meant
nothing
more
than
her
words
had
seemed
to
signify
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
for
a
moment
attribute
to
her
aught
else
.
<EOS>
But
might
not
he
get
another
lesson
from
them
?
<EOS>
He
had
often
told
himself
that
he
was
not
in
love
with
Laura
Standish
;
 
but
why
should
he
not
how
tell
himself
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
?
<EOS>
Of
course
there
would
be
difficulty
.
<EOS>
But
was
it
not
the
business
of
his
life
to
overcome
difficulties
?
<EOS>
Had
he
not
already
overcome
one
difficulty
almost
as
great
;
and
why
should
he
be
afraid
of
this
other
?
<EOS>
Faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
!
<EOS>
And
this
fair
lady
,
 
for
at
this
moment
he
was
ready
to
swear
that
she
was
very
fair
,
 
was
already
half
won
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
taken
him
by
the
hand
so
warmly
,
and
looked
into
his
face
so
keenly
,
had
she
not
felt
for
him
something
stronger
than
common
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
turned
down
Baker
Street
from
the
square
,
and
was
now
walking
towards
the
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
and
see
the
beasts
in
the
Zoological
Gardens
,
and
make
up
his
mind
as
to
his
future
mode
of
life
in
that
delightful
Sunday
solitude
.
<EOS>
There
was
very
much
as
to
which
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
make
up
his
mind
.
<EOS>
If
he
resolved
that
he
would
ask
Lady
Laura
Standish
to
be
his
wife
,
when
should
he
ask
her
,
and
in
what
manner
might
he
propose
to
her
that
they
should
live
?
<EOS>
It
would
hardly
suit
him
to
postpone
his
courtship
indefinitely
,
knowing
,
as
he
did
know
,
that
he
would
be
one
among
many
suitors
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
expect
her
to
wait
for
him
if
he
did
not
declare
himself
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
could
hardly
ask
her
to
come
and
share
with
him
the
allowance
made
to
him
by
his
father
!
<EOS>
Whether
she
had
much
fortune
of
her
own
,
or
little
,
or
none
at
all
,
he
did
not
in
the
least
know
.
<EOS>
He
did
know
that
the
Earl
had
been
distressed
by
his
son
's
extravagance
,
and
that
there
had
been
some
money
difficulties
arising
from
this
source
.
  
<EOS>
But
his
great
desire
would
be
to
support
his
own
wife
by
his
own
labour
.
<EOS>
At
present
he
was
hardly
in
a
fair
way
to
do
that
,
unless
he
could
get
paid
for
his
parliamentary
work
.
<EOS>
Those
fortunate
gentlemen
who
form
"
The
Government
"
are
so
paid
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
there
was
the
Treasury
Bench
open
to
him
,
and
he
must
resolve
that
he
would
seat
himself
there
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
Lady
Laura
understand
this
,
and
then
he
would
ask
his
question
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
at
present
his
political
opponents
had
possession
of
the
Treasury
Bench
;
 
but
all
governments
are
mortal
,
and
Conservative
governments
in
this
country
are
especially
prone
to
die
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
he
could
not
hold
even
a
Treasury
lordship
with
a
poor
thousand
a
year
for
his
salary
without
having
to
face
the
electors
of
Loughshane
again
before
he
entered
upon
the
enjoyment
of
his
place
;
 
but
if
he
could
only
do
something
to
give
a
grace
to
his
name
,
to
show
that
he
was
a
rising
man
,
the
electors
of
Loughshane
,
who
had
once
been
so
easy
with
him
,
would
surely
not
be
cruel
to
him
when
he
showed
himself
a
second
time
among
them
.
<EOS>
Lord
Tulla
was
his
friend
,
and
he
had
those
points
of
law
in
his
favour
which
possession
bestows
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
remembered
that
Lady
Laura
was
related
to
almost
everybody
who
was
anybody
among
the
high
Whigs
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
he
knew
,
second
cousin
to
Mr.
Mildmay
,
who
for
years
had
been
the
leader
of
the
Whigs
,
and
was
third
cousin
to
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
The
late
President
of
the
Council
,
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
and
Lord
Brentford
had
married
sisters
,
and
the
St.
Bungay
people
,
and
the
Mildmay
people
,
and
the
Brentford
people
had
all
some
sort
of
connection
with
the
Palliser
people
,
of
whom
the
heir
and
coming
chief
,
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
would
certainly
be
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
in
the
next
Government
.
<EOS>
Simply
as
an
introduction
into
official
life
nothing
could
be
more
conducive
to
chances
of
success
than
a
matrimonial
alliance
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
would
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
on
that
account
!
<EOS>
No
;
 
he
thought
of
it
because
he
loved
her
;
honestly
because
he
loved
her
.
<EOS>
He
swore
to
that
half
a
dozen
times
,
for
his
own
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
But
,
loving
her
as
he
did
,
and
resolving
that
in
spite
of
all
difficulties
she
should
become
his
wife
,
there
could
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
,
 
on
her
account
as
well
as
on
his
own
,
 
take
advantage
of
any
circumstances
that
there
might
be
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
wandered
among
the
unsavoury
beasts
,
elbowed
on
every
side
by
the
Sunday
visitors
to
the
garden
,
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
first
let
Lady
Laura
understand
what
were
his
intentions
with
regard
to
his
future
career
,
and
then
he
would
ask
her
to
join
her
lot
to
his
.
<EOS>
At
every
turn
the
chances
would
of
course
be
very
much
against
him
;
 
ten
to
one
against
him
,
perhaps
,
on
every
point
;
but
it
was
his
lot
in
life
to
have
to
face
such
odds
.
<EOS>
Twelve
months
since
it
had
been
much
more
than
ten
to
one
against
his
getting
into
Parliament
;
and
yet
he
was
there
.
<EOS>
He
expected
to
be
blown
into
fragments
,
 
to
sheep
-
skinning
in
Australia
,
or
packing
preserved
meats
on
the
plains
of
Paraguay
;
but
when
the
blowing
into
atoms
should
come
,
he
was
resolved
that
courage
to
bear
the
ruin
should
not
be
wanting
.
<EOS>
Then
he
quoted
a
line
or
two
of
a
Latin
poet
,
and
felt
himself
to
be
comfortable
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
,
here
you
are
again
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
Fitzgibbon
;
here
I
am
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancied
you
members
of
Parliament
had
something
else
to
do
besides
looking
at
wild
beasts
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
always
spent
Sunday
in
arranging
how
you
might
most
effectually
badger
each
other
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
got
through
all
that
early
this
morning
,
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
while
you
were
saying
your
prayers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
Mr.
Kennedy
too
;
 
you
know
him
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
He
also
is
a
member
;
but
then
he
can
afford
to
be
idle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
it
so
happened
that
Phineas
did
not
know
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
consequently
there
was
some
slight
form
of
introduction
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
am
to
meet
you
at
dinner
on
Wednesday
,
"
 
said
Phineas
,
 
"
at
Lord
Brentford
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
me
too
,
"
said
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
will
be
the
greatest
possible
addition
to
our
pleasure
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
who
seemed
to
be
afflicted
with
some
difficulty
in
speaking
,
and
whose
bow
to
our
hero
had
hardly
done
more
than
produce
the
slightest
possible
motion
to
the
top
of
his
hat
,
hereupon
muttered
something
which
was
taken
to
mean
an
assent
to
the
proposition
as
to
Wednesday
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
Then
he
stood
perfectly
still
,
with
his
two
hands
fixed
on
the
top
of
his
umbrella
,
and
gazed
at
the
great
monkeys
'
cage
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
clear
that
he
was
not
looking
at
any
special
monkey
,
for
his
eyes
never
wandered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
see
such
a
contrast
in
your
life
?
"
said
Miss
Fitzgibbon
to
Phineas
,
 
hardly
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Between
what
?
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Between
Mr.
Kennedy
and
a
monkey
.
<EOS>
The
monkey
has
so
much
to
say
for
himself
,
and
is
so
delightfully
wicked
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
that
Mr.
Kennedy
ever
did
anything
wrong
in
his
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
was
a
man
who
had
very
little
temptation
to
do
anything
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
was
possessed
of
over
a
million
and
a
half
of
money
,
which
he
was
mistaken
enough
to
suppose
he
had
made
himself
;
whereas
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
had
ever
earned
a
penny
.
<EOS>
His
father
and
his
uncle
had
created
a
business
in
Glasgow
,
and
that
business
now
belonged
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
father
and
his
uncle
,
who
had
toiled
through
their
long
lives
,
had
left
behind
them
servants
who
understood
the
work
,
and
the
business
now
went
on
prospering
almost
by
its
own
momentum
.
<EOS>
The
Mr.
Kennedy
of
the
present
day
,
the
sole
owner
of
the
business
,
though
he
did
occasionally
go
to
Glasgow
,
certainly
did
nothing
towards
maintaining
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
magnificent
place
in
Perthshire
,
called
Loughlinter
,
and
he
sat
for
a
Scotch
group
of
boroughs
,
and
he
had
a
house
in
London
,
and
a
stud
of
horses
in
Leicestershire
,
which
he
rarely
visited
,
and
was
unmarried
.
<EOS>
He
never
spoke
much
to
any
one
,
although
he
was
constantly
in
society
.
<EOS>
He
rarely
did
anything
,
although
he
had
the
means
of
doing
everything
.
<EOS>
He
had
very
seldom
been
on
his
legs
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
though
he
had
sat
there
for
ten
years
.
<EOS>
He
was
seen
about
everywhere
,
sometimes
with
one
acquaintance
and
sometimes
with
another
;
 
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
had
any
friend
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubted
whether
he
had
ever
talked
enough
to
any
man
to
make
that
man
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
tried
him
for
one
season
,
and
after
a
month
or
two
asked
for
a
loan
of
a
few
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
lend
money
to
any
one
under
any
circumstances
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
it
was
the
longest
speech
which
had
ever
fallen
from
his
mouth
in
the
hearing
of
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
But
though
he
would
not
lend
money
,
he
gave
a
great
deal
,
 
and
he
would
give
it
for
almost
every
object
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Robert
Kennedy
,
M.P.
,
Loughlinter
,
£
105
,
"
appeared
on
almost
every
charitable
list
that
was
advertised
.
<EOS>
No
one
ever
spoke
to
him
as
to
this
expenditure
,
nor
did
he
ever
speak
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
Circulars
came
to
him
and
the
cheques
were
returned
.
<EOS>
The
duty
was
a
very
easy
one
to
him
,
and
he
performed
it
willingly
.
<EOS>
Had
any
amount
of
inquiry
been
necessary
,
it
is
possible
that
the
labour
would
have
been
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
Such
was
Mr.
Robert
Kennedy
,
as
to
whom
Phineas
had
heard
that
he
had
during
the
last
winter
entertained
Lord
Brentford
and
Lady
Laura
,
with
very
many
other
people
of
note
,
at
his
place
in
Perthshire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
very
much
prefer
the
monkey
,
"
said
Phineas
to
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Like
to
like
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
have
both
of
you
the
same
aptitude
for
climbing
.
<EOS>
But
the
monkeys
never
fall
,
they
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
knowing
that
he
could
gain
nothing
by
sparring
with
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
raised
his
hat
and
took
his
leave
.
<EOS>
Going
out
of
a
narrow
gate
he
found
himself
again
brought
into
contact
with
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
crowd
there
is
here
,
"
he
said
,
finding
himself
bound
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
who
was
behind
him
,
answered
him
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
made
up
his
mind
that
Mr.
Kennedy
was
insolent
with
the
insolence
of
riches
,
and
that
he
would
hate
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
engaged
to
dine
on
this
Sunday
with
Mr.
Low
,
the
barrister
,
with
whom
he
had
been
reading
for
the
last
three
years
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
had
taken
a
strong
liking
to
Phineas
,
as
had
also
Mrs.
Low
,
and
the
tutor
had
more
than
once
told
his
pupil
that
success
in
his
profession
was
certainly
open
to
him
if
he
would
only
stick
to
his
work
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
was
himself
an
ambitious
man
,
looking
forward
to
entering
Parliament
at
some
future
time
,
when
the
exigencies
of
his
life
of
labour
might
enable
him
to
do
so
;
but
he
was
prudent
,
given
to
close
calculation
,
and
resolved
to
make
the
ground
sure
beneath
his
feet
in
every
step
that
he
took
forward
.
<EOS>
When
he
first
heard
that
Finn
intended
to
stand
for
Loughshane
he
was
stricken
with
dismay
,
and
strongly
dissuaded
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
electors
may
probably
reject
him
.
<EOS>
That
's
his
only
chance
now
,
"
Mr.
Low
had
said
to
his
wife
,
when
he
found
that
Phineas
was
,
as
he
thought
,
foolhardy
.
<EOS>
But
the
electors
of
Loughshane
had
not
rejected
Mr.
Low
's
pupil
,
and
Mr.
Low
was
now
called
upon
to
advise
what
Phineas
should
do
in
his
present
circumstances
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
work
of
a
Chancery
barrister
being
done
by
a
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
most
successful
barristers
are
members
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
But
Phineas
Finn
was
beginning
at
the
wrong
end
,
and
Mr.
Low
knew
that
no
good
would
come
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
think
of
your
being
in
Parliament
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
wonderful
,
is
n't
it
?
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
took
us
so
much
by
surprise
!
"
said
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
As
a
rule
one
never
hears
of
a
barrister
going
into
Parliament
till
after
he
's
forty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'm
only
twenty
-
five
.
<EOS>
I
do
feel
that
I
've
disgraced
myself
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
,
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
;
 
you
've
not
disgraced
yourself
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
The
only
question
is
,
whether
it
's
prudent
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
all
turn
out
for
the
best
,
most
heartily
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Low
was
a
very
matter
-
of
-
fact
lady
,
four
or
five
years
older
than
her
husband
,
who
had
had
a
little
money
of
her
own
,
and
was
possessed
of
every
virtue
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
she
did
not
quite
like
the
idea
of
her
husband
's
pupil
having
got
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
If
her
husband
and
Phineas
Finn
were
dining
anywhere
together
,
Phineas
,
who
had
come
to
them
quite
a
boy
,
would
walk
out
of
the
room
before
her
husband
.
<EOS>
This
could
hardly
be
right
!
<EOS>
Nevertheless
she
helped
Phineas
to
the
nicest
bit
of
fish
she
could
find
,
and
had
he
been
ill
,
would
have
nursed
him
with
the
greatest
care
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
when
Mrs.
Low
had
gone
up
-
stairs
,
there
came
the
great
discussion
between
the
tutor
and
the
pupil
,
for
the
sake
of
which
this
little
dinner
had
been
given
.
<EOS>
When
Phineas
had
last
been
with
Mr.
Low
,
 
on
the
occasion
of
his
showing
himself
at
his
tutor
's
chambers
after
his
return
from
Ireland
,
 
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
so
thoroughly
on
certain
points
as
he
had
done
since
he
had
seen
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
The
discussion
could
hardly
be
of
any
avail
now
,
 
but
it
could
not
be
avoided
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Phineas
,
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
?
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
Everybody
who
knew
our
hero
,
or
nearly
everybody
,
called
him
by
his
Christian
name
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
seem
to
be
so
treated
by
general
consent
in
all
societies
.
<EOS>
Even
Mrs.
Low
,
who
was
very
prosaic
,
and
unlikely
to
be
familiar
in
her
mode
of
address
,
had
fallen
into
the
way
of
doing
it
before
the
election
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
dropped
it
,
when
the
Phineas
whom
she
used
to
know
became
a
member
of
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
question
;
 
is
n't
it
?
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'll
stick
to
your
work
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
 
to
the
Bar
?
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
to
the
Bar
.
"
  
"
I
am
not
thinking
of
giving
it
up
permanently
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Giving
it
up
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
,
raising
his
hands
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
give
it
up
,
how
do
you
intend
to
live
?
<EOS>
Men
are
not
paid
for
being
members
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
exactly
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
am
not
thinking
of
giving
it
up
,
 
permanently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
give
it
up
at
all
,
 
not
for
a
day
;
that
is
,
if
you
ever
mean
to
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
I
think
that
perhaps
you
may
be
wrong
,
Low
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
be
wrong
?
<EOS>
Did
a
period
of
idleness
ever
help
a
man
in
any
profession
?
<EOS>
And
is
it
not
acknowledged
by
all
who
know
anything
about
it
,
that
continuous
labour
is
more
necessary
in
our
profession
than
in
any
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
be
idle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
<EOS>
you
do
mean
,
Phineas
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
simply
this
.
<EOS>
Here
I
am
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
We
must
take
that
as
a
fact
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
doubt
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
it
be
a
misfortune
,
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
Even
you
would
n't
advise
me
to
apply
for
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
;
 
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
though
I
do
not
like
to
give
you
pain
,
if
you
come
to
me
<EOS>
I
can
only
tell
you
what
I
think
.
<EOS>
My
advice
to
you
is
to
give
it
up
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Men
would
laugh
at
you
for
a
few
weeks
,
but
that
is
better
than
being
ruined
for
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
do
that
,
"
said
Phineas
,
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
 
then
let
us
go
on
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
wo
n't
give
up
your
seat
,
the
next
best
thing
will
be
to
take
care
that
it
shall
interfere
as
little
as
possible
with
your
work
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
must
sit
upon
some
Committees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
idea
is
this
,
 
that
I
will
give
up
one
year
to
learning
the
practices
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
nothing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
but
that
.
<EOS>
Why
,
the
thing
is
a
study
in
itself
.
<EOS>
As
for
learning
it
in
a
year
,
that
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
convinced
that
if
a
man
intends
to
be
a
useful
member
of
Parliament
,
he
should
make
a
study
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
do
you
mean
to
live
in
the
meantime
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
,
who
was
an
energetic
man
,
had
assumed
almost
an
angry
tone
of
voice
.
<EOS>
Phineas
for
awhile
sat
silent
;
 
not
that
he
felt
himself
to
be
without
words
for
a
reply
,
but
that
he
was
thinking
in
what
fewest
words
he
might
best
convey
his
ideas
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
very
modest
allowance
from
your
father
,
on
which
you
have
never
been
able
to
keep
yourself
free
from
debt
,
"
continued
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
increased
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
it
satisfy
you
to
live
here
,
in
what
will
turn
out
to
be
parliamentary
club
idleness
,
on
the
savings
of
his
industrious
life
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
find
yourself
unhappy
if
you
do
that
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
my
dear
fellow
,
as
far
as
I
have
as
yet
been
able
to
see
the
world
,
men
do
n't
begin
either
very
good
or
very
bad
.
<EOS>
They
have
generally
good
aspirations
with
infirm
purposes
;
 
or
,
as
we
may
say
,
strong
bodies
with
weak
legs
to
carry
them
.
<EOS>
Then
,
because
their
legs
are
weak
,
they
drift
into
idleness
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
During
all
this
drifting
they
are
wretched
,
and
when
they
have
thoroughly
drifted
they
are
still
wretched
.
<EOS>
The
agony
of
their
old
disappointment
still
clings
to
them
.
<EOS>
In
nine
cases
out
of
ten
<EOS>
it
is
some
one
small
unfortunate
event
that
puts
a
man
astray
at
first
.
<EOS>
He
sees
some
woman
and
loses
himself
with
her
;
 
or
he
is
taken
to
a
racecourse
and
unluckily
wins
money
;
 
or
some
devil
in
the
shape
of
a
friend
lures
him
to
tobacco
and
brandy
.
<EOS>
Your
temptation
has
come
in
the
shape
of
this
accursed
seat
in
Parliament
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
had
never
said
a
soft
word
in
his
life
to
any
woman
but
the
wife
of
his
bosom
,
had
never
seen
a
racehorse
,
always
confined
himself
to
two
glasses
of
port
after
dinner
,
and
looked
upon
smoking
as
the
darkest
of
all
the
vices
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
up
your
mind
,
then
,
that
I
mean
to
be
idle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
up
my
mind
that
your
time
will
be
wholly
unprofitable
,
 
if
you
do
as
you
say
you
intend
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
not
know
my
plan
;
 
just
listen
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Low
did
listen
,
and
Phineas
explained
his
plan
,
 
saying
,
of
course
,
nothing
of
his
love
for
Lady
Laura
,
but
giving
Mr.
Low
to
understand
that
he
intended
to
assist
in
turning
out
the
existing
Government
and
to
mount
up
to
some
seat
,
 
a
humble
seat
at
first
,
 
on
the
Treasury
bench
,
by
the
help
of
his
exalted
friends
and
by
the
use
of
his
own
gifts
of
eloquence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
heard
him
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
after
the
first
year
my
time
will
not
be
fully
employed
,
unless
I
succeed
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
fail
totally
,
 
for
,
of
course
,
I
may
fail
altogether
 
"
  
"
It
is
possible
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
resolved
to
turn
yourself
against
me
,
I
must
not
say
another
word
,
"
said
Phineas
,
with
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Turn
myself
against
you
!
<EOS>
I
would
turn
myself
any
way
so
that
I
might
save
you
from
the
sort
of
life
which
you
are
preparing
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
see
nothing
in
it
that
can
satisfy
any
manly
heart
.
<EOS>
Even
if
you
are
successful
,
what
are
you
to
become
?
<EOS>
You
will
be
the
creature
of
some
minister
,
not
his
colleague
.
<EOS>
You
are
to
make
your
way
up
the
ladder
by
pretending
to
agree
whenever
agreement
is
demanded
from
you
,
and
by
voting
whether
you
agree
or
do
not
.
<EOS>
And
what
is
to
be
your
reward
?
<EOS>
Some
few
precarious
hundreds
a
year
,
lasting
just
so
long
as
a
party
may
remain
in
power
and
you
can
retain
a
seat
in
Parliament
!
<EOS>
It
is
at
the
best
slavery
and
degradation
,
 
even
if
you
are
lucky
enough
to
achieve
the
slavery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
yourself
hope
to
go
into
Parliament
and
join
a
ministry
some
day
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
was
not
quick
to
answer
,
but
he
did
answer
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
true
,
though
I
have
never
told
you
so
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
is
hardly
true
to
say
that
I
hope
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
dreams
,
and
sometimes
dare
to
tell
myself
that
they
may
possibly
become
waking
facts
.
<EOS>
But
if
ever
I
sit
on
a
Treasury
bench
I
shall
sit
there
by
special
invitation
,
having
been
summoned
to
take
a
high
place
because
of
my
professional
success
.
<EOS>
It
is
but
a
dream
after
all
,
and
I
would
not
have
you
repeat
what
I
have
said
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
intention
to
talk
about
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
that
you
will
succeed
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
shall
succeed
.
<EOS>
I
am
succeeding
.
<EOS>
I
live
upon
what
I
earn
,
like
a
gentleman
,
and
can
already
afford
to
be
indifferent
to
work
that
I
dislike
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
the
other
part
of
it
,
 
that
of
which
I
dream
,
 
is
but
an
unnecessary
adjunct
;
the
gilding
on
the
gingerbread
.
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
cake
is
more
wholesome
without
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
go
up
-
stairs
into
Mrs.
Low
's
drawing
-
room
on
that
evening
,
nor
did
he
stay
very
late
with
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
enough
of
counsel
to
make
him
very
unhappy
,
 
to
shake
from
him
much
of
the
audacity
which
he
had
acquired
for
himself
during
his
morning
's
walk
,
 
and
to
make
him
almost
doubt
whether
,
after
all
,
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
would
not
be
for
him
the
safest
escape
from
his
difficulties
.
<EOS>
But
in
that
case
he
must
never
venture
to
see
Lady
Laura
Standish
again
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
's
Dinner
 
No
;
 
in
such
case
as
that
,
 
should
he
resolve
upon
taking
the
advice
of
his
old
friend
Mr.
Low
,
Phineas
Finn
must
make
up
his
mind
never
to
see
Lady
Laura
Standish
again
!
<EOS>
And
he
was
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
Standish
;
 
and
,
for
aught
he
knew
,
Lady
Laura
Standish
might
be
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
walked
home
from
Mr.
Low
's
house
in
Bedford
Square
,
he
was
by
no
means
a
triumphant
man
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
much
more
said
between
him
and
Mr.
Low
than
could
be
laid
before
the
reader
in
the
last
chapter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
had
urged
him
again
and
again
,
and
had
prevailed
so
far
that
Phineas
,
before
he
left
the
house
,
had
promised
to
consider
that
suicidal
expedient
of
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
.
<EOS>
What
a
by
-
word
he
would
become
if
he
were
to
give
up
Parliament
,
having
sat
there
for
about
a
week
!
<EOS>
But
such
immediate
giving
up
was
one
of
the
necessities
of
Mr.
Low
's
programme
.
<EOS>
According
to
Mr.
Low
's
teaching
,
a
single
year
passed
amidst
the
miasma
of
the
House
of
Commons
would
be
altogether
fatal
to
any
chance
of
professional
success
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Low
had
at
any
rate
succeeded
in
making
Phineas
believe
that
he
was
right
in
this
lesson
.
<EOS>
There
was
his
profession
,
as
to
which
Mr.
Low
assured
him
that
success
was
within
his
reach
;
and
there
was
Parliament
on
the
other
side
,
<EOS>
as
to
which
he
knew
that
the
chances
were
all
against
him
,
in
spite
of
his
advantage
of
a
seat
.
<EOS>
That
he
could
not
combine
the
two
,
beginning
with
Parliament
,
he
did
believe
.
<EOS>
Which
should
it
be
?
<EOS>
That
was
the
question
which
he
tried
to
decide
as
he
walked
home
from
Bedford
Square
to
Great
Marlborough
Street
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
answer
the
question
satisfactorily
,
and
went
to
bed
an
unhappy
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
must
at
any
rate
go
to
Lord
Brentford
's
dinner
on
Wednesday
,
and
,
to
enable
him
to
join
in
the
conversation
there
,
must
attend
the
debates
on
Monday
and
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
The
reader
may
perhaps
be
best
made
to
understand
how
terrible
was
our
hero
's
state
of
doubt
by
being
told
that
for
awhile
he
thought
of
absenting
himself
from
these
debates
,
as
being
likely
to
weaken
his
purpose
of
withdrawing
altogether
from
the
House
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
very
often
that
so
strong
a
fury
rages
between
party
and
party
at
the
commencement
of
the
session
that
a
division
is
taken
upon
the
Address
.
<EOS>
It
is
customary
for
the
leader
of
the
opposition
on
such
occasions
to
express
his
opinion
in
the
most
courteous
language
,
that
his
right
honourable
friend
,
sitting
opposite
to
him
on
the
Treasury
bench
,
has
been
,
is
,
and
will
be
wrong
in
everything
that
he
thinks
,
says
,
or
does
in
public
life
;
but
that
,
as
anything
like
factious
opposition
is
never
adopted
on
that
side
of
the
House
,
the
Address
to
the
Queen
,
in
answer
to
that
most
fatuous
speech
which
has
been
put
into
her
Majesty
's
gracious
mouth
,
shall
be
allowed
to
pass
unquestioned
.
<EOS>
Then
the
leader
of
the
House
thanks
his
adversary
for
his
consideration
<EOS>
,
explains
to
all
men
how
happy
the
country
ought
to
be
that
the
Government
has
not
fallen
into
the
disgracefully
incapable
hands
of
his
right
honourable
friend
opposite
;
and
after
that
the
Address
is
carried
amidst
universal
serenity
.
<EOS>
But
such
was
not
the
order
of
the
day
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
the
veteran
leader
of
the
liberal
side
of
the
House
,
had
moved
an
amendment
to
the
Address
,
and
had
urged
upon
the
House
,
in
very
strong
language
,
the
expediency
of
showing
,
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
session
,
that
the
country
had
returned
to
Parliament
a
strong
majority
determined
not
to
put
up
with
Conservative
inactivity
.
<EOS>
"
I
conceive
it
to
be
my
duty
,
"
Mr.
Mildmay
had
said
,
"
at
once
to
assume
that
the
country
is
unwilling
that
the
right
honourable
gentlemen
opposite
should
keep
their
seats
on
the
bench
upon
which
they
sit
,
and
in
the
performance
of
that
duty
I
am
called
upon
to
divide
the
House
upon
the
Address
to
her
Majesty
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
Mr.
Mildmay
used
strong
language
,
the
reader
may
be
sure
that
Mr.
Mildmay
's
followers
used
language
much
stronger
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Daubeny
,
who
was
the
present
leader
of
the
House
,
and
representative
there
of
the
Ministry
,
 
Lord
de
Terrier
,
the
Premier
,
sitting
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
 
was
not
the
man
to
allow
these
amenities
to
pass
by
without
adequate
replies
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
friends
were
very
strong
in
sarcasm
,
if
they
failed
in
argument
,
and
lacked
nothing
for
words
,
though
it
might
perhaps
be
proved
that
they
were
short
in
numbers
.
<EOS>
It
was
considered
that
the
speech
in
which
Mr.
Daubeny
reviewed
the
long
political
life
of
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
showed
that
Mr.
Mildmay
had
been
at
one
time
a
bugbear
,
and
then
a
nightmare
,
and
latterly
simply
a
fungus
,
was
one
of
the
severest
attacks
,
if
not
the
most
severe
,
that
had
been
heard
in
that
House
since
the
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
the
while
,
was
sitting
with
his
hat
low
down
over
his
eyes
,
and
many
men
said
that
he
did
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
But
this
speech
was
not
made
till
after
that
dinner
at
Lord
Brentford
's
,
of
which
a
short
account
must
be
given
.
  
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
the
overwhelming
interest
of
the
doings
in
Parliament
at
the
commencement
of
the
session
,
Phineas
might
have
perhaps
abstained
from
attending
,
in
spite
of
the
charm
of
novelty
.
<EOS>
For
,
in
truth
,
Mr.
Low
's
words
had
moved
him
much
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
was
to
be
his
fate
to
be
a
member
of
Parliament
only
for
ten
days
,
surely
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
take
advantage
of
the
time
to
hear
such
a
debate
as
this
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
thing
to
talk
of
to
his
children
in
twenty
years
'
time
,
or
to
his
grandchildren
in
fifty
;
 
and
it
would
be
essentially
necessary
that
he
should
be
able
to
talk
of
it
to
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
did
,
therefore
,
sit
in
the
House
till
one
on
the
Monday
night
,
and
till
two
on
the
Tuesday
night
,
and
heard
the
debate
adjourned
till
the
Thursday
.
<EOS>
On
the
Thursday
Mr.
Daubeny
was
to
make
his
great
speech
,
and
then
the
division
would
come
.
  
<EOS>
When
Phineas
entered
Lady
Laura
's
drawing
-
room
on
the
Wednesday
before
dinner
,
he
found
the
other
guests
all
assembled
.
<EOS>
Why
men
should
have
been
earlier
in
keeping
their
dinner
engagements
on
that
day
than
on
any
other
he
did
not
understand
;
but
it
was
the
fact
,
probably
,
that
the
great
anxiety
of
the
time
made
those
who
were
at
all
concerned
in
the
matter
very
keen
to
hear
and
to
be
heard
.
<EOS>
During
these
days
everybody
was
in
a
hurry
,
 
everybody
was
eager
;
and
there
was
a
common
feeling
that
not
a
minute
was
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
There
were
three
ladies
in
the
room
,
 
Lady
Laura
,
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
the
wife
of
a
gentleman
who
had
been
a
junior
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
in
the
late
Government
,
and
who
lived
in
the
expectation
of
filling
,
perhaps
,
some
higher
office
in
the
Government
which
,
as
he
hoped
,
was
soon
to
be
called
into
existence
.
<EOS>
There
were
five
gentlemen
besides
Phineas
Finn
himself
,
 
Mr.
Bonteen
,
Mr.
Kennedy
,
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
Barrington
Erle
,
who
had
been
caught
in
spite
of
all
that
Lady
Laura
had
said
as
to
the
difficulty
of
such
an
operation
,
and
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
quick
to
observe
that
every
male
guest
was
in
Parliament
,
and
to
tell
himself
that
he
would
not
have
been
there
unless
he
also
had
had
a
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
here
now
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
ringing
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
've
not
kept
you
waiting
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
we
are
in
such
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
And
how
many
do
you
say
it
will
be
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Seventeen
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
likely
twenty
-
two
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
Colcleugh
so
ill
they
ca
n't
possibly
bring
him
up
,
and
young
Rochester
is
at
Vienna
,
and
Gunning
is
sulking
about
something
,
and
Moody
has
lost
his
eldest
son
.
<EOS>
By
George
!
<EOS>
they
pressed
him
to
come
up
,
although
Frank
Moody
wo
n't
be
buried
till
Friday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
"
said
Lord
Brentford
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ask
some
of
the
Carlton
fellows
,
and
they
'll
own
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
'd
lost
every
relation
I
had
in
the
world
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
,
"
I
'd
vote
on
such
a
question
as
this
.
<EOS>
Staying
away
wo
n't
bring
poor
Frank
Moody
back
to
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
a
decency
in
these
matters
,
is
there
not
,
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
they
had
thrown
all
that
kind
of
thing
overboard
long
ago
,
"
said
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
better
that
they
should
have
no
veil
,
than
squabble
about
the
thickness
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
dinner
was
announced
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
walked
off
with
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
Barrington
Erle
took
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
and
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
took
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bet
four
pounds
to
two
<EOS>
it
's
over
nineteen
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
,
as
he
passed
through
the
drawing
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
The
remark
seemed
to
have
been
addressed
to
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
Phineas
therefore
made
no
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
it
will
,
"
said
Kennedy
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
never
bet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
vote
 
sometimes
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
the
most
odious
man
that
ever
I
set
my
eyes
on
,
"
said
Phineas
to
himself
as
he
followed
Mr.
Kennedy
into
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
had
observed
that
Mr.
Kennedy
had
been
standing
very
near
to
Lady
Laura
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
that
Lady
Laura
had
said
a
few
words
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
more
determined
than
ever
that
he
would
hate
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
would
probably
have
been
moody
and
unhappy
throughout
the
whole
dinner
had
not
Lady
Laura
called
him
to
a
chair
at
her
left
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
generous
of
her
;
and
the
more
so
,
as
Mr.
Kennedy
had
,
in
a
half
-
hesitating
manner
,
prepared
to
seat
himself
in
that
very
place
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
Phineas
and
Mr.
Kennedy
were
neighbours
,
but
Phineas
had
the
place
of
honour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
will
not
speak
during
the
debate
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
<EOS>
I
?
<EOS>
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
I
could
not
get
a
hearing
,
and
,
in
the
next
place
,
I
should
not
think
of
commencing
on
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
shall
ever
speak
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
will
.
<EOS>
You
are
just
the
sort
of
man
who
will
succeed
with
the
House
.
<EOS>
What
I
doubt
is
,
whether
you
will
do
as
well
in
office
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
might
have
the
chance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
can
have
the
chance
if
you
try
for
it
.
<EOS>
Beginning
so
early
,
and
being
on
the
right
side
,
 
and
,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
,
among
the
right
set
,
 
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
you
may
take
office
if
you
will
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
sure
that
you
will
be
tractable
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
begin
,
you
know
,
by
being
Prime
Minister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
enough
to
realise
that
already
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
only
keep
that
little
fact
steadily
before
your
eyes
,
there
is
nothing
you
may
not
reach
in
official
life
.
<EOS>
But
Pitt
was
Prime
Minister
at
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
that
precedent
has
ruined
half
our
young
politicians
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
not
affected
me
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
can
see
,
there
is
no
great
difficulty
in
government
.
<EOS>
A
man
must
learn
to
have
words
at
command
when
he
is
on
his
legs
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
in
the
same
way
as
he
would
if
he
were
talking
to
his
own
servants
.
<EOS>
He
must
keep
his
temper
;
and
he
must
be
very
patient
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
have
seen
Cabinet
Ministers
,
they
are
not
more
clever
than
other
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
there
are
generally
one
or
two
men
of
ability
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
of
fair
ability
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
is
a
good
specimen
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
,
and
never
was
,
anything
brilliant
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
eloquent
,
nor
,
as
far
as
I
am
aware
,
did
he
ever
create
anything
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
always
been
a
steady
,
honest
,
persevering
man
,
and
circumstances
have
made
politics
come
easy
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
the
momentous
questions
which
he
has
been
called
upon
to
decide
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Every
question
so
handled
by
him
has
been
decided
rightly
according
to
his
own
party
,
and
wrongly
according
to
the
party
opposite
.
<EOS>
A
political
leader
is
so
sure
of
support
<EOS>
and
so
sure
of
attack
,
that
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
him
to
be
even
anxious
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
For
the
country
's
sake
,
he
should
have
officials
under
him
who
know
the
routine
of
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
very
badly
then
of
politics
as
a
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
think
of
them
very
highly
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
better
to
deal
with
the
repeal
of
laws
than
the
defending
of
criminals
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
is
papa
's
wisdom
,
not
mine
.
<EOS>
Papa
has
never
been
in
the
Cabinet
yet
,
and
therefore
of
course
he
is
a
little
caustic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
was
quite
right
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
stoutly
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
so
stoutly
that
everybody
at
the
table
listened
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
exactly
see
the
necessity
for
such
internecine
war
just
at
present
,
"
said
Lord
Brentford
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
I
do
,
"
said
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
took
office
knowing
that
he
was
in
a
minority
.
<EOS>
We
had
a
fair
majority
of
nearly
thirty
when
he
came
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
how
very
soft
you
must
have
been
to
go
out
,
"
said
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
soft
,
"
continued
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
We
could
not
command
our
men
,
and
were
bound
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
For
aught
we
knew
,
some
score
of
them
might
have
chosen
to
support
Lord
de
Terrier
,
and
then
we
should
have
owned
ourselves
beaten
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
beaten
,
 
hollow
,
"
said
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
did
Lord
de
Terrier
dissolve
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
Prime
Minister
is
quite
right
to
dissolve
in
such
a
position
,
"
said
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
"
He
must
do
so
for
the
Queen
's
sake
.
<EOS>
It
is
his
only
chance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Just
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
as
you
say
,
his
only
chance
,
and
it
is
his
right
.
<EOS>
His
very
possession
of
power
will
give
him
near
a
score
of
votes
,
and
if
he
thinks
that
he
has
a
chance
,
let
him
try
it
.
<EOS>
We
maintain
that
he
had
no
chance
,
and
that
he
must
have
known
that
he
had
none
;
 
that
if
he
could
not
get
on
with
the
late
House
,
he
certainly
could
not
get
on
with
a
new
House
.
<EOS>
We
let
him
have
his
own
way
as
far
as
we
could
in
February
.
<EOS>
We
had
failed
last
summer
,
and
if
he
could
get
along
he
was
welcome
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
get
along
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
I
think
he
was
right
to
dissolve
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
we
are
right
to
force
the
consequences
upon
him
as
quickly
as
we
can
.
<EOS>
He
practically
lost
nine
seats
by
his
dissolution
.
<EOS>
Look
at
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
look
at
Loughshane
,
"
said
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
The
country
at
any
rate
has
gained
something
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
is
to
become
of
poor
George
?
"
said
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
any
one
knows
where
he
is
.
<EOS>
George
was
n't
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Roby
used
to
think
that
he
was
a
very
bad
fellow
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
Roby
used
to
swear
that
it
was
hopeless
trying
to
catch
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
as
well
to
explain
that
Mr.
Roby
was
a
Conservative
gentleman
of
great
fame
who
had
for
years
acted
as
Whip
under
Mr.
Daubeny
,
and
who
now
filled
the
high
office
of
Patronage
Secretary
to
the
Treasury
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
in
my
heart
,
"
continued
Mr.
Bonteen
,
"
that
Roby
is
rejoiced
that
poor
George
Morris
should
be
out
in
the
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
seats
were
halveable
,
he
should
share
mine
,
for
the
sake
of
auld
lang
syne
,
"
said
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
not
to
-
morrow
night
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
;
"
the
division
to
-
morrow
will
be
a
thing
not
to
be
joked
with
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
I
think
they
're
right
about
old
Moody
.
<EOS>
All
private
considerations
should
give
way
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
Gunning
,
I
'd
have
him
up
<EOS>
or
I
'd
know
the
reason
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
shall
we
have
no
defaulters
,
Barrington
?
"
asked
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
going
to
boast
,
but
I
do
n't
know
of
one
for
whom
we
need
blush
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Powell
is
so
bad
with
gout
that
he
ca
n't
even
bear
any
one
to
look
at
him
,
but
Ratler
says
that
he
'll
bring
him
up
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
was
in
those
days
the
Whip
on
the
liberal
side
of
the
House
.
  
<EOS>
"
Unfortunate
wretch
!
"
said
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
worst
of
it
is
that
he
screams
in
his
paroxysms
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
mean
to
say
that
you
'll
take
him
into
the
lobby
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
He
has
no
business
with
a
seat
if
he
ca
n't
vote
.
<EOS>
But
Sir
Everard
is
a
good
man
,
and
he
'll
be
there
if
laudanum
and
bath
-
chair
make
it
possible
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
same
kind
of
conversation
went
on
during
the
whole
of
dinner
,
and
became
,
if
anything
,
more
animated
when
the
three
ladies
had
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
made
but
one
remark
,
and
then
he
observed
that
as
far
as
he
could
see
a
majority
of
nineteen
would
be
as
serviceable
as
a
majority
of
twenty
.
<EOS>
This
he
said
in
a
very
mild
voice
,
and
in
a
tone
that
was
intended
to
be
expressive
of
doubt
;
but
in
spite
of
his
humility
Barrington
Erle
flew
at
him
almost
savagely
,
 
as
though
a
liberal
member
of
the
House
of
Commons
was
disgraced
by
<EOS>
so
mean
a
spirit
;
and
Phineas
found
himself
despising
the
man
for
his
want
of
zeal
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
are
to
beat
them
,
let
us
beat
them
well
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
every
man
with
a
seat
polled
,
"
said
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Sir
Everard
!
"
said
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
kill
him
,
no
doubt
,
but
I
suppose
the
seat
is
safe
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
Llanwrwsth
is
quite
safe
,
"
said
Barrington
,
in
his
eagerness
omitting
to
catch
Lord
Brentford
's
grim
joke
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
went
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
for
a
few
minutes
after
dinner
,
and
was
eagerly
desirous
of
saying
a
few
more
words
,
 
<EOS>
he
knew
not
what
words
,
 
to
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
and
Mr.
Bonteen
had
left
the
dining
-
room
first
,
and
Phineas
again
found
Mr.
Kennedy
standing
close
to
Lady
Laura
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
there
was
anything
in
it
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
was
an
unmarried
man
,
with
an
immense
fortune
,
a
magnificent
place
,
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
was
not
perhaps
above
forty
years
of
age
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
ask
Lady
Laura
to
be
his
wife
,
 
except
,
indeed
,
that
he
did
not
seem
to
have
sufficient
words
at
command
to
ask
anybody
for
anything
.
<EOS>
But
could
it
be
that
such
a
woman
as
Lady
Laura
could
accept
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Kennedy
because
of
his
wealth
,
and
because
of
his
fine
place
,
 
a
man
who
had
not
a
word
to
throw
to
a
dog
,
who
did
not
seem
to
be
possessed
of
an
idea
,
who
hardly
looked
like
a
gentleman
;
 
so
Phineas
told
himself
.
<EOS>
But
in
truth
Mr.
Kennedy
,
though
he
was
a
plain
,
unattractive
man
,
with
nothing
in
his
personal
appearance
to
call
for
remark
,
was
not
unlike
a
gentleman
in
his
usual
demeanour
.
<EOS>
Phineas
himself
,
it
may
be
here
said
,
was
six
feet
high
,
and
very
handsome
,
with
bright
blue
eyes
,
and
brown
wavy
hair
,
and
light
silken
beard
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Low
had
told
her
husband
more
than
once
that
he
was
much
too
handsome
to
do
any
good
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
,
however
,
had
replied
that
young
Finn
had
never
shown
himself
to
be
conscious
of
his
own
personal
advantages
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
'll
learn
it
soon
enough
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
Some
woman
will
tell
him
,
and
then
he
'll
be
spoilt
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
Phineas
depended
much
as
yet
on
his
own
good
looks
,
but
he
felt
that
Mr.
Kennedy
ought
to
be
despised
by
such
a
one
as
Lady
Laura
Standish
,
because
his
looks
were
not
good
.
<EOS>
And
she
must
despise
him
!
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
that
a
woman
so
full
of
life
should
be
willing
to
put
up
with
a
man
who
absolutely
seemed
to
have
no
life
within
him
.
<EOS>
And
yet
why
was
he
there
,
and
why
was
he
allowed
to
hang
about
just
over
her
shoulders
?
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
began
to
feel
himself
to
be
an
injured
man
.
  
<EOS>
But
Lady
Laura
had
the
power
of
dispelling
instantly
this
sense
of
injury
.
<EOS>
She
had
done
it
effectually
in
the
dining
-
room
by
calling
him
to
the
seat
by
her
side
,
to
the
express
exclusion
of
the
millionaire
,
and
she
did
it
again
now
by
walking
away
from
Mr.
Kennedy
to
the
spot
on
which
Phineas
had
placed
himself
somewhat
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'll
be
at
the
club
on
Friday
morning
after
the
division
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
leave
it
,
come
and
tell
me
what
are
your
impressions
,
and
what
you
think
of
Mr.
Daubeny
's
speech
.
<EOS>
There
'll
be
nothing
done
in
the
House
before
four
,
and
you
'll
be
able
to
run
up
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
asked
Mr.
Kennedy
to
come
,
and
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
anxious
about
it
,
that
I
want
to
hear
what
different
people
say
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
perhaps
,
that
papa
is
to
be
in
the
Cabinet
if
there
's
a
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
indeed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
 
and
you
'll
come
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
will
.
<EOS>
Do
you
expect
to
hear
much
of
an
opinion
from
Mr.
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
quite
know
Mr.
Kennedy
yet
.
<EOS>
And
you
must
remember
that
he
will
say
more
to
me
than
he
will
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
's
not
quick
,
you
know
,
as
you
are
,
and
he
has
no
enthusiasm
on
any
subject
;
 
but
he
has
opinions
,
and
sound
opinions
too
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
felt
that
Lady
Laura
was
in
a
slight
degree
scolding
him
for
the
disrespectful
manner
in
which
he
had
spoken
of
Mr.
Kennedy
;
and
he
felt
also
that
he
had
committed
himself
,
 
that
he
had
shown
himself
to
be
sore
,
and
that
she
had
seen
and
understood
his
soreness
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
I
do
not
know
him
,
"
said
he
,
trying
to
correct
his
blunder
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
that
you
may
some
day
,
as
he
is
one
of
those
men
who
are
both
useful
and
estimable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
can
use
him
,
"
said
Phineas
;
"
but
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
endeavour
to
esteem
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
do
both
;
 
but
that
will
all
come
in
due
time
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
probable
that
in
the
early
autumn
there
will
be
a
great
gathering
of
the
real
Whig
Liberals
at
Loughlinter
;
 
of
those
,
I
mean
,
who
have
their
heart
in
it
,
and
are
at
the
same
time
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
so
,
I
should
be
sorry
that
you
should
not
be
there
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
mention
it
,
but
Mr.
Kennedy
has
just
said
a
word
about
it
to
papa
,
and
a
word
from
him
always
means
so
much
!
<EOS>
Well
;
 
good
-
night
;
and
mind
you
come
up
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
You
are
going
to
the
club
,
now
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
envy
you
men
your
clubs
more
than
I
do
the
House
;
 
though
I
feel
that
a
woman
's
life
is
only
half
a
life
,
as
she
can
not
have
a
seat
in
Parliament
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
went
away
,
and
walked
down
to
Pall
Mall
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
preferred
to
take
his
walk
alone
,
but
he
could
not
get
rid
of
his
affectionate
countryman
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
think
over
what
had
taken
place
during
the
evening
;
and
,
indeed
,
he
did
so
in
spite
of
his
friend
's
conversation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
when
she
first
saw
him
after
his
return
to
London
,
had
told
him
how
anxious
her
father
was
to
congratulate
him
on
his
seat
,
but
the
Earl
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
had
been
courteous
,
as
hosts
customarily
are
,
but
had
been
in
no
way
specially
kind
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
then
Mr.
Kennedy
!
<EOS>
As
to
going
to
Loughlinter
,
he
would
not
do
such
a
thing
,
 
not
though
the
success
of
the
liberal
party
were
to
depend
on
it
.
<EOS>
He
declared
to
himself
that
there
were
some
things
which
a
man
could
not
do
.
<EOS>
But
although
he
was
not
altogether
satisfied
with
what
had
occurred
in
Portman
Square
,
he
felt
as
he
walked
down
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Fitzgibbon
that
Mr.
Low
and
Mr.
Low
's
counsels
must
be
scattered
to
the
winds
.
<EOS>
He
had
thrown
the
die
in
consenting
to
stand
for
Loughshane
,
and
must
stand
the
hazard
of
the
cast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bedad
,
Phin
,
my
boy
,
I
do
n't
think
you
're
listening
to
me
at
all
,
"
said
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
listening
to
every
word
you
say
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
I
have
to
go
down
to
the
ould
country
again
this
session
,
you
'll
go
with
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
boy
!
<EOS>
And
it
's
I
that
hope
you
'll
have
the
chance
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
good
of
turning
these
fellows
out
if
one
is
n't
to
get
something
for
one
's
trouble
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bunce
 
<EOS>
It
was
three
o'clock
on
the
Thursday
night
before
Mr.
Daubeny
's
speech
was
finished
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
there
was
any
truth
in
the
allegation
made
at
the
time
,
that
he
continued
on
his
legs
an
hour
longer
than
the
necessities
of
his
speech
required
,
in
order
that
five
or
six
<EOS>
very
ancient
Whigs
might
be
wearied
out
and
shrink
to
their
beds
.
<EOS>
Let
a
Whig
have
been
ever
so
ancient
and
ever
so
weary
,
he
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
depart
from
Westminster
Hall
that
night
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Powell
was
there
in
his
bath
-
chair
at
twelve
,
with
a
doctor
on
one
side
of
him
and
a
friend
on
the
other
,
in
some
purlieu
of
the
House
,
and
did
his
duty
like
a
fine
old
Briton
as
he
was
.
<EOS>
That
speech
of
Mr.
Daubeny
's
will
never
be
forgotten
by
any
one
who
heard
it
.
<EOS>
Its
studied
bitterness
had
perhaps
never
been
equalled
,
and
yet
not
a
word
was
uttered
for
the
saying
of
which
he
could
be
accused
of
going
beyond
the
limits
of
parliamentary
antagonism
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
personalities
could
not
have
been
closer
,
that
accusations
of
political
dishonesty
and
of
almost
worse
than
political
cowardice
and
falsehood
could
not
have
been
clearer
,
that
no
words
in
the
language
could
have
attributed
meaner
motives
or
more
unscrupulous
conduct
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
Mr.
Daubeny
in
all
that
he
said
was
parliamentary
,
and
showed
himself
to
be
a
gladiator
thoroughly
well
trained
for
the
arena
in
which
he
had
descended
to
the
combat
.
<EOS>
His
arrows
were
poisoned
,
and
his
lance
was
barbed
,
and
his
shot
was
heated
red
,
 
because
such
things
are
allowed
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
poison
his
enemies
'
wells
or
use
Greek
fire
,
because
those
things
are
not
allowed
.
<EOS>
He
knew
exactly
the
rules
of
the
combat
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
sat
and
heard
him
without
once
raising
his
hat
from
his
brow
,
or
speaking
a
word
to
his
neighbour
.
<EOS>
Men
on
both
sides
of
the
House
said
that
Mr.
Mildmay
suffered
terribly
;
but
as
Mr.
Mildmay
uttered
no
word
of
complaint
to
any
one
,
and
was
quite
ready
to
take
Mr.
Daubeny
by
the
hand
the
next
time
they
met
in
company
,
I
do
not
know
that
any
one
was
able
to
form
a
true
idea
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
feelings
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
was
an
impassive
man
who
rarely
spoke
of
his
own
feelings
,
and
no
doubt
sat
with
his
hat
low
down
over
his
eyes
in
order
that
no
man
might
judge
of
them
on
that
occasion
by
the
impression
on
his
features
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
could
have
left
off
half
an
hour
earlier
it
would
have
been
perfect
as
an
attack
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
in
criticising
Mr.
Daubeny
's
speech
,
"
but
he
allowed
himself
to
sink
into
comparative
weakness
,
and
the
glory
of
it
was
over
before
the
end
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
division
.
<EOS>
The
Liberals
had
333
votes
to
314
for
the
Conservatives
,
and
therefore
counted
a
majority
of
19
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
so
large
a
number
of
members
had
never
before
voted
at
any
division
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
own
I
'm
disappointed
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
to
Mr.
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
there
would
be
twenty
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
went
beyond
that
.
<EOS>
I
knew
they
would
have
old
Moody
up
,
but
I
thought
Gunning
would
have
been
too
hard
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
they
've
promised
them
both
peerages
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
if
they
remain
in
.
<EOS>
But
they
know
they
're
going
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
go
,
with
such
a
majority
against
them
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
they
must
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
wants
nothing
better
,
but
it
is
rather
hard
upon
poor
Daubeny
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
an
unfortunate
old
Tantalus
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
gets
a
good
drop
of
real
water
now
and
again
,
and
I
do
n't
pity
him
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
He
's
clever
of
course
,
and
has
made
his
own
way
,
but
I
've
always
a
feeling
that
he
has
no
business
where
he
is
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
shall
know
all
about
it
at
Brooks
's
by
one
o'clock
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
though
it
had
been
past
five
before
he
went
to
bed
,
 
for
there
had
been
much
triumphant
talking
to
be
done
among
liberal
members
after
the
division
,
 
was
up
at
his
breakfast
at
Mrs.
Bunce
's
lodgings
by
nine
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
matter
which
he
was
called
upon
to
settle
immediately
in
which
Mrs.
Bunce
herself
was
much
interested
,
and
respecting
which
he
had
promised
to
give
an
answer
on
this
very
morning
.
<EOS>
A
set
of
very
dingy
chambers
up
two
pairs
of
stairs
at
No
.
9
,
Old
Square
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
to
which
Mr.
Low
had
recommended
him
to
transfer
himself
and
all
his
belongings
,
were
waiting
his
occupation
,
should
he
resolve
upon
occupying
them
.
<EOS>
If
he
intended
to
commence
operations
as
a
barrister
,
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
have
chambers
and
a
clerk
;
and
before
he
had
left
Mr.
Low
's
house
on
Sunday
evening
<EOS>
he
had
almost
given
that
gentleman
authority
to
secure
for
him
these
rooms
at
No
.
9
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whether
you
remain
in
Parliament
or
no
,
you
must
make
a
beginning
,
"
Mr.
Low
had
said
;
"
and
how
are
you
even
to
pretend
to
begin
if
you
do
n't
have
chambers
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
hoped
that
he
might
be
able
to
wean
Phineas
away
from
his
Parliament
bauble
;
 
that
he
might
induce
the
young
barrister
to
give
up
his
madness
,
if
not
this
session
or
the
next
,
at
any
rate
before
a
third
year
had
commenced
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
was
a
persistent
man
,
liking
very
much
when
he
did
like
,
and
loving
very
strongly
when
he
did
love
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
many
a
tug
for
Phineas
Finn
before
he
would
allow
that
false
Westminster
Satan
to
carry
off
the
prey
as
altogether
his
own
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
only
get
Phineas
into
the
dingy
chambers
he
might
do
much
!
  
<EOS>
But
Phineas
had
now
become
so
imbued
with
the
atmosphere
of
politics
,
had
been
so
breathed
upon
by
Lady
Laura
and
Barrington
Erle
,
that
he
could
no
longer
endure
the
thought
of
any
other
life
than
that
of
a
life
spent
among
the
lobbies
.
<EOS>
A
desire
to
help
to
beat
the
Conservatives
had
fastened
on
his
very
soul
,
and
almost
made
Mr.
Low
odious
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
of
Mr.
Low
,
and
for
the
nonce
would
not
go
to
him
any
more
;
 
but
he
must
see
the
porter
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
he
must
write
a
line
to
Mr.
Low
,
and
he
must
tell
Mrs.
Bunce
that
for
the
present
he
would
still
keep
on
her
rooms
.
<EOS>
His
letter
to
Mr.
Low
was
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
May
,

.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
LOW
,
  
I
have
made
up
my
mind
against
taking
the
chambers
,
and
am
now
off
to
the
Inn
to
say
that
I
shall
not
want
them
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
know
what
you
will
think
of
me
,
and
it
is
very
grievous
to
me
to
have
to
bear
the
hard
judgment
of
a
man
whose
opinion
I
value
so
highly
;
but
,
in
the
teeth
of
your
terribly
strong
arguments
,
I
think
that
there
is
something
to
be
said
on
my
side
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
This
seat
in
Parliament
has
come
in
my
way
by
chance
,
and
I
think
it
would
be
pusillanimous
in
me
to
reject
it
,
feeling
,
as
I
do
,
that
a
seat
in
Parliament
confers
very
great
honour
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
too
,
very
fond
of
politics
,
and
regard
legislation
as
the
finest
profession
going
.
<EOS>
Had
I
any
one
dependent
on
me
,
I
probably
might
not
be
justified
in
following
the
bent
of
my
inclination
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
all
alone
in
the
world
,
and
therefore
have
a
right
to
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
If
,
after
a
trial
of
one
or
two
sessions
,
I
should
fail
in
that
which
I
am
attempting
,
it
will
not
even
then
be
too
late
to
go
back
to
the
better
way
.
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
that
at
any
rate
it
is
not
my
intention
to
be
idle
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
how
you
will
fret
and
fume
over
what
I
say
,
and
how
utterly
I
shall
fail
in
bringing
you
round
to
my
way
of
thinking
;
but
as
I
must
write
to
tell
you
of
my
decision
,
I
can
not
refrain
from
defending
myself
to
the
best
of
my
ability
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
always
faithfully
,
  
PHINEAS
FINN
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
received
this
letter
at
his
chambers
,
and
when
he
had
read
it
,
he
simply
pressed
his
lips
closely
together
,
placed
the
sheet
of
paper
back
in
its
envelope
,
and
put
it
into
a
drawer
at
his
left
hand
.
<EOS>
Having
done
this
,
he
went
on
with
what
work
he
had
before
him
,
as
though
his
friend
's
decision
were
a
matter
of
no
consequence
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
thing
was
done
,
and
there
should
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
So
he
told
himself
;
but
nevertheless
his
mind
was
full
of
it
all
day
;
and
,
though
he
wrote
not
a
word
of
answer
to
Phineas
,
he
made
a
reply
within
his
own
mind
to
every
one
of
the
arguments
used
in
the
letter
.
"
<EOS>
Great
honour
!
<EOS>
How
can
there
be
honour
in
what
comes
,
as
he
says
,
by
chance
?
<EOS>
He
has
n't
sense
enough
to
understand
that
the
honour
comes
from
the
mode
of
winning
it
,
and
from
the
mode
of
wearing
it
;
and
that
the
very
fact
of
his
being
member
for
Loughshane
at
this
instant
simply
proves
that
Loughshane
should
have
had
no
privilege
to
return
a
member
!
<EOS>
No
one
dependent
on
him
!
<EOS>
Are
not
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
sisters
dependent
on
him
as
long
as
he
must
eat
their
bread
till
he
can
earn
bread
of
his
own
?
<EOS>
He
will
never
earn
bread
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
will
always
be
eating
bread
that
others
have
earned
.
<EOS>
"
In
this
way
,
before
the
day
was
over
,
Mr.
Low
became
very
angry
,
and
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
But
yet
he
found
himself
creating
plans
for
encountering
and
conquering
the
parliamentary
fiend
who
was
at
present
so
cruelly
potent
with
his
pupil
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
the
third
evening
that
he
told
his
wife
that
Finn
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
take
chambers
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
would
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
him
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
,
savagely
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
present
I
can
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
neither
now
nor
ever
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
,
with
great
emphasis
;
"
he
has
been
false
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
,
who
was
a
man
thoroughly
and
thoughtfully
just
at
all
points
;
"
he
has
not
been
false
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
always
meant
what
he
has
said
,
when
he
was
saying
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
weak
and
blind
,
and
flies
like
a
moth
to
the
candle
;
one
pities
the
poor
moth
,
and
would
save
him
a
stump
of
his
wing
if
it
be
possible
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
when
he
had
written
his
letter
to
Mr.
Low
,
started
off
for
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
making
his
way
through
the
well
-
known
dreary
streets
of
Soho
,
and
through
St.
Giles
's
,
to
Long
Acre
.
<EOS>
He
knew
every
corner
well
,
for
he
had
walked
the
same
road
almost
daily
for
the
last
three
years
.
<EOS>
He
had
conceived
a
liking
for
the
route
,
which
he
might
easily
have
changed
without
much
addition
to
the
distance
,
by
passing
through
Oxford
Street
and
Holborn
;
but
there
was
an
air
of
business
on
which
he
prided
himself
in
going
by
the
most
direct
passage
,
and
he
declared
to
himself
very
often
that
things
dreary
and
dingy
to
the
eye
might
be
good
in
themselves
.
<EOS>
Lincoln
's
Inn
itself
is
dingy
,
and
the
Law
Courts
therein
are
perhaps
the
meanest
in
which
Equity
ever
disclosed
herself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
's
three
rooms
in
the
Old
Square
,
each
of
them
brown
with
the
binding
of
law
books
and
with
the
dust
collected
on
law
papers
,
and
with
furniture
that
had
been
brown
always
,
and
had
become
browner
with
years
,
<EOS>
were
perhaps
as
unattractive
to
the
eye
of
a
young
pupil
as
any
rooms
which
were
ever
entered
.
<EOS>
And
the
study
of
the
Chancery
law
itself
is
not
an
alluring
pursuit
till
the
mind
has
come
to
have
some
insight
into
the
beauty
of
its
ultimate
object
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
during
his
three
years
'
course
of
reasoning
on
these
things
,
had
taught
himself
to
believe
that
things
ugly
on
the
outside
might
be
very
beautiful
within
;
and
had
therefore
come
to
prefer
crossing
Poland
Street
and
Soho
Square
,
and
so
continuing
his
travels
by
the
Seven
Dials
and
Long
Acre
.
<EOS>
His
morning
walk
was
of
a
piece
with
his
morning
studies
,
and
he
took
pleasure
in
the
gloom
of
both
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
taste
of
his
palate
had
been
already
changed
by
the
glare
of
the
lamps
in
and
about
palatial
Westminster
,
and
he
found
that
St.
Giles
's
was
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
The
ways
about
Pall
Mall
and
across
the
Park
to
Parliament
Street
,
or
to
the
Treasury
,
were
much
pleasanter
,
and
the
new
offices
in
Downing
Street
,
already
half
built
,
absorbed
all
that
interest
which
he
had
hitherto
been
able
to
take
in
the
suggested
but
uncommenced
erection
of
new
Law
Courts
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
<EOS>
As
he
made
his
way
to
the
porter
's
lodge
under
the
great
gateway
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
he
told
himself
that
he
was
glad
that
he
had
escaped
,
at
any
rate
for
a
while
,
from
a
life
so
dull
and
dreary
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
only
sit
in
chambers
at
the
Treasury
instead
of
chambers
in
that
old
court
,
how
much
pleasanter
it
would
be
!
<EOS>
After
all
,
as
regarded
that
question
of
income
,
it
might
well
be
that
the
Treasury
chambers
should
be
the
more
remunerative
,
and
the
more
quickly
remunerative
,
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
thought
,
Lady
Laura
might
be
compatible
with
the
Treasury
chambers
and
Parliament
,
but
could
not
possibly
be
made
compatible
with
Old
Square
,
Lincoln
's
Inn
.
  
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
there
came
upon
him
a
feeling
of
sorrow
when
the
old
man
at
the
lodge
seemed
to
be
rather
glad
than
otherwise
that
he
did
not
want
the
chambers
.
<EOS>
"
Then
Mr.
Green
can
have
them
,
"
said
the
porter
;
"
that
'll
be
good
news
for
Mr.
Green
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
the
gen'lemen
'll
do
for
chambers
if
things
goes
on
as
they
're
going
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Green
was
welcome
to
the
chambers
as
far
as
Phineas
was
concerned
;
but
Phineas
felt
nevertheless
a
certain
amount
of
regret
that
he
should
have
been
compelled
to
abandon
a
thing
which
was
regarded
both
by
the
porter
and
by
Mr.
Green
as
being
so
desirable
.
<EOS>
He
had
however
written
his
letter
to
Mr.
Low
,
and
made
his
promise
to
Barrington
Erle
,
and
was
bound
to
Lady
Laura
Standish
;
and
he
walked
out
through
the
old
gateway
into
Chancery
Lane
,
resolving
that
he
would
not
even
visit
Lincoln
's
Inn
again
for
a
year
.
<EOS>
There
were
certain
books
,
 
law
books
,
 
which
he
would
read
at
such
intervals
of
leisure
as
politics
might
give
him
;
but
within
the
precincts
of
the
Inns
of
Court
he
would
not
again
put
his
foot
for
twelve
months
,
let
learned
pundits
of
the
law
,
 
such
for
instance
as
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Low
<EOS>
,
 
say
what
they
might
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
told
Mrs.
Bunce
,
before
he
left
his
home
after
breakfast
,
that
he
should
for
the
present
remain
under
her
roof
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
much
gratified
,
not
simply
because
lodgings
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
are
less
readily
let
than
chambers
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
but
also
because
it
was
a
great
honour
to
her
to
have
a
member
of
Parliament
in
her
house
.
<EOS>
Members
of
Parliament
are
not
so
common
about
Oxford
Street
as
they
are
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Pall
Mall
and
St.
James
's
Square
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Bunce
,
when
he
came
home
to
his
dinner
,
did
not
join
as
heartily
as
he
should
have
done
in
his
wife
's
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunce
was
in
the
employment
of
certain
copying
law
-
stationers
in
Carey
Street
,
and
had
a
strong
belief
in
the
law
as
a
profession
;
 
but
he
had
none
whatever
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
"
And
he
's
given
up
going
into
chambers
?
"
said
Mr.
Bunce
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Given
it
up
altogether
for
the
present
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
do
n't
mean
to
have
no
clerk
?
"
said
Mr.
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
unless
it
is
for
his
Parliament
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
no
clerks
wanted
for
that
,
and
what
's
worse
,
there
ai
n't
no
fees
to
pay
'em
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is

Jane

if
you
do
n't
look
sharp
there

"
And
he
in
Parliament
,
Jacob
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
ai
n't
no
salary
for
being
in
Parliament

<EOS>
There
are
scores
of

<EOS>
Parliament
gents
ai
n't
got
so
much
as'll

their

for

And
then
if
anybody
does
trust
'em
,
there
's
no
getting
at
'em
to
make
'em
pay
as
there
is
at
other
folk

<EOS>

I
do
n't
know

our
Mr.
Phineas

ever
be

Why
should
our

be
better

anybody
else

He

always
acted
handsome

Jacob

There
was
one
time
he
could
not
pay
his
lodgings
for
wellnigh
nine
months
,
till
his
governor
come
down
with
the
money

<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
that
was
handsome

<EOS>
It
knocked
me
about
terrible

I
know

He
always
meant
honest

I
do
n't

that
I
care
much
for

runs
short
of

<EOS>
How
is
he
going
to
see
his
way
,
with
his
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
this
giving
up
of
his
profession
?
<EOS>
He
owes
us
near
a
quarter
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
paid
me
two
months
this
morning

Jacob

so
he
do
n't
owe
a
farthing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
 
so
much
the
better
for
us
.
<EOS>
I
shall
just
have
a
few
words
with
Mr.
Low
,
and
see
what
he
says
to
it
.
<EOS>
For
myself
I
do
n't
think
half
so
much
of
Parliament
folk
as
some
do
.
<EOS>
They
're
for
promising
everything
before
they
's
elected
;
but
not
one
in
twenty
of
'em
is
as
good
as
his
word
when
he
gets
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunce
was
a
copying
journeyman
,
who
spent
ten
hours
a
day
in
Carey
Street
with
a
pen
between
his
fingers
;
and
after
that
he
would
often
spend
two
or
three
hours
of
the
night
with
a
pen
between
his
fingers
in
Marlborough
Street
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
thoroughly
hard
-
working
man
,
doing
pretty
well
in
the
world
,
for
he
had
a
good
house
over
his
head
,
and
always
could
find
raiment
and
bread
for
his
wife
and
eight
children
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
was
an
unhappy
man
because
he
suffered
from
political
grievances
,
or
,
I
should
more
correctly
say
,
that
his
grievances
were
semi
-
political
and
semi
-
social
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
vote
,
not
being
himself
the
tenant
of
the
house
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
.
<EOS>
The
tenant
was
a
tailor
who
occupied
the
shop
,
whereas
Bunce
occupied
the
whole
of
the
remainder
of
the
premises
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
lodger
,
and
lodgers
were
not
as
yet
trusted
with
the
franchise
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
ideas
,
which
he
himself
admitted
to
be
very
raw
,
as
to
the
injustice
of
the
manner
in
which
he
was
paid
for
his
work
.
<EOS>
So
much
a
folio
,
without
reference
to
the
way
in
which
his
work
was
done
,
without
regard
to
the
success
of
his
work
,
with
no
questions
asked
of
himself
,
was
,
as
he
thought
,
no
proper
way
of
remunerating
a
man
for
his
labours
.
<EOS>
He
had
long
since
joined
a
Trade
Union
,
and
for
two
years
past
had
paid
a
subscription
of
a
shilling
a
week
towards
its
funds
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
be
doing
some
battle
against
his
superiors
,
and
to
be
putting
himself
in
opposition
to
his
employers
;
 
not
that
he
objected
personally
to
Messrs.
Foolscap
,
Margin
,
and
Vellum
,
who
always
made
much
of
him
as
a
useful
man
;
 
but
because
some
such
antagonism
would
be
manly
,
and
the
fighting
of
some
battle
would
be
the
right
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
If
Labour
do
n't
mean
to
go
to
the
wall
himself
,
"
Bunce
would
say
to
his
wife
,
"
Labour
must
look
alive
,
and
put
somebody
else
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
was
a
comfortable
motherly
woman
,
who
loved
her
husband
but
hated
politics
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
an
aversion
to
his
superiors
in
the
world
because
they
were
superiors
,
so
had
she
a
liking
for
them
for
the
same
reason
.
<EOS>
She
despised
people
poorer
than
herself
,
and
thought
it
a
fair
subject
for
boasting
that
her
children
always
had
meat
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
ever
so
small
a
morsel
,
she
took
care
that
they
had
it
,
in
order
that
the
boast
might
be
maintained
.
<EOS>
The
world
had
once
or
twice
been
almost
too
much
for
her
,
 
when
,
for
instance
,
her
husband
had
been
ill
;
and
again
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
for
the
last
three
months
of
that
long
period
in
which
Phineas
had
omitted
to
pay
his
bills
;
but
she
had
kept
a
fine
brave
heart
during
those
troubles
,
and
could
honestly
swear
that
the
children
always
had
a
bit
of
meat
,
though
she
herself
had
been
occasionally
without
it
for
days
together
.
<EOS>
At
such
times
she
would
be
more
than
ordinarily
meek
to
Mr.
Margin
,
and
especially
courteous
to
the
old
lady
who
lodged
in
her
first
-
floor
drawing
-
room
,
 
for
Phineas
lived
up
two
pairs
of
stairs
,
 
and
she
would
excuse
such
servility
by
declaring
that
there
was
no
knowing
how
soon
she
might
want
assistance
.
<EOS>
But
her
husband
,
in
such
emergencies
,
would
become
furious
and
quarrelsome
,
and
would
declare
that
Labour
was
going
to
the
wall
,
and
that
something
very
strong
must
be
done
at
once
.
<EOS>
That
shilling
which
Bunce
paid
weekly
to
the
Union
she
regarded
as
being
absolutely
thrown
away
,
 
as
much
so
as
though
he
cast
it
weekly
into
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
told
him
so
,
over
and
over
again
,
making
heart
-
piercing
allusions
to
the
eight
children
and
to
the
bit
of
meat
.
<EOS>
He
would
always
endeavour
to
explain
to
her
that
there
was
no
other
way
under
the
sun
for
keeping
Labour
from
being
sent
to
the
wall
;
 
but
he
would
do
so
hopelessly
and
altogether
ineffectually
,
and
she
had
come
to
regard
him
as
a
lunatic
to
the
extent
of
that
one
weekly
shilling
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
a
woman
's
instinctive
partiality
for
comeliness
in
a
man
,
and
was
very
fond
of
Phineas
Finn
because
he
was
handsome
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
was
very
proud
of
him
because
he
was
a
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
,
 
from
her
husband
,
who
had
told
her
the
fact
with
much
disgust
,
 
that
the
sons
of
Dukes
and
Earls
go
into
Parliament
,
and
she
liked
to
think
that
the
fine
young
man
to
whom
she
talked
more
or
less
every
day
should
sit
with
the
sons
of
Dukes
and
Earls
.
<EOS>
When
Phineas
had
really
brought
distress
upon
her
by
owing
her
some
thirty
or
forty
pounds
,
she
could
never
bring
herself
to
be
angry
with
him
,
 
because
he
was
handsome
and
because
he
dined
out
with
Lords
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
triumphed
greatly
over
her
husband
,
who
had
desired
to
be
severe
upon
his
aristocratic
debtor
,
when
the
money
had
all
been
paid
in
a
lump
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
he
's
any
great
catch
,
"
Bunce
had
said
,
when
the
prospect
of
their
lodger
's
departure
had
been
debated
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jacob
,
"
said
his
wife
,
"
I
do
n't
think
you
feel
it
when
you
've
got
people
respectable
about
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
only
respectable
man
I
know
<EOS>
,
"
said
Jacob
,
"
is
the
man
as
earns
his
bread
;
and
Mr.
Finn
,
as
I
take
it
,
is
a
long
way
from
that
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
returned
to
his
lodgings
before
he
went
down
to
his
club
,
and
again
told
Mrs.
Bunce
that
he
had
altogether
made
up
his
mind
about
the
chambers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
you
'll
keep
me
I
shall
stay
here
for
the
first
session
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
shall
be
only
too
proud
,
Mr.
Finn
;
and
though
it
may
n't
perhaps
be
quite
the
place
for
a
member
of
Parliament
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
I
think
it
is
quite
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
we
'll
do
our
very
best
to
make
you
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Respectable
we
are
,
I
may
say
;
and
though
Bunce
is
a
bit
rough
sometimes
 
"
  
"
Never
to
me
,
Mrs.
Bunce
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
rough
,
 
and
silly
,
too
,
with
his
radical
nonsense
,
paying
a
shilling
a
week
to
a
nasty
Union
just
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Still
he
means
well
,
and
there
ai
n't
a
man
who
works
harder
for
his
wife
and
children
;
 
that
I
will
say
of
him
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
do
talk
politics
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
I
like
a
man
to
talk
politics
,
Mrs.
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
a
gentleman
in
Parliament
of
course
it
's
proper
;
but
I
never
could
see
what
good
it
could
do
to
a
law
-
stationer
;
and
when
he
talks
of
Labour
going
to
the
wall
,
I
always
ask
him
whether
he
did
n't
get
his
wages
regular
last
Saturday
.
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
love
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
when
a
man
as
is
a
journeyman
has
took
up
politics
and
joined
a
Trade
Union
,
he
ai
n't
no
better
than
a
milestone
for
his
wife
to
take
and
talk
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
Phineas
went
down
to
the
Reform
Club
,
and
made
one
of
those
who
were
buzzing
there
in
little
crowds
and
uttering
their
prophecies
as
to
future
events
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
was
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
That
was
certain
.
<EOS>
Whether
Mr.
Mildmay
was
to
come
in
was
uncertain
.
<EOS>
That
he
would
go
to
Windsor
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
morning
was
not
to
be
doubted
;
but
it
was
thought
very
probable
that
he
might
plead
his
age
,
and
decline
to
undertake
the
responsibility
of
forming
a
Ministry
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
then
?
"
said
Phineas
to
his
friend
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
there
will
be
a
choice
out
of
three
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
Duke
,
who
is
the
most
incompetent
man
in
England
;
there
is
Monk
,
who
is
the
most
unfit
;
and
there
is
Gresham
,
who
is
the
most
unpopular
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
conceive
it
possible
to
find
a
worse
Prime
Minister
than
either
of
the
three
;
 
but
the
country
affords
no
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
which
would
Mildmay
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
of
them
,
 
one
after
the
other
,
so
as
to
make
the
embarrassment
the
greater
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
was
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
's
description
of
the
crisis
;
but
then
it
was
understood
that
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
was
given
to
romancing
.
   
<EOS>
The
News
about
Mr.
Mildmay
and
Sir
Everard
 
Fitzgibbon
and
Phineas
started
together
from
Pall
Mall
for
Portman
Square
,
 
as
both
of
them
had
promised
to
call
on
Lady
Laura
,
 
but
Fitzgibbon
turned
in
at
Brooks
's
as
they
walked
up
St.
James
's
Square
,
and
Phineas
went
on
by
himself
in
a
cab
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
belong
here
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
as
his
friend
entered
the
cab
,
and
Phineas
immediately
began
to
feel
that
he
would
have
done
nothing
till
he
could
get
into
Brooks
's
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
very
well
to
begin
by
talking
politics
at
the
Reform
Club
.
<EOS>
Such
talking
had
procured
for
him
his
seat
at
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
But
that
was
done
now
,
and
something
more
than
talking
was
wanted
for
any
further
progress
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
as
he
told
himself
,
of
political
import
was
managed
at
the
Reform
Club
.
<EOS>
No
influence
from
thence
was
ever
brought
to
bear
upon
the
adjustment
of
places
under
the
Government
,
or
upon
the
arrangement
of
cabinets
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
very
well
to
count
votes
at
the
Reform
Club
;
but
after
the
votes
had
been
counted
,
 
had
been
counted
successfully
,
 
Brooks
's
was
the
place
,
as
Phineas
believed
,
to
learn
at
the
earliest
moment
what
would
be
the
exact
result
of
the
success
.
<EOS>
He
must
get
into
Brooks
's
,
if
it
might
be
possible
for
him
.
<EOS>
Fitzgibbon
was
not
exactly
the
man
to
propose
him
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
Earl
of
Brentford
would
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
was
at
home
,
and
with
her
was
sitting
 
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
intended
to
be
triumphant
as
he
entered
Lady
Laura
's
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
there
with
the
express
purpose
of
triumphing
in
the
success
of
their
great
party
,
and
of
singing
a
pleasant
paean
in
conjunction
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
But
his
trumpet
was
put
out
of
tune
at
once
when
he
saw
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
He
said
hardly
a
word
as
he
gave
his
hand
to
Lady
Laura
,
 
and
then
afterwards
to
Mr.
Kennedy
,
who
chose
to
greet
him
with
this
show
of
cordiality
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
satisfied
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
is
that
all
?
<EOS>
I
thought
to
have
found
your
joy
quite
irrepressible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
bottle
of
soda
-
water
,
though
it
is
a
very
lively
thing
when
opened
,
wo
n't
maintain
its
vivacity
beyond
a
certain
period
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
you
have
had
your
gas
let
off
already
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
yes
;
at
any
rate
,
the
sputtering
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
Nineteen
is
very
well
,
but
the
question
is
whether
we
might
not
have
had
twenty
-
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
has
just
been
saying
that
not
a
single
available
vote
has
been
missed
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
He
has
just
come
from
Brooks
's
,
and
that
seems
to
be
what
they
say
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Mr.
Kennedy
also
was
a
member
of
Brooks
's
!
<EOS>
At
the
Reform
Club
there
certainly
had
been
an
idea
that
the
number
might
have
been
swelled
to
twenty
-
one
;
but
then
,
as
Phineas
began
to
understand
,
nothing
was
correctly
known
at
the
Reform
Club
.
<EOS>
For
an
accurate
appreciation
of
the
political
balance
of
the
day
,
you
must
go
to
Brooks
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
must
of
course
be
right
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
belong
to
Brooks
's
myself
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
only
joking
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
I
suppose
,
no
doubt
that
Lord
de
Terrier
is
out
,
and
that
is
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
probably
tendered
his
resignation
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
same
thing
,
"
said
Phineas
,
roughly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
exactly
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
Should
there
be
any
difficulty
about
Mr.
Mildmay
,
he
might
,
at
the
Queen
's
request
,
make
another
attempt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
a
majority
of
nineteen
against
him
!
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Surely
Mr.
Mildmay
is
not
the
only
man
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
Duke
,
and
there
is
Mr.
Gresham
,
 
and
there
is
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
had
at
his
tongue
's
end
all
the
lesson
that
he
had
been
able
to
learn
at
the
Reform
Club
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hardly
think
the
Duke
would
venture
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
venture
,
nothing
have
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
the
Duke
is
incompetent
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
anything
very
wonderful
is
required
in
the
way
of
genius
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
has
held
his
own
in
both
Houses
successfully
,
and
he
is
both
honest
and
popular
.
<EOS>
I
quite
agree
that
a
Prime
Minister
at
the
present
day
should
be
commonly
honest
,
and
more
than
commonly
popular
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
are
all
for
the
Duke
,
are
you
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
again
smiling
as
she
spoke
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
;
 
<EOS>
if
we
are
deserted
by
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
find
it
quite
so
easy
to
make
up
my
mind
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
Mr.
Mildmay
will
form
a
government
;
and
as
long
as
there
is
that
prospect
,
I
need
hardly
commit
myself
to
an
opinion
as
to
his
probable
successor
.
<EOS>
"
Then
the
objectionable
Mr.
Kennedy
took
his
leave
,
and
Phineas
was
left
alone
with
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
glorious
;
 
is
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
began
,
as
soon
as
he
found
the
field
to
be
open
for
himself
and
his
own
manoeuvring
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
very
young
,
and
had
not
as
yet
learned
the
manner
in
which
he
might
best
advance
his
cause
with
such
a
woman
as
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
was
telling
her
too
clearly
that
he
could
have
no
gratification
in
talking
with
her
unless
he
could
be
allowed
to
have
her
all
to
himself
.
<EOS>
That
might
be
very
well
if
Lady
Laura
were
in
love
with
him
,
but
would
hardly
be
the
way
to
reduce
her
to
that
condition
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
she
,
smiling
as
she
spoke
,
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
that
you
did
not
mean
it
,
but
you
were
uncourteous
to
my
friend
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
<EOS>
I
?
<EOS>
Was
I
?
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
I
did
n't
intend
to
be
uncourteous
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
thought
you
had
intended
it
,
of
course
I
could
not
tell
you
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
take
the
liberty
;
 
for
it
is
a
liberty
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
feel
so
anxious
that
you
should
do
nothing
to
mar
your
chances
as
a
rising
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
only
too
kind
to
me
,
 
always
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
clever
you
are
,
and
how
excellent
are
all
your
instincts
;
but
I
see
that
you
are
a
little
impetuous
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
you
will
be
angry
if
I
take
upon
myself
the
task
of
mentor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
you
could
say
would
make
me
angry
,
 
though
you
might
make
me
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
do
that
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
A
mentor
ought
to
be
very
old
,
you
know
,
and
I
am
infinitely
older
than
you
are
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
it
was
the
reverse
;
 
indeed
,
I
may
say
that
I
know
that
it
is
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
talking
of
years
.
<EOS>
Years
have
very
little
to
do
with
the
comparative
ages
of
men
and
women
.
<EOS>
A
woman
at
forty
is
quite
old
,
whereas
a
man
at
forty
is
young
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
remembering
that
he
had
put
down
Mr.
Kennedy
's
age
as
forty
in
his
own
mind
,
frowned
when
he
heard
this
,
and
walked
about
the
room
in
displeasure
.
"
<EOS>
And
therefore
,
"
continued
Lady
Laura
,
"
I
talk
to
you
as
though
I
were
a
kind
of
grandmother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
my
great
-
grandmother
if
you
will
only
be
kind
enough
to
me
to
say
what
you
really
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
then
be
so
impetuous
,
and
you
must
be
a
little
more
careful
to
be
civil
to
persons
to
whom
you
may
not
take
any
particular
fancy
.
<EOS>
Now
Mr.
Kennedy
is
a
man
who
may
be
very
useful
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
Mr.
Kennedy
to
be
of
use
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
I
call
being
impetuous
,
 
being
young
,
 
being
a
boy
.
<EOS>
Why
should
not
Mr.
Kennedy
be
of
use
to
you
as
well
as
any
one
else
?
<EOS>
You
do
not
mean
to
conquer
the
world
all
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
but
there
is
something
mean
to
me
in
the
expressed
idea
that
I
should
make
use
of
any
man
,
 
and
more
especially
of
a
man
whom
I
do
n't
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
do
you
not
like
him
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
he
is
one
of
my
Dr.
Fells
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
like
him
simply
because
he
does
not
talk
much
.
<EOS>
That
may
be
a
good
reason
why
you
should
not
make
of
him
an
intimate
companion
,
 
because
you
like
talkative
people
;
but
it
should
be
no
ground
for
dislike
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
paused
for
a
moment
before
he
answered
her
,
thinking
whether
or
not
it
would
be
well
to
ask
her
some
question
which
might
produce
from
her
a
truth
which
he
would
not
like
to
hear
.
<EOS>
Then
he
did
ask
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
do
you
like
him
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
She
too
paused
,
but
only
for
a
second
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
 
I
think
I
may
say
that
I
do
like
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
than
that
?
"
  
"
Certainly
no
more
than
that
;
 
but
that
I
think
is
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
you
would
say
if
any
one
asked
you
whether
you
liked
me
,
"
said
Phineas
,
looking
away
from
her
through
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
the
same
;
 
but
without
the
doubt
,
if
the
person
who
questioned
me
had
any
right
to
ask
the
question
.
<EOS>
There
are
not
above
one
or
two
who
could
have
such
a
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
was
wrong
,
of
course
,
to
ask
it
about
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
said
Phineas
,
looking
out
into
the
Square
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
see
you
think
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
I
was
quite
willing
to
be
asked
the
question
by
you
,
and
quite
willing
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
is
a
man
of
great
wealth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
that
have
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
moment
,
you
impetuous
Irish
boy
,
and
hear
me
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
liked
being
called
an
impetuous
Irish
boy
,
and
came
close
to
her
,
sitting
where
he
could
look
up
into
her
face
;
and
there
came
a
smile
upon
his
own
,
and
he
was
very
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
that
he
is
a
man
of
great
wealth
,
"
continued
Lady
Laura
;
"
and
as
wealth
gives
influence
,
he
is
of
great
use
,
 
politically
,
 
to
the
party
to
which
he
belongs
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
politically
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
suppose
you
care
nothing
for
politics
?
<EOS>
To
such
men
,
to
men
who
think
as
you
think
,
who
are
to
sit
on
the
same
benches
with
yourself
,
and
go
into
the
same
lobby
and
be
seen
at
the
same
club
,
it
is
your
duty
to
be
civil
both
for
your
own
sake
and
for
that
of
the
cause
.
<EOS>
It
is
for
the
hermits
of
society
to
indulge
in
personal
dislikings
,
 
for
men
who
have
never
been
active
and
never
mean
to
be
active
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
telling
Mr.
Kennedy
how
much
I
thought
of
you
,
 
as
a
good
Liberal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
came
in
and
spoilt
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
did
.
<EOS>
You
knocked
down
my
little
house
,
and
I
must
build
it
all
up
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
great
deal
of
trouble
,
 
a
great
deal
,
indeed
;
but
I
shall
take
it
.
<EOS>
I
mean
you
to
be
very
intimate
with
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
to
shoot
his
grouse
,
and
to
stalk
his
deer
,
and
to
help
to
keep
him
in
progress
as
a
liberal
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
prepared
to
admit
,
as
a
friend
,
that
he
would
go
back
without
some
such
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
;
 
I
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
that
you
do
understand
at
all
,
but
I
must
endeavour
to
make
you
do
so
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
to
be
my
political
pupil
,
you
must
at
any
rate
be
obedient
.
<EOS>
The
next
time
you
meet
Mr.
Kennedy
,
ask
him
his
opinion
instead
of
telling
him
your
own
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
in
Parliament
twelve
years
,
and
he
was
a
good
deal
older
than
you
when
he
began
.
<EOS>
"
At
this
moment
a
side
door
was
opened
,
and
the
red
-
haired
,
red
-
bearded
man
whom
Phineas
had
seen
before
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
hesitated
a
moment
,
as
though
he
were
going
to
retreat
again
,
and
then
began
to
pull
about
the
books
and
toys
which
lay
on
one
of
the
distant
tables
,
as
though
he
were
in
quest
of
some
article
.
<EOS>
And
he
would
have
retreated
had
not
Lady
Laura
called
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
,
"
she
said
,
"
let
me
introduce
you
to
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
I
do
not
think
you
have
ever
met
my
brother
,
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
Then
the
two
young
men
bowed
,
and
each
of
them
muttered
something
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
be
in
a
hurry
,
Oswald
.
<EOS>
You
have
nothing
special
to
take
you
away
.
<EOS>
Here
is
Mr.
Finn
come
to
tell
us
who
are
all
the
possible
new
Prime
Ministers
.
<EOS>
He
is
uncivil
enough
not
to
have
named
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
is
out
of
the
question
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
is
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
but
I
may
be
allowed
my
little
joke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
will
at
any
rate
be
in
the
Cabinet
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
whatever
about
politics
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
did
,
"
said
his
sister
,
 
"
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
did
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
never
shall
,
for
all
your
wishing
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
meanest
trade
going
<EOS>
I
think
,
<EOS>
and
I
'm
sure
it
's
the
most
dishonest
.
<EOS>
They
talk
of
legs
on
the
turf
,
and
of
course
there
are
legs
;
but
what
are
they
to
the
legs
in
the
House
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
are
in
Parliament
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
;
but
do
not
mind
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
Of
course
there
are
honest
men
there
,
and
no
doubt
you
are
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
indifferent
honest
,
 
as
yet
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
speaking
of
men
who
go
into
Parliament
to
look
after
Government
places
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
what
I
'm
doing
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
not
a
man
serve
the
Crown
?
<EOS>
He
has
to
work
very
hard
for
what
he
earns
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
that
the
most
of
them
work
at
all
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
mean
you
in
particular
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Finn
is
such
a
thorough
politician
that
he
will
never
forgive
you
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
will
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
I
'll
convert
him
some
day
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
come
into
the
House
,
Lady
Laura
,
I
suppose
he
'll
come
on
the
right
side
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
never
go
into
the
House
,
as
you
call
it
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
;
I
shall
be
very
happy
if
you
'll
dine
with
me
to
-
morrow
at
Moroni
's
.
<EOS>
They
give
you
a
capital
little
dinner
at
Moroni
's
,
and
they
've
the
best
Château
Yquem
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
Oblige
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
engaged
to
dine
with
one
of
the
Vice
-
Chancellors
on
the
day
named
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
before
dined
at
the
house
of
this
great
law
luminary
,
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
through
Mr.
Low
,
and
he
had
thought
a
great
deal
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Freemantle
had
sent
him
the
invitation
nearly
a
fortnight
ago
,
and
he
understood
there
was
to
be
an
elaborate
dinner
party
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
it
for
a
fact
,
but
he
was
in
hopes
of
meeting
the
expiring
Lord
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
He
considered
it
to
be
his
duty
never
to
throw
away
such
a
chance
.
<EOS>
He
would
in
all
respects
have
preferred
Mr.
Freemantle
's
dinner
in
Eaton
Place
,
dull
and
heavy
though
it
might
probably
be
,
to
the
chance
of
Lord
Chiltern
's
companions
at
Moroni
's
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
be
the
faults
of
our
hero
,
he
was
not
given
to
what
is
generally
called
dissipation
by
the
world
at
large
,
 
by
which
the
world
means
self
-
indulgence
.
<EOS>
He
cared
not
a
brass
farthing
for
Moroni
's
Château
Yquem
,
nor
for
the
wondrously
studied
repast
which
he
would
doubtless
find
prepared
for
him
at
that
celebrated
establishment
in
St.
James
's
Street
;
 
not
a
farthing
as
compared
with
the
chance
of
meeting
so
great
a
man
as
Lord
Moles
.
<EOS>
And
Lord
Chiltern
's
friends
might
probably
be
just
the
men
whom
he
would
not
desire
to
know
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Laura
's
request
overrode
everything
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
asked
him
to
oblige
her
,
and
of
course
he
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
going
to
dine
with
the
incoming
Prime
Minister
,
he
would
have
put
off
his
engagement
at
her
request
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
quick
enough
to
make
an
answer
without
hesitation
;
but
after
a
moment
's
pause
he
said
he
should
be
most
happy
to
dine
with
Lord
Chiltern
at
Moroni
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
;
7.30
sharp
,
 
<EOS>
only
I
can
tell
you
you
wo
n't
meet
any
other
members
.
<EOS>
"
Then
the
servant
announced
more
visitors
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
escaped
out
of
the
room
before
he
was
seen
by
the
new
comers
.
<EOS>
These
were
Mrs.
Bonteen
and
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
and
then
Mr.
Bonteen
,
 
and
after
them
Mr.
Ratler
,
the
Whip
,
who
was
in
a
violent
hurry
,
and
did
not
stay
there
a
moment
,
and
then
Barrington
Erle
and
young
Lord
James
Fitz
-
Howard
,
the
youngest
son
of
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
In
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
there
was
a
gathering
of
liberal
political
notabilities
in
Lady
Laura
's
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
great
pieces
of
news
by
which
they
were
all
enthralled
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
would
not
be
Prime
Minister
,
and
Sir
Everard
Powell
was
 
dead
.
<EOS>
Of
course
nothing
quite
positive
could
be
known
about
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
be
with
the
Queen
at
Windsor
on
the
morrow
at
eleven
o'clock
,
and
it
was
improbable
that
he
would
tell
his
mind
to
any
one
before
he
told
it
to
her
Majesty
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
had
engaged
"
the
Duke
,
"
 
<EOS>
so
he
was
called
by
Lord
James
,
 
to
go
down
to
Windsor
with
him
,
that
he
might
be
in
readiness
if
wanted
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
learned
that
at
home
,
"
said
Lord
James
,
who
had
just
heard
the
news
from
his
sister
,
who
had
heard
it
from
the
Duchess
.
<EOS>
Lord
James
was
delighted
with
the
importance
given
to
him
by
his
father
's
coming
journey
.
<EOS>
From
this
,
and
from
other
equally
well
-
known
circumstances
,
it
was
surmised
that
Mr.
Mildmay
would
decline
the
task
proposed
to
him
.
<EOS>
This
,
nevertheless
,
was
only
a
surmise
,
 
whereas
the
fact
with
reference
to
Sir
Everard
was
fully
substantiated
.
<EOS>
The
gout
had
flown
to
his
stomach
,
and
he
was
dead
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
 
yes
;
as
dead
as
a
herring
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
,
who
at
that
moment
,
however
,
was
not
within
hearing
of
either
of
the
ladies
present
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
rubbed
his
hands
,
and
looked
as
though
he
were
delighted
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
delighted
,
 
not
because
his
old
friend
Sir
Everard
was
dead
,
but
by
the
excitement
of
the
tragedy
.
<EOS>
"
Having
done
so
good
a
deed
in
his
last
moments
,
"

Laurence
Fitzgibbon

"
we
may
take
it
for

that
he

go

<EOS>
"
I
hope
there
will
be
no
crowner
's
quest
,
Ratler

"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
;
"
if
there
is
I
do
n't
know
how
you
'll
get
out
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
anything
in
it
so
horrible
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
If
a
fellow
dies
leading
his
regiment
we
do
n't
think
anything
of
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
's
vote
was
of
more
service
to
his
country
than
anything
that
a
colonel
or
a
captain
can
do
.
"
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
I
think
that
Mr.
Ratler
was
somewhat
in
dread
of
future
newspaper
paragraphs
,
should
it
be
found
necessary
to
summon
a
coroner
's
inquisition
to
sit
upon
poor
Sir
Everard
.
  
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
on
Lady
Laura
took
Phineas
apart
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
;
I
am
indeed
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
whether
it
's
nonsense
or
not
;
 
but
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
explain
it
all
now
,
but
I
do
so
want
you
to
know
my
brother
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
of
the
greatest
service
to
him
,
 
of
the
very
greatest
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
half
so
bad
as
people
say
he
is
.
<EOS>
In
many
ways
he
is
very
good
,
 
very
good
.
<EOS>
And
he
is
very
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
I
will
think
and
believe
no
ill
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
;
 
do
not
believe
evil
of
him
,
 
not
more
evil
than
you
see
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
anxious
,
 
so
very
anxious
to
try
to
put
him
on
his
legs
,
and
I
find
it
so
difficult
to
get
any
connecting
link
with
him
.
<EOS>
Papa
will
not
speak
with
him
,
 
because
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
friends
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
think
he
loves
me
.
<EOS>
I
saw
how
distasteful
it
was
to
you
to
go
to
him
;
 
and
probably
you
were
engaged
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
can
always
get
off
those
sort
of
things
if
there
is
an
object
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
just
so
.
<EOS>
And
the
object
was
to
oblige
me
;
 
was
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
was
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
go
now
.
<EOS>
We
are
to
hear
Daubeny
's
statement
at
four
,
and
I
would
not
miss
it
for
worlds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
you
would
go
abroad
with
my
brother
in
the
autumn
?
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
right
to
think
of
such
a
thing
;
 
have
I
?
<EOS>
At
any
rate
I
will
not
think
of
it
yet
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
 
<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
perhaps
on
Sunday
if
you
are
in
town
.

"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
walked
down
to
Westminster
with
his
mind
very
full
of
Lady
Laura
and
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
What
did
she
mean
by
her
affectionate
manner
to
himself
,
and
what
did
she
mean
by
the
continual
praises
which
she
lavished
upon
Mr.
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
Of
whom
was
she
thinking
most
,
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
or
of
him
?
<EOS>
She
had
called
herself
his
mentor
.
<EOS>
Was
the
description
of
her
feelings
towards
himself
,
as
conveyed
in
that
name
,
of
a
kind
to
be
gratifying
to
him
?
<EOS>
No
;
 
he
thought
not
.
<EOS>
But
then
might
it
not
be
within
his
power
to
change
the
nature
of
those
feelings
?
<EOS>
She
was
not
in
love
with
him
at
present
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
make
any
boast
to
himself
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
But
it
might
be
within
his
power
to
compel
her
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
The
female
mentor
might
be
softened
.
<EOS>
That
she
could
not
love
Mr.
Kennedy
,
he
thought
that
he
was
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
like
love
in
her
manner
to
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
As
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
Phineas
would
do
whatever
might
be
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
All
that
he
really
knew
of
Lord
Chiltern
was
that
he
had
gambled
and
that
he
had
drunk
.
   
<EOS>
The
New
Government
 
<EOS>
In
the
House
of
Lords
that
night
,
and
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
the
outgoing
Ministers
made
their
explanations
.
<EOS>
As
our
business
at
the
present
moment
is
with
the
Commons
,
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
their
chamber
,
and
will
do
so
the
more
willingly
because
the
upshot
of
what
was
said
in
the
two
places
was
the
same
.
<EOS>
The
outgoing
ministers
were
very
grave
,
very
self
-
laudatory
,
and
very
courteous
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
courtesy
it
may
be
declared
that
no
stranger
to
the
ways
of
the
place
could
have
understood
how
such
soft
words
could
be
spoken
by
Mr.
Daubeny
,
beaten
,
so
quickly
after
the
very
sharp
words
which
he
had
uttered
when
he
only
expected
to
be
beaten
.
<EOS>
He
announced
to
his
fellow
-
commoners
that
his
right
honourable
friend
and
colleague
Lord
de
Terrier
had
thought
it
right
to
retire
from
the
Treasury
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
,
in
constitutional
obedience
to
the
vote
of
the
Lower
House
,
had
resigned
,
and
the
Queen
had
been
graciously
pleased
to
accept
Lord
de
Terrier
's
resignation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
could
only
inform
the
House
that
her
Majesty
had
signified
her
pleasure
that
Mr.
Mildmay
should
wait
upon
her
to
-
morrow
at
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
 
so
Mr.
Daubeny
understood
,
 
would
be
with
her
Majesty
to
-
morrow
at
that
hour
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
had
found
it
to
be
his
duty
to
recommend
her
Majesty
to
send
for
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
real
import
of
Mr.
Daubeny
's
speech
.
<EOS>
That
further
portion
of
it
in
which
he
explained
with
blandest
,
most
beneficent
,
honey
-
flowing
words
that
his
party
would
have
done
everything
that
the
country
could
require
of
any
party
,
had
the
House
allowed
it
to
remain
on
the
Treasury
benches
for
a
month
or
two
,
 
and
explained
also
that
his
party
would
never
recriminate
,
would
never
return
evil
for
evil
,
would
in
no
wise
copy
the
factious
opposition
of
their
adversaries
;
that
his
party
would
now
,
as
it
ever
had
done
,
carry
itself
with
the
meekness
of
the
dove
,
and
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
,
 
all
this
,
I
say
,
was
so
generally
felt
by
gentlemen
on
both
sides
of
the
House
to
be
"
leather
and
prunella
"
that
very
little
attention
was
paid
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
great
point
was
that
Lord
de
Terrier
had
resigned
,
and
that
Mr.
Mildmay
had
been
summoned
to
Windsor
.
  
<EOS>
The
Queen
had
sent
for
Mr.
Mildmay
in
compliance
with
advice
given
to
her
by
Lord
de
Terrier
.
<EOS>
And
yet
Lord
de
Terrier
and
his
first
lieutenant
had
used
all
the
most
practised
efforts
of
their
eloquence
for
the
last
three
days
in
endeavouring
to
make
their
countrymen
believe
that
no
more
unfitting
Minister
than
Mr.
Mildmay
ever
attempted
to
hold
the
reins
of
office
!
<EOS>
Nothing
had
been
too
bad
for
them
to
say
of
Mr.
Mildmay
,
 
and
yet
,
in
the
very
first
moment
in
which
they
found
themselves
unable
to
carry
on
the
Government
themselves
,
they
advised
the
Queen
to
send
for
that
most
incompetent
and
baneful
statesman
!
<EOS>
We
who
are
conversant
with
our
own
methods
of
politics
,
see
nothing
odd
in
this
,
because
we
are
used
to
it
;
but
surely
in
the
eyes
of
strangers
our
practice
must
be
very
singular
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
like
it
in
any
other
country
,
 
nothing
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Nowhere
else
is
there
the
same
good
-
humoured
,
affectionate
,
prize
-
fighting
ferocity
in
politics
.
<EOS>
The
leaders
of
our
two
great
parties
are
to
each
other
exactly
as
are
the
two
champions
of
the
ring
who
knock
each
other
about
for
the
belt
and
for
five
hundred
pounds
a
side
once
in
every
two
years
.
<EOS>
How
they
fly
at
each
other
,
striking
as
though
each
blow
should
carry
death
if
it
were
but
possible
!
<EOS>
And
yet
there
is
no
one
whom
the
Birmingham
Bantam
respects
so
highly
as
he
does
<EOS>
Bill
Burns
the
Brighton
Bully
,
or
with
whom
he
has
so
much
delight
in
discussing
the
merits
of
a
pot
of
half
-
and
-
half
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
with
Mr.
Daubeny
and
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
In
private
life
Mr.
Daubeny
almost
adulated
his
elder
rival
,
 
and
Mr.
Mildmay
never
omitted
an
opportunity
of
taking
Mr.
Daubeny
warmly
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
so
in
the
United
States
.
<EOS>
There
the
same
political
enmity
exists
,
but
the
political
enmity
produces
private
hatred
.
<EOS>
The
leaders
of
parties
there
really
mean
what
they
say
when
they
abuse
each
other
,
and
are
in
earnest
when
they
talk
as
though
they
were
about
to
tear
each
other
limb
from
limb
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
Mr.
Daubeny
would
have
injured
a
hair
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
venerable
head
,
even
for
an
assurance
of
six
continued
months
in
office
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Daubeny
had
completed
his
statement
,
Mr.
Mildmay
simply
told
the
House
that
he
had
received
and
would
obey
her
Majesty
's
commands
.
<EOS>
The
House
would
of
course
understand
that
he
by
no
means
meant
to
aver
that
the
Queen
would
even
commission
him
to
form
a
Ministry
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
took
no
such
command
from
her
Majesty
it
would
become
his
duty
to
recommend
her
Majesty
to
impose
the
task
upon
some
other
person
.
<EOS>
Then
everything
was
said
that
had
to
be
said
,
and
members
returned
to
their
clubs
.
<EOS>
A
certain
damp
was
thrown
over
the
joy
of
some
excitable
Liberals
by
tidings
which
reached
the
House
during
Mr.
Daubeny
's
speech
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Powell
was
no
more
dead
than
was
Mr.
Daubeny
himself
.
<EOS>
Now
it
is
very
unpleasant
to
find
that
your
news
is
untrue
,
when
you
have
been
at
great
pains
to
disseminate
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
he
is
dead
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lady
Powell
assured
me
half
an
hour
ago
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
's
opponent
,
"
that
he
was
at
that
moment
a
great
deal
better
than
he
had
been
for
the
last
three
months
.
<EOS>
The
journey
down
to
the
House
did
him
a
world
of
good
.
"
<EOS>
"
Then
we
'll
have
him
down
for
every
division
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
The
political
portion
of
London
was
in
a
ferment
for
the
next
five
days
.
<EOS>
On
the
Sunday
morning
it
was
known
that
Mr.
Mildmay
had
declined
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
liberal
Government
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
and
Mr.
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
had
been
in
conference
so
often
,
and
so
long
,
that
it
may
almost
be
said
they
lived
together
in
conference
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Gresham
had
been
with
Mr.
Mildmay
,
 
and
Mr.
Monk
also
.
<EOS>
At
the
clubs
it
was
said
by
many
that
Mr.
Monk
had
been
with
Mr.
Mildmay
;
but
it
was
also
said
very
vehemently
by
others
that
no
such
interview
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
was
a
Radical
,
much
admired
by
the
people
,
sitting
in
Parliament
for
that
most
Radical
of
all
constituencies
,
the
Pottery
Hamlets
,
who
had
never
as
yet
been
in
power
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
great
question
of
the
day
whether
Mr.
Mildmay
would
or
would
not
ask
Mr.
Monk
to
join
him
;
and
it
was
said
by
those
who
habitually
think
at
every
period
of
change
that
the
time
has
now
come
in
which
the
difficulties
to
forming
a
government
will
at
last
be
found
to
be
insuperable
,
that
Mr.
Mildmay
could
not
succeed
either
with
Mr.
Monk
or
without
him
.
<EOS>
There
were
at
the
present
moment
two
sections
of
these
gentlemen
,
 
the
section
which
declared
that
Mr.
Mildmay
had
sent
for
Mr.
Monk
,
and
the
section
which
declared
that
he
had
not
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
others
,
who
perhaps
knew
better
what
they
were
saying
,
by
whom
it
was
asserted
that
the
whole
difficulty
lay
with
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
was
willing
to
serve
with
Mr.
Mildmay
,
 
with
certain
stipulations
as
to
the
special
seat
in
the
Cabinet
which
he
himself
was
to
occupy
,
and
as
to
the
introduction
of
certain
friends
of
his
own
;
but
,
 
so
said
these
gentlemen
who
were
supposed
really
to
understand
the
matter
,
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
was
not
willing
to
serve
with
the
Duke
and
with
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Now
,
everybody
who
knew
anything
knew
that
the
Duke
and
Mr.
Palliser
were
indispensable
to
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
And
a
liberal
Government
,
with
Mr.
Gresham
in
the
opposition
,
could
not
live
half
through
a
session
!
<EOS>
All
Sunday
and
Monday
these
things
were
discussed
;
and
on
the
Monday
Lord
de
Terrier
absolutely
stated
to
the
Upper
House
that
he
had
received
her
Majesty
's
commands
to
form
another
government
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
,
in
half
a
dozen
most
modest
words
,
 
in
words
hardly
audible
,
and
most
unlike
himself
,
 
made
his
statement
in
the
Lower
House
to
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Ratler
,
and
Mr.
Bonteen
,
and
Mr.
Barrington
Erle
,
and
Mr.
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
aroused
themselves
and
swore
that
such
things
could
not
be
.
<EOS>
Should
the
prey
which
they
had
won
for
themselves
,
the
spoil
of
their
bows
and
arrows
,
be
snatched
from
out
of
their
very
mouths
by
treachery
?
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
and
Mr.
Daubeny
could
not
venture
even
to
make
another
attempt
unless
they
did
so
in
combination
with
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
Such
a
combination
,
said
Mr.
Barrington
Erle
,
would
be
disgraceful
to
both
parties
,
but
would
prove
Mr.
Gresham
to
be
as
false
as
Satan
himself
.
<EOS>
Early
on
the
Tuesday
morning
,
when
it
was
known
that
Mr.
Gresham
had
been
at
Lord
de
Terrier
's
house
,
Barrington
Erle
was
free
to
confess
that
he
had
always
been
afraid
of
Mr.
Gresham
.

I
have
felt
for
years
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
if
anybody
could
break
up
the
party
it
would
be
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
that
Tuesday
morning
Mr.
Gresham
certainly
was
with
Lord
de
Terrier
,
but
nothing
came
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
was
either
not
enough
like
Satan
for
the
occasion
,
or
else
he
was
too
closely
like
him
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
did
not
bid
high
enough
,
or
else
Mr.
Gresham
did
not
like
biddings
from
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
Nothing
then
came
from
this
attempt
,
and
on
the
Tuesday
afternoon
the
Queen
again
sent
for
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
On
the
Wednesday
morning
the
gentlemen
who
thought
that
the
insuperable
difficulties
had
at
length
arrived
,
began
to
wear
their
longest
faces
,
and
to
be
triumphant
with
melancholy
forebodings
.
<EOS>
Now
at
last
there
was
a
dead
lock
.
<EOS>
Nobody
could
form
a
government
.
<EOS>
It
was
asserted
that
Mr.
Mildmay
had
fallen
at
her
Majesty
's
feet
dissolved
in
tears
,
and
had
implored
to
be
relieved
from
further
responsibility
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
known
to
many
at
the
clubs
that
the
Queen
had
on
that
morning
telegraphed
to
Germany
for
advice
.
<EOS>
There
were
men
so
gloomy
as
to
declare
that
the
Queen
must
throw
herself
into
the
arms
of
Mr.
Monk
,
unless
Mr.
Mildmay
would
consent
to
rise
from
his
knees
and
once
more
buckle
on
his
ancient
armour
.
<EOS>
"
Even
that
would
be
better
than
Gresham
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
,
in
his
anger
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
"
said
Ratler
,
"
we
shall
have
Gresham
and
Monk
together
,
and
you
and
I
shall
have
to
do
their
biddings
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Barrington
Erle
's
reply
to
that
suggestion
I
may
not
dare
to
insert
in
these
pages
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Wednesday
night
,
however
,
it
was
known
that
everything
had
been
arranged
,
and
before
the
Houses
met
on
the
Thursday
every
place
had
been
bestowed
,
either
in
reality
or
in
imagination
.
<EOS>
The
_
Times
_
,
in
its
second
edition
on
the
Thursday
,
gave
a
list
of
the
Cabinet
,
in
which
four
places
out
of
fourteen
were
rightly
filled
.
<EOS>
On
the
Friday
it
named
ten
places
aright
,
and
indicated
the
law
officers
,
with
only
one
mistake
in
reference
to
Ireland
;
and
on
the
Saturday
it
gave
a
list
of
the
Under
Secretaries
of
State
,
and
Secretaries
and
Vice
-
Presidents
generally
,
with
wonderful
correctness
as
to
the
individuals
,
though
the
offices
were
a
little
jumbled
.
<EOS>
The
Government
was
at
last
formed
in
a
manner
which
everybody
had
seen
to
be
the
only
possible
way
in
which
a
government
could
be
formed
.
<EOS>
Nobody
was
surprised
,
and
the
week
's
work
was
regarded
as
though
the
regular
routine
of
government
making
had
simply
been
followed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
was
Prime
Minister
;
Mr.
Gresham
was
at
the
Foreign
Office
;
Mr.
Monk
was
at
the
Board
of
Trade
;
the
Duke
was
President
of
the
Council
;
the
Earl
of
Brentford
was
Privy
Seal
;
and
Mr.
Palliser
was
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
made
a
step
up
in
the
world
,
and
went
to
the
Admiralty
as
Secretary
;
Mr.
Bonteen
was
sent
again
to
the
Admiralty
;
and
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
became
a
junior
Lord
of
the
Treasury
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
was
,
of
course
,
installed
as
Patronage
Secretary
to
the
same
Board
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
was
perhaps
the
only
man
in
the
party
as
to
whose
destination
there
could
not
possibly
be
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
had
really
qualified
himself
for
a
position
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
all
men
feel
that
he
would
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
be
called
upon
to
fill
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
as
much
could
be
said
on
behalf
of
any
other
man
in
the
new
Government
.
  
<EOS>
During
all
this
excitement
,
and
through
all
these
movements
,
Phineas
Finn
felt
himself
to
be
left
more
and
more
out
in
the
cold
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
such
a
fool
as
to
suppose
that
any
office
would
be
offered
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
hinted
at
such
a
thing
to
his
one
dearly
intimate
friend
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
hitherto
opened
his
mouth
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
the
new
Government
was
formed
he
had
not
been
sitting
for
above
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
Of
course
nothing
could
be
done
for
him
as
yet
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
he
felt
himself
to
be
out
in
the
cold
.
<EOS>
The
very
men
who
had
discussed
with
him
the
question
of
the
division
,
 
who
had
discussed
it
with
him
because
his
vote
was
then
as
good
as
that
of
any
other
member
,
 
did
not
care
to
talk
to
him
about
the
distribution
of
places
.
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
could
not
be
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
,
at
any
rate
,
could
not
be
a
rival
.
<EOS>
He
could
neither
mar
nor
assist
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
be
either
a
successful
or
a
disappointed
sympathiser
,
 
because
he
could
not
himself
be
a
candidate
.
<EOS>
The
affair
which
perhaps
disgusted
him
more
than
anything
else
was
the
offer
of
an
office
,
 
not
in
the
Cabinet
,
indeed
,
but
one
supposed
to
confer
high
dignity
,
 
to
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
refused
the
offer
,
and
this
somewhat
lessened
Finn
's
disgust
,
but
the
offer
itself
made
him
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
was
made
simply
because
of
his
money
,
"
he
said
to
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
that
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
People
seem
to
think
that
he
has
got
a
head
on
his
shoulders
,
though
he
has
got
no
tongue
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
at
his
refusing
it
because
of
the
Right
Honourable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
that
Mr.
Kennedy
refused
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
?
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
the
Right
Hon
.
<EOS>
Robert
Kennedy
for
ever
and
ever
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
when
he
said
this
did
not
as
yet
know
exactly
how
it
would
have
come
to
pass
that
such
honour
,
 
the
honour
of
the
enduring
prefix
to
his
name
,
 
would
have
come
in
the
way
of
Mr.
Kennedy
<EOS>
had
Mr.
Kennedy
accepted
the
office
in
question
;
but
he
was
very
quick
to
learn
all
these
things
,
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
he
rarely
made
any
mistake
about
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
that
have
been
to
him
,
 
with
his
wealth
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
a
position
of
his
own
and
need
not
care
for
such
things
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
should
not
attempt
what
is
called
independence
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
By
doing
so
they
simply
decline
to
make
themselves
useful
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
a
few
whose
special
walk
in
life
it
is
to
be
independent
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
unmoved
by
parties
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Great
Akinetoses
!
<EOS>
You
know
Orion
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
is
not
an
Akinetos
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
holds
a
very
proud
position
,
"
said
Phineas
,
ironically
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
proud
position
indeed
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
in
sober
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
The
dinner
at
Moroni
's
had
been
eaten
,
and
Phineas
had
given
an
account
of
the
entertainment
to
Lord
Chiltern
's
sister
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
only
two
other
guests
,
and
both
of
them
had
been
men
on
the
turf
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
the
first
there
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
he
surprised
me
ever
so
much
by
telling
me
that
you
had
spoken
to
him
of
me
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
did
so
.
<EOS>
I
wish
him
to
know
you
.
<EOS>
I
want
him
to
know
some
men
who
think
of
something
besides
horses
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
well
educated
,
you
know
,
and
would
certainly
have
taken
honours
if
he
had
not
quarrelled
with
the
people
at
Christ
Church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
take
a
degree
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
they
sent
him
down
.
<EOS>
It
is
best
always
to
have
the
truth
among
friends
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
hear
it
some
day
.
<EOS>
They
expelled
him
because
he
was
drunk
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Laura
burst
out
into
tears
,
and
Phineas
sat
near
her
,
and
consoled
her
,
and
swore
that
if
in
any
way
he
could
befriend
her
brother
he
would
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
at
this
time
claimed
a
promise
which
he
said
that
Phineas
had
made
to
him
,
 
that
Phineas
would
go
over
with
him
to
Mayo
to
assist
at
his
re
-
election
.
<EOS>
And
Phineas
did
go
.
<EOS>
The
whole
affair
occupied
but
a
week
,
and
was
chiefly
memorable
as
being
the
means
of
cementing
the
friendship
which
existed
between
the
two
Irish
members
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
a
year
!
"
said
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
speaking
of
the
salary
of
his
office
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
much
;
is
it
?
<EOS>
And
every
fellow
to
whom
I
owe
a
shilling
will
be
down
upon
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
studied
my
own
comfort
,
I
should
have
done
the
same
as
Kennedy
.

It
was
now
the
middle
of
May
,
and
a
month
had
elapsed
since
the
terrible
difficulty
about
the
Queen
's
Government
had
been
solved
.
<EOS>
A
month
had
elapsed
,
and
things
had
shaken
themselves
into
their
places
with
more
of
ease
and
apparent
fitness
than
men
had
given
them
credit
for
possessing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
Mr.
Monk
were
the
best
friends
in
the
world
,
swearing
by
each
other
in
their
own
house
,
and
supported
in
the
other
by
as
gallant
a
phalanx
of
Whig
peers
as
ever
were
got
together
to
fight
against
the
instincts
of
their
own
order
in
compliance
with
the
instincts
of
those
below
them
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
's
father
was
in
the
Cabinet
,
to
Lady
Laura
's
infinite
delight
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
ambition
to
be
brought
as
near
to
political
action
as
was
possible
for
a
woman
without
surrendering
any
of
the
privileges
of
feminine
inaction
.
<EOS>
That
women
should
even
wish
to
have
votes
at
parliamentary
elections
was
to
her
abominable
,
and
the
cause
of
the
Rights
of
Women
generally
was
odious
to
her
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
for
herself
,
she
delighted
in
hoping
that
she
too
might
be
useful
,
 
in
thinking
that
she
too
was
perhaps
,
in
some
degree
,
politically
powerful
;
and
she
had
received
considerable
increase
to
such
hopes
when
her
father
accepted
the
Privy
Seal
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
himself
was
not
an
ambitious
man
,
and
,
but
for
his
daughter
,
would
have
severed
himself
altogether
from
political
life
before
this
time
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
unhappy
man
;
 
being
an
obstinate
man
,
and
having
in
his
obstinacy
quarrelled
with
his
only
son
.
<EOS>
In
his
unhappiness
he
would
have
kept
himself
alone
,
living
in
the
country
,
brooding
over
his
wretchedness
,
were
it
not
for
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
On
her
behalf
,
and
in
obedience
to
her
requirements
,
he
came
yearly
up
to
London
,
and
,
perhaps
in
compliance
with
her
persuasion
,
had
taken
some
part
in
the
debates
of
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
It
is
easy
for
a
peer
to
be
a
statesman
,
if
the
trouble
of
the
life
be
not
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
was
now
a
statesman
,
if
a
seat
in
the
Cabinet
be
proof
of
statesmanship
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
time
,
in
May
,
there
was
staying
with
Lady
Laura
in
Portman
Square
a
very
dear
friend
of
hers
,
by
name
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
was
an
orphan
,
an
heiress
,
and
a
beauty
;
with
a
terrible
aunt
,
one
Lady
Baldock
,
who
was
supposed
to
be
the
dragon
who
had
Violet
,
as
a
captive
maiden
,
in
charge
.
<EOS>
But
as
Miss
Effingham
was
of
age
,
and
was
mistress
of
her
own
fortune
,
Lady
Baldock
was
,
in
truth
,
not
omnipotent
as
a
dragon
should
be
.
<EOS>
The
dragon
,
at
any
rate
,
was
not
now
staying
in
Portman
Square
,
and
the
captivity
of
the
maiden
was
therefore
not
severe
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
was
very
pretty
,
but
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
beautiful
.
<EOS>
She
was
small
,
with
light
crispy
hair
,
which
seemed
to
be
ever
on
the
flutter
round
her
brows
,
and
which
yet
was
never
a
hair
astray
.
<EOS>
She
had
sweet
,
soft
grey
eyes
,
which
never
looked
at
you
long
,
hardly
for
a
moment
,
 
but
which
yet
,
in
that
half
moment
,
nearly
killed
you
by
the
power
of
their
sweetness
.
<EOS>
Her
cheek
was
the
softest
thing
in
nature
,
and
the
colour
of
it
,
when
its
colour
was
fixed
enough
to
be
told
,
was
a
shade
of
pink
so
faint
and
creamy
that
you
would
hardly
dare
to
call
it
by
its
name
.
<EOS>
Her
mouth
was
perfect
,
not
small
enough
to
give
that
expression
of
silliness
which
is
so
common
,
but
almost
divine
,
with
the
temptation
of
its
full
,
rich
,
ruby
lips
.
<EOS>
Her
teeth
,
which
she
but
seldom
showed
,
were
very
even
and
very
white
,
and
there
rested
on
her
chin
the
dearest
dimple
that
ever
acted
as
a
loadstar
to
mens
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
fault
of
her
face
,
if
it
had
a
fault
,
was
in
her
nose
,
 
which
was
a
little
too
sharp
,
and
perhaps
too
small
.
<EOS>
A
woman
who
wanted
to
depreciate
Violet
Effingham
had
once
called
her
a
pug
-
nosed
puppet
;
but
I
,
as
her
chronicler
,
deny
that
she
was
pug
-
nosed
,
 
and
<EOS>
all
the
world
who
knew
her
soon
came
to
understand
that
she
was
no
puppet
.
<EOS>
In
figure
she
was
small
,
but
not
so
small
as
she
looked
to
be
.
<EOS>
Her
feet
and
hands
were
delicately
fine
,
and
there
was
a
softness
about
her
whole
person
,
an
apparent
compressibility
,
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
she
might
go
into
very
small
compass
.
<EOS>
Into
what
compass
and
<EOS>
how
compressed
,
there
were
very
many
men
who
held
very
different
opinions
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
was
certainly
no
puppet
.
<EOS>
She
was
great
at
dancing
,
 
as
perhaps
might
be
a
puppet
,
 
<EOS>
but
she
was
great
also
at
archery
,
great
at
skating
,
 
and
great
,
too
,
at
hunting
.
<EOS>
With
reference
to
that
last
accomplishment
,
she
and
Lady
Baldock
had
had
more
than
one
terrible
tussle
,
not
always
with
advantage
to
the
dragon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
aunt
,
"
she
had
said
once
during
the
last
winter
,
"
I
am
going
to
the
meet
with
George
,
"
 
George
was
her
cousin
,
Lord
Baldock
,
and
was
the
dragon
's
son
,
 
"
and
there
,
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
promise
me
that
you
will
not
go
further
,
"
said
the
dragon
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
promise
nothing
to
-
day
to
any
man
or
to
any
woman
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
said
to
a
young
lady
who
spoke
in
this
way
,
and
who
had
become
of
age
only
a
fortnight
since
?
<EOS>
She
rode
that
day
the
famous
run
from
Bagnall
's
Gorse
to
Foulsham
Common
,
and
was
in
at
the
death
.
  
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
was
now
sitting
in
conference
with
her
friend
Lady
Laura
,
and
they
were
discussing
matters
of
high
import
,
 
of
very
high
import
,
indeed
,
 
to
the
interests
of
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
ask
you
to
accept
him
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
lucky
,
"
said
the
other
,
"
as
he
has
never
asked
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
done
much
the
same
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
he
loves
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
 
or
fancy
that
I
know
,
 
that
so
many
men
love
me
!
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
what
sort
of
love
is
it
?
<EOS>
It
is
just
as
when
you
and
I
,
when
we
see
something
nice
in
a
shop
,
call
it
a
dear
duck
of
a
thing
,
and
tell
somebody
to
go
and
buy
it
,
let
the
price
be
ever
so
extravagant
.
<EOS>
I
know
my
own
position
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
dear
duck
of
a
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
dear
thing
to
Oswald
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
,
Laura
,
will
some
day
inspire
a
grand
passion
,
 
or
I
daresay
<EOS>
have
already
,
for
you
are
a
great
deal
too
close
to
tell
;
 
and
then
there
will
be
cutting
of
throats
,
and
a
mighty
hubbub
,
and
a
real
tragedy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
go
beyond
genteel
comedy
,
 
unless
I
run
away
with
somebody
beneath
me
,
or
do
something
awfully
improper
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
do
that
,
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
,
because
of
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
I
should
indeed
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
possible
,
without
compromising
myself
,
I
should
like
her
to
be
told
some
morning
that
I
had
gone
off
with
the
curate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
be
so
wicked
,
Violet
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
serve
her
right
,
and
her
countenance
would
be
so
awfully
comic
.
<EOS>
Mind
,
if
it
is
ever
to
come
off
,
I
must
be
there
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
she
would
say
as
well
as
possible
.
<EOS>
She
would
turn
to
poor
Gussy
.
<EOS>
"
Augusta
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
I
always
expected
it
.
<EOS>
I
always
did
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
should
come
out
and
curtsey
to
her
,
and
say
so
prettily
,
"
Dear
aunt
,
it
was
only
our
little
joke
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
line
.
<EOS>
But
for
you
,
 
you
,
if
you
planned
it
,
would
go
off
to
-
morrow
with
Lucifer
himself
if
you
liked
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
failing
Lucifer
,
I
shall
probably
be
very
humdrum
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
there
is
anything
settled
,
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
settled
,
 
or
any
beginning
of
anything
that
ever
can
be
settled
,
But
I
am
not
talking
about
myself
.
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
that
if
you
will
accept
him
,
he
will
do
anything
that
you
and
I
may
ask
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
he
will
promise
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
know
him
to
break
his
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
him
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
How
should
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
pretend
to
be
ignorant
and
meek
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
You
do
know
him
,
 
much
better
than
most
girls
know
the
men
they
marry
.
<EOS>
You
have
known
him
,
more
or
less
intimately
,
all
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
am
I
bound
to
marry
him
because
of
that
accident
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
are
not
bound
to
marry
him
,
 
unless
you
love
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
love
him
,
"
said
Violet
,
with
slow
,
emphatic
words
,
and
a
little
forward
motion
of
her
face
,
as
though
she
were
specially
eager
to
convince
her
friend
that
she
was
quite
in
earnest
in
what
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
,
Violet
,
that
you
are
nearer
to
loving
him
than
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
near
to
loving
any
man
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
I
ever
shall
be
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
possible
to
myself
to
be
what
girls
call
in
love
.
<EOS>
I
can
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
I
do
like
,
perhaps
,
half
a
dozen
.
<EOS>
I
like
them
so
much
that
if
I
go
to
a
house
or
to
a
party
it
is
quite
a
matter
of
importance
to
me
whether
this
man
or
that
will
or
will
not
be
there
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
suppose
I
flirt
with
them
.
<EOS>
At
least
Augusta
tells
me
that
my
aunt
says
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
caring
about
any
one
of
them
in
the
way
of
loving
him
,
 
wanting
to
marry
him
,
and
have
him
all
to
myself
,
and
that
sort
of
thing
,
 
I
do
n't
know
what
it
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
intend
to
be
married
some
day
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
do
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
n't
intend
to
wait
very
much
longer
.
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
tired
of
Lady
Baldock
,
and
though
I
can
generally
escape
among
my
friends
,
that
is
not
sufficient
.
<EOS>
I
am
beginning
to
think
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
a
house
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
A
girl
becomes
such
a
Bohemian
when
she
is
always
going
about
,
and
does
n't
quite
know
where
any
of
her
things
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
silence
between
them
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
was
doubled
up
in
a
corner
of
a
sofa
,
with
her
feet
tucked
under
her
,
and
her
face
reclining
upon
one
of
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
And
as
she
talked
she
was
playing
with
a
little
toy
which
was
constructed
to
take
various
shapes
as
it
was
flung
this
way
or
that
.
<EOS>
A
bystander
looking
at
her
would
have
thought
that
the
toy
was
much
more
to
her
than
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
was
sitting
upright
,
in
a
common
chair
,
at
a
table
not
far
from
her
companion
,
and
was
manifestly
devoting
herself
altogether
to
the
subject
that
was
being
discussed
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
no
lounging
,
easy
attitude
,
she
had
found
no
employment
for
her
fingers
,
and
she
looked
steadily
at
Violet
as
she
talked
,
 
whereas
Violet
was
looking
only
at
the
little
manikin
which
she
tossed
.
<EOS>
And
now
Laura
got
up
and
came
to
the
sofa
,
and
sat
close
to
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Violet
,
though
she
somewhat
moved
one
foot
,
so
as
to
seem
to
make
room
for
the
other
,
still
went
on
with
her
play
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
marry
,
Violet
,
you
must
choose
some
one
man
out
of
the
lot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
quite
true
,
my
dear
,
I
certainly
ca
n't
marry
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
do
you
mean
to
make
the
choice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
shall
toss
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
be
in
earnest
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
I
will
be
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
the
first
that
comes
after
I
have
quite
made
up
my
mind
.
<EOS>
You
'll
think
it
very
horrible
,
but
that
is
really
what
I
shall
do
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
a
husband
is
very
much
like
a
house
or
a
horse
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
take
your
house
because
it
's
the
best
house
in
the
world
,
but
because
just
then
you
want
a
house
.
<EOS>
You
go
and
see
a
house
,
and
if
it
's
very
nasty
<EOS>
you
do
n't
take
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
think
it
will
suit
pretty
well
,
and
if
you
are
tired
of
looking
about
for
houses
,
you
do
take
it
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
way
one
buys
one
's
horses
,
 
and
one
's
husbands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
not
made
up
your
mind
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
quite
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
was
a
little
more
decent
than
usual
just
before
I
left
Baddingham
.
<EOS>
When
I
told
her
that
I
meant
to
have
a
pair
of
ponies
,
she
merely
threw
up
her
hands
and
grunted
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
gnash
her
teeth
,
and
curse
and
swear
,
and
declare
to
me
that
I
was
a
child
of
perdition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
cursing
and
swearing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
told
me
once
that
if
I
bought
a
certain
little
dog
,
it
would
lead
to
my
being
everlastingly
 
<EOS>
you
know
what
.
<EOS>
She
is
n't
so
squeamish
as
I
am
,
and
said
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
bought
the
little
dog
,
and
it
bit
my
aunt
's
heel
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
sorry
then
,
and
gave
the
creature
to
Mary
Rivers
.
<EOS>
He
was
such
a
beauty
!
<EOS>
I
hope
the
perdition
has
gone
with
him
,
for
I
do
n't
like
Mary
Rivers
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
give
the
poor
beasty
to
somebody
,
and
Mary
Rivers
happened
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
Puck
was
connected
with
Apollyon
,
but
she
did
n't
mind
that
.
<EOS>
Puck
was
worth
twenty
guineas
,
and
I
daresay
she
has
sold
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
may
have
an
equal
chance
then
among
the
other
favourites
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
after
another
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
no
favourites
,
and
I
will
not
say
that
any
man
may
have
a
chance
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
press
me
about
your
brother
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
I
am
so
anxious
.
<EOS>
Because
it
would
save
him
.
<EOS>
Because
you
are
the
only
woman
for
whom
he
has
ever
cared
,
and
because
he
loves
you
with
all
his
heart
;
and
because
his
father
would
be
reconciled
to
him
to
-
morrow
if
he
heard
that
you
and
he
were
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Laura
,
my
dear
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
angry
if
I
speak
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
After
what
I
have
said
,
you
have
a
right
to
speak
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
that
all
your
reasons
are
reasons
why
he
should
marry
me
;
 
<EOS>
not
reasons
why
I
should
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
not
his
love
for
you
a
reason
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Violet
,
pausing
,
 
and
speaking
the
word
in
the
lowest
possible
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
did
not
love
me
,
that
,
if
known
to
me
,
should
be
a
reason
why
I
should
not
marry
him
.
<EOS>
Ten
men
may
love
me
,
 
I
do
n't
say
that
any
man
does
 
"
  
"
He
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
marry
all
the
ten
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
that
business
of
saving
him
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
know
what
I
mean
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
any
special
mission
for
saving
young
men
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
think
that
I
shall
have
quite
enough
to
do
to
save
myself
.
<EOS>
It
is
strange
what
a
propensity
<EOS>
I
feel
for
the
wrong
side
of
the
post
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
the
strongest
assurance
that
you
will
always
keep
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
try
,
but
I
'm
quite
sure
that
the
jockey
who
takes
me
in
hand
ought
to
be
very
steady
himself
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Lord
Chiltern
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
out
with
it
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
to
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
not
bear
the
best
reputation
in
this
world
as
a
steady
man
.
<EOS>
Is
he
altogether
the
sort
of
man
that
mammas
of
the
best
kind
are
seeking
for
their
daughters
?
<EOS>
I
like
a
roué
myself
;
 
and
a
prig
who
sits
all
night
in
the
House
,
and
talks
about
nothing
but
church
-
rates
and
suffrage
<EOS>

is
to
me
intolerable
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
men
who
are
improper
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
a
man
myself
I
should
go
in
for
everything
I
ought
to
leave
alone
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
should
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
,
 
I
'm
not
a
man
,
and
I
must
take
care
of
myself
.
<EOS>
The
wrong
side
of
a
post
for
a
woman
is
so
very
much
the
wrong
side
.
<EOS>
I
like
a
fast
man
,
but
I
know
that
I
must
not
dare
to
marry
the
sort
of
man
that
I
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
one
of
us
<EOS>
,
then
,
 
the
very
first
among
us
;
 
would
that
be
the
wrong
side
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
to
be
Lady
Chiltern
in
the
present
tense
,
and
Lady
Brentford
in
the
future
,
would
be
promotion
for
Violet
Effingham
in
the
past
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
hard
you
are
,
Violet
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fancy
,
 
that
it
should
come
to
this
,
 
that
you
should
call
me
hard
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
be
your
sister
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
well
enough
to
be
your
father
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
well
enough
to
be
Chiltern
's
friend
.
<EOS>
I
am
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Nothing
that
any
one
has
ever
said
of
him
has
estranged
me
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
fought
for
him
till
I
have
been
black
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
have
,
 
with
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
afraid
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
The
risk
would
be
so
great
.
<EOS>
Suppose
that
I
did
not
save
him
,
but
that
he
brought
me
to
shipwreck
instead
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
could
not
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
it
not
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
might
be
so
very
well
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
a
child
they
used
to
be
always
telling
me
to
mind
myself
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
a
child
and
a
man
need
not
mind
themselves
.
<EOS>
Let
them
do
what
they
may
,
they
can
be
set
right
again
.
<EOS>
Let
them
fall
as
they
will
,
you
can
put
them
on
their
feet
.
<EOS>
But
a
woman
has
to
mind
herself
;
 
and
very
hard
work
<EOS>
it
is
when
she
has
a
dragon
of
her
own
driving
her
ever
the
wrong
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
take
you
from
the
dragon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
and
to
hand
me
over
to
a
griffin
.
"
  
"
The
truth
is
,
Violet
,
that
you
do
not
know
Oswald
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
a
griffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
to
be
uncomplimentary
.
<EOS>
Take
any
of
the
dangerous
wild
beasts
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
merely
intend
to
point
out
that
he
is
a
dangerous
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
he
is
noble
-
minded
,
and
I
will
call
him
a
lion
if
you
like
it
better
.
<EOS>
But
even
with
a
lion
there
is
risk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
there
will
be
risk
.
<EOS>
There
is
risk
with
every
man
,
 
unless
you
will
be
contented
with
the
prig
you
described
.
<EOS>
Of
course
there
would
be
risk
with
my
brother
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
a
gambler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
he
is
one
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
given
it
up
in
part
,
and
would
entirely
at
your
instance
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
they
say
other
things
of
him
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
paroxysms
of
evil
life
which
have
well
-
nigh
ruined
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
these
paroxysms
are
so
dangerous
!
<EOS>
Is
he
not
in
debt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
 
but
not
deeply
.
<EOS>
Every
shilling
that
he
owes
would
be
paid
;
 
every
shilling
.
<EOS>
Mind
,
I
know
all
his
circumstances
,
and
I
give
you
my
word
that
every
shilling
should
be
paid
.
<EOS>
He
has
never
lied
,
 
and
he
has
told
me
everything
.
<EOS>
His
father
could
not
leave
an
acre
away
from
him
if
he
would
,
and
would
not
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
ask
as
fearing
that
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
only
of
a
dangerous
habit
.
<EOS>
A
paroxysm
of
spending
money
is
apt
to
make
one
so
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
And
then
 
"
  
"
Well
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
make
a
catalogue
of
your
brother
's
weaknesses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
to
say
that
he
drinks
too
much
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
People
say
so
.
<EOS>
The
dragon
says
so
.
<EOS>
And
as
I
always
find
her
sayings
to
be
untrue
,
I
suppose
this
is
like
the
rest
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
untrue
if
it
be
said
of
him
as
a
habit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
another
paroxysm
,
 
just
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
laugh
at
me
,
Violet
,
when
I
am
taking
his
part
,
or
I
shall
be
offended
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
see
,
if
I
am
to
be
his
wife
,
it
is
 
rather
important
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Still
you
need
not
ridicule
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Laura
,
you
know
I
do
not
ridicule
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
love
you
for
what
you
are
doing
.
<EOS>
Would
not
I
do
the
same
,
and
fight
for
him
down
to
my
nails
if
I
had
a
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
I
want
you
to
be
Oswald
's
wife
;
 
because
I
know
that
you
would
fight
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
true
that
he
is
a
 
drunkard
.
<EOS>
Look
at
his
hand
,
which
is
as
steady
as
yours
.
<EOS>
Look
at
his
eye
.
<EOS>
Is
there
a
sign
of
it
?
<EOS>
He
has
been
drunk
,
once
or
twice
,
perhaps
,
 
and
has
done
fearful
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
might
be
that
he
would
do
fearful
things
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
knew
a
man
with
a
softer
heart
or
with
a
finer
spirit
.
<EOS>
I
believe
as
I
sit
here
that
if
he
were
married
to
-
morrow
,
his
vices
would
fall
from
him
like
old
clothes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
admit
,
Laura
,
that
there
will
be
some
risk
for
the
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
there
will
be
a
risk
.
<EOS>
Is
there
not
always
a
risk
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
men
in
the
city
would
call
this
double
-
dangerous
,
I
think
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
Then
the
door
was
opened
,
and
the
man
of
whom
they
were
speaking
entered
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
 
<EOS>
The
reader
has
been
told
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
a
red
man
,
and
that
peculiarity
of
his
personal
appearance
was
certainly
the
first
to
strike
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
It
imparted
a
certain
look
of
ferocity
to
him
,
which
was
apt
to
make
men
afraid
of
him
at
first
sight
.
<EOS>
Women
are
not
actuated
in
the
same
way
,
and
are
accustomed
to
look
deeper
into
men
at
the
first
sight
than
other
men
will
trouble
themselves
to
do
.
<EOS>
His
beard
was
red
,
and
was
clipped
,
so
as
to
have
none
of
the
softness
of
waving
hair
.
<EOS>
The
hair
on
his
head
also
was
kept
short
,
and
was
very
red
,
 
and
the
colour
of
his
face
was
red
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
was
a
handsome
man
,
with
well
-
cut
features
,
not
tall
,
but
very
strongly
built
,
and
with
a
certain
curl
in
the
corner
of
his
eyelids
which
gave
to
him
a
look
of
resolution
,
 
which
perhaps
he
did
not
possess
.
<EOS>
He
was
known
to
be
a
clever
man
,
and
when
very
young
had
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
scholar
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
three
-
and
-
twenty
grey
-
haired
votaries
of
the
turf
declared
that
he
would
make
his
fortune
on
the
race
-
course
,
 
so
clear
-
headed
was
he
as
to
odds
,
so
excellent
a
judge
of
a
horse
's
performances
,
and
so
gifted
with
a
memory
of
events
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
five
-
and
-
twenty
<EOS>
he
had
lost
every
shilling
of
a
fortune
of
his
own
,
had
squeezed
from
his
father
more
than
his
father
ever
chose
to
name
in
speaking
of
his
affairs
to
any
one
,
and
was
known
to
be
in
debt
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
sacrificed
himself
on
one
or
two
memorable
occasions
in
conformity
with
turf
laws
of
honour
,
and
men
said
of
him
,
either
that
he
was
very
honest
or
very
chivalric
,
 
in
accordance
with
the
special
views
on
the
subject
of
the
man
who
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
It
was
reported
now
that
he
no
longer
owned
horses
on
the
turf
;
 
but
this
was
doubted
by
some
who
could
name
the
animals
which
they
said
that
he
owned
,
and
which
he
ran
in
the
name
of
Mr.
Macnab
,
 
<EOS>
said
some
;
of
Mr.
Pardoe
,
 
said
others
;
of
Mr.
Chickerwick
<EOS>
,
 
said
a
third
set
of
informants
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
that
Lord
Chiltern
at
this
moment
had
no
interest
of
his
own
in
any
horse
upon
the
turf
.
  
<EOS>
But
all
the
world
knew
that
he
drank
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
by
the
throat
a
proctor
's
bull
-
dog
when
he
had
been
drunk
at
Oxford
,
had
nearly
strangled
the
man
,
and
had
been
expelled
.
<EOS>
He
had
fallen
through
his
violence
into
some
terrible
misfortune
at
Paris
,
had
been
brought
before
a
public
judge
,
and
his
name
and
his
infamy
had
been
made
notorious
in
every
newspaper
in
the
two
capitals
.
<EOS>
After
that
he
had
fought
a
ruffian
at
Newmarket
,
and
had
really
killed
him
with
his
fists
.
<EOS>
In
reference
to
this
latter
affray
it
had
been
proved
that
the
attack
had
been
made
on
him
,
that
he
had
not
been
to
blame
,
and
that
he
had
not
been
drunk
.
<EOS>
After
a
prolonged
investigation
he
had
come
forth
from
that
affair
without
disgrace
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
done
so
,
at
least
,
if
he
had
not
been
heretofore
disgraced
.
<EOS>
But
we
all
know
how
the
man
well
spoken
of
may
steal
a
horse
,
while
he
who
is
of
evil
repute
may
not
look
over
a
hedge
.
<EOS>
It
was
asserted
widely
by
many
who
were
supposed
to
know
all
about
everything
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
in
a
fit
of
delirium
tremens
when
he
killed
the
ruffian
at
Newmarket
.
<EOS>
The
worst
of
that
latter
affair
was
that
it
produced
the
total
estrangement
which
now
existed
between
Lord
Brentford
and
his
son
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
would
not
believe
that
his
son
was
in
that
matter
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
.
<EOS>
"
Such
things
do
not
happen
to
other
men
's
sons
,
"
he
said
,
when
Lady
Laura
pleaded
for
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
could
not
induce
her
father
to
see
his
son
,
but
so
far
prevailed
that
no
sentence
of
banishment
was
pronounced
against
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
son
sitting
at
his
father
's
table
if
he
so
pleased
.
<EOS>
He
never
did
so
please
,
 
but
nevertheless
he
continued
to
live
in
the
house
in
Portman
Square
;
and
when
he
met
the
Earl
,
in
the
hall
,
perhaps
,
or
on
the
staircase
,
would
simply
bow
to
him
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Earl
would
bow
again
,
and
shuffle
on
,
 
and
look
very
wretched
,
as
no
doubt
he
was
.
<EOS>
A
grown
-
up
son
must
be
the
greatest
comfort
a
man
can
have
,
 
if
he
be
his
father
's
best
friend
;
but
otherwise
he
can
hardly
be
a
comfort
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
in
this
house
,
the
son
was
a
constant
thorn
in
his
father
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
do
when
we
leave
London
?
"
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
once
said
to
his
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
stays
here
,
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
hunts
still
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
hunts
,
 
and
he
has
a
room
somewhere
at
an
inn
,
 
down
in
Northamptonshire
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
mostly
in
London
.
<EOS>
They
have
trains
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
life
for
my
son
!
"
said
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
life
!
<EOS>
Of
course
no
decent
person
will
let
him
into
his
house
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
this
,
for
in
truth
Lord
Chiltern
was
not
fond
of
staying
at
the
houses
of
persons
whom
the
Earl
would
have
called
decent
.
  
<EOS>
General
Effingham
,
the
father
of
Violet
,
and
Lord
Brentford
had
been
the
closest
and
dearest
of
friends
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
young
men
in
the
same
regiment
,
and
through
life
each
had
confided
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
When
the
General
's
only
son
,
then
a
youth
of
seventeen
,
was
killed
in
one
of
our
grand
New
Zealand
wars
,
the
bereaved
father
and
the
Earl
had
been
together
for
a
month
in
their
sorrow
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
Lord
Chiltern
's
career
had
still
been
open
to
hope
,
 
and
the
one
man
had
contrasted
his
lot
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
General
Effingham
lived
long
enough
to
hear
the
Earl
declare
that
his
lot
was
the
happier
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Now
the
General
was
dead
,
and
Violet
,
the
daughter
of
a
second
wife
,
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
Effinghams
.
<EOS>
This
second
wife
had
been
a
Miss
Plummer
,
a
lady
from
the
city
with
much
money
,
whose
sister
had
married
Lord
Baldock
.
<EOS>
Violet
in
this
way
had
fallen
to
the
care
of
the
Baldock
people
,
and
not
into
the
hands
of
her
father
's
friends
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
reader
will
have
surmised
,
she
had
ideas
of
her
own
of
emancipating
herself
from
Baldock
thraldom
.
  
<EOS>
Twice
before
that
last
terrible
affair
at
Newmarket
,
before
the
quarrel
between
the
father
and
the
son
had
been
complete
,
Lord
Brentford
had
said
a
word
to
his
daughter
,
 
merely
a
word
,
 
of
his
son
in
connection
with
Miss
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
thinks
of
it
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
"
That
had
been
the
first
word
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
then
resolved
that
the
affair
in
Paris
should
be
regarded
as
condoned
,
 
as
among
the
things
to
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
too
good
for
him
;
but
if
he
asks
her
let
him
tell
her
everything
.
<EOS>
"
That
had
been
the
second
word
,
and
had
been
spoken
immediately
subsequent
to
a
payment
of
twelve
thousand
pounds
made
by
the
Earl
towards
the
settlement
of
certain
Doncaster
accounts
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
in
negotiating
for
the
money
had
been
very
eloquent
in
describing
some
honest
,
 
or
shall
we
say
chivalric
,
 
sacrifice
which
had
brought
her
brother
into
this
special
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Since
that
the
Earl
had
declined
to
interest
himself
in
his
son
's
matrimonial
affairs
;
and
when
Lady
Laura
had
once
again
mentioned
the
matter
,
declaring
her
belief
that
it
would
be
the
means
of
saving
her
brother
Oswald
,
the
Earl
had
desired
her
to
be
silent
.
"
<EOS>
Would
you
wish
to
destroy
the
poor
child
?
<EOS>
"
he
had
said
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
Lady
Laura
felt
sure
that
if
she
were
to
go
to
her
father
with
a
positive
statement
that
Oswald
and
Violet
were
engaged
,
he
would
relent
and
would
accept
Violet
as
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
payment
of
Lord
Chiltern
's
present
debts
;
 
she
had
a
little
scheme
of
her
own
about
that
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
,
who
had
been
already
two
days
in
Portman
Square
,
had
not
as
yet
seen
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
lived
in
the
house
,
that
is
,
that
he
slept
there
,
and
probably
eat
his
breakfast
in
some
apartment
of
his
own
;
 
but
she
knew
also
that
the
habits
of
the
house
would
not
by
any
means
make
it
necessary
that
they
should
meet
.
<EOS>
Laura
and
her
brother
probably
saw
each
other
daily
,
 
but
they
never
went
into
society
together
,
and
did
not
know
the
same
sets
of
people
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
announced
to
Lady
Baldock
her
intention
of
spending
the
first
fortnight
of
her
London
season
with
her
friend
Lady
Laura
<EOS>
,
Lady
Baldock
had
as
a
matter
of
course
 
"
jumped
upon
her
,
"
as
Miss
Effingham
would
herself
call
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
the
house
of
the
worst
reprobate
in
all
England
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
 
dear
old
Lord
Brentford
,
whom
papa
loved
so
well
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
Lord
Chiltern
,
who
,
only
last
year
,
 
murdered
a
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
true
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
worse
than
that
,
 
much
worse
.
<EOS>
He
is
always
 
tipsy
,
and
always
gambling
,
and
always---
<EOS>
But
it
is
quite
unfit
that
I
should
speak
a
word
more
to
you
about
such
a
man
as
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
His
name
ought
never
to
be
mentioned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
did
you
mention
it
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
's
process
of
jumping
upon
her
niece
,
 
in
which
I
think
the
aunt
had
generally
the
worst
of
the
exercise
<EOS>
,
 
went
on
for
some
time
,
but
Violet
of
course
carried
her
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
marries
him
there
will
be
an
end
of
everything
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
to
her
daughter
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
more
sense
than
that
,
mamma
,
"
said
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
she
has
any
sense
at
all
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
;
 
"
not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
do
wish
my
poor
sister
had
lived
;
 
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
was
now
in
the
room
with
Violet
,
 
immediately
upon
that
conversation
between
Violet
and
his
sister
as
to
the
expediency
of
Violet
becoming
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Indeed
his
entrance
had
interrupted
the
conversation
before
it
was
over
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
,
Miss
Effingham
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
in
thinking
that
I
might
find
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
,
as
large
as
life
,
"
she
said
,
getting
up
from
her
corner
on
the
sofa
and
giving
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Laura
and
I
have
been
discussing
the
affairs
of
the
nation
for
the
last
two
days
,
and
have
nearly
brought
our
discussion
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
help
looking
,
first
at
his
eye
and
then
at
his
hand
,
not
as
wanting
evidence
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
which
his
sister
had
made
,
but
because
the
idea
of
a
drunkard
's
eye
and
a
drunkard
's
hand
had
been
brought
before
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
's
hand
was
like
the
hand
of
any
other
man
,
but
there
was
something
in
his
eye
that
almost
frightened
her
.
<EOS>
It
looked
as
though
he
would
not
hesitate
to
wring
his
wife
's
neck
round
,
if
ever
he
should
be
brought
to
threaten
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
And
then
his
eye
,
like
the
rest
of
him
,
was
red
.
<EOS>
No
;
 
she
did
not
think
that
she
could
ever
bring
herself
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
Why
take
a
venture
that
was
double
-
dangerous
,
when
there
were
so
many
ventures
open
to
her
,
apparently
with
very
little
of
danger
attached
to
them
?
<EOS>
"
If
it
should
ever
be
said
that
I
loved
him
,
I
would
do
it
all
the
same
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
did
not
come
and
see
you
here
,
I
suppose
that
I
should
never
see
you
,
"
said
he
,
seating
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
often
go
to
parties
,
and
when
I
do
you
are
not
likely
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
might
make
our
little
arrangements
for
meeting
,
"
said
she
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
,
Lady
Baldock
,
is
going
to
have
an
evening
next
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
servants
would
be
ordered
to
put
me
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
.
<EOS>
You
can
tell
her
that
I
invited
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
Oswald
and
Lady
Baldock
are
great
friends
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
he
might
come
and
take
you
and
me
to
the
Zoo
on
Sunday
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
proper
sort
of
thing
for
a
brother
and
a
friend
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
that
place
in
the
Regent
's
Park
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
were
you
there
last
?
"
demanded
Miss
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
I
came
home
once
from
Eton
.
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
go
again
till
I
can
come
home
from
Eton
again
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
altered
his
tone
as
he
continued
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
People
would
look
at
me
as
if
I
were
the
wildest
beast
in
the
whole
collection
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Violet
,
"
if
you
wo
n't
go
to
Lady
Baldock
's
or
to
the
Zoo
,
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
Laura
's
drawing
-
room
;
 
unless
,
indeed
,
you
like
to
take
me
to
the
top
of
the
Monument
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
you
to
the
top
of
the
Monument
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
,
Laura
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
that
you
are
a
foolish
girl
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
and
that
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
a
scheme
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
that
you
should
come
here
;
and
as
you
live
in
the
house
,
and
as
I
am
sure
to
be
here
every
morning
,
and
as
you
have
no
possible
occupation
for
your
time
,
and
as
we
have
nothing
particular
to
do
with
ours
,
 
<EOS>
I
daresay
I
sha
n't
see
you
again
before
I
go
to
my
aunt
's
in
Berkeley
Square
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
likely
not
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
,
Oswald
?
"
asked
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
He
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
before
he
answered
her
.
"
<EOS>
Because
she
and
I
run
in
different
grooves
now
,
and
are
not
such
meet
playfellows
as
we
used
to
be
once
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
my
taking
you
away
right
through
Saulsby
Wood
once
on
the
old
pony
,
and
not
bringing
you
back
till
tea
-
time
,
and
Miss
Blink
going
and
telling
my
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
remember
it
?
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
the
happiest
day
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
His
pockets
were
crammed
full
of
gingerbread
and
Everton
toffy
,
and
we
had
three
bottles
of
lemonade
slung
on
to
the
pony
's
saddlebows
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
a
pity
that
we
should
ever
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
pity
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
nevertheless
,
substantially
necessary
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Failing
our
power
of
reproducing
the
toffy
,
I
suppose
it
was
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
Miss
Effingham
then
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
 
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
These
disagreeable
realities
of
life
grow
upon
one
;
do
they
not
?
<EOS>
You
took
off
my
shoes
and
dried
them
for
me
at
a
woodman
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
put
up
with
my
maid
's
doing
those
things
now
.
<EOS>
And
Miss
Blink
the
mild
is
changed
for
Lady
Baldock
the
martinet
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
rode
about
with
you
in
a
wood
all
day
I
should
be
sent
to
Coventry
instead
of
to
bed
.
<EOS>
And
so
you
see
everything
is
changed
as
well
as
my
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
is
not
changed
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
getting
up
from
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
changed
,
 
at
least
not
in
this
,
that
as
I
loved
you
better
than
any
being
in
the
world
,
 
better
even
than
Laura
there
,
 
so
do
I
love
you
now
infinitely
the
best
of
all
.
<EOS>
Do
not
look
so
surprised
at
me
.
<EOS>
You
knew
it
before
as
well
as
you
do
now
;
 
and
Laura
knows
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
secret
to
be
kept
in
the
matter
among
us
three
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Lord
Chiltern
,
 
"
said
Miss
Effingham
,
rising
also
to
her
feet
,
and
then
pausing
,
not
knowing
how
to
answer
him
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
suddenness
in
his
mode
of
addressing
her
which
had
,
so
to
say
,
almost
taken
away
her
breath
;
and
then
to
be
told
by
a
man
of
his
love
before
his
sister
was
in
itself
,
to
her
,
a
matter
so
surprising
,
that
none
of
those
words
came
at
her
command
which
will
come
,
as
though
by
instinct
,
to
young
ladies
on
such
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
known
it
always
,
"
said
he
,
as
though
he
were
angry
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
she
replied
,
"
you
must
excuse
me
if
I
say
that
you
are
,
at
the
least
,
very
abrupt
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
when
I
was
going
back
so
joyfully
to
our
childish
days
that
you
would
turn
the
tables
on
me
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
said
nothing
that
ought
to
make
you
angry
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
because
he
has
driven
me
to
say
that
which
will
make
me
appear
to
be
uncivil
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
I
do
not
love
you
with
that
love
of
which
you
are
speaking
now
.
<EOS>
As
an
old
friend
I
have
always
regarded
you
,
and
I
hope
that
I
may
always
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
got
up
and
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
were
you
so
sudden
with
her
,
 
so
abrupt
,
 
so
loud
?
"
said
his
sister
,
coming
up
to
him
and
taking
him
by
the
arm
almost
in
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
make
no
difference
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
She
does
not
care
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
Such
a
woman
as
Violet
can
not
be
had
after
that
fashion
.
<EOS>
You
must
begin
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
begun
and
ended
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
nonsense
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
persist
.
<EOS>
It
was
madness
to
speak
in
that
way
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
of
this
,
however
,
that
there
is
no
one
she
likes
better
than
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
remember
that
you
have
done
much
to
make
any
girl
afraid
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
remember
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
something
now
to
make
her
fear
you
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Speak
to
her
softly
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
of
the
sort
of
life
which
you
would
live
with
her
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
that
all
is
changed
.
<EOS>
As
she
comes
to
love
you
,
she
will
believe
you
when
she
would
believe
no
one
else
on
that
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
tell
her
a
lie
?
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
looking
his
sister
full
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
upon
his
heel
and
left
her
.

went
on
very
calmly
after
the
opening
battle
which
ousted
Lord
de
Terrier
and
sent
Mr.
Mildmay
back
to
the
Treasury
,
 
so
calmly
that
Phineas
Finn
was
unconsciously
disappointed
,
as
lacking
that
excitement
of
contest
to
which
he
had
been
introduced
in
the
first
days
of
his
parliamentary
career
.
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
certain
waspish
attacks
were
made
by
Mr.
Daubeny
,
now
on
this
Secretary
of
State
and
now
on
that
;
but
they
were
felt
by
both
parties
to
mean
nothing
;
and
as
no
great
measure
was
brought
forward
,
nothing
which
would
serve
by
the
magnitude
of
its
interests
to
divide
the
liberal
side
of
the
House
into
fractions
,
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Cabinet
was
allowed
to
hold
its
own
in
comparative
peace
and
quiet
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
July
,
 
the
middle
of
July
,
 
and
the
member
for
Loughshane
had
not
yet
addressed
the
House
.
<EOS>
How
often
had
he
meditated
doing
so
;
how
he
had
composed
his
speeches
walking
round
the
Park
on
his
way
down
to
the
House
;
how
he
got
his
subjects
up
,
 
only
to
find
on
hearing
them
discussed
that
he
really
knew
little
or
nothing
about
them
;
how
he
had
his
arguments
and
almost
his
very
words
taken
out
of
his
mouth
by
some
other
member
;
and
lastly
,
how
he
had
actually
been
deterred
from
getting
upon
his
legs
by
a
certain
tremor
of
blood
<EOS>
round
his
heart
when
the
moment
for
rising
had
come
,
 
of
all
this
<EOS>
he
never
said
a
word
to
any
man
.
<EOS>
Since
that
last
journey
to
county
Mayo
,
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
been
his
most
intimate
friend
,
but
he
said
nothing
of
all
this
even
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
To
his
other
friend
,
Lady
Laura
Standish
,
he
did
explain
something
of
his
feelings
,
not
absolutely
describing
to
her
the
extent
of
hindrance
to
which
his
modesty
had
subjected
him
,
but
letting
her
know
that
he
had
his
qualms
as
well
as
his
aspirations
.
<EOS>
But
as
Lady
Laura
always
recommended
patience
,
and
more
than
once
expressed
her
opinion
that
a
young
member
would
be
better
to
sit
in
silence
at
least
for
one
session
,
he
was
not
driven
to
the
mortification
of
feeling
that
he
was
incurring
her
contempt
by
his
bashfulness
.
<EOS>
As
regarded
the
men
among
whom
he
lived
,
I
think
he
was
almost
annoyed
at
finding
that
no
one
seemed
to
expect
that
he
should
speak
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
,
when
he
had
first
talked
of
sending
Phineas
down
to
Loughshane
,
had
predicted
for
him
all
manner
of
parliamentary
successes
,
and
had
expressed
the
warmest
admiration
of
the
manner
in
which
Phineas
had
discussed
this
or
that
subject
at
the
Union
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
above
one
or
two
men
in
the
House
who
can
do
that
kind
of
thing
,
"
Barrington
Erle
had
once
said
.
<EOS>
But
now
no
allusions
whatever
were
made
to
his
powers
of
speech
,
and
Phineas
in
his
modest
moments
began
to
be
more
amazed
than
ever
that
he
should
find
himself
seated
in
that
chamber
.
  
<EOS>
To
the
forms
and
technicalities
of
parliamentary
business
he
did
give
close
attention
,
and
was
unremitting
in
his
attendance
.
<EOS>
On
one
or
two
occasions
he
ventured
to
ask
a
question
of
the
Speaker
,
and
as
the
words
of
experience
fell
into
his
ears
,
he
would
tell
himself
that
he
was
going
through
his
education
,
 
that
he
was
learning
to
be
a
working
member
,
and
perhaps
to
be
a
statesman
.
<EOS>
But
his
regrets
with
reference
to
Mr.
Low
and
the
dingy
chambers
in
Old
Square
were
very
frequent
;
and
had
it
been
possible
for
him
to
undo
all
that
he
had
done
,
he
would
often
have
abandoned
to
some
one
else
the
honour
of
representing
the
electors
of
Loughshane
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
supported
in
all
his
difficulties
by
the
kindness
of
his
friend
,
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
was
often
in
the
house
in
Portman
Square
,
and
was
always
received
with
cordiality
,
and
,
as
he
thought
,
almost
with
affection
.
<EOS>
She
would
sit
and
talk
to
him
,
sometimes
saying
a
word
about
her
brother
and
sometimes
about
her
father
,
as
though
there
were
more
between
them
than
the
casual
intimacy
of
London
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
And
in
Portman
Square
he
had
been
introduced
to
Miss
Effingham
,
and
had
found
Miss
Effingham
to
be
 
very
nice
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
had
quite
taken
to
him
,
and
he
had
danced
with
her
at
two
or
three
parties
,
talking
always
,
as
he
did
so
,
about
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
Laura
,
I
think
your
friend
Mr.
Finn
is
in
love
with
you
,
"
said
Violet
to
Lady
Laura
one
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
.
<EOS>
He
is
fond
of
me
,
and
so
am
I
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
honest
,
and
so
naïve
without
being
awkward
!
<EOS>
And
then
he
is
undoubtedly
clever
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
so
uncommonly
handsome
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
that
makes
much
difference
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
does
if
a
man
looks
like
a
gentleman
as
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Finn
certainly
looks
like
a
gentleman
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
no
doubt
is
one
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
has
got
any
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
penny
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
does
such
a
man
manage
to
live
?
<EOS>
There
are
so
many
men
like
that
,
and
they
are
always
mysteries
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
'll
have
to
marry
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whoever
gets
him
will
not
have
a
bad
husband
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
during
the
summer
had
very
often
met
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
They
sat
on
the
same
side
of
the
House
,
they
belonged
to
the
same
club
,
they
dined
together
more
than
once
in
Portman
Square
,
and
on
one
occasion
Phineas
had
accepted
an
invitation
to
dinner
sent
to
him
by
Mr.
Kennedy
himself
.
"
<EOS>
A
slower
affair
I
never
saw
in
my
life
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
afterwards
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
Though
there
were
two
or
three
men
there
who
talk
everywhere
else
,
they
could
not
talk
at
his
table
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
gave
you
good
wine
,
I
should
say
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
,
"
and
let
me
tell
you
that
that
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
.
<EOS>
"
In
spite
,
however
,
of
all
these
opportunities
for
intimacy
,
now
,
nearly
at
the
end
of
the
session
,
Phineas
had
hardly
spoken
a
dozen
words
to
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
really
knew
nothing
whatsoever
of
the
man
,
as
one
friend
,
 
or
even
as
one
acquaintance
knows
another
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
desired
him
to
be
on
good
terms
with
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
for
that
reason
he
had
dined
with
him
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
disliked
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
felt
quite
sure
that
Mr.
Kennedy
disliked
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
therefore
rather
surprised
when
he
received
the
following
note
:
    
Albany
,
Z
3
,
July
17
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MR
.
<EOS>
FINN
,
  
<EOS>
I
shall
have
some
friends
at
Loughlinter
next
month
,
and
should
be
very
glad
if
you
will
join
us
.
<EOS>
I
will
name
the
16th
August
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
shoot
,
but
there
are
grouse
and
deer
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
truly
,
  
ROBERT
KENNEDY
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
do
?
<EOS>
He
had
already
begun
to
feel
rather
uncomfortable
at
the
prospect
of
being
separated
from
all
his
new
friends
as
soon
as
the
session
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibhon
had
asked
him
to
make
another
visit
to
county
Mayo
,
but
that
he
had
declined
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
said
something
to
him
about
going
abroad
with
her
brother
,
and
since
that
there
had
sprung
up
a
sort
of
intimacy
between
him
and
Lord
Chiltern
;
but
nothing
had
been
fixed
about
this
foreign
trip
,
and
there
were
pecuniary
objections
to
it
which
put
it
almost
out
of
his
power
.
<EOS>
The
Christmas
holidays
he
would
of
course
pass
with
his
family
at
Killaloe
,
but
he
hardly
liked
the
idea
of
hurrying
off
to
Killaloe
immediately
the
session
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
Everybody
around
him
seemed
to
be
looking
forward
to
pleasant
leisure
doings
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Men
talked
about
grouse
,
and
of
the
ladies
at
the
houses
to
which
they
were
going
and
of
the
people
whom
they
were
to
meet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
said
nothing
of
her
own
movements
for
the
early
autumn
,
and
no
invitation
had
come
to
him
to
go
to
the
Earl
's
country
house
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
felt
that
every
one
would
depart
and
that
he
would
be
left
,
 
and
this
had
made
him
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
do
with
the
invitation
from
Mr.
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
He
disliked
the
man
,
and
had
told
himself
half
a
dozen
times
that
he
despised
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
must
refuse
it
.
<EOS>
Even
for
the
sake
of
the
scenery
,
and
the
grouse
,
and
the
pleasant
party
,
and
the
feeling
that
going
to
Loughlinter
in
August
would
be
the
proper
sort
of
thing
to
do
,
he
must
refuse
it
!
<EOS>
But
it
occurred
to
him
at
last
that
he
would
call
in
Portman
Square
before
he
wrote
his
note
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
go
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
in
her
most
decided
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
it
is
civil
in
him
to
ask
you
,
and
why
should
you
be
uncivil
in
return
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
uncivil
in
not
accepting
a
man
's
invitation
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
going
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
I
shall
be
disappointed
if
you
do
not
go
too
.
<EOS>
Both
Mr.
Gresham
and
Mr.
Monk
will
be
there
,
and
I
believe
they
have
never
stayed
together
in
the
same
house
before
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
there
are
a
dozen
men
on
your
side
of
the
House
who
would
give
their
eyes
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
he
did
go
.
<EOS>
The
note
accepting
Mr.
Kennedy
's
invitation
was
written
at
the
Reform
Club
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
his
leaving
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
careful
in
writing
to
be
not
more
familiar
or
more
civil
than
Mr.
Kennedy
had
been
to
himself
,
and
then
he
signed
himself
"
<EOS>
Yours
truly
,
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
another
proposition
was
made
to
him
,
and
a
most
charming
proposition
,
during
the
few
minutes
that
he
remained
in
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
because
I
can
now
ask
you
to
run
down
to
us
at
Saulsby
for
a
couple
of
days
on
your
way
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
Till
this
was
fixed
I
could
n't
ask
you
to
come
all
the
way
to
Saulsby
for
two
days
;
and
there
wo
n't
be
room
for
more
between
our
leaving
London
and
starting
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
swore
that
he
would
have
gone
if
it
had
been
but
for
one
hour
,
and
if
Saulsby
had
been
twice
the
distance
.
"
<EOS>
Very
well
;
come
on
the
13th
and
go
on
the
15th
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
on
the
15th
,
unless
you
choose
to
stay
with
the
housekeeper
.
<EOS>
And
remember
,
Mr.
Finn
,
we
have
got
no
grouse
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
declared
that
he
did
not
care
a
straw
for
grouse
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
another
little
occurrence
which
happened
before
Phineas
left
London
,
and
which
was
not
altogether
so
charming
as
his
prospects
at
Saulsby
and
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
Early
in
August
,
when
the
session
was
still
incomplete
,
he
dined
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
at
the
Reform
Club
.
<EOS>
Laurence
had
specially
invited
him
to
do
so
,
and
made
very
much
of
him
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
George
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
Laurence
said
to
him
that
morning
,
"
nothing
has
happened
to
me
this
session
that
has
given
me
so
much
pleasure
as
your
being
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
Of
course
there
are
fellows
with
whom
one
is
very
intimate
and
of
whom
one
is
very
fond
,
 
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
But
most
of
these
Englishmen
on
our
side
are
such
cold
fellows
;
or
else
they
are
like
Ratler
and
Barrington
Erle
,
thinking
of
nothing
but
politics
.
<EOS>
And
then
as
to
our
own
men
,
there
are
so
many
of
them
one
can
hardly
trust
!
<EOS>
That
's
the
truth
of
it
.
<EOS>
Your
being
in
the
House
has
been
such
a
comfort
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
really
liked
his
friend
Laurence
,
expressed
himself
very
warmly
in
answer
to
this
,
and
became
affectionate
,
and
made
sundry
protestations
of
friendship
which
were
perfectly
sincere
.
<EOS>
Their
sincerity
was
tested
after
dinner
,
when
Fitzgibbon
,
as
they
two
were
seated
on
a
sofa
in
the
corner
of
the
smoking
-
room
,
asked
Phineas
to
put
his
name
to
the
back
of
a
bill
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
at
six
months
'
date
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
Laurence
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
is
a
sum
of
money
utterly
beyond
my
reach
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
,
my
dear
boy
,
and
that
's
why
I
've
come
to
you
.
<EOS>
D'ye
think
I
'd
have
asked
anybody
who
by
any
impossibility
might
have
been
made
to
pay
anything
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
's
the
use
of
it
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
use
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
's
for
me
to
judge
of
the
use
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Why
,
d'ye
think
I
'd
ask
it
if
it
was
n't
any
use
?
<EOS>
I
'll
make
it
of
use
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
And
take
my
word
,
you
'll
never
hear
about
it
again
.
<EOS>
It
's
just
a
forestalling
of
my
salary
;
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
do
it
till
I
saw
that
we
were
at
least
safe
for
six
months
to
come
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
Finn
with
many
misgivings
,
with
much
inward
hatred
of
himself
for
his
own
weakness
,
did
put
his
name
on
the
back
of
the
bill
which
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
prepared
for
his
signature
.
   
<EOS>
Saulsby
Wood
 
<EOS>
"
So
you
wo
n't
come
to
Moydrum
again
?
"
said
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
this
autumn
,
Laurence
.
<EOS>
Your
father
would
think
that
I
want
to
live
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bedad
,
it
's
my
father
would
be
glad
to
see
you
,
 
and
the
oftener
the
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
my
time
is
filled
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
going
to
be
one
of
the
party
at
Loughlinter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
am
.
<EOS>
Kennedy
asked
me
,
and
people
seem
to
think
that
everybody
is
to
do
what
he
bids
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
too
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
had
asked
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
it
as
good
as
a
promise
of
an
under
-
secretaryship
.
<EOS>
All
the
Cabinet
are
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
he
ever
had
an
Irishman
in
his
house
before
.
<EOS>
When
do
you
start
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
on
the
12th
or
13th
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
shall
go
to
Saulsby
on
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
devil
you
will
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
Phineas
,
my
boy
,
you
're
the
luckiest
fellow
I
know
.
<EOS>
This
is
your
first
year
,
and
you
're
asked
to
the
two
most
difficult
houses
in
England
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
look
out
for
an
heiress
now
.
<EOS>
There
is
little
Vi
Effingham
;
 
she
is
sure
to
be
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
be
in
the
least
unhappy
about
the
bill
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
to
making
that
all
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
rather
unhappy
about
the
bill
;
but
there
was
so
much
that
was
pleasant
in
his
cup
at
the
present
moment
,
that
he
resolved
,
as
far
as
possible
,
to
ignore
the
bitter
of
that
one
ingredient
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
in
the
dark
as
to
two
or
three
matters
respecting
these
coming
visits
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
liked
to
have
taken
a
servant
with
him
;
but
he
had
no
servant
,
and
felt
ashamed
to
hire
one
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
was
in
trouble
about
a
gun
,
and
the
paraphernalia
of
shooting
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
bad
shot
at
snipe
in
the
bogs
of
county
Clare
,
but
he
had
never
even
seen
a
gun
used
in
England
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
bought
himself
a
gun
,
 
with
other
paraphernalia
,
and
took
a
license
for
himself
,
and
then
groaned
over
the
expense
to
which
he
found
that
his
journey
would
subject
him
.
<EOS>
And
at
last
he
hired
a
servant
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
was
intensely
ashamed
of
himself
when
he
had
done
so
,
hating
himself
,
and
telling
himself
that
he
was
going
to
the
devil
headlong
.
<EOS>
And
why
had
he
done
it
?
<EOS>
Not
that
Lady
Laura
would
like
him
the
better
,
or
that
she
would
care
whether
he
had
a
servant
or
not
.
<EOS>
She
probably
would
know
nothing
of
his
servant
.
<EOS>
But
the
people
about
her
would
know
,
and
he
was
foolishly
anxious
that
the
people
about
her
should
think
that
he
was
worthy
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
called
on
Mr.
Low
before
he
started
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
like
to
leave
London
without
seeing
you
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
know
you
will
have
nothing
pleasant
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
say
nothing
unpleasant
certainly
.
<EOS>
I
see
your
name
in
the
divisions
,
and
I
feel
a
sort
of
envy
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
fool
could
go
into
a
lobby
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
have
been
gratified
to
see
that
you
have
had
the
patience
to
abstain
from
speaking
till
you
had
looked
about
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
more
than
I
expected
from
your
hot
Irish
blood
.
<EOS>
Going
to
meet
Mr.
Gresham
and
Mr.
Monk
,
 
are
you
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
hope
you
may
meet
them
in
the
Cabinet
some
day
.
<EOS>
Mind
you
come
and
see
me
when
Parliament
meets
in
February
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
was
delighted
when
she
found
that
Phineas
had
hired
a
servant
;
but
Mr.
Bunce
predicted
nothing
but
evil
from
so
vain
an
expense
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
;
where
is
it
to
come
from
?
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
no
richer
because
he
's
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
no
wages
.
<EOS>
M.P.
and
M.T.
,
"
 
whereby
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunce
,
I
fear
,
meant
empty
,
 
"
are
pretty
much
alike
when
a
man
has
n't
a
fortune
at
his
back
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
he
's
going
to
stay
with
all
the
lords
in
the
Cabinet
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bunce
,
to
whom
Phineas
,
in
his
pride
,
had
confided
perhaps
more
than
was
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Cabinet
,
indeed
,
"
said
Bunce
;
"
if
he
'd
stick
to
chambers
,
and
let
alone
cabinets
,
he
'd
do
a
deal
better
.
<EOS>
Given
up
his
rooms
,
has
he
,
 
till
February
?
<EOS>
He
do
n't
expect
we
're
going
to
keep
them
empty
for
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
found
that
the
house
was
full
at
Saulsby
,
although
the
sojourn
of
the
visitors
would
necessarily
be
so
short
.
<EOS>
There
were
three
or
four
there
on
their
way
on
to
Loughlinter
,
like
himself
,
 
Mr.
Bonteen
and
Mr.
Ratler
,
with
Mr.
Palliser
,
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
his
wife
,
 
and
there
was
Violet
Effingham
,
who
,
however
,
was
not
going
to
Loughlinter
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
indeed
,
"
she
said
to
our
hero
,
who
on
the
first
evening
had
the
pleasure
of
taking
her
in
to
dinner
,
"
unfortunately
I
have
n't
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
therefore
I
am
not
asked
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Laura
is
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
but
Lady
Laura
has
a
Cabinet
Minister
in
her
keeping
.
<EOS>
I
've
only
one
comfort
;
 
you
'll
be
awfully
dull
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
it
would
be
very
much
nicer
to
stay
here
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
want
to
know
my
real
mind
,
"
said
Violet
,
"
I
would
give
one
of
my
little
fingers
to
go
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
four
Cabinet
Ministers
in
the
house
,
and
four
un
-
Cabinet
Ministers
,
and
half
a
dozen
other
members
of
Parliament
,
and
there
will
be
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
,
who
is
the
best
fun
in
the
world
;
and
,
in
point
of
fact
,
it
's
the
thing
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
asked
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
belong
to
the
Baldock
faction
,
and
we
do
n't
sit
on
your
side
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
thinks
that
I
should
tell
secrets
.
"
  
<EOS>
Why
on
earth
had
Mr.
Kennedy
invited
him
,
Phineas
Finn
,
to
meet
four
Cabinet
Ministers
and
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
?
<EOS>
He
could
only
have
done
so
at
the
instance
of
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
It
was
delightful
for
Phineas
to
think
that
Lady
Laura
cared
for
him
so
deeply
;
but
it
was
not
equally
delightful
when
he
remembered
how
very
close
must
be
the
alliance
between
Mr.
Kennedy
and
Lady
Laura
,
when
she
was
thus
powerful
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
At
Saulsby
Phineas
did
not
see
much
of
his
hostess
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
making
their
plans
for
the
one
entire
day
of
this
visit
,
she
said
a
soft
word
of
apology
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
busy
with
all
these
people
,
that
I
hardly
know
what
I
am
doing
.
<EOS>
But
we
shall
be
able
to
find
a
quiet
minute
or
two
at
Loughlinter
,
 
unless
,
indeed
,
you
intend
to
be
on
the
mountains
all
day
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
brought
a
gun
like
everybody
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
have
brought
a
gun
.
<EOS>
I
do
shoot
;
but
I
am
not
an
inveterate
sportsman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
that
one
day
there
was
a
great
riding
party
made
up
,
and
Phineas
found
himself
mounted
,
after
luncheon
,
with
some
dozen
other
equestrians
.
<EOS>
Among
them
were
Miss
Effingham
and
Lady
Glencora
,
Mr.
Ratler
and
the
Earl
of
Brentford
himself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
whose
husband
was
,
as
has
been
said
,
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
and
who
was
still
a
young
woman
,
and
a
very
pretty
woman
,
had
taken
lately
very
strongly
to
politics
,
which
she
discussed
among
men
and
women
of
both
parties
with
something
more
than
ordinary
audacity
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
nice
,
happy
,
lazy
time
you
've
had
of
it
since
you
've
been
in
,
"
said
she
to
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
have
been
more
happy
than
lazy
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
've
done
nothing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
has
twenty
schemes
of
reform
,
all
mature
;
but
among
you
you
've
not
let
him
bring
in
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
and
Mr.
Mildmay
and
you
will
break
his
heart
among
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Mr.
Palliser
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
if
you
do
n't
take
care
he
and
Mr.
Monk
and
Mr.
Gresham
will
arise
and
shake
themselves
,
and
turn
you
all
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
look
to
ourselves
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
,
yes
;
 
or
you
will
be
known
to
all
posterity
as
the
fainéant
government
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
tell
you
,
Lady
Glencora
,
that
a
fainéant
government
is
not
the
worst
government
that
England
can
have
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
the
great
fault
of
our
politicians
that
they
have
all
wanted
to
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Mildmay
is
at
any
rate
innocent
of
that
charge
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
riding
through
a
vast
wood
,
and
Phineas
found
himself
delightfully
established
by
the
side
of
Violet
Effingham
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
has
been
explaining
to
me
that
he
must
have
nineteen
next
session
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
I
were
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
would
decline
to
be
counted
up
in
that
way
as
one
of
Mr.
Ratler
's
sheep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
something
on
your
own
hook
.
<EOS>
You
men
in
Parliament
are
so
much
like
sheep
!
<EOS>
If
one
jumps
at
a
gap
,
all
go
after
him
,
 
and
then
you
are
penned
into
lobbies
,
and
then
you
are
fed
,
and
then
you
are
fleeced
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
were
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
'd
get
up
in
the
middle
and
make
such
a
speech
.
<EOS>
You
all
seem
to
me
to
be
so
much
afraid
of
one
another
that
you
do
n't
quite
dare
to
speak
out
.
<EOS>
Do
you
see
that
cottage
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
pretty
cottage
it
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
Twelve
years
ago
I
took
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
and
had
them
dried
in
that
cottage
,
and
when
I
got
back
to
the
house
I
was
put
to
bed
for
having
been
out
all
day
in
the
wood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
wandering
about
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
was
n't
alone
.
<EOS>
Oswald
Standish
was
with
me
.
<EOS>
We
were
children
then
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Chiltern
;
 
<EOS>
yes
,
I
know
him
.
<EOS>
He
and
I
have
been
rather
friends
this
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
good
;
 
is
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
,
 
in
what
way
?
"
  
"
Honest
and
generous
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
no
man
whom
I
believe
to
be
more
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
is
clever
?
"
asked
Miss
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
clever
.
<EOS>
That
is
,
he
talks
very
well
if
you
will
let
him
talk
after
his
own
fashion
.
<EOS>
You
would
always
fancy
that
he
was
going
to
eat
you
;
 
but
that
is
his
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
like
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
a
favourite
of
yours
,
Miss
Effingham
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
now
,
 
not
particularly
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
ever
see
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
sister
is
the
best
friend
I
have
,
and
I
used
to
like
him
so
much
when
he
was
a
boy
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
that
cottage
since
that
day
,
and
I
remember
it
as
though
it
were
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
is
quite
changed
,
is
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Changed
,
 
in
what
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
used
to
say
that
he
was
 
unsteady
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
changed
.
<EOS>
But
Chiltern
is
at
heart
a
Bohemian
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
not
to
see
that
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
hates
the
decencies
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
does
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
ought
to
marry
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
married
,
that
would
all
be
cured
;
 
do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
fancy
him
with
a
wife
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
There
is
a
savagery
about
him
which
would
make
him
an
uncomfortable
companion
for
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
would
love
his
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
as
he
does
his
horses
.
<EOS>
And
he
would
treat
her
well
,
 
as
he
does
his
horses
.
<EOS>
But
he
expects
every
horse
he
has
to
do
anything
that
any
horse
can
do
;
and
he
would
expect
the
same
of
his
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
no
idea
how
deep
an
injury
he
might
be
doing
his
friend
by
this
description
,
nor
did
it
once
occur
to
him
that
his
companion
was
thinking
of
herself
as
the
possible
wife
of
this
Red
Indian
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
rode
on
in
silence
for
some
distance
,
and
then
she
said
<EOS>
but
one
word
more
about
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
so
good
to
me
in
that
cottage
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
the
party
at
Saulsby
was
broken
up
,
and
there
was
a
regular
pilgrimage
towards
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
Phineas
resolved
upon
sleeping
a
night
at
Edinburgh
on
his
way
,
and
he
found
himself
joined
in
the
bands
of
close
companionship
with
Mr.
Ratler
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
evening
was
by
no
means
thrown
away
,
for
he
learned
much
of
his
trade
from
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Ratler
was
heard
to
declare
afterwards
at
Loughlinter
that
Mr.
Finn
was
a
pleasant
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
It
soon
came
to
be
admitted
by
all
who
knew
Phineas
Finn
that
he
had
a
peculiar
power
of
making
himself
agreeable
which
no
one
knew
how
to
analyse
or
define
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
because
he
listens
so
well
,
"
said
one
man
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
women
would
not
like
him
for
that
,
"
said
another
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
has
studied
when
to
listen
and
when
to
talk
,
"
said
a
third
.
<EOS>
The
truth
,
however
,
was
,
that
Phineas
Finn
had
made
no
study
in
the
matter
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
was
simply
his
nature
to
be
pleasant
.
   
<EOS>
Loughlinter
 
Phineas
Finn
reached
Loughlinter
together
with
Mr.
Ratler
in
a
post
-
chaise
from
the
neighbouring
town
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
,
who
had
done
this
kind
of
thing
very
often
before
,
travelled
without
impediments
,
but
the
new
servant
of
our
hero
's
was
stuck
outside
with
the
driver
,
and
was
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
bring
a
man
with
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
to
his
young
friend
.
<EOS>
"
The
servants
of
the
house
like
it
much
better
,
because
they
get
fee'd
;
you
are
just
as
well
waited
on
,
and
it
do
n't
cost
half
as
much
.
"
<EOS>
Phineas
blushed
as
he
heard
all
this
;
but
there
was
the
impediment
,
not
to
be
got
rid
of
for
the
nonce
,
and
Phineas
made
the
best
of
his
attendant
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
one
of
those
points
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
as
to
which
a
man
never
quite
makes
up
his
mind
.
<EOS>
If
you
bring
a
fellow
,
you
wish
you
had
n't
brought
him
;
and
if
you
do
n't
,
you
wish
you
had
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
great
deal
more
decided
in
my
ways
that
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
Loughlinter
,
as
they
approached
it
,
seemed
to
Phineas
to
be
a
much
finer
place
than
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
,
except
that
Loughlinter
wanted
that
graceful
beauty
of
age
which
Saulsby
possessed
.
<EOS>
Loughlinter
was
all
of
cut
stone
,
but
the
stones
had
been
cut
only
yesterday
.
<EOS>
It
stood
on
a
gentle
slope
,
with
a
greensward
falling
from
the
front
entrance
down
to
a
mountain
lake
.
<EOS>
And
on
the
other
side
of
the
Lough
there
rose
a
mighty
mountain
to
the
skies
,
Ben
Linter
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
it
,
and
all
round
to
the
left
,
there
ran
the
woods
of
Linter
,
stretching
for
miles
through
crags
and
bogs
and
mountain
lands
.
<EOS>
No
better
ground
for
deer
than
the
side
of
Ben
Linter
was
there
in
all
those
highlands
.
<EOS>
And
the
Linter
,
rushing
down
into
the
Lough
through
rocks
which
,
in
some
places
,
almost
met
together
above
its
waters
,
ran
so
near
to
the
house
that
the
pleasant
noise
of
its
cataracts
could
be
heard
from
the
hall
door
.
<EOS>
Behind
the
house
the
expanse
of
drained
park
land
seemed
to
be
interminable
;
and
then
,
again
,
came
the
mountains
.
<EOS>
There
were
Ben
Linn
and
Ben
Lody
;
 
and
the
whole
territory
belonging
to
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
He
was
laird
of
Linn
and
laird
of
Linter
,
as
his
people
used
to
say
.
<EOS>
And
yet
his
father
had
walked
into
Glasgow
as
a
little
boy
,
 
no
doubt
with
the
normal
half
-
crown
in
his
breeches
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Magnificent
;
 
is
it
not
?
"
said
Phineas
to
the
Treasury
Secretary
,
as
they
were
being
driven
up
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
grand
;
 
but
the
young
trees
show
the
new
man
.
<EOS>
A
new
man
may
buy
a
forest
;
but
he
ca
n't
get
park
trees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
at
the
moment
,
was
thinking
how
far
all
these
things
which
he
saw
,
the
mountains
stretching
everywhere
around
him
,
the
castle
,
the
lake
,
the
river
,
the
wealth
of
it
all
,
and
,
more
than
the
wealth
,
the
nobility
of
the
beauty
,
might
act
as
temptations
to
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
If
a
woman
were
asked
to
have
the
half
of
all
this
,
would
it
be
possible
that
she
should
prefer
to
take
the
half
of
his
nothing
?
<EOS>
He
thought
it
might
be
possible
for
a
girl
who
would
confess
,
or
seem
to
confess
,
that
love
should
be
everything
.
<EOS>
But
it
could
hardly
be
possible
for
a
woman
who
looked
at
the
world
almost
as
a
man
looked
at
it
,
 
as
an
oyster
to
be
opened
with
such
weapon
as
she
could
find
ready
to
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
professed
to
have
a
care
for
all
the
affairs
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
She
loved
politics
,
and
could
talk
of
social
science
,
and
had
broad
ideas
about
religion
,
and
was
devoted
to
certain
educational
views
.
<EOS>
Such
a
woman
would
feel
that
wealth
was
necessary
to
her
,
and
would
be
willing
,
for
the
sake
of
wealth
,
to
put
up
with
a
husband
without
romance
.
<EOS>
Nay
;
might
it
not
be
that
she
would
prefer
a
husband
without
romance
?
<EOS>
Thus
Phineas
was
arguing
to
himself
as
he
was
driven
up
to
the
door
of
Loughlinter
Castle
,
while
Mr.
Ratler
was
eloquent
on
the
beauty
of
old
park
trees
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
a
Scotch
forest
is
a
very
scrubby
sort
of
thing
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
in
the
house
,
 
at
least
,
they
found
nobody
;
and
within
half
an
hour
Phineas
was
walking
about
the
grounds
by
himself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
had
declared
himself
to
be
delighted
at
having
an
opportunity
of
writing
letters
,
 
and
<EOS>
no
doubt
was
writing
them
by
the
dozen
,
all
dated
from
Loughlinter
,
and
all
detailing
the
facts
that
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
Mr.
Monk
,
and
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
and
Lord
Brentford
were
in
the
same
house
with
him
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
no
letters
to
write
,
and
therefore
rushed
down
across
the
broad
lawn
to
the
river
,
of
which
he
heard
the
noisy
tumbling
waters
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
air
which
immediately
filled
him
with
high
spirits
;
and
,
in
his
desire
to
investigate
the
glories
of
the
place
,
he
forgot
that
he
was
going
to
dine
with
four
Cabinet
Ministers
in
a
row
.
<EOS>
He
soon
reached
the
stream
,
and
began
to
make
his
way
up
it
through
the
ravine
.
<EOS>
There
was
waterfall
over
waterfall
,
and
there
were
little
bridges
here
and
there
which
looked
to
be
half
natural
and
half
artificial
,
and
a
path
which
required
that
you
should
climb
,
but
which
was
yet
a
path
,
and
all
was
so
arranged
that
not
a
pleasant
splashing
rush
of
the
waters
was
lost
to
the
visitor
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
and
on
,
up
the
stream
,
till
there
was
a
sharp
turn
in
the
ravine
,
and
then
,
looking
upwards
,
he
saw
above
his
head
a
man
and
a
woman
standing
together
on
one
of
the
little
half
-
made
wooden
bridges
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
sharp
,
and
he
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
woman
was
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
recognised
the
man
,
but
he
had
very
little
doubt
that
it
was
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
Mr.
Kennedy
,
because
he
would
prefer
that
it
should
be
any
other
man
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
turned
back
at
once
if
he
had
thought
that
he
could
have
done
so
without
being
observed
;
but
he
felt
sure
that
,
standing
as
they
were
,
they
must
have
observed
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
like
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
intrude
himself
.
<EOS>
So
he
remained
still
,
and
began
to
throw
stones
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
thrown
above
a
stone
or
two
when
he
was
called
from
above
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
,
and
then
he
perceived
that
the
man
who
called
him
was
his
host
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
he
ceased
to
throw
stones
,
and
went
up
the
path
,
and
joined
them
upon
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
stepped
forward
,
and
bade
him
welcome
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
His
manner
was
less
cold
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
more
words
at
command
than
was
usual
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
been
long
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
finding
out
the
most
beautiful
spot
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
lovely
?
"
said
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
not
been
here
an
hour
yet
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
insisted
on
bringing
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
wonderfully
beautiful
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
this
very
spot
where
we
now
stand
that
made
me
build
the
house
where
it
is
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
and
I
was
only
eighteen
when
I
stood
here
and
made
up
my
mind
.
<EOS>
That
is
just
twenty
-
five
years
ago
.
"
<EOS>
"
So
he
is
forty
-
three
,
"
said
Phineas
to
himself
,
thinking
how
glorious
it
was
to
be
only
twenty
-
five
.
"
<EOS>
And
within
twelve
months
,
"
continued
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
the
foundations
were
being
dug
and
the
stone
-
cutters
were
at
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
good
-
natured
man
your
father
must
have
been
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
had
nothing
else
to
do
with
his
money
but
to
pour
it
over
my
head
,
as
it
were
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
had
any
other
enjoyment
of
it
himself
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
a
little
higher
,
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
We
shall
get
a
fine
view
over
to
Ben
Linn
just
now
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
declared
that
she
would
go
as
much
higher
as
he
chose
to
take
her
,
and
Phineas
was
rather
in
doubt
as
to
what
it
would
become
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
would
stay
where
he
was
,
or
go
down
,
or
make
himself
to
vanish
after
any
most
acceptable
fashion
;
but
if
he
were
to
do
so
abruptly
it
would
seem
as
though
he
were
attributing
something
special
to
the
companionship
of
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
saw
his
doubt
,
and
asked
him
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
as
well
come
on
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
dine
till
eight
,
and
it
is
not
much
past
six
yet
.
<EOS>
The
men
of
business
are
all
writing
letters
,
and
the
ladies
who
have
been
travelling
are
in
bed
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
all
of
them
,
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Then
they
went
on
with
their
walk
very
pleasantly
,
and
the
lord
of
all
that
they
surveyed
took
them
from
one
point
of
vantage
to
another
,
till
they
both
swore
that
of
all
spots
upon
the
earth
<EOS>
Loughlinter
was
surely
the
most
lovely
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
delight
in
it
,
I
own
,
"
said
the
lord
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
come
up
here
alone
,
and
feel
that
in
the
midst
of
this
little
bit
of
a
crowded
island
I
have
all
this
to
myself
,
 
all
this
with
which
no
other
man
's
wealth
can
interfere
,
 
I
grow
proud
of
my
own
,
till
I
become
thoroughly
ashamed
of
myself
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
believe
it
is
better
to
dwell
in
cities
than
in
the
country
,
 
better
,
at
any
rate
,
for
a
rich
man
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
had
now
spoken
more
words
than
Phineas
had
heard
to
fall
from
his
lips
during
the
whole
time
that
they
had
been
acquainted
with
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
too
,
"
said
Laura
,
"
if
one
were
obliged
to
choose
between
the
two
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
think
that
a
little
of
both
is
good
for
man
and
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
doubt
about
that
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
as
far
as
enjoyment
goes
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
them
up
out
of
the
ravine
on
to
the
side
of
the
mountain
,
and
then
down
by
another
path
through
the
woods
to
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
As
they
went
he
relapsed
into
his
usual
silence
,
and
the
conversation
was
kept
up
between
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
At
a
point
not
very
far
from
the
castle
,
 
just
so
far
that
one
could
see
by
the
break
of
the
ground
where
the
castle
stood
,
Kennedy
left
them
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
will
take
you
back
in
safety
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
,
as
I
am
here
,
I
'll
go
up
to
the
farm
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
show
myself
now
and
again
when
I
am
here
,
they
think
I
'm
indifferent
about
the
"
bestials
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Now
,
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
you
are
going
to
pretend
to
understand
all
about
sheep
and
oxen
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
owning
that
it
was
so
,
went
away
to
his
farm
,
and
Phineas
with
Lady
Laura
returned
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
upon
the
whole
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
that
that
is
as
good
a
man
as
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
he
is
an
idle
one
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
that
.
<EOS>
He
is
,
perhaps
,
neither
zealous
nor
active
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
thoughtful
and
high
-
principled
,
and
has
a
method
and
a
purpose
in
the
use
which
he
makes
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
And
you
see
that
he
has
poetry
in
his
nature
too
,
if
you
get
him
upon
the
right
string
.
<EOS>
How
fond
he
is
of
the
scenery
of
this
place
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
man
would
be
fond
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
'm
ashamed
to
say
that
it
almost
makes
me
envy
him
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
never
have
wished
to
be
Mr.
Robert
Kennedy
in
London
,
but
I
should
like
to
be
the
Laird
of
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
Laird
of
Linn
and
Laird
of
Linter
,
 
Here
in
summer
,
gone
in
winter
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
ballad
about
the
old
lairds
;
but
that
belongs
to
a
time
when
Mr.
Kennedy
had
not
been
heard
of
,
when
some
branch
of
the
Mackenzies
lived
down
at
that
wretched
old
tower
which
you
see
as
you
first
come
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
When
old
Mr.
Kennedy
bought
it
there
were
hardly
a
hundred
acres
on
the
property
under
cultivation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
belonged
to
the
Mackenzies
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
to
the
Mackenzie
of
Linn
,
as
he
was
called
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Kennedy
,
the
old
man
,
who
was
first
called
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
That
is
Linn
Castle
,
and
they
lived
there
for
hundreds
of
years
.
<EOS>
But
these
Highlanders
,
with
all
that
is
said
of
their
family
pride
,
have
forgotten
the
Mackenzies
already
,
and
are
quite
proud
of
their
rich
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
unpoetical
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
but
then
poetry
is
so
usually
false
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
Scotland
would
not
have
been
as
prosaic
a
country
as
any
under
the
sun
but
for
Walter
Scott
;
 
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
Henry
V
owes
the
romance
of
his
character
altogether
to
Shakspeare
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
think
you
despise
poetry
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
it
is
false
I
do
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
is
to
know
when
it
is
false
and
when
it
is
true
.
<EOS>
Tom
Moore
was
always
false
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
so
false
as
Byron
,
"
said
Phineas
with
energy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Much
more
so
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
not
discuss
that
now
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
Mr.
Monk
since
you
have
been
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
no
one
.
<EOS>
I
came
with
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
with
Mr.
Ratler
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
find
Mr.
Ratler
a
companion
much
to
your
taste
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Chance
brought
us
together
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Ratler
is
a
man
of
sense
,
Lady
Laura
,
and
is
not
to
be
despised
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
always
seems
to
me
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
that
nothing
is
to
be
gained
in
politics
by
sitting
at
the
feet
of
the
little
Gamaliels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
great
Gamaliels
will
not
have
a
novice
on
their
footstools
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Then
sit
at
no
man
's
feet
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
astonishing
that
the
price
generally
put
upon
any
article
by
the
world
is
that
which
the
owner
puts
on
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
that
this
is
specially
true
of
a
man
's
own
self
?
<EOS>
If
you
herd
with
Ratler
,
men
will
take
it
for
granted
that
you
are
a
Ratlerite
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
If
you
consort
with
Greshams
and
Pallisers
,
you
will
equally
be
supposed
to
know
your
own
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
a
Mentor
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
so
apt
as
you
are
to
fill
his
Telemachus
with
pride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
I
do
not
think
your
fault
lies
that
way
.
<EOS>
If
it
did
,
or
if
I
thought
so
,
my
Telemachus
,
you
may
be
sure
that
I
should
resign
my
position
as
Mentor
.
<EOS>
Here
are
Mr.
Kennedy
and
Lady
Glencora
and
Mrs.
Gresham
on
the
steps
.
"
<EOS>
Then
they
went
up
through
the
Ionic
columns
on
to
the
broad
stone
terrace
before
the
door
,
and
there
they
found
a
crowd
of
men
and
women
.
<EOS>
For
the
legislators
and
statesmen
had
written
their
letters
,
and
the
ladies
had
taken
their
necessary
rest
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
was
dressing
,
considered
deeply
all
that
Lady
Laura
had
said
to
him
,
 
not
so
much
with
reference
to
the
advice
which
she
had
given
him
,
though
that
also
was
of
importance
,
as
to
the
fact
that
it
had
been
given
by
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
first
called
herself
his
Mentor
;
but
he
had
accepted
the
name
and
had
addressed
her
as
her
Telemachus
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
believed
himself
to
be
older
than
she
,
 
if
,
indeed
,
there
was
any
difference
in
their
ages
.
<EOS>
And
was
it
possible
that
a
female
Mentor
should
love
her
<EOS>
Telemachus
,
 
should
love
him
as
Phineas
desired
to
be
loved
by
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
He
would
not
say
that
it
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
had
been
mistakes
between
them
;
 
a
mistake
in
his
manner
of
addressing
her
,
and
another
in
hers
of
addressing
him
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
old
bachelor
of
forty
-
three
was
not
thinking
of
a
wife
.
<EOS>
Had
this
old
bachelor
of
forty
-
three
been
really
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
would
he
have
allowed
her
to
walk
home
alone
with
Phineas
,
leaving
her
with
some
flimsy
pretext
of
having
to
look
at
his
sheep
?
<EOS>
Phineas
resolved
that
he
must
at
any
rate
play
out
his
game
,
 
whether
he
were
to
lose
it
or
to
win
it
;
and
in
playing
it
he
must
,
if
possible
,
drop
something
of
that
Mentor
and
Telemachus
style
of
conversation
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
advice
given
him
of
herding
with
Greshams
and
Pallisers
,
instead
of
with
Ratlers
and
Fitzgibbons
,
 
he
must
use
that
as
circumstances
might
direct
.
<EOS>
To
him
,
himself
,
as
he
thought
of
it
all
,
it
was
sufficiently
astonishing
that
even
the
Ratlers
and
Fitzgibbons
should
admit
him
among
them
as
one
of
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
think
of
my
father
and
of
the
old
house
at
Killaloe
,
and
remember
that
hitherto
I
have
done
nothing
myself
,
I
can
not
understand
how
it
is
that
I
should
be
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
only
one
way
of
understanding
it
.
<EOS>
If
Lady
Laura
really
loved
him
,
the
riddle
might
be
read
.
  
<EOS>
The
rooms
at
Loughlinter
were
splendid
,
much
larger
and
very
much
more
richly
furnished
than
those
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
certain
stiffness
in
the
movement
of
things
,
and
perhaps
in
the
manner
of
some
of
those
present
,
which
was
not
felt
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
Phineas
at
once
missed
the
grace
and
prettiness
and
cheery
audacity
of
Violet
Effingham
,
and
felt
at
the
same
time
that
Violet
Effingham
would
be
out
of
her
element
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
At
Loughlinter
they
were
met
for
business
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
least
a
semi
-
political
,
or
perhaps
rather
a
semi
-
official
gathering
,
and
he
became
aware
that
he
ought
not
to
look
simply
for
amusement
.
<EOS>
When
he
entered
the
drawing
-
room
before
dinner
,
Mr.
Monk
and
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
and
Mr.
Gresham
,
with
sundry
others
,
were
standing
in
a
wide
group
before
the
fireplace
,
and
among
them
were
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
and
Lady
Laura
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
As
he
approached
them
it
seemed
as
though
a
sort
of
opening
was
made
for
himself
;
but
he
could
see
,
though
others
did
not
,
that
the
movement
came
from
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
Mr.
Monk
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
that
you
and
I
are
the
only
two
in
the
whole
party
who
really
know
what
we
would
be
at
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
must
be
divided
from
so
many
of
my
friends
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
"
I
am
happy
to
go
astray
in
the
company
of
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
might
I
ask
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
,
with
a
peculiar
smile
for
which
he
was
famous
,
"
what
it
is
that
you
and
Mr.
Monk
are
really
at
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Making
men
and
women
all
equal
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
That
I
take
to
be
the
gist
of
our
political
theory
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lady
Glencora
,
I
must
cry
off
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
in
the
Cabinet
myself
I
should
not
admit
so
much
.
<EOS>
There
are
reticences
,
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
And
there
is
an
official
discretion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
,
Lady
Glencora
,
that
you
would
really
advocate
equality
?
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
mean
to
say
so
,
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
And
I
mean
to
go
further
,
and
to
tell
you
that
you
are
no
Liberal
at
heart
unless
you
do
so
likewise
;
unless
that
is
the
basis
of
your
political
aspirations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
let
me
speak
for
myself
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
By
no
means
,
 
not
when
you
are
criticising
me
and
my
politics
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
wish
to
make
the
lower
orders
comfortable
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
educated
,
and
happy
and
good
?
"
  
"
Undoubtedly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
make
them
as
comfortable
and
as
good
as
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Better
if
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'm
sure
you
wish
to
make
yourself
as
good
and
as
comfortable
as
anybody
else
,
 
as
those
above
you
,
if
anybody
is
above
you
?
<EOS>
You
will
admit
that
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
if
I
understand
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
admitted
everything
,
and
are
an
advocate
for
general
equality
,
 
just
as
Mr.
Monk
is
,
and
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
getting
out
of
it
;
 
is
there
,
Mr.
Kennedy
?
"
<EOS>
Then
dinner
was
announced
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
walked
off
with
the
French
Republican
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
As
she
went
,
she
whispered
into
Mr.
Kennedy
's
ear
,
"
You
will
understand
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
saying
that
people
are
equal
;
but
that
the
tendency
of
all
law
-
making
and
of
all
governing
should
be
to
reduce
the
inequalities
.
"
<EOS>
In
answer
to
which
Mr.
Kennedy
said
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
's
politics
were
too
fast
and
furious
for
his
nature
.
  
<EOS>
A
week
passed
by
at
Loughlinter
,
at
the
end
of
which
Phineas
found
himself
on
terms
of
friendly
intercourse
with
all
the
political
magnates
assembled
in
the
house
,
but
especially
with
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
He
had
determined
that
he
would
not
follow
Lady
Laura
's
advice
as
to
his
selection
of
companions
,
if
in
doing
so
he
should
be
driven
even
to
a
seeming
of
intrusion
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
attempt
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
anybody
,
and
would
stand
aloof
when
bigger
men
than
himself
were
talking
,
and
was
content
to
be
less
,
 
as
indeed
he
was
less
,
 
than
Mr.
Bonteen
or
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
found
that
,
without
any
effort
on
his
part
,
 
almost
in
opposition
to
efforts
on
his
part
,
 
he
had
fallen
into
an
easy
pleasant
way
with
these
men
which
was
very
delightful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
killed
a
stag
in
company
with
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
had
stopped
beneath
a
crag
to
discuss
with
him
a
question
as
to
the
duty
on
Irish
malt
.
<EOS>
He
had
played
chess
with
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
had
been
told
that
gentleman
's
opinion
on
the
trial
of
Mr.
Jefferson
Davis
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
had
 
at
last
 
called
him
Finn
,
and
had
proved
to
him
that
nothing
was
known
in
Ireland
about
sheep
.
<EOS>
But
with
Mr.
Monk
he
had
had
long
discussions
on
abstract
questions
in
politics
,
 
and
before
the
week
was
over
was
almost
disposed
to
call
himself
a
disciple
,
or
,
at
least
,
a
follower
of
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
Why
not
of
Mr.
Monk
as
well
as
of
any
one
else
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
was
in
the
Cabinet
,
and
of
all
the
members
of
the
Cabinet
was
the
most
advanced
Liberal
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
not
so
far
wrong
the
other
night
,
"
Mr.
Monk
said
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Equality
is
an
ugly
word
and
should
n't
be
used
.
<EOS>
It
misleads
,
and
frightens
,
and
is
a
bugbear
.
<EOS>
And
she
,
in
using
it
,
had
not
perhaps
a
clearly
defined
meaning
for
it
in
her
own
mind
.
<EOS>
But
the
wish
of
every
honest
man
should
be
to
assist
in
lifting
up
those
below
him
,
till
they
be
something
nearer
his
own
level
than
he
finds
them
.
"
<EOS>
To
this
Phineas
assented
,
 
and
by
degrees
he
found
himself
assenting
to
a
great
many
things
that
Mr.
Monk
said
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
was
a
thin
,
tall
,
gaunt
man
,
who
had
devoted
his
whole
life
to
politics
,
hitherto
without
any
personal
reward
beyond
that
which
came
to
him
from
the
reputation
of
his
name
,
and
from
the
honour
of
a
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
four
or
five
brothers
,
 
and
all
besides
him
were
in
trade
.
<EOS>
They
had
prospered
in
trade
,
whereas
he
had
prospered
solely
in
politics
;
and
men
said
that
he
was
dependent
altogether
on
what
his
relatives
supplied
for
his
support
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
been
in
Parliament
for
more
than
twenty
years
,
and
had
been
known
not
only
as
a
Radical
but
as
a
Democrat
.
<EOS>
Ten
years
since
,
when
he
had
risen
to
fame
,
but
not
to
repute
,
among
the
men
who
then
governed
England
,
nobody
dreamed
that
Joshua
Monk
would
ever
be
a
paid
servant
of
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
He
had
inveighed
against
one
minister
after
another
as
though
they
all
deserved
impeachment
.
<EOS>
He
had
advocated
political
doctrines
which
at
that
time
seemed
to
be
altogether
at
variance
with
any
possibility
of
governing
according
to
English
rules
of
government
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
regarded
as
a
pestilent
thorn
in
the
sides
of
all
ministers
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
was
a
member
of
the
Cabinet
,
and
those
whom
he
had
terrified
in
the
old
days
began
to
find
that
he
was
not
so
much
unlike
other
men
.
<EOS>
There
are
but
few
horses
which
you
can
not
put
into
harness
,
and
those
of
the
highest
spirit
will
generally
do
your
work
the
best
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
had
his
eyes
about
him
,
thought
that
he
could
perceive
that
Mr.
Palliser
did
not
shoot
a
deer
with
Mr.
Ratler
,
and
that
Mr.
Gresham
played
no
chess
with
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
Bonteen
,
indeed
,
was
a
noisy
pushing
man
whom
nobody
seemed
to
like
,
and
Phineas
wondered
why
he
should
be
at
Loughlinter
,
and
why
he
should
be
in
office
.
<EOS>
His
friend
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
indeed
once
endeavoured
to
explain
this
.
"
<EOS>
A
man
who
can
vote
hard
,
as
I
call
it
;
and
who
will
speak
a
few
words
now
and
then
as
they
're
wanted
,
without
any
ambition
that
way
,
may
always
have
his
price
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
has
a
pretty
wife
into
the
bargain
,
he
ought
to
have
a
pleasant
time
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
no
doubt
was
a
very
useful
man
,
who
thoroughly
knew
his
business
;
but
yet
,
as
it
seemed
to
Phineas
,
no
very
great
distinction
was
shown
to
Mr.
Ratler
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
got
as
high
as
that
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
I
should
think
myself
a
miracle
of
luck
.
<EOS>
And
yet
nobody
seems
to
think
anything
of
Ratler
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
nothing
unless
one
can
go
to
the
very
top
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
did
right
to
accept
office
,
"
Mr.
Monk
said
to
him
one
day
,
as
they
sat
together
on
a
rock
close
by
one
of
the
little
bridges
over
the
Linter
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
unless
a
man
does
so
when
the
bonds
of
the
office
tendered
to
him
are
made
compatible
with
his
own
views
,
he
declines
to
proceed
on
the
open
path
towards
the
prosecution
of
those
views
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
is
combating
one
ministry
after
another
,
and
striving
to
imbue
those
ministers
with
his
convictions
,
can
hardly
decline
to
become
a
minister
himself
when
he
finds
that
those
convictions
of
his
own
are
henceforth
,
 
or
at
least
for
some
time
to
come
,
 
to
be
the
ministerial
convictions
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Do
you
follow
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
clearly
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
denied
your
own
children
had
you
refused
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unless
indeed
a
man
were
to
feel
that
he
was
in
some
way
unfitted
for
office
work
.
<EOS>
I
very
nearly
provided
for
myself
an
escape
on
that
plea
;
 
but
when
I
came
to
sift
it
,
I
thought
that
it
would
be
false
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
tell
you
that
the
delight
of
political
life
is
altogether
in
opposition
.
<EOS>
Why
,
it
is
freedom
against
slavery
,
fire
against
clay
,
movement
against
stagnation
!
<EOS>
The
very
inaccuracy
which
is
permitted
to
opposition
is
in
itself
a
charm
worth
more
than
all
the
patronage
and
all
the
prestige
of
ministerial
power
.
<EOS>
You
'll
try
them
both
,
and
then
say
if
you
do
not
agree
with
me
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
full
swing
of
the
benches
below
the
gangway
,
where
I
needed
to
care
for
no
one
,
and
could
always
enjoy
myself
on
my
legs
as
long
as
I
felt
that
I
was
true
to
those
who
sent
me
there
!
<EOS>
That
is
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
They
have
got
me
into
harness
,
and
my
shoulders
are
sore
.
<EOS>
The
oats
,
however
,
are
of
the
best
,
and
the
hay
is
unexceptionable
.

Donald
Bean
's
Pony
 
Phineas
liked
being
told
that
the
pleasures
of
opposition
and
the
pleasures
of
office
were
both
open
to
him
,
 
and
he
liked
also
to
be
the
chosen
receptacle
of
Mr.
Monk
's
confidence
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
understand
that
he
was
expected
to
remain
ten
days
at
Loughlinter
,
and
that
then
there
was
to
be
a
general
movement
.
<EOS>
Since
the
first
day
he
had
seen
but
little
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
but
he
had
found
himself
very
frequently
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
And
then
had
come
up
the
question
of
his
projected
trip
to
Paris
with
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
He
had
received
a
letter
from
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
FINN
,
  
Are
you
going
to
Paris
with
me
?
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
C.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
not
a
word
beyond
this
,
and
before
he
answered
it
he
made
up
his
mind
to
tell
Lady
Laura
the
truth
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
to
Paris
because
he
had
no
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
just
got
that
from
your
brother
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
like
Oswald
.
<EOS>
He
writes
to
me
perhaps
three
times
in
the
year
,
and
his
letters
are
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
You
will
go
<EOS>
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
 
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
I
may
tell
you
the
real
reason
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
;
 
I
can
not
answer
that
;
but
unless
it
be
some
political
secret
between
you
and
Mr.
Monk
,
I
should
think
you
might
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
afford
to
go
to
Paris
this
autumn
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
be
a
shocking
admission
to
make
,
 
though
I
do
n't
know
why
it
should
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
;
 
<EOS>
but
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
like
you
<EOS>
all
the
better
for
making
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
,
for
Oswald
's
sake
.
<EOS>
It
's
so
hard
to
find
any
companion
for
him
whom
he
would
like
and
whom
<EOS>
we
,
 
that
is
I
,
 
should
think
altogether
 
;
you
know
what
I
mean
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
wish
that
I
should
go
with
him
is
a
great
compliment
,
and
I
thoroughly
wish
that
I
could
do
it
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
must
go
to
Killaloe
and
retrieve
my
finances
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
,
Lady
Laura
,
you
can
hardly
conceive
how
very
poor
a
man
I
am
.
"
<EOS>
There
was
a
melancholy
tone
about
his
voice
as
he
said
this
,
which
made
her
think
for
the
moment
whether
or
no
he
had
been
right
in
going
into
Parliament
,
and
whether
she
had
been
right
in
instigating
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
late
to
recur
to
that
question
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
climb
into
office
early
,
and
forego
those
pleasures
of
opposition
which
are
so
dear
to
Mr.
Monk
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
money
is
an
accident
which
does
not
count
nearly
so
high
as
do
some
other
things
.
<EOS>
You
and
Mr.
Kennedy
have
the
same
enjoyment
of
everything
around
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
while
it
lasts
.
"
  
"
And
Lady
Glencora
and
I
stand
pretty
much
on
the
same
footing
,
in
spite
of
all
her
wealth
,
 
except
that
she
is
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
she
is
worth
,
 
something
not
to
be
counted
;
and
I
am
worth
,
 
just
what
papa
chooses
to
give
me
.
<EOS>
A
ten
-
pound
note
at
the
present
moment
I
should
look
upon
as
great
riches
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
spoken
to
him
of
her
own
position
as
regards
money
;
but
he
had
heard
,
or
thought
that
he
had
heard
,
that
she
had
been
left
a
fortune
altogether
independent
of
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
of
the
ten
days
had
now
come
,
and
Phineas
was
discontented
and
almost
unhappy
.
<EOS>
The
more
he
saw
of
Lady
Laura
the
more
he
feared
that
it
was
impossible
that
she
should
become
his
wife
.
<EOS>
And
yet
from
day
to
day
his
intimacy
with
her
became
more
close
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
made
love
to
her
,
nor
could
he
discover
that
it
was
possible
for
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
be
a
woman
for
whom
all
the
ordinary
stages
of
love
-
making
were
quite
unsuitable
,
Of
course
he
could
declare
his
love
and
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
on
any
occasion
on
which
he
might
find
himself
to
be
alone
with
her
.
<EOS>
And
on
this
morning
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
do
so
before
the
day
was
over
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
possible
that
she
would
never
speak
to
him
again
;
 
that
all
the
pleasures
and
ambitious
hopes
to
which
she
had
introduced
him
might
be
over
as
soon
as
that
rash
word
should
have
been
spoken
!
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
he
would
speak
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
day
there
was
to
be
a
grouse
-
shooting
party
,
and
the
shooters
were
to
be
out
early
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
talked
of
for
some
day
or
two
past
,
and
Phineas
knew
that
he
could
not
escape
it
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
some
rivalry
between
him
and
Mr.
Bonteen
,
and
there
was
to
be
a
sort
of
match
as
to
which
of
the
two
would
kill
most
birds
before
lunch
.
<EOS>
But
there
had
also
been
some
half
promise
on
Lady
Laura
's
part
that
she
would
walk
with
him
up
the
Linter
and
come
down
upon
the
lake
,
taking
an
opposite
direction
from
that
by
which
they
had
returned
with
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
be
shooting
all
day
,
"
she
said
,
when
he
proposed
it
to
her
as
they
were
starting
for
the
moor
.
<EOS>
The
waggonet
that
was
to
take
them
was
at
the
door
,
and
she
was
there
to
see
them
start
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
one
of
the
shooting
party
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
was
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
undertake
to
be
back
in
time
,
if
you
will
not
think
it
too
hot
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
see
you
again
till
we
meet
in
town
next
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
certainly
will
go
with
you
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
to
say
,
if
you
are
here
.
<EOS>
But
you
can
not
return
without
the
rest
of
the
party
,
as
you
are
going
so
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
get
back
somehow
,
"
said
Phineas
,
who
was
resolved
that
a
few
miles
more
or
less
of
mountain
should
not
detain
him
from
the
prosecution
of
a
task
so
vitally
important
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
start
at
five
that
will
be
early
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
early
enough
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
went
off
to
the
mountains
,
and
shot
his
grouse
,
and
won
his
match
,
and
eat
his
luncheon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
,
however
,
was
not
beaten
by
much
,
and
was
in
consequence
somewhat
ill
-
humoured
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
,
"
I
'll
back
myself
for
the
rest
of
the
day
for
a
ten
-
pound
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
there
had
been
no
money
staked
on
the
match
at
all
,
 
but
it
had
been
simply
a
trial
of
skill
,
as
to
which
would
kill
the
most
birds
in
a
given
time
.
<EOS>
And
the
proposition
for
that
trial
had
come
from
Mr.
Bonteen
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
think
of
shooting
for
money
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
why
not
?
<EOS>
A
bet
is
the
only
way
to
decide
these
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Partly
because
I
'm
sure
I
should
n't
hit
a
bird
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
partly
because
I
have
n't
got
any
money
to
lose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
bets
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
to
him
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
annoyed
when
Bonteen
offered
the
wager
.
<EOS>
I
felt
sure
,
however
,
you
would
not
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
such
bets
are
very
common
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
men
ought
to
propose
them
unless
they
are
quite
sure
of
their
company
.
<EOS>
Maybe
I
'm
wrong
,
and
I
often
feel
that
I
am
strait
-
laced
about
such
things
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
odd
to
me
that
men
can
not
amuse
themselves
without
pitting
themselves
against
each
other
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
tells
me
that
he
can
shoot
better
than
I
,
I
tell
him
that
my
keeper
can
shoot
better
than
he
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
same
,
it
's
a
good
thing
to
excel
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
so
sure
of
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
who
can
kill
more
salmon
than
anybody
else
,
can
rarely
do
anything
else
.
<EOS>
Are
you
going
on
with
your
match
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
'm
going
to
make
my
way
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
over
nine
miles
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
walk
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
found
that
it
was
now
two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
broiling
day
in
August
,
and
the
way
back
to
Loughlinter
,
for
six
or
seven
out
of
the
nine
miles
,
would
be
along
a
high
road
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
do
it
all
the
same
,
"
said
he
,
preparing
for
a
start
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
engagement
with
Lady
Laura
Standish
;
and
as
this
is
the
last
day
that
I
shall
see
her
,
I
certainly
do
not
mean
to
break
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
engagement
with
Lady
Laura
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
not
tell
me
,
that
I
might
have
a
pony
ready
?
<EOS>
But
come
along
.
<EOS>
Donald
Bean
has
a
pony
.
<EOS>
He
's
not
much
bigger
than
a
dog
,
but
he
'll
carry
you
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
walk
it
,
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
think
of
the
state
in
which
you
'd
reach
Loughlinter
!
<EOS>
Come
along
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
take
you
off
the
mountain
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
must
allow
me
to
take
you
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
Mr.
Kennedy
led
the
way
down
to
Donald
Bean
's
cottage
,
and
before
three
o'clock
Phineas
found
himself
mounted
on
a
shaggy
steed
,
which
,
in
sober
truth
,
was
not
much
bigger
than
a
large
dog
.
<EOS>
"
If
Mr.
Kennedy
is
really
my
rival
,
"
said
Phineas
to
himself
,
as
he
trotted
along
,
"
I
almost
think
that
I
am
doing
an
unhandsome
thing
in
taking
the
pony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
five
o'clock
he
was
under
the
portico
before
the
front
door
,
and
there
he
found
Lady
Laura
waiting
for
him
,
 
waiting
for
him
,
or
at
least
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
on
her
hat
and
gloves
and
light
shawl
,
and
her
parasol
was
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
her
look
so
young
,
so
pretty
,
and
so
fit
to
receive
a
lover
's
vows
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
same
moment
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
was
Lady
Laura
Standish
,
the
daughter
of
an
Earl
,
the
descendant
of
a
line
of
Earls
,
 
and
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
simple
country
doctor
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Was
it
fitting
that
he
should
ask
such
a
woman
to
be
his
wife
?
<EOS>
But
then
Mr.
Kennedy
was
the
son
of
a
man
who
had
walked
into
Glasgow
with
half
-
a
-
crown
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
's
grandfather
had
been
,
 
<EOS>
Phineas
thought
that
he
had
heard
that
Mr.
Kennedy
's
grandfather
had
been
a
Scotch
drover
;
whereas
his
own
grandfather
had
been
a
little
squire
near
Ennistimon
,
in
county
Clare
,
and
his
own
first
cousin
once
removed
still
held
the
paternal
acres
at
Finn
Grove
.
<EOS>
His
family
was
supposed
to
be
descended
from
kings
in
that
part
of
Ireland
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
did
not
become
him
to
fear
Lady
Laura
on
the
score
of
rank
,
if
it
was
to
be
allowed
to
Mr.
Kennedy
to
proceed
without
fear
on
that
head
.
<EOS>
As
to
wealth
,
Lady
Laura
had
already
told
him
that
her
fortune
was
no
greater
than
his
.
<EOS>
Her
statement
to
himself
on
that
head
made
him
feel
that
he
should
not
hesitate
on
the
score
of
money
.
<EOS>
They
neither
had
any
,
and
he
was
willing
to
work
for
both
.
<EOS>
If
she
feared
the
risk
,
let
her
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
he
argued
with
himself
;
but
yet
he
knew
,
 
knew
as
well
as
the
reader
will
know
,
 
that
he
was
going
to
do
that
which
he
had
no
right
to
do
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
very
well
for
him
to
wait
,
 
presuming
him
to
be
successful
in
his
love
,
 
for
the
opening
of
that
oyster
with
his
political
sword
,
that
oyster
on
which
he
proposed
that
they
should
both
live
;
but
such
waiting
could
not
well
be
to
the
taste
of
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
It
could
hardly
be
pleasant
to
her
to
look
forward
to
his
being
made
a
junior
lord
or
an
assistant
secretary
before
she
could
establish
herself
in
her
home
.
<EOS>
So
he
told
himself
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
told
himself
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
persevere
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
expect
you
in
the
least
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
spoke
very
positively
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
are
things
as
to
which
a
man
may
be
very
positive
,
and
yet
may
be
allowed
to
fail
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
how
on
earth
did
you
get
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
got
me
a
pony
,
 
Donald
Bean
's
pony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
told
him
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
told
him
why
I
was
coming
,
and
that
I
must
be
here
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
the
trouble
to
come
all
the
way
off
the
mountain
to
persuade
Donald
to
lend
me
his
pony
.
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
that
Mr.
Kennedy
has
conquered
me
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
of
that
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
he
would
,
 
unless
it
were
your
own
fault
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
up
the
path
by
the
brook
,
from
bridge
to
bridge
,
till
they
found
themselves
out
upon
the
open
mountain
at
the
top
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
resolved
that
he
would
not
speak
out
his
mind
till
he
found
himself
on
that
spot
;
that
then
he
would
ask
her
to
sit
down
,
and
that
while
she
was
so
seated
he
would
tell
her
everything
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
he
had
on
his
head
a
Scotch
cap
with
a
grouse
's
feather
in
it
,
and
he
was
dressed
in
a
velvet
shooting
-
jacket
and
dark
knickerbockers
;
and
was
certainly
,
in
this
costume
,
as
handsome
a
man
as
any
woman
would
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
,
too
,
a
look
of
breeding
about
him
which
had
come
to
him
,
no
doubt
,
from
the
royal
Finns
of
old
,
which
ever
served
him
in
great
stead
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
indeed
,
only
Phineas
Finn
,
and
was
known
by
the
world
to
be
no
more
;
but
he
looked
as
though
he
might
have
been
anybody
,
 
a
royal
Finn
himself
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
had
that
special
grace
of
appearing
to
be
altogether
unconscious
of
his
own
personal
advantages
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
that
in
truth
he
was
barely
conscious
of
them
;
that
he
depended
on
them
very
little
,
if
at
all
;
that
there
was
nothing
of
personal
vanity
in
his
composition
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
indulged
in
any
hope
that
Lady
Laura
would
accept
him
because
he
was
a
handsome
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
all
that
climbing
,
"
he
said
,
"
will
you
not
sit
down
for
a
moment
?
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
to
her
she
looked
at
him
and
told
herself
that
he
was
as
handsome
as
a
god
.
<EOS>
"
Do
sit
down
for
one
moment
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
something
that
I
desire
to
say
to
you
,
and
to
say
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
she
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
also
have
something
to
tell
you
,
and
will
say
it
while
I
am
yet
standing
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
I
accepted
an
offer
of
marriage
from
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
am
too
late
,
"
said
Phineas
,
and
putting
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
coat
,
he
turned
his
back
upon
her
,
and
walked
away
across
the
mountain
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
fool
he
had
been
to
let
her
know
his
secret
when
her
knowledge
of
it
could
be
of
no
service
to
him
,
 
when
her
knowledge
of
it
could
only
make
him
appear
foolish
in
her
eyes
!
<EOS>
But
for
his
life
he
could
not
have
kept
his
secret
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Nor
now
could
he
bring
himself
to
utter
a
word
of
even
decent
civility
.
<EOS>
But
he
went
on
walking
as
though
he
could
thus
leave
her
there
,
and
never
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
What
an
ass
he
had
been
in
supposing
that
she
cared
for
him
!
<EOS>
What
a
fool
to
imagine
that
his
poverty
could
stand
a
chance
against
the
wealth
of
Loughlinter
!
<EOS>
But
why
had
she
lured
him
on
?
<EOS>
How
he
wished
that
he
were
now
grinding
,
hard
at
work
in
Mr.
Low
's
chambers
,
or
sitting
at
home
at
Killaloe
with
the
hand
of
that
pretty
little
Irish
girl
within
his
own
!
  
<EOS>
Presently
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
,
 
calling
him
gently
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
and
found
that
she
was
very
near
him
.
<EOS>
He
himself
had
then
been
standing
still
for
some
moments
,
and
she
had
followed
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
:
what
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
And
turning
round
he
made
an
attempt
to
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
not
wish
me
joy
,
or
say
a
word
of
congratulation
?
<EOS>
Had
I
not
thought
much
of
your
friendship
,
I
should
not
have
been
so
quick
to
tell
you
of
my
destiny
.
<EOS>
No
one
else
has
been
told
,
except
papa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
hope
you
will
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
do
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
he
lent
me
the
pony
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
forget
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Forget
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
need
forget
nothing
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
<EOS>
for
nothing
has
been
said
that
need
be
regretted
.
<EOS>
Only
wish
me
joy
,
and
all
will
be
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Laura
,
I
do
wish
you
joy
,
with
all
my
heart
,
 
but
that
will
not
make
all
things
pleasant
.
<EOS>
I
came
up
here
to
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
no
,
no
;
do
not
say
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
said
it
,
and
will
say
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
,
poor
,
penniless
,
plain
simple
fool
that
I
am
,
have
been
ass
enough
to
love
you
,
Lady
Laura
Standish
;
and
I
brought
you
up
here
to
-
day
to
ask
you
to
share
with
me
 
my
nothingness
.
<EOS>
And
this
I
have
done
on
soil
that
is
to
be
all
your
own
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
that
you
regard
me
as
a
conceited
fool
,
 
as
a
bewildered
idiot
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
regard
you
as
a
dear
friend
,
 
both
of
my
own
and
of
my
husband
,
"
said
she
,
offering
him
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
I
have
had
a
chance
,
I
wonder
,
if
I
had
spoken
a
week
since
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
answer
such
a
question
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
Or
,
rather
,
I
will
,
answer
it
fully
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
week
since
we
told
each
other
,
you
to
me
and
I
to
you
,
that
we
were
both
poor
,
 
both
without
other
means
than
those
which
come
to
us
from
our
fathers
.
<EOS>
You
will
make
your
way
;
 
will
make
it
surely
;
but
how
at
present
could
you
marry
any
woman
unless
she
had
money
of
her
own
?
<EOS>
For
me
,
 
like
so
many
other
girls
,
it
was
necessary
that
I
should
stay
at
home
or
marry
some
one
rich
enough
to
dispense
with
fortune
in
a
wife
.
<EOS>
The
man
whom
in
all
the
world
<EOS>
I
think
the
best
has
asked
me
to
share
everything
with
him
;
 
and
I
have
thought
it
wise
to
accept
his
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
was
fool
enough
to
think
that
you
loved
me
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
To
this
she
made
no
immediate
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
was
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
owe
it
you
to
tell
you
what
a
fool
I
have
been
.
<EOS>
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
loved
me
.
<EOS>
At
least
I
thought
that
perhaps
you
loved
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
a
child
wanting
the
moon
;
 
was
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
should
I
not
have
loved
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
slowly
,
laying
her
hand
gently
upon
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
Because
Loughlinter
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Stop
,
Mr.
Finn
;
stop
.
<EOS>
Do
not
say
to
me
any
unkind
word
that
I
have
not
deserved
,
and
that
would
make
a
breach
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
accepted
the
owner
of
Loughlinter
as
my
husband
,
because
I
verily
believe
that
I
shall
thus
do
my
duty
in
that
sphere
of
life
to
which
it
has
pleased
God
to
call
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
liked
him
,
and
I
will
love
him
.
<EOS>
For
you
,
 
may
I
trust
myself
to
speak
openly
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
trust
me
as
against
all
others
,
except
us
two
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
you
,
then
,
I
will
say
also
that
I
have
always
liked
you
since
I
knew
you
;
that
I
have
loved
you
as
a
friend
;
 
and
could
have
loved
you
otherwise
had
not
circumstances
showed
me
so
plainly
that
it
would
be
unwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lady
Laura
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
a
moment
.
<EOS>
And
pray
remember
that
what
I
say
to
you
now
must
never
be
repeated
to
any
ears
.
<EOS>
No
one
knows
it
but
my
father
,
my
brother
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Early
in
the
spring
I
paid
my
brother
's
debts
.
<EOS>
His
affection
to
me
is
more
than
a
return
for
what
I
have
done
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
did
this
,
 
when
I
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
,
I
made
up
my
mind
also
that
I
could
not
allow
myself
the
same
freedom
of
choice
which
would
otherwise
have
belonged
to
me
.
<EOS>
Will
that
be
sufficient
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
answer
you
,
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
Sufficient
!
<EOS>
And
you
are
not
angry
with
me
for
what
I
have
said
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
I
am
not
angry
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
understood
,
of
course
,
that
nothing
of
this
shall
ever
be
repeated
,
 
even
among
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Is
that
a
bargain
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
speak
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
will
wish
me
joy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
wished
you
joy
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
do
so
again
.
<EOS>
May
you
have
every
blessing
which
the
world
can
give
you
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
expect
me
to
be
very
jovial
for
awhile
myself
;
but
there
will
be
nobody
to
see
my
melancholy
moods
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
hiding
myself
away
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
When
is
the
marriage
to
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
has
been
said
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
guided
by
him
,
 
but
there
must
,
of
course
,
be
delay
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
settlements
and
I
know
not
what
.
<EOS>
It
may
probably
be
in
the
spring
,
 
or
perhaps
the
summer
.
<EOS>
I
shall
do
just
what
my
betters
tell
me
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
now
seated
himself
on
the
exact
stone
on
which
he
had
wished
her
to
sit
when
he
proposed
to
tell
his
own
story
,
and
was
looking
forth
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
that
everything
had
been
changed
for
him
while
he
had
been
up
there
upon
the
mountain
,
and
that
the
change
had
been
marvellous
in
its
nature
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
been
coming
up
,
there
had
been
apparently
two
alternatives
before
him
:
the
glory
of
successful
love
,
 
which
,
indeed
,
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
most
improbable
result
of
the
coming
interview
,
 
and
the
despair
and
utter
banishment
attendant
on
disdainful
rejection
.
<EOS>
But
his
position
was
far
removed
from
either
of
these
alternatives
.
<EOS>
She
had
almost
told
him
that
she
would
have
loved
him
<EOS>
had
she
not
been
poor
,
 
that
she
was
beginning
to
love
him
and
had
quenched
her
love
,
because
it
had
become
impossible
to
her
to
marry
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
In
such
circumstances
he
could
not
be
angry
with
her
,
 
he
could
not
quarrel
with
her
;
he
could
not
do
other
than
swear
to
himself
that
he
would
be
her
friend
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
loved
her
better
than
ever
;
 
and
she
was
the
promised
wife
of
his
rival
!
<EOS>
Why
had
not
Donald
Bean
's
pony
broken
his
neck
?
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
down
now
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
"
  
"
You
will
not
go
on
by
the
lake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
use
?
<EOS>
It
is
all
the
same
now
.
<EOS>
You
will
want
to
be
back
to
receive
him
in
from
shooting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
He
is
above
those
little
cares
.
<EOS>
But
it
will
be
<EOS>
as
well
we
should
go
the
nearest
way
,
as
we
have
spent
so
much
of
our
time
here
.
<EOS>
I
shall
tell
Mr.
Kennedy
that
I
have
told
you
,
 
if
you
do
not
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
what
you
please
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
wo
n't
have
it
taken
in
that
way
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Your
brusque
want
of
courtesy
to
me
<EOS>
I
have
forgiven
,
but
I
shall
expect
you
to
make
up
for
it
by
the
alacrity
of
your
congratulations
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
you
uncourteous
to
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
have
been
uncourteous
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
We
are
old
friends
,
and
may
take
the
liberty
of
speaking
plainly
to
each
other
;
 
but
you
will
owe
it
to
Mr.
Kennedy
to
be
gracious
.
<EOS>
Think
of
the
pony
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
walked
back
to
the
house
together
,
and
as
they
went
down
the
path
very
little
was
said
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
were
about
to
come
out
upon
the
open
lawn
,
while
they
were
still
under
cover
of
the
rocks
and
shrubs
,
Phineas
stopped
his
companion
by
standing
before
her
,
and
then
he
made
his
farewell
speech
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
good
-
bye
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
away
early
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
and
God
bless
you
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
hand
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
And
she
gave
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
you
know
what
it
is
to
love
dearly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
to
be
in
love
!
<EOS>
I
believe
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
And
to
miss
your
love
!
<EOS>
I
think
,
 
I
am
bound
to
think
that
you
have
never
been
so
tormented
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
sore
;
 
but
I
will
do
my
best
,
like
a
man
,
to
get
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
,
my
friend
,
do
.
<EOS>
So
small
a
trouble
will
never
weigh
heavily
on
shoulders
such
as
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
will
weigh
very
heavily
,
but
I
will
struggle
hard
that
it
may
not
crush
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
loved
you
so
dearly
!
<EOS>
As
we
are
parting
give
me
one
kiss
,
that
I
may
think
of
it
and
treasure
it
in
my
memory
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
murmuring
words
she
spoke
to
express
her
refusal
of
such
a
request
,
I
will
not
quote
;
but
the
kiss
had
been
taken
before
the
denial
was
completed
,
and
then
they
walked
on
in
silence
together
,
 
and
in
peace
,
towards
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
six
or
seven
men
were
going
away
,
and
there
was
an
early
breakfast
.
<EOS>
There
were
none
of
the
ladies
there
,
but
Mr.
Kennedy
,
the
host
,
was
among
his
friends
.
<EOS>
A
large
drag
with
four
horses
was
there
to
take
the
travellers
and
their
luggage
to
the
station
,
and
there
was
naturally
a
good
deal
of
noise
at
the
front
door
as
the
preparations
for
the
departure
were
made
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
them
Mr.
Kennedy
took
our
hero
aside
.
"
<EOS>
Laura
has
told
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
that
she
has
acquainted
you
with
my
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
congratulate
you
most
heartily
,
"
said
Phineas
,
grasping
the
other
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
indeed
a
lucky
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
myself
to
be
so
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
Such
a
wife
was
all
that
was
wanting
to
me
,
and
such
a
wife
is
very
hard
to
find
.
<EOS>
Will
you
remember
,
Finn
,
that
Loughlinter
will
never
be
so
full
but
what
there
will
be
a
room
for
you
,
or
so
empty
<EOS>
but
what
you
will
be
made
welcome
?
<EOS>
I
say
this
on
Lady
Laura
's
part
and
on
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
was
being
carried
away
to
the
railway
station
,
could
not
keep
himself
from
speculating
as
to
how
much
Kennedy
knew
of
what
had
taken
place
during
the
walk
up
the
Linter
.
<EOS>
Of
one
small
circumstance
that
had
occurred
,
he
felt
quite
sure
that
Mr.
Kennedy
knew
nothing
.
   
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
Returns
to
Killaloe
 
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
's
first
session
of
Parliament
was
over
,
 
his
first
session
with
all
its
adventures
.
<EOS>
When
he
got
back
to
Mrs.
Bunce
's
house
,
 
for
Mrs.
Bunce
received
him
for
a
night
in
spite
of
her
husband
's
advice
to
the
contrary
,
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
he
almost
felt
that
Mrs.
Bunce
and
her
rooms
were
beneath
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
was
very
unhappy
,
 
as
wretched
as
a
man
can
be
;
there
were
moments
in
which
he
thought
that
it
would
hardly
become
him
to
live
unless
he
could
do
something
to
prevent
the
marriage
of
Lady
Laura
and
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
he
had
his
consolations
.
<EOS>
These
were
reflections
which
had
in
them
much
of
melancholy
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
despised
by
the
woman
to
whom
he
had
told
his
love
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
shown
him
that
she
thought
him
to
be
unworthy
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
regarded
his
love
as
an
offence
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
had
almost
told
him
that
prudence
alone
had
forbidden
her
to
return
his
passion
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
kissed
her
,
and
had
afterwards
parted
from
her
as
a
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
there
should
have
been
a
flavour
of
exquisite
joy
in
the
midst
of
his
agony
as
he
thought
of
this
;
 
but
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
kiss
her
again
.
<EOS>
All
future
delights
of
that
kind
would
belong
to
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
he
had
no
real
idea
of
interfering
with
that
gentleman
in
the
fruition
of
his
privileges
.
<EOS>
But
still
there
was
the
kiss
,
 
an
eternal
fact
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
in
all
respects
except
that
of
his
love
,
his
visit
to
Loughlinter
had
been
pre
-
eminently
successful
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
had
become
his
friend
,
and
had
encouraged
him
to
speak
during
the
next
session
,
 
setting
before
him
various
models
,
and
prescribing
for
him
a
course
of
reading
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
had
become
intimate
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
on
pleasant
terms
with
Mr.
Palliser
and
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
Mr.
Kennedy
,
 
he
and
Mr.
Kennedy
were
almost
bosom
friends
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
quite
surpassed
the
Ratlers
,
Fitzgibbons
,
and
Bonteens
in
that
politico
-
social
success
which
goes
so
far
towards
downright
political
success
,
and
which
in
itself
is
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
He
had
surpassed
these
men
in
spite
of
their
offices
and
their
acquired
positions
,
and
could
not
but
think
that
even
Mr.
Low
,
if
he
knew
it
all
,
would
confess
that
he
had
been
right
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
his
bosom
friendship
with
Mr.
Kennedy
,
that
of
course
troubled
him
.
<EOS>
Ought
he
not
to
be
driving
a
poniard
into
Mr.
Kennedy
's
heart
?
<EOS>
The
conventions
of
life
forbade
that
;
and
therefore
the
bosom
friendship
was
to
be
excused
.
<EOS>
If
not
an
enemy
to
the
death
,
then
there
could
be
no
reason
why
he
should
not
be
a
bosom
friend
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
over
to
Ireland
,
staying
but
one
night
with
Mrs.
Bunce
,
and
came
down
upon
them
at
Killaloe
like
a
god
out
of
the
heavens
.
<EOS>
Even
his
father
was
well
-
nigh
overwhelmed
by
admiration
,
and
his
mother
and
sisters
thought
themselves
only
fit
to
minister
to
his
pleasures
.
<EOS>
He
had
learned
,
if
he
had
learned
nothing
else
,
to
look
as
though
he
were
master
of
the
circumstances
around
him
,
and
was
entirely
free
from
internal
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
When
his
father
spoke
to
him
about
his
legal
studies
,
he
did
not
exactly
laugh
at
his
father
's
ignorance
,
but
he
recapitulated
to
his
father
so
much
of
Mr.
Monk
's
wisdom
at
second
hand
,
 
showing
plainly
that
it
was
his
business
to
study
the
arts
of
speech
and
the
technicalities
of
the
House
,
and
not
to
study
law
,
 
that
his
father
had
nothing
further
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
a
man
of
such
dimensions
that
an
ordinary
father
could
hardly
dare
to
inquire
into
his
proceedings
;
and
as
for
an
ordinary
mother
,
 
such
as
Mrs.
Finn
certainly
was
,
 
she
could
do
no
more
than
look
after
her
son
's
linen
with
awe
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
 
the
reader
I
hope
will
not
quite
have
forgotten
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
 
was
in
a
great
tremor
when
first
she
met
the
hero
of
Loughshane
after
returning
from
the
honours
of
his
first
session
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
somewhat
disappointed
because
the
newspapers
had
not
been
full
of
the
speeches
he
had
made
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
the
ladies
of
the
Finn
household
had
all
been
ill
at
ease
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
imagine
why
Phineas
had
restrained
himself
with
so
much
philosophy
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Flood
Jones
in
discussing
the
matter
with
the
Miss
Finns
had
never
expressed
the
slightest
doubt
of
his
capacity
or
his
judgment
.
<EOS>
And
when
tidings
came
,
 
the
tidings
came
in
a
letter
from
Phineas
to
his
father
,
 
that
he
did
not
intend
to
speak
that
session
,
because
speeches
from
a
young
member
on
his
first
session
were
thought
to
be
inexpedient
,
Miss
Flood
Jones
and
the
Miss
Finns
were
quite
willing
to
accept
the
wisdom
of
this
decision
,
much
as
they
might
regret
the
effect
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
when
she
met
her
hero
,
hardly
dared
to
look
him
in
the
face
,
but
she
remembered
accurately
all
the
circumstances
of
her
last
interview
with
him
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
he
wore
that
ringlet
near
his
heart
?
<EOS>
Mary
had
received
from
Barbara
Finn
certain
hairs
supposed
to
have
come
from
the
head
of
Phineas
,
and
these
she
always
wore
near
her
own
.
<EOS>
And
moreover
,
since
she
had
seen
Phineas
she
had
refused
an
offer
of
marriage
from
Mr.
Elias
Bodkin
<EOS>
,
 
had
refused
it
almost
ignominiously
,
 
and
when
doing
so
had
told
herself
that
she
would
never
be
false
to
Phineas
Finn
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
think
it
so
good
of
you
to
come
to
see
us
again
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
to
come
home
to
my
own
people
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
might
be
staying
with
plenty
of
grandees
if
you
liked
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
It
did
happen
by
accident
that
I
had
to
go
to
the
house
of
a
man
whom
perhaps
you
would
call
a
grandee
,
and
to
meet
grandees
there
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
only
for
a
few
days
,
and
I
am
very
glad
to
be
taken
in
again
here
,
I
can
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
very
glad
we
all
are
to
have
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
glad
to
see
me
,
Mary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
glad
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
not
be
glad
,
and
Barbara
the
dearest
friend
I
have
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
Of
course
she
talks
about
you
,
 
and
that
makes
me
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
,
Mary
,
how
often
I
think
about
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mary
,
who
was
very
happy
at
hearing
such
words
,
and
who
was
walking
in
to
dinner
with
him
at
the
moment
,
could
not
refrain
herself
from
pressing
his
arm
with
her
little
fingers
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
Phineas
in
his
position
could
not
marry
at
once
;
but
she
would
wait
for
him
,
 
oh
,
for
ever
,
if
he
would
only
ask
her
.
<EOS>
He
of
course
was
a
wicked
traitor
to
tell
her
that
he
was
wo
nt
to
think
of
her
.
<EOS>
But
Jove
smiles
at
lovers
'
perjuries
;
 
and
it
is
well
that
he
should
do
so
,
as
such
perjuries
can
hardly
be
avoided
altogether
in
the
difficult
circumstances
of
a
successful
gentleman
's
life
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
a
traitor
,
of
course
,
but
he
was
almost
forced
to
be
a
traitor
,
by
the
simple
fact
that
Lady
Laura
Standish
was
in
London
,
and
Mary
Flood
Jones
in
Killaloe
.
  
<EOS>
He
remained
for
nearly
five
months
at
Killaloe
,
and
I
doubt
whether
his
time
was
altogether
well
spent
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
books
recommended
to
him
by
Mr.
Monk
he
probably
did
read
,
and
was
often
to
be
found
encompassed
by
blue
books
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
there
was
a
grain
of
pretence
about
his
blue
books
and
parliamentary
papers
,
and
that
in
these
days
he
was
,
in
a
gentle
way
,
something
of
an
impostor
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
be
angry
with
me
for
not
going
to
you
,
"
he
said
once
to
Mary
's
mother
when
he
had
declined
an
invitation
to
drink
tea
;
"
but
the
fact
is
that
my
time
is
not
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
make
any
apologies
.
<EOS>
We
are
quite
aware
that
we
have
very
little
to
offer
,
"
said
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
,
who
was
not
altogether
happy
about
Mary
,
and
who
perhaps
knew
more
about
members
of
Parliament
and
blue
books
than
Phineas
Finn
had
supposed
.
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
you
are
a
fool
to
think
of
that
man
,
"
the
mother
said
to
her
daughter
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
of
him
,
mamma
;
not
particularly
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
is
no
better
than
anybody
else
that
I
can
see
,
and
he
is
beginning
to
give
himself
airs
,
"
said
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
Mary
made
no
answer
;
but
she
went
up
into
her
room
and
swore
before
a
figure
of
the
Virgin
that
she
would
be
true
to
Phineas
for
ever
and
ever
,
in
spite
of
her
mother
,
in
spite
of
all
the
world
,
 
in
spite
,
should
it
be
necessary
,
even
of
himself
.
  
<EOS>
About
<EOS>
Christmas
time
there
came
a
discussion
between
Phineas
and
his
father
about
money
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
find
you
get
on
pretty
well
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
who
thought
that
he
had
been
liberal
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
tight
fit
,
"
said
Phineas
,
 
who
was
less
afraid
of
his
father
than
he
had
been
when
he
last
discussed
these
things
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
it
would
have
been
ample
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
for
a
moment
,
sir
,
that
I
am
complaining
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
is
much
more
than
I
have
a
right
to
expect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
began
to
make
an
inquiry
within
his
own
breast
as
to
whether
his
son
had
a
right
to
expect
anything
;
 
whether
the
time
had
not
come
in
which
his
son
should
be
earning
his
own
bread
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
pause
,
"
there
is
no
chance
of
your
doing
anything
at
the
bar
now
?
"
  
"
Not
immediately
.
<EOS>
It
is
almost
impossible
to
combine
the
two
studies
together
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
himself
was
aware
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
I
have
given
the
profession
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
 
after
all
the
money
it
has
cost
us
.
"
  
"
By
no
means
,
sir
.
<EOS>
And
all
that
I
am
doing
now
will
,
I
trust
,
be
of
assistance
to
me
when
I
shall
come
back
to
work
at
the
law
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
is
on
the
cards
that
I
may
go
into
office
,
 
and
if
so
,
public
business
will
become
my
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
be
turned
out
with
the
Ministry
!
"
  
"
Yes
;
that
is
true
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
must
run
my
chance
.
<EOS>
If
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
,
I
hope
I
might
be
able
to
secure
some
permanent
place
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
that
I
can
hardly
fail
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
I
trust
I
may
never
be
driven
to
want
it
.
<EOS>
I
thought
,
however
,
that
we
had
settled
all
this
before
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
assumed
a
look
of
injured
innocence
,
as
though
his
father
was
driving
him
too
hard
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
in
the
mean
time
your
money
has
been
enough
?
"
said
the
doctor
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
intended
to
ask
you
to
advance
me
a
hundred
pounds
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
There
were
expenses
to
which
I
was
driven
on
first
entering
Parliament
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
A
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
it
be
inconvenient
,
sir
,
I
can
do
without
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
not
as
yet
paid
for
his
gun
,
or
for
that
velvet
coat
in
which
he
had
been
shooting
,
or
,
most
probably
,
for
the
knickerbockers
.
<EOS>
He
knew
he
wanted
the
hundred
pounds
badly
;
but
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
in
asking
for
it
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
once
in
office
,
 
though
the
office
were
but
a
sorry
junior
lordship
,
 
he
would
repay
his
father
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
,
of
course
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
but
do
not
let
the
necessity
for
asking
for
more
hundreds
come
oftener
than
you
can
help
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
said
that
he
would
not
,
and
then
there
was
no
further
discourse
about
money
.
<EOS>
It
need
hardly
be
said
that
he
told
his
father
nothing
of
that
bill
which
he
had
endorsed
for
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
came
the
time
which
called
him
again
to
London
and
the
glories
of
London
life
,
 
to
lobbies
,
and
the
clubs
,
and
the
gossip
of
men
in
office
,
and
the
chance
of
promotion
for
himself
;
to
the
glare
of
the
gas
-
lamps
,
the
mock
anger
of
rival
debaters
,
and
the
prospect
of
the
Speaker
's
wig
.
<EOS>
During
the
idleness
of
the
recess
he
had
resolved
at
any
rate
upon
this
,
 
that
a
month
of
the
session
should
not
have
passed
by
before
he
had
been
seen
upon
his
legs
in
the
House
,
 
had
been
seen
and
heard
.
<EOS>
And
many
a
time
as
he
had
wandered
alone
,
with
his
gun
,
across
the
bogs
which
lie
on
the
other
side
of
the
Shannon
from
Killaloe
,
he
had
practised
the
sort
of
address
which
he
would
make
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
short
,
 
always
short
;
and
he
would
eschew
all
action
and
gesticulation
;
Mr.
Monk
had
been
very
urgent
in
his
instructions
to
him
on
that
head
;
but
he
would
be
especially
careful
that
no
words
should
escape
him
which
had
not
in
them
some
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
wrong
in
his
purpose
,
but
purpose
there
should
be
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
twitted
more
than
once
at
Killaloe
with
his
silence
;
 
for
it
had
been
conceived
by
his
fellow
-
townsmen
that
he
had
been
sent
to
Parliament
on
the
special
ground
of
his
eloquence
.
<EOS>
They
should
twit
him
no
more
on
his
next
return
.
<EOS>
He
would
speak
and
would
carry
the
House
with
him
if
a
human
effort
might
prevail
.
  
<EOS>
So
he
packed
up
his
things
,
and
started
again
for
London
in
the
beginning
of
February
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Mary
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
with
his
sweetest
smile
.
<EOS>
But
on
this
occasion
there
was
no
kiss
,
and
no
culling
of
locks
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
he
can
not
help
it
,
"
said
Mary
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
his
position
.
<EOS>
But
whether
it
be
for
good
or
evil
,
I
will
be
true
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
are
unhappy
,
"
Babara
Finn
said
to
her
on
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
am
not
unhappy
,
 
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
deal
to
make
me
happy
and
proud
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
a
bit
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
turned
away
and
cried
heartily
,
and
Barbara
Finn
cried
with
her
for
company
.
   
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
Returns
to
London
 
<EOS>
Phineas
had
received
two
letters
during
his
recess
at
Killaloe
from
two
women
who
admired
him
much
,
which
,
as
they
were
both
short
,
shall
be
submitted
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
as
follows
:
    
Saulsby
,
October
20
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MR
.
<EOS>
FINN
,
  
<EOS>
I
write
a
line
to
tell
you
that
our
marriage
is
to
be
hurried
on
as
quickly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
does
not
like
to
be
absent
from
Parliament
;
nor
will
he
be
content
to
postpone
the
ceremony
till
the
session
be
over
.
<EOS>
The
day
fixed
is
the
3rd
of
December
,
and
we
then
go
at
once
to
Rome
,
and
intend
to
be
back
in
London
by
the
opening
of
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
most
sincerely
,
  
LAURA
STANDISH

<EOS>
Our
London
address
will
be
No
.
52
,
Grosvenor
Place
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
he
wrote
an
answer
as
short
,
expressing
his
ardent
wishes
that
those
winter
hymeneals
might
produce
nothing
but
happiness
,
and
saying
that
he
would
not
be
in
town
many
days
before
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
No
.
52
,
Grosvenor
Place
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
second
letter
was
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
December
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
AND
HONOURED
SIR
<EOS>
,
  
Bunce
is
getting
ever
so
anxious
about
the
rooms
,
and
says
as
how
he
has
a
young
Equity
draftsman
and
wife
and
baby
as
would
take
the
whole
house
,
and
all
because
Miss
Pouncefoot
said
a
word
about
her
port
wine
,
which
any
lady
of
her
age
might
say
in
her
tantrums
,
and
mean
nothing
after
all
.
<EOS>
Me
and
Miss
Pouncefoot
's
knowed
each
other
for
seven
years
,
and
what
's
a
word
or
two
<EOS>
as
is
n't
meant
after
that
?
<EOS>
But
,
honoured
sir
,
it
's
not
about
that
as
I
write
to
trouble
you
,
but
to
ask
if
I
may
say
for
certain
that
you
'll
take
the
rooms
again
in
February
.
<EOS>
It
's
easy
to
let
them
for
the
month
after
Christmas
,
because
of
the
pantomimes
.
<EOS>
Only
say
at
once
,
because
Bunce
is
nagging
me
day
after
day
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
nobody
's
wife
and
baby
to
have
to
do
for
,
and
'd
sooner
have
a
Parliament
gent
like
yourself
than
any
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
umbly
and
respectful
,
  
JANE
BUNCE
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
he
replied
that
he
would
certainly
come
back
to
the
rooms
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
should
he
be
lucky
enough
to
find
them
vacant
,
and
he
expressed
his
willingness
to
take
them
on
and
from
the
1st
of
February
.
<EOS>
And
on
the
3rd
of
February
he
found
himself
in
the
old
quarters
,
Mrs.
Bunce
having
contrived
,
with
much
conjugal
adroitness
,
both
to
keep
Miss
Pouncefoot
and
to
stave
off
the
Equity
draftsman
's
wife
and
baby
.
<EOS>
Bunce
,
however
,
received
Phineas
very
coldly
,
and
told
his
wife
the
same
evening
that
as
far
as
he
could
see
their
lodger
would
never
turn
up
to
be
a
trump
in
the
matter
of
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
means
well
,
why
did
he
go
and
stay
with
them
lords
down
in
Scotland
?
<EOS>
I
knows
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
knows
a
man
when
I
sees
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
,
who
's
looking
out
to
be
a
Tory
judge
some
of
these
days
,
is
a
deal
better
;
 
because
he
knows
what
he
's
after
.
"
  
<EOS>
Immediately
on
his
return
to
town
,
Phineas
found
himself
summoned
to
a
political
meeting
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
house
in
St.
James
's
Square
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
going
to
begin
in
earnest
this
time
,
"
Barrington
Erle
said
to
him
at
the
club
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
that
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
heard
all
about
it
down
at
Loughlinter
?
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
in
truth
,
Phineas
had
heard
very
little
of
any
settled
plan
down
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
He
had
played
a
game
of
chess
with
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
had
shot
a
stag
with
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
had
discussed
sheep
with
Lord
Brentford
,
but
had
hardly
heard
a
word
about
politics
from
any
one
of
those
influential
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
From
Mr.
Monk
he
had
heard
much
of
a
coming
Reform
Bill
;
but
his
communications
with
Mr.
Monk
had
rather
been
private
discussions
,
 
in
which
he
had
learned
Mr.
Monk
's
own
views
on
certain
points
,
 
than
revelations
on
the
intention
of
the
party
to
which
Mr.
Monk
belonged
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
of
nothing
settled
,
"
said
Phineas
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
we
are
to
have
a
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
suppose
we
are
not
to
touch
the
question
of
ballot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
difficulty
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
of
course
we
sha
n't
touch
it
as
long
as
Mr.
Mildmay
is
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
consent
to
the
ballot
as
First
Minister
of
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
would
Gresham
,
or
Palliser
,
"
said
Phineas
,
who
did
not
choose
to
bring
forward
his
greatest
gun
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
Gresham
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
say
what
Gresham
might
bring
himself
to
do
.
<EOS>
Gresham
is
a
man
who
may
go
any
lengths
before
he
has
done
.
<EOS>
Planty
Pall
,
"
 
for
such
was
the
name
by
which
Mr.
Plantagenet
Palliser
was
ordinarily
known
among
his
friends
,
 
"
would
of
course
go
with
Mr.
Mildmay
and
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
Monk
is
opposed
to
the
ballot
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
that
's
the
question
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
has
assented
to
the
proposition
of
a
measure
without
the
ballot
;
but
if
there
should
come
a
row
,
and
men
like
Turnbull
demand
it
,
and
the
London
mob
kick
up
a
shindy
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
how
far
Monk
would
be
steady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
he
says
,
he
'll
stick
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
your
leader
,
then
?
"
asked
Barrington
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
a
leader
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
leads
our
side
;
and
if
anybody
leads
me
,
he
does
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
great
faith
in
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
one
who
would
go
for
the
ballot
to
-
morrow
,
if
it
were
brought
forward
stoutly
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
to
Mr.
Ratler
a
few
minutes
afterwards
,
pointing
to
Phineas
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
much
of
that
young
man
,
"
said
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
and
Mr.
Ratler
had
put
their
heads
together
during
that
last
evening
at
Loughlinter
,
and
had
agreed
that
they
did
not
think
much
of
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
Why
did
Mr.
Kennedy
go
down
off
the
mountain
to
get
him
a
pony
?
<EOS>
And
why
did
Mr.
Gresham
play
chess
with
him
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
and
Mr.
Bonteen
may
have
been
right
in
making
up
their
minds
to
think
<EOS>
but
little
of
Phineas
Finn
,
but
Barrington
Erle
had
been
quite
wrong
when
he
had
said
that
Phineas
would
"
go
for
the
ballot
"
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
made
up
his
mind
very
strongly
that
he
would
always
oppose
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
That
he
would
hold
the
same
opinion
throughout
his
life
,
no
one
should
pretend
to
say
;
but
in
his
present
mood
,
and
under
the
tuition
which
he
had
received
from
Mr.
Monk
,
he
was
prepared
to
demonstrate
,
out
of
the
House
and
in
it
,
that
the
ballot
was
,
as
a
political
measure
,
unmanly
,
ineffective
,
and
enervating
.
<EOS>
Enervating
had
been
a
great
word
with
Mr.
Monk
,
and
Phineas
had
clung
to
it
with
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
The
meeting
took
place
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
on
the
third
day
of
the
session
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
of
course
heard
of
such
meetings
before
,
but
had
never
attended
one
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
had
been
no
such
gathering
when
Mr.
Mildmay
's
party
came
into
power
early
in
the
last
session
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
and
his
men
had
then
made
their
effort
in
turning
out
their
opponents
,
and
had
been
well
pleased
to
rest
awhile
upon
their
oars
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
they
must
go
again
to
work
,
and
therefore
the
liberal
party
was
collected
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
house
,
in
order
that
the
liberal
party
might
be
told
what
it
was
that
Mr.
Mildmay
and
his
Cabinet
intended
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
was
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
what
would
be
the
nature
of
the
performance
on
this
occasion
,
and
entertained
some
idea
that
every
gentleman
present
would
be
called
upon
to
express
individually
his
assent
or
dissent
in
regard
to
the
measure
proposed
.
<EOS>
He
walked
to
St.
James
's
Square
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
;
but
even
with
Fitzgibbon
was
ashamed
to
show
his
ignorance
by
asking
questions
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
,
"
this
kind
of
thing
means
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
know
as
well
as
possible
,
and
so
do
you
,
what
Mr.
Mildmay
will
say
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
Gresham
will
say
a
few
words
;
and
then
Turnbull
will
make
a
murmur
,
and
then
we
shall
all
assent
,
 
to
anything
or
to
nothing
;
 
and
then
it
will
be
over
.
"
<EOS>
Still
Phineas
did
not
understand
whether
the
assent
required
would
or
would
not
be
an
individual
personal
assent
.
<EOS>
When
the
affair
was
over
he
found
that
he
was
disappointed
,
and
that
he
might
almost
as
well
have
stayed
away
from
the
meeting
,
 
except
that
he
had
attended
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bidding
,
and
had
given
a
silent
adhesion
to
Mr.
Mildmay
's
plan
of
reform
for
that
session
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
been
very
nearly
correct
in
his
description
of
what
would
occur
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
made
a
long
speech
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
,
the
great
Radical
of
the
day
,
 
the
man
who
was
supposed
to
represent
what
many
called
the
Manchester
school
of
politics
,
 
asked
half
a
dozen
questions
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
these
Mr.
Gresham
made
a
short
speech
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Mildmay
made
another
speech
,
and
then
all
was
over
.
<EOS>
The
gist
of
the
whole
thing
was
,
that
there
should
be
a
Reform
Bill
,
 
very
generous
in
its
enlargement
of
the
franchise
,
 
but
no
ballot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
expressed
his
doubt
whether
this
would
be
satisfactory
to
the
country
;
but
even
Mr.
Turnbull
was
soft
in
his
tone
and
complaisant
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
As
there
was
no
reporter
present
,
 
<EOS>
that
plan
of
turning
private
meetings
at
gentlemen
's
houses
into
public
assemblies
not
having
been
as
yet
adopted
,
 
there
could
be
no
need
for
energy
or
violence
.
<EOS>
They
went
to
Mr.
Mildmay
's
house
to
hear
Mr.
Mildmay
's
plan
,
 
and
they
heard
it
.
  
<EOS>
Two
days
after
this
Phineas
was
to
dine
with
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
had
asked
him
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
give
dinner
parties
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
should
like
you
to
come
and
meet
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
accepted
the
invitation
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
who
said
that
Mr.
Turnbull
was
the
greatest
man
in
the
nation
,
and
that
the
nation
could
be
saved
only
by
a
direct
obedience
to
Mr.
Turnbull
's
instructions
.
<EOS>
Others
said
that
Mr.
Turnbull
was
a
demagogue
and
at
heart
a
rebel
;
that
he
was
un
-
English
,
false
and
very
dangerous
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
rather
inclined
to
believe
the
latter
statement
;
and
as
danger
and
dangerous
men
are
always
more
attractive
than
safety
and
safe
men
,
he
was
glad
to
have
an
opportunity
of
meeting
Mr.
Turnbull
at
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
he
went
to
call
on
Lady
Laura
,
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
the
last
evening
which
he
spent
in
her
company
at
Loughlinter
,
 
<EOS>
whom
,
when
he
was
last
speaking
to
her
,
he
had
kissed
close
beneath
the
falls
of
the
Linter
.
<EOS>
He
found
her
at
home
,
and
with
her
was
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
Darby
and
Joan
meeting
,
is
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
getting
up
to
welcome
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
Mr.
Kennedy
before
,
and
had
been
standing
close
to
him
during
the
meeting
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
find
you
both
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Robert
is
going
away
this
instant
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
he
told
you
of
our
adventures
at
Rome
?
"
  
"
Not
a
word
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
tell
you
;
 
but
not
now
.
<EOS>
The
dear
old
Pope
was
so
civil
to
us
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
think
it
quite
a
pity
that
he
should
be
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
be
off
,
"
said
the
husband
,
getting
up
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
meet
you
at
dinner
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
dine
at
Mr.
Monk
's
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
am
asked
expressly
to
hear
Turnbull
make
a
convert
of
you
.
<EOS>
There
are
only
to
be
us
four
.
<EOS>
Au
revoir
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Kennedy
went
,
and
Phineas
found
himself
alone
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
knew
how
to
address
her
,
and
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
prepared
himself
for
the
interview
as
he
ought
to
have
done
,
and
felt
himself
to
be
awkward
.
<EOS>
She
evidently
expected
him
to
speak
,
and
for
a
few
seconds
sat
waiting
for
what
he
might
say
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
she
found
that
it
was
incumbent
on
her
to
begin
.
<EOS>
"
Were
you
surprised
at
our
suddenness
when
you
got
my
note
?
"
  
"
A
little
.
<EOS>
You
had
spoken
of
waiting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
never
imagined
that
he
would
have
been
impetuous
.
<EOS>
And
he
seems
to
think
that
even
the
business
of
getting
himself
married
would
not
justify
him
staying
away
from
Parliament
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
rigid
martinet
in
all
matters
of
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
wonder
that
he
should
be
in
a
hurry
,
but
that
you
should
submit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
that
I
should
do
just
what
the
wise
people
told
me
.
<EOS>
I
asked
papa
,
and
he
said
that
it
would
be
better
.
<EOS>
So
the
lawyers
were
driven
out
of
their
minds
,
and
the
milliners
out
of
their
bodies
,
and
the
thing
was
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
there
at
the
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
That
I
know
is
what
you
mean
to
ask
.
<EOS>
Papa
said
that
he
might
come
if
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
Oswald
stipulated
that
he
should
be
received
as
a
son
.
<EOS>
Then
my
father
spoke
the
hardest
word
that
ever
fell
from
his
mouth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
will
not
repeat
it
,
 
not
altogether
.
<EOS>
But
he
said
that
Oswald
was
not
entitled
to
a
son
's
treatment
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
sore
about
my
money
,
because
Robert
was
so
generous
as
to
his
settlement
.
<EOS>
So
the
breach
between
them
is
as
wide
as
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
is
Chiltern
now
?
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Down
in
Northamptonshire
,
staying
at
some
inn
from
whence
he
hunts
.
<EOS>
He
tells
me
that
he
is
quite
alone
,
 
that
he
never
dines
out
,
never
has
any
one
to
dine
with
him
,
that
he
hunts
five
or
six
days
a
week
,
 
and
reads
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
a
bad
sort
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
the
reading
is
any
good
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
bear
that
he
should
be
so
solitary
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
breaks
down
in
it
,
then
his
companions
will
not
be
fit
for
him
.
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
hunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
 
at
home
in
county
Clare
.
<EOS>
All
Irishmen
hunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
go
down
to
him
and
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
delighted
to
have
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
thought
over
the
proposition
before
he
answered
it
,
and
then
made
the
reply
that
he
had
made
once
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
do
so
,
Lady
Laura
,
 
but
that
I
have
no
money
for
hunting
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alas
,
alas
!
"
said
she
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
that
hits
one
on
every
side
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
might
manage
it
,
 
for
a
couple
of
days
,
 
in
March
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
do
what
you
think
you
ought
not
to
do
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
certainly
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
like
it
,
and
if
I
can
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
could
mount
you
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
other
expense
now
,
and
keeps
a
stable
full
of
horses
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
has
seven
or
eight
.
<EOS>
And
now
tell
me
,
Mr.
Finn
;
when
are
you
going
to
charm
the
House
?
<EOS>
Or
is
it
your
first
intention
to
strike
terror
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
blushed
,
 
he
knew
that
he
blushed
as
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
suppose
I
shall
make
some
sort
of
attempt
before
long
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
the
idea
of
being
a
bore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
ought
to
speak
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
that
,
but
I
certainly
mean
to
try
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
lots
of
opportunities
about
the
new
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
know
that
Mr.
Mildmay
is
going
to
bring
it
in
at
once
.
<EOS>
You
hear
all
that
from
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
papa
has
told
me
.
<EOS>
I
still
see
papa
almost
every
day
.
<EOS>
You
must
call
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Mind
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
said
that
he
certainly
would
.
<EOS>
"
Papa
is
very
lonely
now
,
and
I
sometimes
feel
that
I
have
been
almost
cruel
in
deserting
him
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
that
he
has
a
horror
of
the
house
,
 
especially
later
in
the
year
,
 
always
fancying
that
he
will
meet
Oswald
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
unhappy
about
it
all
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
does
n't
your
brother
marry
?
"
said
Phineas
,
knowing
nothing
as
yet
of
Lord
Chiltern
and
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
were
to
marry
well
,
that
would
bring
your
father
round
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
it
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
why
should
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
paused
before
she
answered
;
and
then
she
told
the
whole
story
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
violently
in
love
,
and
the
girl
he
loves
has
refused
him
twice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
with
Miss
Effingham
?
"
asked
Phineas
,
guessing
the
truth
at
once
,
and
remembering
what
Miss
Effingham
had
said
to
him
when
riding
in
the
wood
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
with
Violet
Effingham
;
my
father
's
pet
,
his
favourite
,
whom
he
loves
next
to
myself
,
 
almost
as
well
as
myself
;
whom
he
would
really
welcome
as
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
would
gladly
make
her
mistress
of
his
house
,
and
of
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
Everything
would
then
go
smoothly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
does
not
like
Lord
Chiltern
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
loves
him
in
her
heart
;
but
she
is
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
As
she
says
herself
,
a
girl
is
bound
to
be
so
careful
of
herself
.
<EOS>
With
all
her
seeming
frolic
,
Violet
Effingham
is
very
wise
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
though
not
conscious
of
anything
akin
to
jealousy
,
was
annoyed
at
the
revelation
made
to
him
.
<EOS>
Since
he
had
heard
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
in
love
with
Miss
Effingham
,
he
did
not
like
Lord
Chiltern
quite
as
well
as
he
had
done
before
.
<EOS>
He
himself
had
simply
admired
Miss
Effingham
,
and
had
taken
pleasure
in
her
society
;
but
,
though
this
had
been
all
,
he
did
not
like
to
hear
of
another
man
wanting
to
marry
her
,
and
he
was
almost
angry
with
Lady
Laura
for
saying
that
she
believed
Miss
Effingham
loved
her
brother
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Effingham
had
twice
refused
Lord
Chiltern
,
that
ought
to
have
been
sufficient
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
Phineas
was
in
love
with
Miss
Effingham
himself
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
still
violently
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
any
other
love
was
of
course
impossible
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
was
something
offensive
to
him
in
the
story
as
it
had
been
told
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
be
wisdom
on
her
part
,
"
said
he
,
answering
Lady
Laura
's
last
words
<EOS>
,
"
you
can
not
find
fault
with
her
for
her
decision
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
find
no
fault
;
 
but
<EOS>
I
think
my
brother
would
make
her
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
when
she
was
left
alone
,
at
once
reverted
to
the
tone
in
which
Phineas
Finn
had
answered
her
remarks
about
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
very
ill
able
to
conceal
his
thoughts
,
and
wore
his
heart
almost
upon
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Can
it
be
possible
that
he
cares
for
her
himself
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
was
the
nature
of
Lady
Laura
's
first
question
to
herself
upon
the
matter
.
<EOS>
And
in
asking
herself
that
question
,
she
thought
nothing
of
the
disparity
in
rank
or
fortune
between
Phineas
Finn
and
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
it
occur
to
her
as
at
all
improbable
that
Violet
might
accept
the
love
of
him
who
had
so
lately
been
her
own
lover
.
<EOS>
But
the
idea
grated
against
her
wishes
on
two
sides
.
<EOS>
She
was
most
anxious
that
Violet
should
ultimately
become
her
brother
's
wife
,
 
<EOS>
and
she
could
not
be
pleased
that
Phineas
should
be
able
to
love
any
woman
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
beg
my
readers
not
to
be
carried
away
by
those
last
words
into
any
erroneous
conclusion
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
suppose
that
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
,
the
lately
married
bride
,
indulged
a
guilty
passion
for
the
young
man
who
had
loved
her
.
<EOS>
Though
she
had
probably
thought
often
of
Phineas
Finn
since
her
marriage
,
her
thoughts
had
never
been
of
a
nature
to
disturb
her
rest
.
<EOS>
It
had
never
occurred
to
her
even
to
think
that
she
regarded
him
with
any
feeling
that
was
an
offence
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
hated
herself
had
any
such
idea
presented
itself
to
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
prided
herself
on
being
a
pure
high
-
principled
woman
,
who
had
kept
so
strong
a
guard
upon
herself
as
to
be
nearly
free
from
the
dangers
of
those
rocks
upon
which
other
women
made
shipwreck
of
their
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
took
pride
in
this
,
and
would
then
blame
herself
for
her
own
pride
.
<EOS>
But
though
she
so
blamed
herself
,
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
think
that
to
her
there
might
be
danger
of
such
shipwreck
.
<EOS>
She
had
put
away
from
herself
the
idea
of
love
when
she
had
first
perceived
that
Phineas
had
regarded
her
with
more
than
friendship
,
and
had
accepted
Mr.
Kennedy
's
offer
with
an
assured
conviction
that
by
doing
so
she
was
acting
best
for
her
own
happiness
and
for
that
of
all
those
concerned
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
the
romance
of
the
position
to
be
sweet
when
Phineas
had
stood
with
her
at
the
top
of
the
falls
of
the
Linter
,
and
had
told
her
of
the
hopes
which
he
had
dared
to
indulge
.
<EOS>
And
when
at
the
bottom
of
the
falls
he
had
presumed
to
take
her
in
his
arms
,
she
had
forgiven
him
without
difficulty
to
herself
,
telling
herself
that
that
would
be
the
alpha
and
the
omega
of
the
romance
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
felt
herself
bound
to
tell
Mr.
Kennedy
of
what
had
occurred
,
 
but
she
had
felt
that
he
could
hardly
have
been
angry
<EOS>
even
had
he
been
told
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
often
thought
of
her
lover
since
,
and
of
his
love
,
 
telling
herself
that
she
too
had
once
had
a
lover
,
never
regarding
her
husband
in
that
light
;
but
her
thoughts
had
not
frightened
her
as
guilty
thoughts
will
do
.
<EOS>
There
had
come
a
romance
which
had
been
pleasant
,
and
it
was
gone
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
soon
banished
,
 
but
it
had
left
to
her
a
sweet
flavour
,
of
which
she
loved
to
taste
the
sweetness
though
she
knew
that
it
was
gone
.
<EOS>
And
the
man
should
be
her
friend
,
but
especially
her
husband
's
friend
.
<EOS>
It
should
be
her
care
to
see
that
his
life
was
successful
,
 
and
especially
her
husband
's
care
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
delight
to
her
to
know
that
her
husband
liked
the
man
.
<EOS>
And
the
man
would
marry
,
and
the
man
's
wife
should
be
her
friend
.
<EOS>
All
this
had
been
very
pure
and
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Now
an
idea
had
flitted
across
her
brain
that
the
man
was
in
love
with
some
one
else
,
 
and
she
did
not
like
it
!
  
<EOS>
But
she
did
not
therefore
become
afraid
of
herself
,
or
in
the
least
realise
at
once
the
danger
of
her
own
position
.
<EOS>
Her
immediate
glance
at
the
matter
did
not
go
beyond
the
falseness
of
men
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
so
,
as
she
suspected
,
 
if
Phineas
had
in
truth
transferred
his
affections
to
Violet
Effingham
,
of
how
little
value
was
the
love
of
such
a
man
!
<EOS>
It
did
not
occur
to
her
at
this
moment
that
she
also
had
transferred
hers
to
Robert
Kennedy
,
or
that
,
if
not
,
she
had
done
worse
.
<EOS>
But
she
did
remember
that
in
the
autumn
this
young
Phoebus
among
men
had
turned
his
back
upon
her
out
upon
the
mountain
that
he
might
hide
from
her
the
agony
of
his
heart
when
he
learned
that
she
was
to
be
the
wife
of
another
man
;
and
that
now
,
before
the
winter
was
over
,
he
could
not
hide
from
her
the
fact
that
his
heart
was
elsewhere
!
<EOS>
And
then
she
speculated
,
and
counted
up
facts
,
and
satisfied
herself
that
Phineas
could
not
even
have
seen
Violet
Effingham
since
they
two
had
stood
together
upon
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
How
false
are
men
!
 
<EOS>
how
false
and
how
weak
of
heart
!
  
<EOS>
"
Chiltern
and
Violet
Effingham
!
"
said
Phineas
to
himself
,
as
he
walked
away
from
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
fair
that
she
should
be
sacrificed
because
she
is
rich
,
and
because
she
is
so
winning
and
so
fascinating
that
Lord
Brentford
would
receive
even
his
son
for
the
sake
of
receiving
also
such
a
daughter
-
in
-
law
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
also
liked
Lord
Chiltern
;
had
seen
or
fancied
that
he
had
seen
fine
things
in
him
;
had
looked
forward
to
his
regeneration
,
hoping
,
perhaps
,
that
he
might
have
some
hand
in
the
good
work
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
recognise
the
propriety
of
sacrificing
Violet
Effingham
even
for
work
so
good
as
this
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Effingham
had
refused
Lord
Chiltern
twice
,
surely
that
ought
to
be
sufficient
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
occur
to
him
that
the
love
of
such
a
girl
as
Violet
would
be
a
great
treasure
 
to
himself
.
<EOS>
As
regarded
himself
,
he
was
still
in
love
,
 
hopelessly
in
love
,
with
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
!
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
Wednesday
evening
and
there
was
no
House
;
 
and
at
seven
o'clock
<EOS>
Phineas
was
at
Mr.
Monk
's
hall
door
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
first
of
the
guests
,
and
he
found
Mr.
Monk
alone
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
doing
butler
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
who
had
a
brace
of
decanters
in
his
hands
,
which
he
proceeded
to
put
down
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
finished
,
and
now
we
will
go
up
-
stairs
to
receive
the
two
great
men
properly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
for
coming
too
early
,
"
said
Finn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
minute
too
early
.
<EOS>
Seven
is
seven
,
and
it
is
I
who
am
too
late
.
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
bless
you
<EOS>
,
you
do
n't
think
I
'm
ashamed
of
being
found
in
the
act
of
decanting
my
own
wine
!
<EOS>
I
remember
Lord
Palmerston
saying
before
some
committee
about
salaries
,
five
or
six
years
ago
now
,
I
daresay
,
that
it
would
n't
do
for
an
English
Minister
to
have
his
hall
door
opened
by
a
maid
-
servant
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
'm
an
English
Minister
,
and
I
've
got
nobody
but
a
maid
-
servant
to
open
my
hall
door
,
and
I
'm
obliged
to
look
after
my
own
wine
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
it
's
improper
?
<EOS>
I
should
n't
like
to
be
the
means
of
injuring
the
British
Constitution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
if
you
resign
soon
,
and
if
nobody
follows
your
example
,
grave
evil
results
may
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sincerely
hope
so
,
for
I
do
love
the
British
Constitution
;
and
I
love
also
the
respect
in
which
members
of
the
English
Cabinet
are
held
.
<EOS>
Now
Turnbull
,
who
will
be
here
in
a
moment
,
hates
it
all
;
but
he
is
a
rich
man
,
and
has
more
powdered
footmen
hanging
about
his
house
than
ever
Lord
Palmerston
had
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
still
in
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
 
and
makes
his
thirty
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
Here
he
is
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
,
Turnbull
?
<EOS>
We
were
talking
about
my
maid
-
servant
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
opened
the
door
for
you
properly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
 
as
far
as
I
perceived
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
,
who
was
better
at
a
speech
than
a
joke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
very
respectable
young
woman
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
one
more
so
in
all
London
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
;
"
but
Finn
seems
to
think
that
I
ought
to
have
a
man
in
livery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
one
of
those
who
never
think
of
such
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
either
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
Then
the
laird
of
Loughlinter
was
announced
,
and
they
all
went
down
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
was
a
good
-
looking
robust
man
about
sixty
,
with
long
grey
hair
and
a
red
complexion
,
with
hard
eyes
,
a
well
-
cut
nose
,
and
full
lips
.
<EOS>
He
was
nearly
six
feet
high
,
stood
quite
upright
,
and
always
wore
a
black
swallow
-
tail
coat
,
black
trousers
,
and
a
black
silk
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
In
the
House
,
at
least
,
he
was
always
so
dressed
,
and
at
dinner
tables
.
<EOS>
What
difference
there
might
be
in
his
costume
<EOS>
when
at
home
at
Staleybridge
few
of
those
who
saw
him
in
London
had
the
means
of
knowing
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
his
face
to
indicate
special
talent
.
<EOS>
No
one
looking
at
him
would
take
him
to
be
a
fool
;
but
there
was
none
of
the
fire
of
genius
in
his
eye
,
nor
was
there
in
the
lines
of
his
mouth
any
of
that
play
of
thought
or
fancy
which
is
generally
to
be
found
in
the
faces
of
men
and
women
who
have
made
themselves
great
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
had
certainly
made
himself
great
,
and
could
hardly
have
done
so
without
force
of
intellect
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
the
most
popular
,
if
not
the
most
popular
politician
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Poor
men
believed
in
him
,
thinking
that
he
was
their
most
honest
public
friend
;
and
men
who
were
not
poor
believed
in
his
power
,
thinking
that
his
counsels
must
surely
prevail
.
<EOS>
He
had
obtained
the
ear
of
the
House
and
the
favour
of
the
reporters
,
and
opened
his
voice
at
no
public
dinner
,
on
no
public
platform
,
without
a
conviction
that
the
words
spoken
by
him
would
be
read
by
thousands
.
<EOS>
The
first
necessity
for
good
speaking
is
a
large
audience
;
and
of
this
advantage
Mr.
Turnbull
had
made
himself
sure
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
could
hardly
be
said
that
he
was
a
great
orator
.
<EOS>
He
was
gifted
with
a
powerful
voice
,
with
strong
,
and
I
may
,
perhaps
,
call
them
broad
convictions
,
with
perfect
self
-
reliance
,
with
almost
unlimited
powers
of
endurance
,
with
hot
ambition
,
with
no
keen
scruples
,
and
with
a
moral
skin
of
great
thickness
.
<EOS>
Nothing
said
against
him
pained
him
,
no
attacks
wounded
him
,
no
raillery
touched
him
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
sore
spot
about
him
,
and
probably
his
first
thoughts
on
waking
every
morning
told
him
that
he
,
at
least
,
was
totus
teres
atque
rotundus
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
of
course
,
a
thorough
Radical
,
 
and
so
was
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Monk
's
first
waking
thoughts
were
probably
exactly
the
reverse
of
those
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
was
a
much
hotter
man
in
debate
than
Mr.
Turnbull
;
 
but
Mr.
Monk
was
ever
doubting
of
himself
,
and
never
doubted
of
himself
so
much
as
when
he
had
been
most
violent
,
and
also
most
effective
,
in
debate
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Monk
jeered
at
himself
for
being
a
Cabinet
Minister
and
keeping
no
attendant
grander
than
a
parlour
-
maid
,
there
was
a
substratum
of
self
-
doubt
under
the
joke
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
was
certainly
a
great
Radical
,
and
as
such
enjoyed
a
great
reputation
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
high
office
in
the
State
had
ever
been
offered
to
him
;
but
things
had
been
said
which
justified
him
,
or
seemed
to
himself
to
justify
him
,
in
declaring
that
in
no
possible
circumstances
would
he
serve
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
"
I
serve
the
people
,
"
he
had
said
,
"
and
much
as
I
respect
the
servants
of
the
Crown
<EOS>
,
I
think
that
my
own
office
is
the
higher
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
been
greatly
called
to
task
for
this
speech
;
and
Mr.
Mildmay
,
the
present
Premier
,
had
asked
him
whether
he
did
not
recognise
the
so
-
called
servants
of
the
Crown
as
the
most
hard
-
worked
and
truest
servants
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
The
House
and
the
press
had
supported
Mr.
Mildmay
,
but
to
all
that
Mr.
Turnbull
was
quite
indifferent
;
and
when
an
assertion
made
by
him
before
three
or
four
thousand
persons
at
Manchester
,
to
the
effect
that
he
,
 
he
specially
,
 
was
the
friend
and
servant
of
the
people
,
was
received
with
acclamation
,
he
felt
quite
satisfied
that
he
had
gained
his
point
.
<EOS>
Progressive
reform
in
the
franchise
,
of
which
manhood
suffrage
should
be
the
acknowledged
and
not
far
distant
end
,
equal
electoral
districts
,
ballot
,
tenant
right
for
England
as
well
as
Ireland
,
reduction
of
the
standing
army
till
there
should
be
no
standing
army
to
reduce
,
utter
disregard
of
all
political
movements
in
Europe
,
an
almost
idolatrous
admiration
for
all
political
movements
in
America
,
free
trade
in
everything
except
malt
,
and
an
absolute
extinction
of
a
State
Church
,
 
<EOS>
these
were
among
the
principal
articles
in
Mr.
Turnbull
's
political
catalogue
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
that
when
once
he
had
learned
the
art
of
arranging
his
words
as
he
stood
upon
his
legs
,
and
had
so
mastered
his
voice
as
to
have
obtained
the
ear
of
the
House
,
the
work
of
his
life
was
not
difficult
.
<EOS>
Having
nothing
to
construct
,
he
could
always
deal
with
generalities
.
<EOS>
Being
free
from
responsibility
,
he
was
not
called
upon
either
to
study
details
or
to
master
even
great
facts
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
business
to
inveigh
against
existing
evils
,
and
perhaps
there
is
no
easier
business
when
once
the
privilege
of
an
audience
has
been
attained
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
work
to
cut
down
forest
-
trees
,
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
subsequent
cultivation
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
had
once
told
Phineas
Finn
how
great
were
the
charms
of
that
inaccuracy
which
was
permitted
to
the
Opposition
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
no
doubt
enjoyed
these
charms
to
the
full
,
though
he
would
sooner
have
put
a
padlock
on
his
mouth
for
a
month
than
have
owned
as
much
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
Mr.
Turnbull
was
no
doubt
right
in
resolving
that
he
would
not
take
office
,
though
some
reticence
on
that
subject
might
have
been
more
becoming
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
conversation
at
dinner
,
though
it
was
altogether
on
political
subjects
,
had
in
it
nothing
of
special
interest
as
long
as
the
girl
was
there
to
change
the
plates
;
but
when
she
was
gone
,
and
the
door
was
closed
,
it
gradually
opened
out
,
and
there
came
on
to
be
a
pleasant
sparring
match
between
the
two
great
Radicals
,
 
the
Radical
who
had
joined
himself
to
the
governing
powers
,
and
the
Radical
who
stood
aloof
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
barely
said
a
word
now
and
then
,
and
Phineas
was
almost
as
silent
as
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
there
to
hear
some
such
discussion
,
and
was
quite
willing
to
listen
while
guns
of
such
great
calibre
were
being
fired
off
for
his
amusement
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Mr.
Mildmay
is
making
a
great
step
forward
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
believe
that
he
would
ever
live
to
go
so
far
.
<EOS>
It
will
hardly
suffice
even
for
this
year
;
but
still
coming
from
him
,
it
is
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
It
only
shows
how
far
a
man
may
be
made
to
go
,
if
only
the
proper
force
be
applied
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
it
matters
very
little
who
are
the
Ministers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
I
have
always
declared
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
little
indeed
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
mind
whether
it
be
Lord
de
Terrier
,
or
Mr.
Mildmay
,
or
Mr.
Gresham
,
or
you
yourself
,
if
you
choose
to
get
yourself
made
First
Lord
of
the
Treasury
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
such
ambition
,
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
you
had
.
<EOS>
If
I
went
in
for
that
kind
of
thing
myself
,
I
should
like
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
I
should
feel
that
if
I
could
do
any
good
at
all
by
becoming
a
Minister
,
I
could
only
do
it
by
becoming
first
Minister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
would
n't
doubt
your
own
fitness
for
such
a
position
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
my
fitness
for
the
position
of
any
Minister
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
on
other
grounds
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
it
on
every
ground
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
,
rising
on
his
legs
and
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
am
not
fit
to
have
diplomatic
intercourse
with
men
who
would
come
to
me
simply
with
the
desire
of
deceiving
me
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
am
unfit
to
deal
with
members
of
Parliament
who
would
flock
around
me
because
they
wanted
places
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
am
unfit
to
answer
every
man
's
question
so
as
to
give
no
information
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
not
answer
them
so
as
to
give
information
?
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Turnbull
was
so
intent
on
his
speech
that
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
heard
this
interruption
.
<EOS>
He
took
no
notice
of
it
as
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
am
unfit
to
maintain
the
proprieties
of
a
seeming
confidence
between
a
Crown
all
-
powerless
and
a
people
all
-
powerful
.
<EOS>
No
man
recognises
his
own
unfitness
for
such
work
more
clearly
than
I
do
,
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
took
in
hand
such
work
at
all
,
I
should
like
to
be
the
leader
,
and
not
the
led
.
<EOS>
Tell
us
fairly
,
now
,
what
are
your
convictions
worth
in
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Cabinet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
question
which
a
man
may
hardly
answer
himself
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
question
which
a
man
should
at
least
answer
for
himself
before
he
consents
to
sit
there
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
was
almost
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
reason
have
you
for
supposing
that
I
have
omitted
that
duty
?
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Simply
this
,
 
that
I
can
not
reconcile
your
known
opinions
with
the
practices
of
your
colleagues
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
tell
you
what
my
convictions
may
be
worth
in
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
they
are
worth
the
chair
on
which
I
sit
when
I
am
there
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
tell
you
what
my
aspirations
were
when
I
consented
to
fill
that
chair
,
and
you
shall
judge
of
their
worth
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
they
might
possibly
leaven
the
batch
of
bread
which
we
have
to
bake
,
 
giving
to
the
whole
batch
more
of
the
flavour
of
reform
than
it
would
have
possessed
<EOS>
had
I
absented
myself
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
when
I
was
asked
to
join
Mr.
Mildmay
and
Mr.
Gresham
,
the
very
fact
of
that
request
indicated
liberal
progress
,
and
that
if
I
refused
the
request
I
should
be
declining
to
assist
in
good
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
have
supported
them
,
if
anything
were
proposed
worthy
of
support
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
I
could
not
have
been
so
effective
in
taking
care
that
some
measure
be
proposed
worthy
of
support
as
I
may
possibly
be
now
.
<EOS>
I
thought
a
good
deal
about
it
,
and
I
believe
that
my
decision
was
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
were
right
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
juster
object
of
ambition
than
a
seat
in
the
Cabinet
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
must
dispute
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
,
turning
round
upon
our
hero
.
<EOS>
"
I
regard
the
position
of
our
high
Ministers
as
most
respectable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
for
so
much
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
But
the
orator
went
on
again
,
regardless
of
the
interruption
:
    
"
The
position
of
gentlemen
in
inferior
offices
,
 
of
gentlemen
who
attend
rather
to
the
nods
and
winks
of
their
superiors
in
Downing
Street
than
to
the
interest
of
their
constituents
,
 
I
do
not
regard
as
being
highly
respectable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
can
not
begin
at
the
top
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
Mr.
Monk
has
begun
at
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
the
top
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
profess
to
think
that
even
he
has
raised
himself
by
going
into
office
.
<EOS>
To
be
an
independent
representative
of
a
really
popular
commercial
constituency
is
,
in
my
estimation
,
the
highest
object
of
an
Englishman
's
ambition
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
why
commercial
,
Mr.
Turnbull
?
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
the
commercial
constituencies
really
do
elect
their
own
members
in
accordance
with
their
own
judgments
,
whereas
the
counties
and
the
small
towns
are
coerced
either
by
individuals
or
by
a
combination
of
aristocratic
influences
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
yet
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
there
are
not
half
a
dozen
Conservatives
returned
by
all
the
counties
in
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Scotland
is
very
much
to
be
honoured
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
was
the
first
to
take
his
departure
,
and
Mr.
Turnbull
followed
him
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
Phineas
got
up
to
go
at
the
same
time
,
but
stayed
at
his
host
's
request
,
and
sat
for
awhile
smoking
a
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Turnbull
is
a
wonderful
man
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
not
domineer
too
much
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
fault
is
not
arrogance
,
so
much
as
ignorance
that
there
is
,
or
should
be
,
a
difference
between
public
and
private
life
.
<EOS>
In
the
House
of
Commons
a
man
in
Mr.
Turnbull
's
position
must
speak
with
dictatorial
assurance
.
<EOS>
He
is
always
addressing
,
not
the
House
only
,
but
the
country
at
large
,
and
the
country
will
not
believe
in
him
unless
he
believe
in
himself
.
<EOS>
But
he
forgets
that
he
is
not
always
addressing
the
country
at
large
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
sort
of
a
time
Mrs.
Turnbull
and
the
little
Turnbulls
have
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
went
home
,
made
up
his
mind
that
Mrs.
Turnbull
and
the
little
Turnbulls
must
probably
have
a
bad
time
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
Rides
<EOS>
His
Horse
Bonebreaker
 
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
whatever
might
be
the
details
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
,
the
ballot
would
not
form
a
part
of
it
;
and
<EOS>
as
there
was
a
strong
party
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
a
very
numerous
party
out
of
it
,
who
were
desirous
that
voting
by
ballot
should
be
made
a
part
of
the
electoral
law
,
it
was
decided
that
an
independent
motion
should
be
brought
on
in
anticipation
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
.
<EOS>
The
arrangement
was
probably
one
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
own
making
;
so
that
he
might
be
hampered
by
no
opposition
on
that
subject
by
his
own
followers
if
,
 
as
he
did
not
doubt
,
 
the
motion
should
be
lost
.
<EOS>
It
was
expected
that
the
debate
would
not
last
over
one
night
,
and
Phineas
resolved
that
he
would
make
his
maiden
speech
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
had
very
strong
opinions
as
to
the
inefficacy
of
the
ballot
for
any
good
purposes
,
and
thought
that
he
might
be
able
to
strike
out
from
his
convictions
some
sparks
of
that
fire
which
used
to
be
so
plentiful
with
him
at
the
old
debating
clubs
.
<EOS>
But
even
at
breakfast
that
morning
his
heart
began
to
beat
quickly
at
the
idea
of
having
to
stand
on
his
legs
before
so
critical
an
audience
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
if
possible
get
the
subject
off
his
mind
during
the
day
,
and
therefore
went
out
among
the
people
who
certainly
would
not
talk
to
him
about
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
He
sat
for
nearly
an
hour
in
the
morning
with
Mr.
Low
,
and
did
not
even
tell
Mr.
Low
that
it
was
his
intention
to
speak
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
Then
he
made
one
or
two
other
calls
,
and
at
about
three
went
up
to
Portman
Square
to
look
for
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
nearly
the
end
of
February
,
and
Phineas
had
often
seen
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
seen
her
brother
,
but
had
learned
from
his
sister
that
he
had
been
driven
up
to
London
by
the
frost
,
He
was
told
by
the
porter
at
Lord
Brentford
's
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
in
the
house
,
and
as
he
was
passing
through
the
hall
he
met
Lord
Brentford
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
thus
driven
to
speak
,
and
felt
himself
called
upon
to
explain
why
he
was
there
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
see
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Lord
Chiltern
in
the
house
?
"
said
the
Earl
,
turning
to
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
lord
;
his
lordship
arrived
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
will
find
him
upstairs
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
myself
I
know
nothing
of
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
an
angry
tone
,
as
though
he
resented
the
fact
that
any
one
should
come
to
his
house
to
call
upon
his
son
;
and
turned
his
back
quickly
upon
Phineas
.
<EOS>
But
he
thought
better
of
it
before
he
reached
the
front
door
,
and
turned
again
.
<EOS>
"
By
-
the
-
bye
,
"
said
he
,
"
what
majority
shall
we
have
to
-
night
,
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pretty
nearly
as
many
as
you
please
to
name
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
;
I
suppose
we
are
tolerably
safe
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
speak
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
may
,
"
said
Phineas
,
feeling
that
he
blushed
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
Do
.
<EOS>
If
you
see
Lord
Chiltern
will
you
tell
him
from
me
that
I
should
be
glad
to
see
him
before
he
leaves
London
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
home
till
noon
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
much
astonished
at
the
commission
given
to
him
,
of
course
said
that
he
would
do
as
he
was
desired
,
and
then
passed
on
to
Lord
Chiltern
's
apartments
.
  
<EOS>
He
found
his
friend
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
without
coat
and
waistcoat
,
with
a
pair
of
dumb
-
bells
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
When
there
's
no
hunting
I
'm
driven
to
this
kind
of
thing
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
's
good
exercise
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
gives
me
something
to
do
.
<EOS>
When
I
'm
in
London
I
feel
like
a
gipsy
in
church
,
till
the
time
comes
for
prowling
out
at
night
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
occupation
for
my
days
<EOS>
whatever
,
and
no
place
to
which
I
can
take
myself
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
stand
in
a
club
window
as
some
men
do
,
and
I
should
disgrace
any
decent
club
if
I
did
stand
there
.
<EOS>
I
belong
to
the
Travellers
,
but
I
doubt
whether
the
porter
would
let
me
go
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
pique
yourself
on
being
more
of
an
outer
Bohemian
than
you
are
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
pique
myself
on
this
,
that
whether
Bohemian
or
not
,
I
will
go
nowhere
that
I
am
not
wanted
.
<EOS>
Though
,
 
for
the
matter
of
that
,
I
suppose
I
'm
not
wanted
here
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
gave
him
the
message
from
his
father
.
"
<EOS>
He
wishes
to
see
me
to
-
morrow
morning
?
<EOS>
"
continued
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
send
me
word
what
it
is
he
has
to
say
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
choose
to
be
insulted
by
him
,
though
he
is
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
certainly
go
,
if
I
were
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
it
very
much
,
if
all
the
circumstances
were
the
same
.
<EOS>
Let
him
tell
me
what
he
wants
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
can
not
ask
him
,
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
he
wants
very
well
.
<EOS>
Laura
has
been
interfering
and
doing
no
good
.
<EOS>
You
know
Violet
Effingham
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
know
her
,
"
said
Phineas
,
much
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
want
her
to
marry
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
not
wish
to
marry
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
But
do
you
think
that
such
a
girl
as
Miss
Effingham
would
marry
such
a
man
as
I
am
?
<EOS>
She
would
be
much
more
likely
to
take
you
.
<EOS>
By
George
,
she
would
!
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
she
has
three
thousand
a
year
of
her
own
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
she
has
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
about
the
tune
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
would
take
her
without
a
shilling
to
-
morrow
,
if
she
would
have
me
,
 
because
I
like
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
only
girl
I
ever
did
like
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
the
use
of
my
liking
her
?
<EOS>
They
have
painted
me
so
black
among
them
,
especially
my
father
,
that
no
decent
girl
would
think
of
marrying
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
father
ca
n't
be
angry
with
you
if
you
do
your
best
to
comply
with
his
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
a
straw
whether
he
be
angry
or
not
.
<EOS>
He
allows
me
eight
hundred
a
year
,
and
he
knows
that
if
he
stopped
it
I
should
go
to
the
Jews
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
myself
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
leave
an
acre
away
from
me
,
and
yet
he
wo
n't
join
me
in
raising
money
for
the
sake
of
paying
Laura
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Laura
can
hardly
want
money
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
detestable
prig
whom
she
has
chosen
to
marry
,
and
whom
I
hate
with
all
my
heart
,
is
richer
than
ever
Croesus
was
;
but
nevertheless
Laura
ought
to
have
her
own
money
.
<EOS>
She
shall
have
it
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
see
Lord
Brentford
,
if
I
were
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
about
coming
down
to
Willingford
.
<EOS>
Laura
says
you
will
come
some
day
in
March
.
<EOS>
I
can
mount
you
for
a
couple
of
days
and
should
be
delighted
to
have
you
.
<EOS>
My
horses
all
pull
like
the
mischief
,
and
rush
like
devils
,
and
want
a
deal
of
riding
;
but
an
Irishman
likes
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
dislike
it
particularly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
to
have
something
to
do
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
tells
me
that
a
horse
is
an
armchair
,
I
always
tell
him
to
put
the
brute
into
his
bedroom
.
<EOS>
Mind
you
come
.
<EOS>
The
house
I
stay
at
is
called
the
Willingford
Bull
,
and
it
's
just
four
miles
from
Peterborough
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
swore
that
he
would
go
down
and
ride
the
pulling
horses
,
and
then
took
his
leave
,
earnestly
advising
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
he
went
,
to
keep
the
appointment
proposed
by
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
morning
came
,
at
half
-
past
eleven
,
the
son
,
who
had
been
standing
for
half
an
hour
with
his
back
to
the
fire
in
the
large
gloomy
dining
-
room
,
suddenly
rang
the
bell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tell
the
Earl
,
"
he
said
to
the
servant
,
"
that
I
am
here
and
will
go
to
him
if
he
wishes
it
.
"
<EOS>
The
servant
came
back
,
and
said
that
the
Earl
was
waiting
.
<EOS>
Then
Lord
Chiltern
strode
after
the
man
into
his
father
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
,
"
said
the
father
,
"
I
have
sent
for
you
because
I
think
it
may
be
as
well
to
speak
to
you
on
some
business
.
<EOS>
Will
you
sit
down
?
"
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
sat
down
,
but
did
not
answer
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
very
unhappy
about
your
sister
's
fortune
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
,
 
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
We
can
raise
the
money
between
us
,
and
pay
her
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
please
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
opposition
to
my
advice
that
she
paid
your
debts
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
in
opposition
to
mine
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
her
that
I
would
not
pay
them
,
and
were
I
to
give
her
back
to
-
morrow
,
as
you
say
,
the
money
that
she
has
so
used
,
I
should
be
stultifying
myself
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
do
so
on
one
condition
.
<EOS>
I
will
join
with
you
in
raising
the
money
for
your
sister
,
on
one
condition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
tells
me
,
 
indeed
she
has
told
me
often
,
 
that
you
are
attached
to
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
Violet
Effingham
,
my
lord
,
is
unhappily
not
attached
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
that
may
be
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
taken
the
liberty
of
interrogating
her
upon
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Even
you
,
my
lord
,
could
hardly
have
done
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
I
say
that
I
never
have
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
simply
mean
that
even
you
could
hardly
have
asked
Miss
Effingham
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
I
have
asked
her
,
and
she
has
refused
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
girls
often
do
that
,
and
yet
accept
afterwards
the
men
whom
they
have
refused
.
<EOS>
Laura
tells
me
that
she
believes
that
Violet
would
consent
if
you
pressed
your
suit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
knows
nothing
about
it
,
my
lord
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
are
probably
wrong
.
<EOS>
Laura
and
Violet
are
very
close
friends
,
and
have
no
doubt
discussed
this
matter
between
them
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
it
may
be
as
well
that
you
should
hear
what
I
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
shall
not
interfere
myself
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
ground
on
which
I
can
do
so
with
propriety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
became
very
angry
,
and
nearly
broke
down
in
his
anger
.
<EOS>
He
paused
for
a
moment
,
feeling
disposed
to
tell
his
son
to
go
and
never
to
see
him
again
.
<EOS>
But
he
gulped
down
his
wrath
,
and
went
on
with
his
speech
.
<EOS>
"
My
meaning
,
sir
,
is
this
;
 
that
I
have
so
great
faith
in
Violet
Effingham
,
that
I
would
receive
her
acceptance
of
your
hand
as
the
only
proof
which
would
be
convincing
to
me
of
amendment
in
your
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
to
do
so
,
I
would
join
with
you
in
raising
money
to
pay
your
sister
,
would
make
some
further
sacrifice
with
reference
to
an
income
for
you
and
your
wife
,
and
 
would
make
you
both
welcome
to
Saulsby
,
 
if
you
chose
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Earl
's
voice
hesitated
much
and
became
almost
tremulous
as
he
made
the
last
proposition
.
<EOS>
And
his
eyes
had
fallen
away
from
his
son
's
gaze
,
and
he
had
bent
a
little
over
the
table
,
and
was
moved
.
<EOS>
But
he
recovered
himself
at
once
,
and
added
,
with
all
proper
dignity
,
"
If
you
have
anything
to
say
I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
your
offers
would
be
nothing
,
my
lord
,
if
I
did
not
like
the
girl
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
ask
you
to
marry
a
girl
if
you
did
not
like
her
,
as
you
call
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
as
to
Miss
Effingham
,
it
happens
that
our
wishes
jump
together
.
<EOS>
I
have
asked
her
,
and
she
has
refused
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
even
know
where
to
find
her
to
ask
her
again
.
<EOS>
If
I
went
to
Lady
Baldock
's
house
the
servants
would
not
let
me
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
whose
fault
is
that
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yours
partly
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
You
have
told
everybody
that
I
am
the
devil
,
and
now
all
the
old
women
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
told
anybody
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
down
to
Lady
Baldock
's
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
is
at
Baddingham
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
can
get
speech
of
Miss
Effingham
 
"
  
"
Miss
Effingham
is
not
at
Baddingham
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
is
staying
with
your
sister
in
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
London
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
that
I
saw
her
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
Then
I
will
do
the
best
I
can
.
<EOS>
Laura
will
tell
you
of
the
result
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
would
have
given
the
son
some
advice
as
to
the
mode
in
which
he
should
put
forward
his
claim
upon
Violet
's
hand
,
but
the
son
would
not
wait
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Choosing
to
presume
that
the
conference
was
over
,
he
went
back
to
the
room
in
which
he
had
kept
his
dumb
-
bells
,
and
for
a
minute
or
two
went
to
work
at
his
favourite
exercise
.
<EOS>
But
he
soon
put
the
dumb
-
bells
down
,
and
began
to
prepare
himself
for
his
work
.
<EOS>
If
this
thing
was
to
be
done
,
it
might
as
well
be
done
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
looked
out
of
his
window
,
and
saw
that
the
streets
were
in
a
mess
of
slush
.
<EOS>
White
snow
was
becoming
black
mud
,
as
it
will
do
in
London
;
and
the
violence
of
frost
was
giving
way
to
the
horrors
of
thaw
.
<EOS>
All
would
be
soft
and
comparatively
pleasant
in
Northamptonshire
on
the
following
morning
,
and
if
everything
went
right
he
would
breakfast
at
the
Willingford
Bull
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
down
by
the
hunting
train
,
and
be
at
the
inn
by
ten
.
<EOS>
The
meet
was
only
six
miles
distant
,
and
all
would
be
pleasant
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
this
whatever
might
be
the
result
of
his
work
to
-
day
;
 
but
in
the
meantime
he
would
go
and
do
his
work
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
cab
called
,
and
within
half
an
hour
of
the
time
at
which
he
had
left
his
father
,
he
was
at
the
door
of
his
sister
's
house
in
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
The
servants
told
him
that
the
ladies
were
at
lunch
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
eat
lunch
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
them
that
I
am
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
come
to
see
you
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
as
soon
as
the
servant
had
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
say
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
has
not
come
to
see
me
;
 
that
is
,
not
to
see
me
specially
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
can
not
pretend
not
to
know
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
think
it
civil
to
call
if
he
has
heard
that
you
are
in
town
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
be
only
that
,
I
will
be
civil
in
return
;
 
as
sweet
as
May
to
him
.
<EOS>
If
it
be
really
only
that
,
and
if
I
were
sure
of
it
,
I
should
be
really
glad
to
see
him
.
"
<EOS>
Then
they
finished
their
lunch
,
and
Lady
Laura
got
up
and
led
the
way
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
remember
,
"
said
she
,
gravely
,
"
that
you
might
be
a
saviour
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
in
girls
being
saviours
to
men
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
man
who
should
be
the
saviour
to
the
girl
.
<EOS>
If
I
marry
at
all
,
I
have
the
right
to
expect
that
protection
shall
be
given
to
me
,
 
not
that
I
shall
have
to
give
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Violet
,
you
are
determined
to
misrepresent
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
was
walking
about
the
room
,
and
did
not
sit
down
when
they
entered
.
<EOS>
The
ordinary
greetings
took
place
,
and
Miss
Effingham
made
some
remark
about
the
frost
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
seems
to
be
going
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
I
suppose
that
you
will
soon
be
at
work
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
shall
hunt
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
next
day
,
and
the
next
,
and
the
next
,
"
said
Violet
,
"
till
about
the
middle
of
April
;
 
and
then
your
period
of
misery
will
begin
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
but
hunting
that
I
can
call
an
occupation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
make
one
?
"
said
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
do
so
,
if
it
be
possible
.
<EOS>
Laura
,
would
you
mind
leaving
me
and
Miss
Effingham
alone
for
a
few
minutes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
got
up
,
and
so
also
did
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
For
what
purpose
?
"
said
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
for
any
good
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
I
wish
it
,
and
I
will
not
harm
you
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
was
now
going
,
but
paused
before
she
reached
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
will
you
do
as
I
ask
you
?
"
said
the
brother
.
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Laura
went
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
that
I
feared
you
would
harm
me
,
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
know
it
was
not
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
say
is
always
said
awkwardly
.
<EOS>
An
hour
ago
I
did
not
know
that
you
were
in
town
,
but
when
I
was
told
the
news
I
came
at
once
.
<EOS>
My
father
told
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
that
you
see
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
spoken
to
him
for
months
before
,
and
probably
may
not
speak
to
him
for
months
again
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
one
point
,
Violet
,
on
which
he
and
I
agree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
there
will
soon
be
many
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
possible
,
 
but
<EOS>
I
fear
not
probable
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Violet
,
"
 
and
he
looked
at
her
with
all
his
eyes
,
till
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
all
eyes
,
<EOS>
so
great
was
the
intensity
of
his
gaze
;
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
scorn
myself
were
I
to
permit
myself
to
come
before
you
with
a
plea
for
your
favour
founded
on
my
father
's
whims
.
<EOS>
My
father
is
unreasonable
,
and
has
been
very
unjust
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
ever
believed
evil
of
me
,
and
has
believed
it
often
when
all
the
world
knew
that
he
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
care
little
for
being
reconciled
to
a
father
who
has
been
so
cruel
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
loves
me
dearly
,
and
is
my
friend
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
that
you
should
not
speak
against
him
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
understand
,
at
least
,
that
I
am
asking
nothing
from
you
because
he
wishes
it
.
<EOS>
Laura
probably
has
told
you
that
you
may
make
things
straight
by
becoming
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
,
 
certainly
,
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
argument
that
she
should
never
have
used
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
argument
to
which
you
should
not
listen
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Make
things
straight
indeed
!
<EOS>
Who
can
tell
?
<EOS>
There
would
be
very
little
made
straight
by
such
a
marriage
,
if
it
were
not
that
I
loved
you
.
<EOS>
Violet
,
that
is
my
plea
,
and
my
only
one
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
so
well
that
I
do
believe
that
if
you
took
me
I
should
return
to
the
old
ways
,
and
become
as
other
men
are
,
and
be
in
time
as
respectable
,
as
stupid
,
 
and
perhaps
as
ill
-
natured
as
old
Lady
Baldock
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
poor
aunt
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
she
says
worse
things
of
me
than
that
.
<EOS>
Now
,
dearest
,
you
have
heard
all
that
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
he
came
close
to
her
,
and
put
out
his
hand
,
 
<EOS>
but
she
did
not
touch
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
other
argument
to
use
,
 
not
a
word
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
As
I
came
here
in
the
cab
I
was
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
that
I
might
find
what
best
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
words
make
no
difference
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
unless
they
be
so
uttered
as
to
force
a
belief
.
<EOS>
I
do
love
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
other
reason
but
<EOS>
that
why
you
should
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
other
excuse
to
offer
for
coming
to
you
again
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
one
thing
in
the
world
that
to
me
has
any
charm
.
<EOS>
Can
you
be
surprised
that
I
should
be
persistent
in
asking
for
it
?
"
<EOS>
He
was
looking
at
her
still
with
the
same
gaze
,
and
there
seemed
to
be
a
power
in
his
eye
from
which
she
could
not
escape
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
standing
with
his
right
hand
out
,
as
though
expecting
,
or
at
least
hoping
,
that
her
hand
might
be
put
into
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
to
answer
you
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
your
love
,
if
you
can
give
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
how
you
swore
once
that
you
would
love
me
for
ever
and
always
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
remind
me
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
child
then
,
 
a
naughty
child
,
"
she
added
,
smiling
;
"
and
was
put
to
bed
for
what
I
did
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Be
a
child
still
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
if
we
but
could
!
"
  
"
And
have
you
no
other
answer
to
make
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
must
answer
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
entitled
to
an
answer
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
I
am
sorry
that
I
can
not
give
you
the
love
for
which
you
ask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
?
"
  
"
Never
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
myself
personally
,
or
what
you
have
heard
of
me
,
that
is
so
hateful
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
is
hateful
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
spoken
of
hate
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
feel
the
strongest
regard
for
my
old
friend
and
playfellow
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
many
things
which
a
woman
is
bound
to
consider
before
she
allows
herself
so
to
love
a
man
that
she
can
consent
to
become
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Allow
herself
!
<EOS>
Then
it
is
a
matter
entirely
of
calculation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
should
be
some
thought
in
it
,
Lord
Chiltern
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
now
a
pause
,
and
the
man
's
hand
was
at
last
allowed
to
drop
,
as
there
came
no
response
to
the
proffered
grasp
.
<EOS>
He
walked
once
or
twice
across
the
room
before
he
spoke
again
,
and
then
he
stopped
himself
closely
opposite
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
try
again
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
better
so
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
something
to
me
unmanly
in
a
man
's
persecuting
a
girl
.
<EOS>
Just
tell
Laura
,
will
you
,
that
it
is
all
over
;
and
she
may
as
well
tell
my
father
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
then
tendered
her
hand
to
him
,
but
he
did
not
take
it
,
 
probably
did
not
see
it
,
and
at
once
left
the
room
and
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
believe
you
love
him
,
"
Lady
Laura
said
to
her
friend
in
her
anger
,
when
they
discussed
the
matter
immediately
on
Lord
Chiltern
's
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
right
to
say
that
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
right
to
my
belief
,
and
I
do
believe
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
love
him
,
and
that
you
lack
the
courage
to
risk
yourself
in
trying
to
save
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
a
woman
bound
to
marry
a
man
if
she
love
him
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
she
is
,
"
replied

impetuously
,

what
she

that

she
also
is
loved

Whatever

Must
she
do
so

whatever
friends
may
say

the
contrary

Is
there
to

no
prudence
in
marriage

"
  
<EOS>
"
There
may
be
a
great
deal
too
much
prudence
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
true
.
<EOS>
There
is
certainly
too
much
prudence
if
a
woman
marries
prudently
,
but
without
love
.
"
<EOS>
Violet
intended
by
this
no
attack
upon
her
friend
,
 
had
not
had
present
in
her
mind
at
the
moment
any
idea
of
Lady
Laura
's
special
prudence
in
marrying
Mr.
Kennedy
;
but
Lady
Laura
felt
it
keenly
,
and
knew
at
once
that
an
arrow
had
been
shot
which
had
wounded
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
get
nothing
,
"
she
said
,
"
by
descending
to
personalities
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
none
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
is
always
hard
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
for
any
one
person
to
judge
altogether
of
the
mind
of
another
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
said
anything
severe
of
your
refusal
of
my
brother

I
retract
it

only
wish
that
it
could
have
been
otherwise

<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
when
he
left
his
sister
's
house
,
walked
through
the
slush
and
dirt
to
a
haunt
of
his
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Covent
Garden
,
and
there
he
remained
through
the
whole
afternoon
and
evening
.
<EOS>
A
certain
Captain
Clutterbuck
joined
him
,
and
dined
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
told
nothing
to
Captain
Clutterbuck
of
his
sorrow
,
but
Captain
Clutterbuck
could
see
that
he
was
unhappy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
's
have
another
bottle
of
"
cham
,
"
"
said
Captain
Clutterbuck
,
when
their
dinner
was
nearly
over
.
"
<EOS>
"
Cham
"
is
the
only
thing
to
screw
one
up
when
one
is
down
a
peg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
what
you
like
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
;
"
but
I
shall
have
some
brandy
-
and
-
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
worst
of
brandy
-
and
-
water
is
,
that
one
gets
tired
of
it
before
the
night
is
over
,
"
said
Captain
Clutterbuck
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Lord
Chiltern
did
go
down
to
Peterborough
the
next
day
by
the
hunting
train
,
and
rode
his
horse
Bonebreaker
so
well
in
that
famous
run
from
Sutton
springs
to
Gidding
that
after
the
run
young
Piles
,
 
of
the
house
of
Piles
,
Sarsnet
,
and
Gingham
,
 
offered
him
three
hundred
pounds
for
the
animal
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
n't
worth
above
fifty
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
give
you
the
three
hundred
,
"
said
Piles
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
ride
him
if
you
'd
got
him
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
could
n't
I
!
"
said
Piles
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Piles
did
not
continue
the
conversation
,
contenting
himself
with
telling
his
friend
Grogram
that
that
red
devil
Chiltern
was
as
drunk
as
a
lord
.
   
<EOS>
The
Debate
on
the
Ballot
 
Phineas
took
his
seat
in
the
House
with
a
consciousness
of
much
inward
trepidation
of
heart
on
that
night
of
the
ballot
debate
.
<EOS>
After
leaving
Lord
Chiltern
he
went
down
to
his
club
and
dined
alone
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
men
came
and
spoke
to
him
;
but
he
could
not
talk
to
them
at
his
ease
,
nor
did
he
quite
know
what
they
were
saying
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
do
something
which
he
longed
to
achieve
,
but
the
very
idea
of
which
,
now
that
it
was
so
near
to
him
,
was
a
terror
to
him
.
<EOS>
To
be
in
the
House
and
not
to
speak
would
,
to
his
thinking
,
be
a
disgraceful
failure
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
could
not
continue
to
keep
his
seat
unless
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
put
there
that
he
might
speak
.
<EOS>
He
would
speak
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
would
speak
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
already
been
conspicuous
almost
as
a
boy
orator
?
<EOS>
And
yet
,
at
this
moment
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
eating
mutton
or
beef
,
or
who
was
standing
opposite
to
him
and
talking
to
him
,
<EOS>
so
much
was
he
in
dread
of
the
ordeal
which
he
had
prepared
for
himself
.
<EOS>
As
he
went
down
to
the
House
after
dinner
,
he
almost
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
leave
London
by
one
of
the
night
mail
trains
.
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
to
be
stiff
and
stilted
as
he
walked
,
and
that
his
clothes
were
uneasy
to
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
turned
into
Westminster
Hall
he
regretted
more
keenly
than
ever
he
had
done
that
he
had
seceded
from
the
keeping
of
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
He
could
,
he
thought
,
have
spoken
very
well
in
court
,
and
would
there
have
learned
that
self
-
confidence
which
now
failed
him
so
terribly
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
too
late
to
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
go
in
and
take
his
seat
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
in
and
took
his
seat
,
and
the
chamber
seemed
to
him
to
be
mysteriously
large
,
as
though
benches
were
crowded
over
benches
,
and
galleries
over
galleries
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
long
enough
in
the
House
to
have
lost
the
original
awe
inspired
by
the
Speaker
and
the
clerks
of
the
House
,
by
the
row
of
Ministers
,
and
by
the
unequalled
importance
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
On
ordinary
occasions
he
could
saunter
in
and
out
,
and
whisper
at
his
ease
to
a
neighbour
.
<EOS>
But
on
this
occasion
he
went
direct
to
the
bench
on
which
he
ordinarily
sat
,
and
began
at
once
to
rehearse
to
himself
his
speech
.
<EOS>
He
had
in
truth
been
doing
this
all
day
,
in
spite
of
the
effort
that
he
had
made
to
rid
himself
of
all
memory
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
collecting
the
heads
of
his
speech
while
Mr.
Low
had
been
talking
to
him
,
and
refreshing
his
quotations
in
the
presence
of
Lord
Chiltern
and
the
dumb
-
bells
.
<EOS>
He
had
taxed
his
memory
and
his
intellect
with
various
tasks
,
which
,
as
he
feared
,
would
not
adjust
themselves
one
with
another
.
<EOS>
He
had
learned
the
headings
of
his
speech
,
 
so
that
one
heading
might
follow
the
other
,
and
nothing
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
learned
verbatim
the
words
which
he
intended
to
utter
under
each
heading
,
 
with
a
hope
that
if
any
one
compact
part
should
be
destroyed
or
injured
in
its
compactness
by
treachery
of
memory
,
or
by
the
course
of
the
debate
,
each
other
compact
part
might
be
there
in
its
entirety
,
ready
for
use
;
 
or
at
least
so
many
of
the
compact
parts
as
treachery
of
memory
and
the
accidents
of
the
debate
might
leave
to
him
;
so
that
his
speech
might
be
like
a
vessel
,
watertight
in
its
various
compartments
<EOS>
,
that
would
float
by
the
buoyancy
of
its
stern
and
bow
,
even
though
the
hold
should
be
waterlogged
.
<EOS>
But
this
use
of
his
composed
words
,
even
though
he
should
be
able
to
carry
it
through
,
would
not
complete
his
work
;
 
<EOS>
for
it
would
be
his
duty
to
answer
in
some
sort
those
who
had
gone
before
him
,
and
in
order
to
do
this
he
must
be
able
to
insert
,
without
any
prearrangement
of
words
or
ideas
,
little
intercalatory
parts
between
those
compact
masses
of
argument
with
which
he
had
been
occupying
himself
for
many
laborious
hours
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
round
upon
the
House
and
perceived
that
everything
was
dim
before
him
,
that
all
his
original
awe
of
the
House
had
returned
,
and
with
it
a
present
quaking
fear
that
made
him
feel
the
pulsations
of
his
own
heart
,
he
became
painfully
aware
that
the
task
he
had
prepared
for
himself
was
too
great
.
<EOS>
He
should
,
on
this
the
occasion
of
his
rising
to
his
maiden
legs
,
have
either
prepared
for
himself
a
short
general
speech
,
which
could
indeed
have
done
little
for
his
credit
in
the
House
,
but
which
might
have
served
to
carry
off
the
novelty
of
the
thing
,
and
have
introduced
him
to
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
within
those
walls
,
 
or
he
should
have
trusted
to
what
his
wit
and
spirit
would
produce
for
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
and
not
have
burdened
himself
with
a
huge
exercise
of
memory
.
<EOS>
During
the
presentation
of
a
few
petitions
he
tried
to
repeat
to
himself
the
first
of
his
compact
parts
,
 
a
compact
part
on
which
,
as
it
might
certainly
be
brought
into
use
let
the
debate
have
gone
as
it
might
,
he
had
expended
great
care
.
<EOS>
He
had
flattered
himself
that
there
was
something
of
real
strength
in
his
words
as
he
repeated
them
to
himself
in
the
comfortable
seclusion
of
his
own
room
,
and
he
had
made
them
so
ready
to
his
tongue
that
he
thought
it
to
be
impossible
that
he
should
forget
even
an
intonation
.
<EOS>
Now
he
found
that
he
could
not
remember
the
first
phrases
without
unloosing
and
looking
at
a
small
roll
of
paper
which
he
held
furtively
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
good
of
looking
at
it
?
<EOS>
He
would
forget
it
again
in
the
next
moment
.
<EOS>
He
had
intended
to
satisfy
the
most
eager
of
his
friends
,
and
to
astound
his
opponents
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
no
one
would
be
satisfied
,
 
and
none
astounded
but
they
who
had
trusted
in
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
debate
began
,
and
if
the
leisure
afforded
by
a
long
and
tedious
speech
could
have
served
him
,
he
might
have
had
leisure
enough
.
<EOS>
He
tried
at
first
to
follow
all
that
this
advocate
for
the
ballot
might
say
,
hoping
thence
to
acquire
the
impetus
of
strong
interest
;
but
he
soon
wearied
of
the
work
,
and
began
to
long
that
the
speech
might
be
ended
,
although
the
period
of
his
own
martyrdom
would
thereby
be
brought
nearer
to
him
.
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
seven
<EOS>
so
many
members
had
deserted
their
seats
,
that
Phineas
began
to
think
that
he
might
be
saved
all
further
pains
by
a
"
count
out
.
"
<EOS>
He
reckoned
the
members
present
and
found
that
they
were
below
the
mystic
forty
,
 
first
by
two
,
then
by
four
,
by
five
,
by
seven
,
and
at
one
time
by
eleven
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
for
him
to
ask
the
Speaker
to
count
the
House
,
but
he
wondered
that
no
one
else
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
the
idea
of
this
termination
to
the
night
's
work
came
upon
him
,
and
as
he
thought
of
his
lost
labour
,
he
almost
took
courage
again
,
 
almost
dreaded
rather
than
wished
for
the
interference
of
some
malicious
member
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
malicious
member
then
present
,
or
<EOS>
else
it
was
known
that
Lords
of
the
Treasury
and
Lords
of
the
Admiralty
would
flock
in
during
the
Speaker
's
ponderous
counting
,
 
and
thus
the
slow
length
of
the
ballot
-
lover
's
verbosity
was
permitted
to
evolve
itself
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
At
eight
o'clock
he
had
completed
his
catalogue
of
illustrations
,
and
immediately
Mr.
Monk
rose
from
the
Treasury
bench
to
explain
the
grounds
on
which
the
Government
must
decline
to
support
the
motion
before
the
House
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
aware
that
Mr.
Monk
intended
to
speak
,
and
was
aware
also
that
his
speech
would
be
very
short
.
<EOS>
"
My
idea
is
,
"
he
had
said
to
Phineas
,
"
that
every
man
possessed
of
the
franchise
should
dare
to
have
and
to
express
a
political
opinion
of
his
own
;
that
otherwise
the
franchise
is
not
worth
having
;
and
that
men
will
learn
that
when
all
so
dare
,
no
evil
can
come
from
such
daring
.
<EOS>
As
the
ballot
would
make
any
courage
of
that
kind
unnecessary
,
I
dislike
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
I
shall
confine
myself
to
that
,
and
leave
the
illustration
to
younger
debaters
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
also
had
been
informed
that
Mr.
Turnbull
would
reply
to
Mr.
Monk
,
with
the
purpose
of
crushing
Mr.
Monk
into
dust
,
and
Phineas
had
prepared
his
speech
with
something
of
an
intention
of
subsequently
crushing
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
however
,
that
he
could
not
command
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
chapter
of
accidents
to
which
he
must
accommodate
himself
;
but
such
had
been
his
programme
for
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
made
his
speech
,
 
and
though
he
was
short
,
he
was
very
fiery
and
energetic
.
<EOS>
Quick
as
lightning
words
of
wrath
and
scorn
flew
from
him
,
in
which
he
painted
the
cowardice
,
the
meanness
,
the
falsehood
of
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
ballot
-
box
,
"
he
said
,
"
was
the
grave
of
all
true
political
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
Though
he
spoke
hardly
for
ten
minutes
,
he
seemed
to
say
more
than
enough
,
ten
times
enough
,
to
slaughter
the
argument
of
the
former
speaker
.
<EOS>
At
every
hot
word
as
it
fell
Phineas
was
driven
to
regret
that
a
paragraph
of
his
own
was
taken
away
from
him
,
and
that
his
choicest
morsels
of
standing
ground
were
being
cut
from
under
his
feet
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Monk
sat
down
,
Phineas
felt
that
Mr.
Monk
had
said
all
that
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
had
intended
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Turnbull
rose
slowly
from
the
bench
below
the
gangway
.
<EOS>
With
a
speaker
so
frequent
and
so
famous
as
Mr.
Turnbull
no
hurry
is
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
is
sure
to
have
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
The
Speaker
's
eye
is
ever
travelling
to
the
accustomed
spots
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
rose
slowly
and
began
his
oration
very
mildly
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
nothing
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
he
admired
so
much
as
the
poetic
imagery
and
the
high
-
flown
sentiment
of
his
right
honourable
friend
the
member
for
West
Bromwich
,
"
 
Mr.
Monk
sat
for
West
Bromwich
,
 
"
unless
it
were
the
stubborn
facts
and
unanswered
arguments
of
his
honourable
friend
who
had
brought
forward
this
motion
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Turnbull
proceeded
after
his
fashion
to
crush
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
prosaic
,
very
clear
both
in
voice
and
language
,
very
harsh
,
and
very
unscrupulous
.
<EOS>
He
and
Mr.
Monk
had
been
joined
together
in
politics
for
over
twenty
years
;
 
but
one
would
have
thought
,
from
Mr.
Turnbull
's
words
,
that
they
had
been
the
bitterest
of
enemies
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
was
taunted
with
his
office
,
taunted
with
his
desertion
of
the
liberal
party
,
taunted
with
his
ambition
,
 
and
taunted
with
his
lack
of
ambition
.
<EOS>
"
I
once
thought
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
"
nay
,
not
long
ago
I
thought
,
that
he
and
I
would
have
fought
this
battle
for
the
people
,
shoulder
to
shoulder
,
and
knee
to
knee
;
 
but
he
has
preferred
that
the
knee
next
to
his
own
shall
wear
a
garter
,
and
that
the
shoulder
which
supports
him
shall
be
decked
with
a
blue
ribbon
,
 
as
shoulders
,
I
presume
,
are
decked
in
those
closet
conferences
which
are
called
Cabinets
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
after
this
,
while
Mr.
Turnbull
was
still
going
on
with
a
variety
of
illustrations
drawn
from
the
United
States
,
Barrington
Erle
stepped
across
the
benches
up
to
the
place
where
Phineas
was
sitting
,
and
whispered
a
few
words
into
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"
Bonteen
is
prepared
to
answer
Turnbull
,
and
wishes
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
thought
you
should
have
the
opportunity
,
if
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
was
not
ready
with
a
reply
to
Erle
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
"
Somebody
told
me
,
"
continued
Erle
,
"
that
you
had
said
that
you
would
like
to
speak
to
-
night
.
"
  
"
So
I
did
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
Bonteen
that
you
will
do
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
chamber
seemed
to
swim
round
before
our
hero
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
was
still
going
on
with
his
clear
,
loud
,
unpleasant
voice
,
but
there
was
no
knowing
how
long
he
might
go
on
.
<EOS>
Upon
Phineas
,
if
he
should
now
consent
,
might
devolve
the
duty
,
within
ten
minutes
,
within
three
minutes
,
of
rising
there
before
a
full
House
to
defend
his
great
friend
,
Mr.
Monk
,
from
a
gross
personal
attack
.
<EOS>
Was
it
fit
that
such
a
novice
as
he
should
undertake
such
a
work
as
that
?
<EOS>
Were
he
to
do
so
,
all
that
speech
which
he
had
prepared
,
with
its
various
self
-
floating
parts
,
must
go
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
task
was
exactly
that
which
,
of
all
tasks
,
he
would
best
like
to
have
accomplished
,
and
to
have
accomplished
well
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
should
fail
!
<EOS>
And
he
felt
that
he
would
fail
.
<EOS>
For
such
work
a
man
should
have
all
his
senses
about
him
,
 
his
full
courage
,
perfect
confidence
,
something
almost
approaching
to
contempt
for
listening
opponents
,
and
nothing
of
fear
in
regard
to
listening
friends
.
<EOS>
He
should
be
as
a
cock
in
his
own
farmyard
,
master
of
all
the
circumstances
around
him
.
<EOS>
But
Phineas
Finn
had
not
even
as
yet
heard
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
in
that
room
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
so
confused
was
he
,
that
he
did
not
know
where
sat
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
where
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
.
<EOS>
All
was
confused
,
and
there
arose
as
it
were
a
sound
of
waters
in
his
ears
,
and
a
feeling
as
of
a
great
hell
around
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
rather
wait
,
"
he
said
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
Bonteen
had
better
reply
.
"
Barrington
Erle
looked
into
his
face
,
and
then
stepping
back
across
the
benches
,
told
Mr.
Bonteen
that
the
opportunity
was
his
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
continued
speaking
quite
long
enough
to
give
poor
Phineas
time
for
repentance
;
but
repentance
was
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
He
had
decided
against
himself
,
and
his
decision
could
not
be
reversed
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
left
the
House
,
only
it
seemed
to
him
that
had
he
done
so
every
one
would
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
drew
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
,
and
remained
in
his
place
,
hating
Mr.
Bonteen
,
hating
Barrington
Erle
,
hating
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
but
hating
no
one
so
much
as
he
hated
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
disgraced
himself
for
ever
and
could
never
recover
the
occasion
which
he
had
lost
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
's
speech
was
in
no
way
remarkable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
,
he
said
,
had
done
the
State
good
service
by
adding
his
wisdom
and
patriotism
to
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
The
sort
of
argument
which
Mr.
Bonteen
used
to
prove
that
a
man
who
has
gained
credit
as
a
legislator
should
in
process
of
time
become
a
member
of
the
executive
,
is
trite
and
common
,
and
was
not
used
by
Mr.
Bonteen
with
any
special
force
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bonteen
was
glib
of
tongue
and
possessed
that
familiarity
with
the
place
which
poor
Phineas
had
lacked
so
sorely
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
moment
,
however
,
which
was
terrible
to
Phineas
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Mr.
Bonteen
had
shown
the
purpose
for
which
he
was
on
his
legs
,
Mr.
Monk
looked
round
at
Phineas
,
as
though
in
reproach
.
<EOS>
He
had
expected
that
this
work
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
one
who
would
perform
it
with
more
warmth
of
heart
than
could
be
expected
from
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Bonteen
ceased
,
two
or
three
other
short
speeches
were
made
and
members
fired
off
their
little
guns
.
<EOS>
Phineas
having
lost
so
great
an
opportunity
,
would
not
now
consent
to
accept
one
that
should
be
comparatively
valueless
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
a
division
.
<EOS>
The
motion
was
lost
by
a
large
majority
,
 
by
any
number
you
might
choose
to
name
,
as
Phineas
had
said
to
Lord
Brentford
;
but
in
that
there
was
no
triumph
to
the
poor
wretch
who
had
failed
through
fear
,
and
who
was
now
a
coward
in
his
own
esteem
.
  
<EOS>
He
left
the
House
alone
,
carefully
avoiding
all
speech
with
any
one
.
<EOS>
As
he
came
out
he
had
seen
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
in
the
lobby
,
but
he
had
gone
on
without
pausing
a
moment
,
so
that
he
might
avoid
his
friend
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
was
out
in
Palace
Yard
,
where
was
he
to
go
next
?
<EOS>
He
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
found
that
it
was
just
ten
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
dare
to
go
to
his
club
,
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
go
home
and
to
bed
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
miserable
,
and
nothing
would
comfort
him
but
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Was
there
any
one
who
would
listen
to
his
abuse
of
himself
,
and
would
then
answer
him
with
kindly
apologies
for
his
own
weakness
?
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
would
do
it
if
she
knew
how
,
but
sympathy
from
Mrs.
Bunce
would
hardly
avail
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
person
in
the
world
to
whom
he
could
tell
his
own
humiliation
with
any
hope
of
comfort
,
and
that
person
was
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Sympathy
from
any
man
would
have
been
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
for
a
moment
of
flinging
himself
at
Mr.
Monk
's
feet
and
telling
all
his
weakness
;
 
but
he
could
not
have
endured
pity
even
from
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
endured
from
any
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
thought
that
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
would
be
at
home
,
and
probably
alone
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
at
any
rate
,
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
knock
at
her
door
,
even
at
that
hour
.
<EOS>
He
had
left
Mr.
Kennedy
in
the
House
,
and
there
he
would
probably
remain
for
the
next
hour
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
man
more
constant
than
Mr.
Kennedy
in
seeing
the
work
of
the
day
,
 
or
of
the
night
,
 
to
its
end
.
<EOS>
So
Phineas
walked
up
Victoria
Street
,
and
from
thence
into
Grosvenor
Place
,
and
knocked
at
Lady
Laura
's
door
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
Lady
Laura
was
at
home
;
and
alone
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
shown
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
there
he
found
Lady
Laura
waiting
for
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
the
great
debate
is
over
,
"
she
said
,
with
as
much
of
irony
as
she
knew
how
to
throw
into
the
epithet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
it
is
over
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
what
have
they
done
,
 
those
leviathans
of
the
people
?
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
told
her
what
was
the
majority
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
the
matter
with
you
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
looking
at
him
suddenly
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
not
well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
am
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
you
not
sit
down
?
<EOS>
There
is
something
wrong
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
simply
been
the
greatest
idiot
,
the
greatest
coward
,
the
most
awkward
ass
that
ever
lived
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
come
to
tell
you
of
it
at
this
hour
at
night
,
but
I
have
come
that
I
might
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Probably
because
there
is
no
one
else
in
the
whole
world
who
would
not
laugh
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
I
shall
not
laugh
at
you
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
despise
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
despise
myself
.
<EOS>
For
years
I
have
placed
before
myself
the
ambition
of
speaking
in
the
House
of
Commons
;
 
for
years
I
have
been
thinking
whether
there
would
ever
come
to
me
an
opportunity
of
making
myself
heard
in
that
assembly
,
which
I
consider
to
be
the
first
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
the
opportunity
has
been
offered
to
me
,
 
and
,
though
the
motion
was
nothing
,
the
opportunity
was
great
.
<EOS>
The
subject
was
one
on
which
I
was
thoroughly
prepared
.
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
I
was
summoned
was
most
flattering
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
especially
called
on
to
perform
a
task
which
was
most
congenial
to
my
feelings
;
 
and
I
declined
because
I
was
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
thought
too
much
about
it
,
my
friend
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Too
much
or
too
little
,
what
does
it
matter
?
"
<EOS>
replied
Phineas
,
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
fact
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
the
story
of
Conachar
in
the
"
Fair
Maid
of
Perth
;
"
 
how
his
heart
refused
to
give
him
blood
enough
to
fight
?
<EOS>
He
had
been
suckled
with
the
milk
of
a
timid
creature
,
and
,
though
he
could
die
,
there
was
none
of
the
strength
of
manhood
in
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
about
the
same
thing
with
me
,
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
are
at
all
like
Conachar
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
equally
disgraced
,
and
I
must
perish
after
the
same
fashion
.
<EOS>
I
shall
apply
for
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
getting
up
from
her
chair
and
coming
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
leave
this
room
till
you
have
promised
me
that
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
as
yet
<EOS>
what
has
occurred
to
-
night
;
but
I
do
know
that
that
modesty
which
has
kept
you
silent
is
more
often
a
grace
than
a
disgrace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
kind
of
sympathy
which
he
wanted
,
She
drew
her
chair
nearer
to
him
,
and
then
he
explained
to
her
as
accurately
as
he
could
what
had
taken
place
in
the
House
on
this
evening
,
 
how
he
had
prepared
his
speech
,
how
he
had
felt
that
his
preparation
was
vain
,
how
he
perceived
from
the
course
of
the
debate
that
if
he
spoke
at
all
his
speech
must
be
very
different
from
what
he
had
first
intended
;
how
he
had
declined
to
take
upon
himself
a
task
which
seemed
to
require
so
close
a
knowledge
of
the
ways
of
the
House
and
of
the
temper
of
the
men
,
as
the
defence
of
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
In
accusing
himself
he
,
unconsciously
,
excused
himself
,
and
his
excuse
,
in
Lady
Laura
's
ears
,
was
more
valid
than
his
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
would
give
it
all
up
for
that
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
think
I
ought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
very
little
doubt
but
that
you
were
right
in
allowing
Mr.
Bonteen
to
undertake
such
a
task
.
<EOS>
I
should
simply
explain
to
Mr.
Monk
that
you
felt
too
keen
an
interest
in
his
welfare
to
stand
up
as
an
untried
member
in
his
defence
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
,
I
think
,
the
work
for
a
man
who
is
not
at
home
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Mr.
Monk
will
feel
this
,
and
I
am
quite
certain
that
Mr.
Kennedy
will
think
that
you
have
been
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
what
Mr.
Kennedy
may
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
say
that
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
That
is
not
courteous
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Simply
because
I
care
so
much
what
Mr.
Kennedy
's
wife
may
think
.
<EOS>
Your
opinion
is
all
in
all
to
me
,
 
only
that
I
know
you
are
too
kind
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
be
too
kind
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
is
never
too
kind
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
is
justice
itself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
heard
the
tones
of
her
voice
,
could
not
but
feel
that
there
was
in
Lady
Laura
's
words
something
of
an
accusation
against
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
justice
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
justice
would
condemn
me
.
<EOS>
But
love
and
friendship
know
nothing
of
justice
.
<EOS>
The
value
of
love
is
that
it
overlooks
faults
,
and
forgives
even
crimes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
will
forgive
the
crime
of
your
silence
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
My
strong
belief
in
your
success
will
not
be
in
the
least
affected
by
what
you
tell
me
of
your
failure
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
You
must
await
another
opportunity
;
and
,
if
possible
,
you
should
be
less
anxious
as
to
your
own
performance
.
<EOS>
There
is
Violet
.
"
<EOS>
As
Lady
Laura
spoke
the
last
words
,
there
was
a
sound
of
a
carriage
stopping
in
the
street
,
and
the
front
door
was
immediately
opened
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
staying
here
,
but
has
been
dining
with
her
uncle
,
Admiral
Effingham
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Violet
Effingham
entered
the
room
,
rolled
up
in
pretty
white
furs
,
and
silk
cloaks
,
and
lace
shawls
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
Mr.
Finn
,
come
to
tell
us
of
the
debate
about
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
twopence
about
the
ballot
,
"
said
Violet
,
as
she
put
out
her
hand
to
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
Are
we
going
to
have
a
new
iron
fleet
built
?
<EOS>
That
's
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
Simeon
has
come
out
strong
to
-
night
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
political
question
of
any
importance
except
the
question
of
the
iron
fleet
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
sure
of
that
,
and
so
,
if
Mr.
Finn
can
tell
me
nothing
about
the
iron
fleet
,
I
'll
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
will
tell
you
everything
when
he
comes
home
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Kennedy
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
never
tells
one
anything
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
Mr.
Kennedy
thinks
that
any
woman
knows
the
meaning
of
the
British
Constitution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
what
it
means
,
Violet
?
"
asked
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
is
liberty
to
growl
about
the
iron
fleet
,
or
the
ballot
,
or
the
taxes
,
or
the
peers
,
or
the
bishops
,
 
or
anything
else
,
except
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
British
Constitution
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
beautiful
creature
she
is
!
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
full
of
wit
and
grace
and
pleasantness
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
at
your
brother
's
choice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
will
be
remembered
that
this
was
said
on
the
day
before
Lord
Chiltern
had
made
his
offer
for
the
third
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Oswald
!
<EOS>
he
does
not
know
as
yet
that
she
is
in
town
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
Phineas
went
,
not
wishing
to
await
the
return
of
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
He
had
felt
that
Violet
Effingham
had
come
into
the
room
just
in
time
to
remedy
a
great
difficulty
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
his
love
to
a
married
woman
,
 
to
the
wife
of
the
man
who
called
him
friend
,
 
to
a
woman
who
he
felt
sure
would
have
rebuked
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
hardly
have
restrained
himself
had
not
Miss
Effingham
been
there
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
he
went
home
he
thought
more
of
Miss
Effingham
than
he
did
of
Lady
Laura
;
and
I
think
that
the
voice
of
Miss
Effingham
had
done
almost
as
much
towards
comforting
him
as
had
the
kindness
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
had
been
comforted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
be
punctual
"
 
<EOS>
On
the
very
morning
after
his
failure
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
when
Phineas
was
reading
in
the
_
Telegraph
_
,
 
he
took
the
_
Telegraph
_
not
from
choice
but
for
economy
,
 
the
words
of
that
debate
which
he
had
heard
and
in
which
he
should
have
taken
a
part
,
a
most
unwelcome
visit
was
paid
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
near
eleven
,
and
the
breakfast
things
were
still
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
this
time
on
a
Committee
of
the
House
with
reference
to
the
use
of
potted
peas
in
the
army
and
navy
,
at
which
he
had
sat
once
,
 
at
a
preliminary
meeting
,
 
and
in
reference
to
which
he
had
already
resolved
that
as
he
had
failed
so
frightfully
in
debate
,
he
would
certainly
do
his
duty
to
the
utmost
in
the
more
easy
but
infinitely
more
tedious
work
of
the
Committee
Room
.
<EOS>
The
Committee
met
at
twelve
,
and
he
intended
to
walk
down
to
the
Reform
Club
,
and
then
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
completed
his
reading
of
the
debate
and
of
the
leaders
in
the
_
Telegraph
_
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
himself
how
little
the
writer
of
the
article
knew
about
Mr.
Turnbull
,
how
little
about
Mr.
Monk
,
and
how
little
about
the
people
,
 
such
being
his
own
ideas
as
to
the
qualifications
of
the
writer
of
that
leading
article
,
 
and
was
about
to
start
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Bunce
arrested
him
by
telling
him
that
there
was
a
man
below
who
wanted
to
see
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
a
man
,
Mrs.
Bunce
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
ai
n't
a
gentleman
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
give
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
,
sir
;
<EOS>
but
I
know
it
's
about
money
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
ways
of
them
<EOS>
so
well
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
this
one
's
face
before
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
show
him
up
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
He
knew
well
the
business
on
which
the
man
was
come
.
<EOS>
The
man
wanted
money
for
that
bill
which
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
sent
afloat
,
and
which
Phineas
had
endorsed
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
never
as
yet
fallen
so
deeply
into
troubles
of
money
as
to
make
it
necessary
that
he
need
refuse
himself
to
any
callers
on
that
score
,
and
he
did
not
choose
to
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
most
heartily
wished
that
he
had
left
his
lodgings
for
the
club
before
the
man
had
come
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
the
first
he
had
heard
of
the
bill
being
overdue
and
unpaid
.
<EOS>
The
bill
had
been
brought
to
him
noted
a
month
since
,
and
then
he
had
simply
told
the
youth
who
brought
it
that
he
would
see
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
and
have
the
matter
settled
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
to
his
friend
Laurence
,
and
Laurence
had
simply
assured
him
that
all
should
be
made
right
in
two
days
,
 
or
,
at
furthest
,
by
the
end
of
a
week
.
<EOS>
Since
that
time
he
had
observed
that
his
friend
had
been
somewhat
shy
of
speaking
to
him
when
no
others
were
with
them
.
<EOS>
Phineas
would
not
have
alluded
to
the
bill
had
he
and
Laurence
been
alone
together
;
but
he
had
been
quick
enough
to
guess
from
his
friend
's
manner
that
the
matter
was
not
settled
.
<EOS>
Now
,
no
doubt
,
serious
trouble
was
about
to
commence
.
  
<EOS>
The
visitor
was
a
little
man
with
grey
hair
and
a
white
cravat
,
some
sixty
years
of
age
,
dressed
in
black
,
with
a
very
decent
hat
,
 
which
,
on
entering
the
room
,
he
at
once
put
down
on
the
nearest
chair
,
 
with
reference
to
whom
,
any
judge
on
the
subject
would
have
concurred
at
first
sight
in
the
decision
pronounced
by
Mrs.
Bunce
,
though
none
but
a
judge
very
well
used
to
sift
the
causes
of
his
own
conclusions
could
have
given
the
reasons
for
that
early
decision
.
"
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
a
gentleman
,
"
Mrs.
Bunce
had
said
.
<EOS>
And
the
man
certainly
was
not
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
in
the
white
cravat
was
very
neatly
dressed
,
and
carried
himself
without
any
of
that
humility
which
betrays
one
class
of
uncertified
aspirants
to
gentility
,
or
of
that
assumed
arrogance
which
is
at
once
fatal
to
another
class
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
Mrs.
Bunce
had
seen
at
a
glance
that
he
was
not
a
gentleman
,
 
had
seen
,
moreover
,
that
such
a
man
could
have
come
only
upon
one
mission
.
<EOS>
She
was
right
there
too
.
<EOS>
This
visitor
had
come
about
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
this
bill
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
proceeding
to
take
out
of
his
breast
coat
-
pocket
a
rather
large
leathern
case
,
as
he
advanced
up
towards
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Clarkson
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
If
I
may
venture
so
far
,
I
'll
take
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
Mr.
Clarkson
,
"
said
Phineas
,
getting
up
and
pointing
to
a
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thankye
,
Mr.
Finn
,
thankye
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
more
comfortable
doing
business
sitting
,
sha
n't
we
?
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
horrid
little
man
drew
himself
close
in
to
the
fire
,
and
spreading
out
his
leathern
case
upon
his
knees
,
began
to
turn
over
one
suspicious
bit
of
paper
after
another
,
as
though
he
were
uncertain
in
what
part
of
his
portfolio
lay
this
identical
bit
which
he
was
seeking
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
quite
at
home
,
and
to
feel
that
there
was
no
ground
whatever
for
hurry
in
such
comfortable
quarters
.
<EOS>
Phineas
hated
him
at
once
,
 
with
a
hatred
altogether
unconnected
with
the
difficulty
which
his
friend
Fitzgibbon
had
brought
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
,
"
said
Mr.
Clarkson
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
me
,
dear
me
!
<EOS>
the
third
of
November
,
and
here
we
are
in
March
!
<EOS>
I
did
n't
think
it
was
so
bad
as
this
;
 
I
did
n't
indeed
.
<EOS>
This
is
very
bad
,
 
very
bad
!
<EOS>
And
for
Parliament
gents
,
too
,
who
should
be
more
punctual
than
anybody
,
because
of
the
privilege
.
<EOS>
Should
n't
they
now
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
men
should
be
punctual
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
they
should
;
of
course
they
should
.
<EOS>
I
always
say
to
my
gents
,
"
Be
punctual
,
and
I
'll
do
anything
for
you
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
Finn
,
you
can
hand
me
a
cheque
for
this
amount
,
and
then
you
and
I
will
begin
square
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
can
not
,
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
hand
me
a
cheque
for
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
very
bad
;
 
very
bad
indeed
.
<EOS>
Then
I
suppose
I
must
take
the
half
,
and
renew
for
the
remainder
,
though
I
do
n't
like
it
;
 
I
do
n't
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
pay
no
part
of
that
bill
,
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pay
no
part
of
it
!
"
and
Mr.
Clarkson
,
in
order
that
he
might
the
better
express
his
surprise
,
arrested
his
hand
in
the
very
act
of
poking
his
host
's
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
'll
allow
me
,
I
'll
manage
the
fire
,
"
said
Phineas
,
putting
out
his
hand
for
the
poker
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Clarkson
was
fond
of
poking
fires
,
and
would
not
surrender
the
poker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pay
no
part
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
again
,
holding
the
poker
away
from
Phineas
in
his
left
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
that
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
drive
me
to
be
severe
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
be
severe
with
my
gents
.
<EOS>
I
'll
do
anything
,
Mr.
Finn
,
if
you
'll
only
be
punctual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
Mr.
Clarkson
,
I
have
never
had
one
penny
of
consideration
for
that
bill
,
and
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Finn
!
<EOS>
oh
,
Mr.
Finn
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
Mr.
Clarkson
had
his
will
of
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
had
one
penny
of
consideration
for
that
bill
,
"
continued
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
I
do
n't
deny
my
responsibility
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Finn
;
you
ca
n't
deny
that
.
<EOS>
Here
it
is
;
 
Phineas
Finn
;
 
and
everybody
knows
you
,
because
you
're
a
Parliament
gent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
deny
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
I
should
be
called
upon
for
the
money
when
I
accommodated
my
friend
,
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
and
I
have
not
got
it
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
him
and
take
care
that
arrangements
are
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Arrangements
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
arrangements
for
settling
the
bill
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
has
n't
got
the
money
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
Mr.
Finn
;
you
know
;
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
"
said
Phineas
,
waxing
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
he
's
the
pleasantest
gent
that
ever
lived
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
he
now
?
<EOS>
I
've
<EOS>
know'd
him

these
ten
years
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
that
for
ten
years
I
've
been
without
his
name
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
But
,
bless
you
,
Mr.
Finn
<EOS>
,
there
's
an
end
to
everything
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
looked
at
this
bit
of
paper
if
it
had
n't
been
for
your
signature
.
<EOS>
Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
You
're
just
beginning
,
and
it
's
natural
<EOS>
you
should
want
a
little
help
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
me
always
ready
,
if
you
'll
only
be
punctual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
again
,
sir
,
that
I
never
had
a
shilling
out
of
that
for
myself
,
and
do
not
want
any
such
help
.
"
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Clarkson
smiled
sweetly
.
<EOS>
"
I
gave
my
name
to
my
friend
simply
to
oblige
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
you
Irish
gents
because
you
do
hang
together
so
close
,
"
said
Mr.
Clarkson
.
  
<EOS>
"
Simply
to
oblige
him
,
"
continued
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
said
before
,
I
know
that
I
am
responsible
;
but
,
as
I
said
before
also
,
I
have
not
the
means
of
taking
up
that
bill
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
and
let
you
know
what
we
propose
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
got
up
from
his
seat
and
took
his
hat
.
<EOS>
It
was
full
time
that
he
should
go
down
to
his
Committee
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Clarkson
did
not
get
up
from
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
I
must
ask
you
to
leave
me
now
,
Mr.
Clarkson
,
as
I
have
business
down
at
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Business
at
the
House
never
presses
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
best
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
've
known
Parliament
gents
this
thirty
years
and
more
.
<EOS>
Would
you
believe
it
 
<EOS>
I
've
had
a
Prime
Minister
's
name
in
that
portfolio
;
that
I
have
;
and
a
Lord
Chancellor
's
;
that
I
have
;
 
and
an
Archbishop
's
too
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
Parliament
is
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
;
do
n't
put
me
off
with
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
he
sat
before
the
fire
with
his
pouch
open
before
him
,
and
Phineas
had
no
power
of
moving
him
.
<EOS>
Could
Phineas
have
paid
him
the
money
which
was
manifestly
due
to
him
on
the
bill
,
the
man
would
of
course
have
gone
;
but
failing
in
that
,
Phineas
could
not
turn
him
out
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
black
cloud
on
the
young
member
's
brow
,
and
great
anger
at
his
heart
,
 
against
Fitzgibbon
rather
than
against
the
man
who
was
sitting
there
before
him
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
it
is
really
imperative
that
I
should
go
.
<EOS>
I
am
pledged
to
an
appointment
at
the
House
at
twelve
,
and
it
wants
now
only
a
quarter
.
<EOS>
I
regret
that
your
interview
with
me
should
be
so
unsatisfactory
,
but
I
can
only
promise
you
that
I
will
see
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
when
shall
I
call
again
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
had
better
write
to
you
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
no
,
"
said
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
much
prefer
to
look
in
.
<EOS>
Looking
in
is
always
best
.
<EOS>
We
can
get
to
understand
one
another
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
you
're
not
particular
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
say
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Really
,
I
could
not
see
you
on
Sunday
morning
,
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Parliament
gents
ai
n't
generally
particular
,
 
"
speciaily
not
among
the
Catholics
,
"
pleaded
Mr.
Clarkson
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
always
engaged
on
Sundays
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
we
say
Monday
,
 
or
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
Tuesday
morning
at
eleven
.
<EOS>
And
do
be
punctual
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
At
Tuesday
morning
I
'll
come
,
and
then
no
doubt
I
shall
find
you
ready
.
"
<EOS>
Whereupon
Mr.
Clarkson
slowly
put
up
his
bills
within
his
portfolio
,
and
then
,
before
Phineas
knew
where
he
was
,
had
warmly
shaken
that
poor
dismayed
member
of
Parliament
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Only
do
be
punctual
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
made
his
way
down
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
twelve
,
and
Phineas
rushed
off
to
a
cab
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
such
a
fervour
of
rage
and
misery
that
he
could
hardly
think
of
his
position
,
or
what
he
had
better
do
,
till
he
got
into
the
Committee
Room
;
and
when
there
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
He
intended
to
go
deeply
into
the
question
of
potted
peas
,
holding
an
equal
balance
between
the
assailed
Government
offices
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
advocates
of
the
potted
peas
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
potters
of
the
peas
,
who
wanted
to
sell
their
article
to
the
Crown
,
declared
that
an
extensive
,
 
perhaps
we
may
say
,
an
unlimited
,
 
use
of
the
article
would
save
the
whole
army
and
navy
from
the
scourges
of
scurvy
,
dyspepsia
,
and
rheumatism
,
would
be
the
best
safeguard
against
typhus
and
other
fevers
,
and
would
be
an
invaluable
aid
in
all
other
maladies
to
which
soldiers
and
sailors
are
peculiarly
subject
.
<EOS>
The
peas
in
question
were
grown
on
a
large
scale
in
Holstein
,
and
their
growth
had
been
fostered
with
the
special
object
of
doing
good
to
the
British
army
and
navy
.
<EOS>
The
peas
were
so
cheap
that
there
would
be
a
great
saving
in
money
,
 
and
it
really
had
seemed
to
many
that
the
officials
of
the
Horse
Guards
and
the
Admiralty
had
been
actuated
by
some
fiendish
desire
to
deprive
their
men
of
salutary
fresh
vegetables
,
simply
because
they
were
of
foreign
growth
.
<EOS>
But
the
officials
of
the
War
Office
and
the
Admiralty
declared
that
the
potted
peas
in
question
were
hardly
fit
for
swine
.
<EOS>
The
motion
for
the
Committee
had
been
made
by
a
gentleman
of
the
opposition
,
and
Phineas
had
been
put
upon
it
as
an
independent
member
.
<EOS>
He
had
resolved
to
give
it
all
his
mind
,
and
,
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
,
to
reach
a
just
decision
,
in
which
there
should
be
no
favour
shown
to
the
Government
side
.
<EOS>
New
brooms
are
proverbial
for
thorough
work
,
and
in
this
Committee
work
Phineas
was
as
yet
a
new
broom
.
<EOS>
But
,
unfortunately
,
on
this
day
his
mind
was
so
harassed
that
he
could
hardly
understand
what
was
going
on
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
,
perhaps
,
much
signify
,
as
the
witnesses
examined
were
altogether
agricultural
.
<EOS>
They
only
proved
the
production
of
peas
in
Holstein
,
 
a
fact
as
to
which
Phineas
had
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
The
proof
was
naturally
slow
,
as
the
evidence
was
given
in
German
,
and
had
to
be
translated
into
English
.
<EOS>
And
the
work
of
the
day
was
much
impeded
by
a
certain
member
who
unfortunately
spoke
German
,
who
seemed
to
be
fond
of
speaking
German
before
his
brethren
of
the
Committee
,
and
who
was
curious
as
to
agriculture
in
Holstein
generally
.
<EOS>
The
chairman
did
not
understand
German
,
and
there
was
a
difficulty
in
checking
this
gentleman
,
and
in
making
him
understand
that
his
questions
were
not
relevant
to
the
issue
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
could
not
keep
his
mind
during
the
whole
afternoon
from
the
subject
of
his
misfortune
.
<EOS>
What
should
he
do
if
this
horrid
man
came
to
him
once
or
twice
a
week
?
<EOS>
He
certainly
did
owe
the
man
the
money
.
<EOS>
He
must
admit
that
to
himself
.
<EOS>
The
man
no
doubt
was
a
dishonest
knave
who
had
discounted
the
bill
probably
at
fifty
per
cent
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
Phineas
had
made
himself
legally
responsible
for
the
amount
.
<EOS>
The
privilege
of
the
House
prohibited
him
from
arrest
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
that
very
often
,
but
the
thought
only
made
him
the
more
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
said
,
and
might
it
not
be
said
truly
,
that
he
had
incurred
this
responsibility
,
 
a
responsibility
which
he
was
altogether
unequal
to
answer
,
 
because
he
was
so
protected
?
<EOS>
He
did
feel
that
a
certain
consciousness
of
his
privilege
had
been
present
to
him
when
he
had
put
his
name
across
the
paper
,
and
there
had
been
dishonesty
in
that
very
consciousness
.
<EOS>
And
of
what
service
would
his
privilege
be
to
him
,
if
this
man
could
harass
every
hour
of
his
life
?
<EOS>
The
man
was
to
be
with
him
again
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
when
the
appointment
had
been
proposed
,
he
,
Phineas
,
had
not
dared
to
negative
it
.
<EOS>
And
how
was
he
to
escape
?
<EOS>
As
for
paying
the
bill
,
that
with
him
was
altogether
impossible
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
told
him
,
 
and
he
had
believed
the
man
,
 
that
payment
by
Fitzgibbon
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
And
yet
Fitzgibbon
was
the
son
of
a
peer
,
whereas
he
was
only
the
son
of
a
country
doctor
!
<EOS>
Of
course
Fitzgibbon
must
make
some
effort
,
 
some
great
effort
,
 
and
have
the
thing
settled
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
He
knew
enough
of
the
world
already
to
feel
that
the
hope
was
vain
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
down
from
the
Committee
Room
into
the
House
,
and
he
dined
at
the
House
,
and
remained
there
until
eight
or
nine
at
night
;
but
Fitzgibbon
did
not
come
.
<EOS>
He
then
went
to
the
Reform
Club
,
but
he
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
Both
at
the
club
and
in
the
House
many
men
spoke
to
him
about
the
debate
of
the
previous
night
,
expressing
surprise
that
he
had
not
spoken
,
 
making
him
more
and
more
wretched
.
<EOS>
He
saw
Mr.
Monk
,
but
Mr.
Monk
was
walking
arm
in
arm
with
his
colleague
,
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
Phineas
could
do
no
more
than
just
speak
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
Mr.
Monk
's
nod
of
recognition
was
very
cold
.
<EOS>
That
might
be
fancy
,
but
it
certainly
was
a
fact
that
Mr.
Monk
only
nodded
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
tell
Mr.
Monk
the
truth
,
and
then
,
if
Mr.
Monk
chose
to
quarrel
with
him
,
he
at
any
rate
would
take
no
step
to
renew
their
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
Reform
Club
he
went
to
the
Shakspeare
,
a
smaller
club
to
which
Fitzgibbon
belonged
,
 
and
of
which
Phineas
much
wished
to
become
a
member
,
 
and
to
which
he
knew
that
his
friend
resorted
when
he
wished
to
enjoy
himself
thoroughly
,
and
to
be
at
ease
in
his
inn
.
<EOS>
Men
at
the
Shakspeare
could
do
as
they
pleased
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
politics
there
,
no
fashion
,
no
stiffness
,
and
no
rules
,
 
so
men
said
;
but
that
was
hardly
true
.
<EOS>
Everybody
called
everybody
by
his
Christian
name
,
and
members
smoked
all
over
the
house
.
<EOS>
They
who
did
not
belong
to
the
Shakspeare
thought
it
an
Elysium
upon
earth
;
and
they
who
did
,
believed
it
to
be
among
Pandemoniums
the
most
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Phineas
called
at
the
Shakspeare
,
and
was
told
by
the
porter
that
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
was
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
He
was
shown
into
the
strangers
room
,
and
in
five
minutes
his
friend
came
down
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
you
to
come
down
to
the
Reform
with
me
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
jingo
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
'm
in
the
middle
of
a
rubber
of
whist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
a
man
with
me
about
that
bill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
 
Clarkson
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Clarkson
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mind
him
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
nonsense
.
<EOS>
How
am
I
to
help
minding
him
?
<EOS>
I
must
mind
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
coming
to
me
again
on
Tuesday
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
help
seeing
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Make
them
say
you
're
not
at
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
made
an
appointment
.
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
that
he
'll
never
leave
me
alone
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
the
death
of
me
if
this
is
not
settled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
settled
,
my
dear
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
about
it
and
write
you
a
line
.
<EOS>
You
must
excuse
me
now
,
because
those
fellows
are
waiting
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
it
all
arranged
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
as
Phineas
went
home
he
thoroughly
wished
that
he
had
not
seceded
from
Mr.
Low
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
at
Home
 
<EOS>
About
the
middle
of
March
Lady
Baldock
came
up
from
Baddingham
to
London
,
coerced
into
doing
so
,
as
Violet
Effingham
declared
,
in
thorough
opposition
to
all
her
own
tastes
,
by
the
known
wishes
of
her
friends
and
relatives
.
<EOS>
Her
friends
and
relatives
,
so
Miss
Effingham
insinuated
,
were
unanimous
in
wishing
that
Lady
Baldock
should
remain
at
Baddingham
Park
,
and
therefore
,
 
that
wish
having
been
indiscreetly
expressed
,
 
she
had
put
herself
to
great
inconvenience
,
and
had
come
to
London
in
March
.
<EOS>
"
Gustavus
will
go
mad
,
"
said
Violet
to
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
The
Gustavus
in
question
was
the
Lord
Baldock
of
the
present
generation
,
Miss
Effingham
's
Lady
Baldock
being
the
peer
's
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Why
does
not
Lord
Baldock
take
a
house
himself
?
"
asked
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
,
my
dear
,
"
Violet
answered
,
"
how
much
we
Baddingham
people
think
of
money
?
<EOS>
We
do
n't
like
being
vexed
and
driven
mad
,
but
even
that
is
better
than
keeping
up
two
households
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
regarded
Violet
,
the
injury
arising
from
Lady
Baldock
's
early
migration
was
very
great
,
for
she
was
thus
compelled
to
move
from
Grosvenor
Place
to
Lady
Baldock
's
house
in
Berkeley
Square
.
<EOS>
"
As
you
are
so
fond
of
being
in
London
,
Augusta
<EOS>
and
I
have
made
up
our
minds
to
come
up
before
Easter
,
"
Lady
Baldock
had
written
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
to
her
now
,
<EOS>
"
Violet
had
said
to
her
friend
,
"
because
I
have
not
quite
made
up
my
mind
as
to
what
I
will
do
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Marry
Oswald
,
and
be
your
own
mistress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
be
my
own
mistress
without
marrying
Oswald
,
though
I
do
n't
see
my
way
quite
clearly
as
yet
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
set
up
a
little
house
of
my
own
,
and
let
the
world
say
what
it
pleases
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
they
could
n't
make
me
out
to
be
a
lunatic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wonder
if
they
were
to
try
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
could
not
prevent
me
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
in
the
dark
as
yet
,
and
so
I
shall
be
obedient
and
go
to
my
aunt
.

"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
went
to
Berkeley
Square
,
and
Phineas
Finn
was
introduced
to
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
often
in
Grosvenor
Place
,
and
had
seen
Violet
frequently
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
gave
periodical
dinners
,
 
once
a
week
,
 
to
which
everybody
went
who
could
get
an
invitation
;
and
Phineas
had
been
a
guest
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
in
spite
of
his
miseries
he
had
taken
to
dining
out
a
good
deal
,
and
was
popular
as
an
eater
of
dinners
.
<EOS>
He
could
talk
when
wanted
,
and
did
not
talk
too
much
,
was
pleasant
in
manners
and
appearance
,
and
had
already
achieved
a
certain
recognised
position
in
London
life
.
<EOS>
Of
those
who
knew
him
intimately
,
not
one
in
twenty
were
aware
from
whence
<EOS>
he
came
,
what
was
his
parentage
,
or
what
his
means
of
living
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
member
of
Parliament
,
a
friend
of
Mr.
Kennedy
's
,
was
intimate
with
Mr.
Monk
,
though
an
Irishman
did
not
as
a
rule
herd
with
other
Irishmen
,
and
was
the
right
sort
of
person
to
have
at
your
house
.
<EOS>
Some
people
said
he
was
a
cousin
of
Lord
Brentford
's
,
and
others
declared
that
he
was
Lord
Chiltern
's
earliest
friend
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
,
however
,
with
a
position
gained
,
and
even
Lady
Baldock
asked
him
to
her
house
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
had
evenings
.
<EOS>
People
went
to
her
house
,
and
stood
about
the
room
and
on
the
stairs
,
talked
to
each
other
for
half
an
hour
,
and
went
away
.
<EOS>
In
these
March
days
there
was
no
crowding
,
but
still
there
were
always
enough
of
people
there
to
show
that
Lady
Baldock
was
successful
.
<EOS>
Why
people
should
have
gone
to
Lady
Baldock
's
<EOS>
I
can
not
explain
;
 
but
there
are
houses
to
which
people
go
without
any
reason
.
<EOS>
Phineas
received
a
little
card
asking
him
to
go
,
and
he
always
went
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
like
my
friend
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
Lady
Laura
said
to
Miss
Effingham
,
after
the
first
of
these
evenings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
like
him
decidedly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I.
I
should
hardly
have
thought
that
you
would
have
taken
a
fancy
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
what
you
call
taking
a
fancy
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
quite
sure
I
like
to
be
told
that
I
have
taken
a
fancy
for
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
no
offence
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
do
n't
But
,
to
speak
truth
,
I
think
I
have
rather
taken
a
fancy
to
him
.
<EOS>
There
is
just
enough
of
him
,
but
not
too
much
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
materially
,
 
in
regard
to
his
inches
;
but
as
to
his
mental
belongings
.
<EOS>
I
hate
a
stupid
man
who
ca
n't
talk
to
me
,
and
I
hate
a
clever
man
who
talks
me
down
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
a
man
who
is
too
lazy
to
make
any
effort
to
shine
;
but
I
particularly
dislike
the
man
who
is
always
striving
for
effect
.
<EOS>
I
abominate
a
humble
man
,
but
yet
I
love
to
perceive
that
a
man
acknowledges
the
superiority
of
my
sex
,
and
youth
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
be
flattered
without
plain
flattery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
would
tell
me
that
I
am
pretty
,
unless
he
is
over
seventy
,
ought
to
be
kicked
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
But
a
man
who
ca
n't
show
me
that
he
thinks
me
so
without
saying
a
word
about
it
,
is
a
lout
.
<EOS>
Now
in
all
those
matters
,
your
friend
,
Mr.
Finn
,
seems
to
know
what
he
is
about
.
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
he
makes
himself
pleasant
,
and
,
therefore
,
one
is
glad
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
do
not
mean
to
fall
in
love
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
know
of
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
do
,
I
'll
be
sure
to
give
you
notice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
fear
that
there
was
more
of
earnestness
in
Lady
Laura
's
last
question
than
Miss
Effingham
had
supposed
.
<EOS>
She
had
declared
to
herself
over
and
over
again
that
she
had
never
been
in
love
with
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
She
had
acknowledged
to
herself
,
before
Mr.
Kennedy
had
asked
her
hand
in
marriage
,
that
there
had
been
danger
,
 
that
she
could
have
learned
to
love
the
man
if
such
love
would
not
have
been
ruinous
to
her
,
 
that
the
romance
of
such
a
passion
would
have
been
pleasant
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
gone
farther
than
this
,
and
had
said
to
herself
that
she
would
have
given
way
to
that
romance
,
and
would
have
been
ready
to
accept
such
love
if
offered
to
her
,
<EOS>
had
she
not
put
it
out
of
her
own
power
to
marry
a
poor
man
by
her
generosity
to
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Then
she
had
thrust
the
thing
aside
,
and
had
clearly
understood
,
 
she
thought
that
she
had
clearly
understood
,
 
that
life
for
her
must
be
a
matter
of
business
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
the
case
with
nine
out
of
every
ten
among
mankind
,
with
nine
hundred
and
ninety
-
nine
out
of
every
thousand
,
that
life
must
be
a
matter
of
business
and
not
of
romance
?
<EOS>
Of
course
she
could
not
marry
Mr.
Finn
,
knowing
,
as
she
did
,
that
neither
of
them
had
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
Of
all
men
in
the
world
she
esteemed
Mr.
Kennedy
the
most
,
and
when
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
her
mind
,
she
was
well
aware
that
he
would
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Had
she
not
resolved
that
she
would
accept
the
offer
,
she
would
not
have
gone
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
Having
put
aside
all
romance
as
unfitted
to
her
life
,
she
could
,
she
thought
,
do
her
duty
as
Mr.
Kennedy
's
wife
.
<EOS>
She
would
teach
herself
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
 
she
had
taught
herself
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
any
rate
so
sure
of
her
own
heart
that
she
would
never
give
her
husband
cause
to
rue
the
confidence
he
placed
in
her
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
was
something
sore
within
her
when
she
thought
that
Phineas
Finn
was
fond
of
Violet
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
Lady
Baldock
's
second
evening
,
and
Phineas
came
to
the
house
at
about
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
he
had
encountered
a
second
and
a
third
interview
with
Mr.
Clarkson
,
and
had
already
failed
in
obtaining
any
word
of
comfort
from
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
about
the
bill
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
enough
now
that
Laurence
felt
that
they
were
both
made
safe
by
their
privilege
,
and
that
Mr.
Clarkson
should
be
treated
as
you
treat
the
organ
-
grinders
.
<EOS>
They
are
a
nuisance
and
must
be
endured
.
<EOS>
But
the
nuisance
is
not
so
great
<EOS>
but
what
you
can
live
in
comfort
,
 
if
only
you
are
not
too
sore
as
to
the
annoyance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
fellow
,
"
Laurence
had
said
to
him
,
"
I
have
had
Clarkson
almost
living
in
my
rooms
.
<EOS>
He
used
to
drink
nearly
a
pint
of
sherry
a
day
for
me
.
<EOS>
All
I
looked
to
was
that
I
did
n't
live
there
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
it
,
I
'll
send
in
the
sherry
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
very
bad
,
and
Phineas
tried
to
quarrel
with
his
friend
;
but
he
found
that
it
was
difficult
to
quarrel
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
on
this
side
Phineas
was
very
miserable
,
on
another
side
he
had
obtained
great
comfort
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
and
he
were
better
friends
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
what
Turnbull
says
about
me
in
the
House
,
"
Mr.
Monk
had
said
,
laughing
;
"
he
and
I
understand
each
other
perfectly
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
you
on
your
legs
,
but
it
is
just
as
well
,
perhaps
,
that
you
have
deferred
it
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
the
real
question
on
immediately
after
Easter
,
and
then
you
'll
have
plenty
of
opportunities
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
had
explained
how
he
had
attempted
,
how
he
had
failed
,
and
how
he
had
suffered
;
 
and
Mr.
Monk
had
been
generous
in
his
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
about
it
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
have
gone
through
it
all
myself
.
<EOS>
The
more
respect
you
feel
for
the
House
,
the
more
satisfaction
you
will
have
in
addressing
it
when
you
have
mastered
this
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
first
person
who
spoke
to
Phineas
at
Lady
Baldock
's
was
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
Laurence
's
sister
.
<EOS>
Aspasia
Fitzgibbon
was
a
warm
woman
as
regarded
money
,
and
as
she
was
moreover
a
most
discreet
spinster
,
she
was
made
welcome
by
Lady
Baldock
,
in
spite
of
the
well
-
known
iniquities
of
her
male
relatives
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
she
,
"
how
d'ye
do
?
<EOS>
I
want
to
say
a
word
to
ye
.
<EOS>
Just
come
here
into
the
corner
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
not
knowing
how
to
escape
,
did
retreat
into
the
corner
with
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
now
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
have
ye
been
lending
money
to
Laurence
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
have
lent
him
no
money
,
"
said
Phineas
,
much
astonished
by
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
.
<EOS>
That
's
my
advice
to
ye
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
.
<EOS>
On
any
other
matter
Laurence
is
the
best
creature
in
the
world
,
 
but
he
's
bad
to
lend
money
to
.
<EOS>
You
ai
n't
in
any
hobble
with
him
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
 
nothing
to
speak
of
.
<EOS>
What
makes
you
ask
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
in
a
hobble
?
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
!
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
man
as
Laurence
;
 
never
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
do
it
again
,
if
I
were
you
;
 
<EOS>
that
's
all
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Miss
Fitzgibbon
came
out
of
the
corner
and
made
her
way
down
-
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
immediately
afterwards
came
across
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
,
"
said
she
,
"
that
you
and
the
divine
Aspasia
were
such
close
allies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
the
dearest
friends
in
the
world
,
but
she
has
taken
my
breath
away
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
a
body
be
told
how
she
has
done
that
?
"
Violet
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
no
<EOS>
;
I
'm
afraid
not
,
even
though
the
body
be
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
profound
secret
;
 
really
a
secret
concerning
a
third
person
,
and
she
began
about
it
just
as
though
she
were
speaking
about
the
weather
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
charming
!
<EOS>
I
do
so
like
her
.
<EOS>
You
have
n't
heard
,
have
you
,
that
Mr.
Ratler
proposed
to
her
the
other
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
did
;
 
at
least
,
so
she
tells
everybody
.
<EOS>
She
said
she
'd
take
him
if
he
would
promise
to
get
her
brother
's
salary
doubled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
tell
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
not
me
.
<EOS>
And
of
course
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Barrington
Erle
made
up
the
story
.
<EOS>
Are
you
going
out
of
town
next
week
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
week
next
to
this
was
Easter
-
week
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
you
were
going
into
Northamptonshire
.
"
  
"
From
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
from
Lady
Laura
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
spend
three
days
with
Lord
Chiltern
at
Willingford
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
old
promise

<EOS>
I
am
going
to
ride
his
horses
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
if
I
am
able
to
ride
them

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care
what
you
are
about
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
they
say
his
horses
are
so
dangerous
!

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
rather
good
at
falling
,
I
flatter
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
Lord
Chiltern
rides
anything
he
can
sit
,
so
long
as
it
is
some
animal
that
nobody
else
will
ride
.
<EOS>
It
was
always
so
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
odd
;
is
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
knew
,
of
course
,
that
Lord
Chiltern
had
more
than
once
asked
Violet
Effingham
to
be
his
wife
,
 
<EOS>
and
he
believed
that
she
,
from
her
intimacy
with
Lady
Laura
,
must
know
that
he
knew
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
also
heard
Lady
Laura
express
a
very
strong
wish
that
,
in
spite
of
these
refusals
,
Violet
might
even
yet
become
her
brother
's
wife
.
<EOS>
And
Phineas
also
knew
that
Violet
Effingham
was
becoming
,
in
his
own
estimation
,
the
most
charming
woman
of
his
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
talk
to
her
about
Lord
Chiltern
?
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
odd
,
"
said
Phineas
;
"
but
he
is
an
excellent
fellow
,
 
whom
his
father
altogether
misunderstands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
 
just
so
;
I
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
,
 
you
who
have
never
had
the
misfortune
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
bad
set
.
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
tell
Lord
Brentford
?
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
would
listen
to
you
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
of
course
he
would
,
 
for
you
are
just
the
link
that
is
wanting
.
<EOS>
You
are
Chiltern
's
intimate
friend
,
and
you
are
also
the
friend
of
big
-
wigs
and
Cabinet
Ministers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Brentford
would
put
me
down
at
once
if
I
spoke
to
him
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
would
not
.
<EOS>
You
are
too
big
to
be
put
down
,
and
no
man
can
really
dislike
to
hear
his
son
well
spoken
of
by
those
who
are
well
spoken
of
themselves
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
try
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
said
that
he
would
think
of
it
,
 
that
he
would
try
if
any
fit
opportunity
could
be
found
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
know
how
intimate
I
have
been
with
the
Standishes
,
"
said
Violet
;
"
that
Laura
is
to
me
a
sister
,
and
that
Oswald
used
to
be
almost
a
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
not
you
speak
to
Lord
Brentford
;
 
you
who
are
his
favourite
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
reasons
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
how
can
any
girl
come
forward
and
say
that
she
knows
the
disposition
of
any
man
?
<EOS>
You
can
live
with
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
see
what
he
is
made
of
,
and
know
his
thoughts
,
and
learn
what
is
good
in
him
,
and
also
what
is
bad
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
how
is
any
girl
really
to
know
anything
of
a
man
's
life
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
do
anything
,
Miss
Effingham
,
I
will
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
we
shall
all
of
us
be
so
grateful
to
you
,
"
said
Violet
,
with
her
sweetest
smile
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
retreating
from
this
conversation
,
stood
for
a
while
alone
,
thinking
of
it
.
<EOS>
Had
she
spoken
thus
of
Lord
Chiltern
because
she
did
love
him
or
because
she
did
not
?
<EOS>
And
the
sweet
commendations
which
had
fallen
from
her
lips
upon
him
,
 
him
,
Phineas
Finn
,
 
were
they
compatible
with
anything
like
a
growing
partiality
for
himself
,
or
were
they
incompatible
with
any
such
feeling
?
<EOS>
Had
he
most
reason
to
be
comforted
or
to
be
discomfited
by
what
had
taken
place
?
<EOS>
It
seemed
hardly
possible
to
his
imagination
that
Violet
Effingham
should
love
such
a
nobody
as
he
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
had
had
fair
evidence
that
one
standing
as
high
in
the
world
as
Violet
Effingham
would
fain
have
loved
him
<EOS>
could
she
have
followed
the
dictates
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
He
had
trembled
when
he
had
first
resolved
to
declare
his
passion
to
Lady
Laura
,
 
fearing
that
she
would
scorn
him
as
being
presumptuous
.
<EOS>
But
there
had
been
no
cause
for
such
fear
as
that
.
<EOS>
He
had
declared
his
love
,
and
she
had
not
thought
him
to
be
presumptuous
.
<EOS>
That
now
was
ages
ago
,
 
eight
months
since
;
and
Lady
Laura
had
become
a
married
woman
.
<EOS>
Since
he
had
become
so
warmly
alive
to
the
charms
of
Violet
Effingham
he
had
determined
,
with
stern
propriety
,
that
a
passion
for
a
married
woman
was
disgraceful
.
<EOS>
Such
love
was
in
itself
a
sin
,
even
though
it
was
accompanied
by
the
severest
forbearance
and
the
most
rigid
propriety
of
conduct
.
<EOS>
No
;
 
Lady
Laura
had
done
wisely
to
check
the
growing
feeling
of
partiality
which
she
had
admitted
;
and
now
that
she
was
married
,
he
would
be
as
wise
as
she
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
to
him
that
,
as
regarded
his
own
heart
,
the
way
was
open
to
him
for
a
new
enterprise
.
<EOS>
But
what
if
he
were
to
fail
again
,
and
be
told
by
Violet
,
when
he
declared
his
love
,
that
she
had
just
engaged
herself
to
Lord
Chiltern
!
  
<EOS>
"
What
were
you
and
Violet
talking
about
so
eagerly
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
to
him
,
with
a
smile
that
,
in
its
approach
to
laughter
,
almost
betrayed
its
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
were
talking
about
your
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
him
,
are
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
leave
London
on
Sunday
night
;
 
but
only
for
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
any
chance
there
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
with
Miss
Effingham
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
with
Violet
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
think
she
loves
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
say
?
<EOS>
In
such
a
matter
you
can
judge
better
than
I
can
do
.
<EOS>
One
woman
with
reference
to
another
can
draw
the
line
between
love
and
friendship
.
<EOS>
She
certainly
likes
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
believe
she
loves
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
she
fears
him
.
<EOS>
She
does
not
quite
understand
how
much
there
is
of
tenderness
with
that
assumed
ferocity
.
<EOS>
And
Oswald
is
so
strange
,
so
unwise
,
so
impolitic
,
that
though
he
loves
her
better
than
all
the
world
beside
,
he
will
not
sacrifice
even
a
turn
of
a
word
to
win
her
.
<EOS>
When
he
asks
her
to
marry
him
,
he
almost
flies
at
her
throat
,
as
an
angry
debtor
who
applies
for
instant
payment
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
,
Mr.
Finn
,
never
to
give
it
over
;
 
and
teach
him
that
he
should
be
soft
with
her
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
,
also
,
that
in
her
heart
she
likes
him
.
<EOS>
One
woman
,
as
you
say
,
knows
another
woman
;
and
I
am
certain
he
would
win
her
if
he
would
only
be
gentle
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
again
,
before
they
parted
,
Lady
Laura
told
him
that
this
marriage
was
the
dearest
wish
of
her
heart
,
and
that
there
would
be
no
end
to
her
gratitude
if
Phineas
could
do
anything
to
promote
it
.
<EOS>
All
which
again
made
our
hero
unhappy
.
   
<EOS>
Sunday
in
Grosvenor
Place
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
though
he
was
a
most
scrupulously
attentive
member
of
Parliament
,
was
a
man
very
punctual
to
hours
and
rules
in
his
own
house
,
 
and
liked
that
his
wife
should
be
as
punctual
as
himself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
who
in
marrying
him
had
firmly
resolved
that
she
would
do
her
duty
to
him
in
all
ways
,
even
though
the
ways
might
sometimes
be
painful
,
 
and
had
been
perhaps
more
punctilious
in
this
respect
than
she
might
have
been
had
she
loved
him
heartily
,
 
was
not
perhaps
quite
so
fond
of
accurate
regularity
as
her
husband
;
and
thus
,
by
this
time
,
certain
habits
of
his
had
become
rather
bonds
than
habits
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
always
had
prayers
at
nine
,
and
breakfasted
at
a
quarter
past
nine
,
let
the
hours
on
the
night
before
have
been
as
late
as
they
might
before
the
time
for
rest
had
come
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
he
would
open
his
letters
in
his
study
,
but
he
liked
her
to
be
with
him
,
and
desired
to
discuss
with
her
every
application
he
got
from
a
constituent
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
private
secretary
in
a
room
apart
,
but
he
thought
that
everything
should
be
filtered
to
his
private
secretary
through
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
anxious
that
she
herself
should
superintend
the
accounts
of
their
own
private
expenditure
,
and
had
taken
some
trouble
to
teach
her
an
excellent
mode
of
book
-
keeping
.
<EOS>
He
had
recommended
to
her
a
certain
course
of
reading
,
 
which
was
pleasant
enough
;
ladies
like
to
receive
such
recommendations
;
but
Mr.
Kennedy
,
having
drawn
out
the
course
,
seemed
to
expect
that
his
wife
should
read
the
books
he
had
named
,
and
,
worse
still
,
that
she
should
read
them
in
the
time
he
had
allocated
for
the
work
.
<EOS>
This
,
I
think
,
was
tyranny
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Sundays
became
very
wearisome
to
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Going
to
church
twice
,
she
had
learnt
,
would
be
a
part
of
her
duty
;
and
though
in
her
father
's
household
attendance
at
church
had
never
been
very
strict
,
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
this
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Kennedy
expected
also
that
he
and
she
should
always
dine
together
on
Sundays
,
that
there
should
be
no
guests
,
and
that
there
should
be
no
evening
company
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
the
demand
was
not
very
severe
,
but
yet
she
found
that
it
operated
injuriously
upon
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
The
Sundays
were
very
wearisome
to
her
,
and
made
her
feel
that
her
lord
and
master
was
 
her
lord
and
master
.
<EOS>
She
made
an
effort
or
two
to
escape
,
but
the
efforts
were
all
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
never
spoke
a
cross
word
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
never
gave
a
stern
command
.
<EOS>
But
yet
he
had
his
way
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
say
that
reading
a
novel
on
a
Sunday
is
a
sin
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
we
must
at
any
rate
admit
that
it
is
a
matter
on
which
men
disagree
,
that
many
of
the
best
of
men
are
against
such
occupation
on
Sunday
,
and
that
to
abstain
is
to
be
on
the
safe
side
.
"
<EOS>
So
the
novels
were
put
away
,
and
Sunday
afternoon
with
the
long
evening
became
rather
a
stumbling
-
block
to
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
Those
two
hours
,
moreover
,
with
her
husband
in
the
morning
became
very
wearisome
to
her
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
had
declared
that
it
would
be
her
greatest
ambition
to
help
her
husband
in
his
work
,
and
she
had
read
all
the
letters
from
the
MacNabs
and
MacFies
,
asking
to
be
made
gaugers
and
landing
-
waiters
,
with
an
assumed
interest
.
<EOS>
But
the
work
palled
upon
her
very
quickly
.
<EOS>
Her
quick
intellect
discovered
soon
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
which
she
really
did
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
form
and
verbiage
,
and
pretence
at
business
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
went
through
it
all
with
the
utmost
patience
,
reading
every
word
,
giving
orders
as
to
every
detail
,
and
conscientiously
doing
that
which
he
conceived
he
had
undertaken
to
do
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Laura
wanted
to
meddle
with
high
politics
,
to
discuss
reform
bills
,
to
assist
in
putting
up
Mr.
This
and
putting
down
my
Lord
That
.
<EOS>
Why
should
she
waste
her
time
in
doing
that
which
the
lad
in
the
next
room
,
who
was
called
a
private
secretary
,
could
do
as
well
?
  
<EOS>
Still
she
would
obey
.
<EOS>
Let
the
task
be
as
hard
as
it
might
,
she
would
obey
.
<EOS>
If
he
counselled
her
to
do
this
or
that
,
she
would
follow
his
counsel
,
 
because
she
owed
him
so
much
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
accepted
the
half
of
all
his
wealth
without
loving
him
,
she
owed
him
the
more
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
But
she
knew
,
 
<EOS>
she
could
not
<EOS>
but
know
,
 
that
her
intellect
was
brighter
than
his
;
and
might
it
not
be
possible
for
her
to
lead
him
?
<EOS>
Then
she
made
efforts
to
lead
her
husband
,
and
found
that
he
was
as
stiff
-
necked
as
an
ox
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
was
not
,
perhaps
,
a
clever
man
;
but
he
was
a
man
who
knew
his
own
way
,
and
who
intended
to
keep
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
a
headache
,
Robert
,
"
she
said
to
him
one
Sunday
after
luncheon
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
will
not
go
to
church
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
serious
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
how
one
feels
sometimes
that
one
has
got
a
head
?
<EOS>
And
when
that
is
the
case
one
's
armchair
is
the
best
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
sure
of
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
went
to
church
<EOS>
I
should
not
attend
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fresh
air
would
do
you
more
good
than
anything
else
,
and
we
could
walk
across
the
park
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
;
 
I
wo
n't
go
out
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
This
she
said
with
something
almost
of
crossness
in
her
manner
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
went
to
the
afternoon
service
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
when
she
was
left
alone
began
to
think
of
her
position
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
more
than
four
or
five
months
married
,
and
she
was
becoming
very
tired
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
also
true
that
she
was
becoming
tired
of
her
husband
?
<EOS>
She
had
twice
told
Phineas
Finn
that
of
all
men
in
the
world
she
esteemed
Mr.
Kennedy
the
most
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
esteem
him
less
now
.
<EOS>
She
knew
no
point
or
particle
in
which
he
did
not
do
his
duty
with
accuracy
.
<EOS>
But
no
person
can
live
happily
with
another
,
 
not
even
with
a
brother
or
a
sister
or
a
friend
,
 
simply
upon
esteem
.
<EOS>
All
the
virtues
in
the
calendar
,
though
they
exist
on
each
side
,
will
not
make
a
man
and
woman
happy
together
,
unless
there
be
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
was
beginning
to
find
out
that
there
was
a
lack
of
sympathy
between
herself
and
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
She
thought
of
this
till
she
was
tired
of
thinking
of
it
,
and
then
,
wishing
to
divert
her
mind
,
she
took
up
the
book
that
was
lying
nearest
to
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
volume
of
a
new
novel
which
she
had
been
reading
on
the
previous
day
,
and
now
,
without
much
thought
about
it
,
she
went
on
with
her
reading
.
<EOS>
There
came
to
her
,
no
doubt
,
some
dim
,
half
-
formed
idea
that
,
as
she
was
freed
from
going
to
church
by
the
plea
of
a
headache
,
she
was
also
absolved
by
the
same
plea
from
other
Sunday
hindrances
.
<EOS>
A
child
,
when
it
is
ill
,
has
buttered
toast
and
a
picture
-
book
instead
of
bread
-
and
-
milk
and
lessons
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
Lady
Laura
conceived
herself
to
be
entitled
to
her
novel
.
  
<EOS>
While
she
was
reading
it
,
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
Barrington
Erle
was
shown
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
had
given
no
orders
against
Sunday
visitors
,
but
had
simply
said
that
Sunday
visiting
was
not
to
his
taste
.
<EOS>
Barrington
,
however
,
was
Lady
Laura
's
cousin
,
and
people
must
be
very
strict
if
they
ca
n't
see
their
cousins
on
Sunday
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
soon
lost
her
headache
altogether
in
the
animation
of
discussing
the
chances
of
the
new
Reform
Bill
with
the
Prime
Minister
's
private
secretary
;
and
had
left
her
chair
,
and
was
standing
by
the
table
with
the
novel
in
her
hand
,
protesting
this
and
denying
that
,
expressing
infinite
confidence
in
Mr.
Monk
,
and
violently
denouncing
Mr.
Turnbull
,
when
her
husband
returned
from
church
and
came
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
forgotten
her
headache
altogether
,
and
had
in
her
composition
none
of
that
thoughtfulness
of
hypocrisy
which
would
have
taught
her
to
moderate
her
political
feeling
at
her
husband
's
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
declare
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
if
Mr.
Turnbull
opposes
the
Government
measure
now
,
because
he
ca
n't
have
his
own
way
in
everything
,
I
will
never
again
put
my
trust
in
any
man
who
calls
himself
a
popular
leader
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
should
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
for
you
,
Barrington
,
who
are
an
aristocratic
Whig
of
the
old
official
school
,
and
who
call
yourself
a
Liberal
simply
because
Fox
was
a
Liberal
a
hundred
years
ago
.
<EOS>
My
heart
's
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heart
should
never
have
anything
to
do
with
politics
;
should
it
?
"
said
Erle
,
turning
round
to
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
did
not
wish
to
discuss
the
matter
on
a
Sunday
,
nor
yet
did
he
wish
to
say
before
Barrington
Erle
that
he
thought
it
wrong
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
desirous
of
treating
his
wife
in
some
way
as
though
she
were
an
invalid
,
 
that
she
thereby
might
be
,
as
it
were
,
punished
;
but
he
did
not
wish
to
do
this
in
such
a
way
that
Barrington
should
be
aware
of
the
punishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
had
better
not
disturb
herself
about
it
now
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
a
person
to
help
being
disturbed
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
;
we
wo
n't
mind
all
that
now
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
turning
away
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
up
the
novel
which
Lady
Laura
had
just
laid
down
from
her
hand
,
and
,
having
looked
at
it
,
carried
it
aside
,
and
placed
it
on
a
book
-
shelf
which
was
remote
from
them
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
watched
him
as
he
did
this
,
and
the
whole
course
of
her
husband
's
thoughts
on
the
subject
was
open
to
her
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
regretted
the
novel
,
and
she
regretted
also
the
political
discussion
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
Barrington
Erle
went
away
,
and
the
husband
and
wife
were
alone
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
that
your
head
is
so
much
better
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
intend
to
be
severe
,
but
he
spoke
with
a
gravity
of
manner
which
almost
amounted
to
severity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
it
is
,
"
she
said
,
"
Barrington
's
coming
in
cheered
me
up
.
"
  
"
I
am
sorry
that
you
should
have
wanted
cheering
.
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
know
what
I
mean
,
Robert
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
;
I
do
not
think
that
I
do
,
exactly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
your
head
is
stronger
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
get
that
feeling
of
dazed
,
helpless
imbecility
of
brain
,
which
hardly
amounts
to
headache
,
but
which
yet
 
is
almost
as
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Imbecility
of
brain
may
be
worse
than
headache
,
but
I
do
n't
think
it
can
produce
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
;
 
I
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Headache
comes
,
I
think
,
always
from
the
stomach
,
even
when
produced
by
nervous
affections
.
<EOS>
But
imbecility
of
the
brain
 
"
  
"
Oh
,
Robert
,
I
am
so
sorry
that
I
used
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
that
it
did
not
prevent
your
reading
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
such
reading
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
was
up
to
nothing
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
another
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
deny
that
it
may
be
a
prejudice
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
confess
that
the
use
of
novels
in
my
own
house
on
Sundays
is
a
pain
to
me
.
<EOS>
My
mother
's
ideas
on
the
subject
are
very
strict
,
and
I
can
not
think
that
it
is
bad
for
a
son
to
hang
on
to
the
teaching
of
his
mother
.
<EOS>
"
This
he
said
in
the
most
serious
tone
which
he
could
command
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
I
took
it
up
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Simply
,
I
believe
,
because
it
was
there
.
<EOS>
I
will
avoid
doing
so
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
husband
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
obliged
and
grateful
if
you
will
remember
what
I
have
said
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
left
her
,
and
she
sat
alone
,
first
in
the
dusk
and
then
in
the
dark
,
for
two
hours
,
doing
nothing
.
<EOS>
Was
this
to
be
the
life
which
she
had
procured
for
herself
by
marrying
Mr.
Kennedy
of
Loughlinter
?
<EOS>
If
it
was
harsh
and
unendurable
in
London
,
what
would
it
be
in
the
country
?
   
<EOS>
The
Willingford
Bull
 
Phineas
left
London
by
a
night
mail
train
on
Easter
Sunday
,
and
found
himself
at
the
Willingford
Bull
about
half
an
hour
after
midnight
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
was
up
and
waiting
for
him
,
and
supper
was
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
Willingford
Bull
was
an
English
inn
of
the
old
stamp
,
which
had
now
,
in
these
latter
years
of
railway
travelling
,
ceased
to
have
a
road
business
,
 
for
there
were
no
travellers
on
the
road
,
and
but
little
posting
 
but
had
acquired
a
new
trade
as
a
dépôt
for
hunters
and
hunting
men
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
let
out
horses
and
kept
hunting
stables
,
and
the
house
was
generally
filled
from
the
beginning
of
November
till
the
middle
of
April
.
<EOS>
Then
it
became
a
desert
in
the
summer
,
and
no
guests
were
seen
there
,
till
the
pink
coats
flocked
down
again
into
the
shires
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
many
days
do
you
mean
to
give
us
?
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
he
helped
his
friend
to
a
devilled
leg
of
turkey
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
back
on
Wednesday
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
means
Wednesday
night
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
we
'll
do
.
<EOS>
We
've
the
Cottesmore
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
We
'll
get
into
Tailby
's
country
on
Tuesday
,
and
Fitzwilliam
will
be
only
twelve
miles
off
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
rather
short
of
horses
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
let
me
put
you
out
.
<EOS>
I
can
hire
something
here
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
wo
n't
put
me
out
at
all
.
<EOS>
There
'll
be
three
between
us
each
day
,
and
we
'll
run
our
luck
.
<EOS>
The
horses
have
gone
on
to
Empingham
for
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Tailby
is
rather
a
way
off
,
 
at
Somerby
;
but
we
'll
manage
it
.
<EOS>
If
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
,
we
can
get
back
to
Stamford
by
rail
.
<EOS>
On
Wednesday
we
shall
have
everything
very
comfortable
.
<EOS>
They
're
out
beyond
Stilton
and
will
draw
home
our
way
.
<EOS>
I
've
planned
it
all
out
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
trap
with
a
fast
stepper
,
and
if
we
start
to
-
morrow
at
half
-
past
nine
,
we
shall
be
in
plenty
of
time
.
<EOS>
You
shall
ride
Meg
Merrilies
,
and
if
she
do
n't
carry
you
,
you
may
shoot
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
one
of
the
pulling
ones
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
heavy
in
hand
if
you
are
heavy
at
her
,
but
leave
her
mouth
alone
and
she
'll
go
like
flowing
water
.
<EOS>
You
'd
better
not
ride
more
in
a
crowd
than
you
can
help
.
<EOS>
Now
what
'll
you
drink
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
sat
up
half
the
night
smoking
and
talking
,
and
Phineas
learned
more
about
Lord
Chiltern
then
than
ever
he
had
learned
before
.
<EOS>
There
was
brandy
and
water
before
them
,
but
neither
of
them
drank
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
indeed
,
had
a
pint
of
beer
by
his
side
from
which
he
sipped
occasionally
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
taken
to
beer
,
"
he
said
,
"
as
being
the
best
drink
going
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
hunts
six
days
a
week
he
can
afford
to
drink
beer
.
<EOS>
I
'm
on
an
allowance
,
 
three
pints
a
day
.
<EOS>
That
's
not
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
drink
nothing
else
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
when
I
'm
alone
,
 
except
a
little
cherry
-
brandy
when
I
'm
out
.
<EOS>
I
never
cared
for
drink
;
 
never
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
like
excitement
,
and
have
been
less
careful
than
I
ought
to
have
been
as
to
what
it
has
come
from
.
<EOS>
I
could
give
up
drink
to
-
morrow
,
without
a
struggle
,
 
if
it
were
worth
my
while
to
make
up
my
mind
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
the
same
with
gambling
.
<EOS>
I
never
do
gamble
now
,
because
I
've
got
no
money
;
but
I
own
I
like
it
better
than
anything
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
While
you
are
at
it
,
there
is
life
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
take
to
politics
,
Chiltern
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
would
have
done
so
,
but
my
father
would
not
help
me
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
we
will
not
talk
about
him
.
<EOS>
How
does
Laura
get
on
with
her
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
happily
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
temper
is
too
much
like
mine
to
allow
her
to
be
happy
with
such
a
log
of
wood
as
Robert
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
It
is
such
men
as
he
who
drive
me
out
of
the
pale
of
decent
life
.
<EOS>
If
that
is
decency
,
I
'd
sooner
be
indecent
.
<EOS>
You
mark
my
words
.
<EOS>
They
'll
come
to
grief
.
<EOS>
She
'll
never
be
able
to
stand
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
she
had
her
own
way
in
everything
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
Though
he
's
a
prig
,
he
's
a
man
;
and
she
will
not
find
it
easy
to
drive
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
may
bend
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
an
inch
;
 
that
is
if
I
understand
his
character
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
see
a
good
deal
of
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
pretty
well
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
there
so
often
as
I
used
to
be
in
the
Square
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
get
sick
of
it
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
should
.
<EOS>
Do
you
see
my
father
often
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Only
occasionally
.
<EOS>
He
is
always
very
civil
when
I
do
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
very
pink
of
civility
when
he
pleases
,
but
the
most
unjust
man
I
ever
met
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
thought
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
is
,
"
said
the
Earl
's
son
,
"
and
all
from
lack
of
judgment
to
discern
the
truth
.
<EOS>
He
makes
up
his
mind
to
a
thing
on
insufficient
proof
,
and
then
nothing
will
turn
him
.
<EOS>
He
thinks
well
of
you
,
 
would
probably
believe
your
word
on
any
indifferent
subject
without
thought
of
a
doubt
;
but
if
you
were
to
tell
him
that
I
did
n't
get
drunk
every
night
of
my
life
and
spend
most
of
my
time
in
thrashing
policemen
,
he
would
not
believe
you
.
<EOS>
He
would
smile
incredulously
and
make
you
a
little
bow
.
<EOS>
I
can
see
him
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
hard
on
him
,
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
too
hard
on
me
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
Is
Violet
Effingham
still
in
Grosvenor
Place
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
she
's
with
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
old
grandmother
of
evil
has
come
to
town
,
 
has
she
?
<EOS>
Poor
Violet
!
<EOS>
When
we
were
young
together
we
used
to
have
such
fun
about
that
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
old
woman
is
an
ally
of
mine
now
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
make
allies
everywhere
.
<EOS>
You
know
Violet
Effingham
of
course
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
.
<EOS>
I
know
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
her
very
charming
?
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exceedingly
charming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
asked
that
girl
to
marry
me
three
times
,
and
I
shall
never
ask
her
again
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
point
beyond
which
a
man
should
n't
go
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
reasons
why
it
would
be
a
good
marriage
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
her
money
would
be
serviceable
.
<EOS>
Then
it
would
heal
matters
in
our
family
,
for
my
father
is
as
prejudiced
in
her
favour
as
he
is
against
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
love
her
dearly
.
<EOS>
I
've
loved
her
all
my
life
,
 
since
I
used
to
buy
cakes
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
never
ask
her
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
if
I
were
you
,
"
said
Phineas
,
 
hardly
knowing
what
it
might
be
best
for
him
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
never
will
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
.
<EOS>
I
shall
get
into
some
desperate
scrape
about
her
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
'll
marry
,
and
that
soon
.
<EOS>
Then
I
shall
make
a
fool
of
myself
.
<EOS>
When
I
hear
that
she
is
engaged
I
shall
go
and
quarrel
with
the
man
,
and
kick
him
,
 
or
get
kicked
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
will
turn
against
me
,
and
I
shall
be
called
a
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
dog
in
the
manger
is
what
you
should
be
called
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
;
 
but
how
is
a
man
to
help
it
?
<EOS>
If
you
loved
a
girl
,
could
you
see
another
man
take
her
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
remembered
of
course
that
he
had
lately
come
through
this
ordeal
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
though
he
were
to
come
and
put
his
hand
upon
me
,
and
wanted
my
own
heart
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
Though
I
have
no
property
in
her
at
all
,
no
right
to
her
,
 
though
she
never
gave
me
a
word
of
encouragement
,
it
is
as
though
she
were
the
most
private
thing
in
the
world
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
half
mad
,
and
in
my
madness
I
could
not
master
the
idea
that
I
was
being
robbed
.
<EOS>
I
should
resent
it
as
a
personal
interference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
will
come
to
that
if
you
give
her
up
yourself
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
question
of
giving
up
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
can
not
make
her
marry
me
.
<EOS>
Light
another
cigar
,
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
lit
the
other
cigar
,
remembered
that
he
owed
a
certain
duty
in
this
matter
to
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
She
had
commissioned
him
to
persuade
her
brother
that
his
suit
with
Violet
Effingham
would
not
be
hopeless
,
if
he
could
only
restrain
himself
in
his
mode
of
conducting
it
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
disposed
to
do
his
duty
,
although
he
felt
it
to
be
very
hard
that
he
should
be
called
upon
to
be
eloquent
against
his
own
interest
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
thinking
for
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
how
he
must
bear
himself
if
it
might
turn
out
that
he
should
be
the
man
whom
Lord
Chiltern
was
resolved
to
kick
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
his
friend
and
host
,
and
became
aware
that
a
kicking
-
match
with
such
a
one
would
not
be
pleasant
pastime
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
would
be
happy
enough
to
be
subject
to
Lord
Chiltern
's
wrath
for
such
a
reason
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
his
duty
by
Lord
Chiltern
;
and
then
,
when
that
had
been
adequately
done
,
he
would
,
if
occasion
served
,
fight
a
battle
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
sudden
with
her
,
Chiltern
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
pause
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
too
sudden
?
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
almost
angrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
frighten
her
by
being
so
impetuous
.
<EOS>
You
rush
at
her
as
though
you
wanted
to
conquer
her
by
a
single
blow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
be
more
gentle
with
her
.
<EOS>
You
should
give
her
time
to
find
out
whether
she
likes
you
or
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
known
me
all
her
life
,
and
has
found
that
out
long
ago
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
you
,
and
had
your
skill
in
pleasing
,
I
should
drop
soft
words
into
her
ear
till
I
had
caught
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
gifts
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
awkward
as
a
pig
at
what
is
called
flirting
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
an
accursed
pride
which
stands
in
my
own
light
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
in
this
house
this
moment
,
and
if
I
knew
she
were
to
be
had
for
asking
,
I
do
n't
think
I
could
bring
myself
to
ask
again
.
<EOS>
But
we
'll
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
It
's
half
-
past
two
,
and
we
must
be
off
at
half
-
past
nine
,
if
we
're
to
be
at
Exton
Park
gates
at
eleven
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
went
up
-
stairs
,
assured
himself
that
he
had
done
his
duty
.
<EOS>
If
there
ever
should
come
to
be
anything
between
him
and
Violet
Effingham
,
Lord
Chiltern
might
quarrel
with
him
,
 
might
probably
attempt
that
kicking
encounter
to
which
allusion
had
been
made
,
 
but
nobody
could
justly
say
that
he
had
not
behaved
honourably
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
there
was
a
bustle
and
a
scurry
,
as
there
always
is
on
such
occasions
,
and
the
two
men
got
off
about
ten
minutes
after
time
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Chiltern
drove
hard
,
and
they
reached
the
meet
before
the
master
had
moved
off
.
<EOS>
They
had
a
fair
day
's
sport
with
the
Cottesmore
;
and
Phineas
,
though
he
found
that
Meg
Merrilies
did
require
a
good
deal
of
riding
,
went
through
his
day
's
work
with
credit
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
riding
since
he
was
a
child
,
as
is
the
custom
with
all
boys
in
Munster
,
and
had
an
Irishman
's
natural
aptitude
for
jumping
.
<EOS>
When
they
got
back
to
the
Willingford
Bull
he
felt
pleased
with
the
day
and
rather
proud
of
himself
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
fast
,
you
know
,
"
said
Chiltern
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
do
n't
call
that
a
stiff
country
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Meg
is
very
handy
when
you
've
got
her
out
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
You
shall
ride
Bonebreaker
to
-
morrow
at
Somerby
,
and
you
'll
find
that
better
fun
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bonebreaker
?
<EOS>
Have
n't
I
heard
you
say
he
rushes
like
mischief
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
he
does
rush
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
you
want
a
horse
to
rush
in
that
country
.
<EOS>
When
you
have
to
go
right
through
four
or
five
feet
of
stiff
green
wood
,
like
a
bullet
through
a
target
,
you
want
a
little
force
,
or
you
're
apt
to
be
left
up
a
tree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
ride
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
brute
I
never
put
my
leg
on
yet
.
<EOS>
He
was
sent
down
to
Wilcox
here
,
out
of
Lincolnshire
,
because
they
could
n't
get
anybody
to
ride
him
there
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
goes
with
his
head
up
in
the
air
,
and
wo
n't
look
at
a
fence
that
is
n't
as
high
as
his
breast
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
he
'll
do
here
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
a
better
made
beast
,
or
one
with
more
power
.
<EOS>
Do
you
look
at
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
He
's
to
be
had
for
seventy
pounds
,
and
these
are
the
sort
of
horses
I
like
to
buy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
they
dined
alone
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
explained
to
Phineas
that
he
rarely
associated
with
the
men
of
either
of
the
hunts
in
which
he
rode
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
set
of
fellows
down
here
who
are
poison
to
me
,
and
there
is
another
set
,
and
I
am
poison
to
them
.
<EOS>
Everybody
is
very
civil
,
as
you
see
,
but
I
have
no
associates
.
<EOS>
And
gradually
I
am
getting
to
have
a
reputation
as
though
I
were
the
devil
himself
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
come
out
next
year
dressed
entirely
in
black
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
not
wrong
to
give
way
to
that
kind
of
thing
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
deuce
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
make
civil
little
speeches
.
<EOS>
When
once
a
man
gets
a
reputation
as
an
ogre
,
it
is
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
drop
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
a
score
of
men
here
every
day
if
I
liked
it
,
 
my
title
would
do
that
for
me
;
 
but
they
would
be
men
I
should
loathe
,
and
I
should
be
sure
to
tell
them
so
,
even
though
I
did
not
mean
it
.
<EOS>
Bonebreaker
,
and
the
new
horse
,
and
another
,
went
on
at
twelve
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
must
expect
hard
work
to
-
morrow
,
as
I
daresay
we
sha
n't
be
home
before
eight
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
's
meet
was
in
Leicestershire
,
not
far
from
Melton
,
and
they
started
early
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
to
tell
the
truth
of
him
,
was
rather
afraid
of
Bonebreaker
,
and
looked
forward
to
the
probability
of
an
accident
.
<EOS>
He
had
neither
wife
nor
child
,
and
nobody
had
a
better
right
to
risk
his
neck
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
put
a
gag
on
"
i
m
,
"
said
the
groom
,
"
and
you
'll
ride
"
i
m
in
a
ring
,
 
so
that
you
may
well
-
nigh
break
his
jaw
;
but
he
is
a
rum
un
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
'll
do
my
best
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
'll
take
all
that
,
"
said
the
groom
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
let
him
have
his
own
way
at
everything
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
they
moved
away
from
the
meet
to
Pickwell
Gorse
;
"
and
if
you
'll
only
sit
on
his
back
,
he
'll
carry
you
through
as
safe
as
a
church
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
counsels
of
the
master
and
of
the
groom
were
very
different
.
<EOS>
"
My
idea
is
,
"
continued
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
that
in
hunting
you
should
always
avoid
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
a
horse
is
worth
riding
that
will
go
in
a
crowd
.
<EOS>
It
's
just
like
yachting
,
 
you
should
have
plenty
of
sea
-
room
.
<EOS>
If
you
're
to
pull
your
horse
up
at
every
fence
till
somebody
else
is
over
,
I
think
you
'd
better
come
out
on
a
donkey
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
they
went
away
to
Pickwell
Gorse
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
over
two
hundred
men
out
,
and
Phineas
began
to
think
that
it
might
not
be
so
easy
to
get
out
of
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
A
crowd
in
a
fast
run
no
doubt
quickly
becomes
small
by
degrees
and
beautifully
less
;
but
it
is
very
difficult
,
especially
for
a
stranger
,
to
free
himself
from
the
rush
at
the
first
start
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
's
horse
plunged
about
so
violently
,
as
they
stood
on
a
little
hill
-
side
looking
down
upon
the
cover
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
take
him
to
a
distance
,
and
Phineas
followed
him
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
breaks
down
wind
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
we
ca
n't
be
better
than
we
are
here
.
<EOS>
If
he
goes
up
wind
,
he
must
turn
before
long
,
and
we
shall
be
all
right
.
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
an
old
hound
opened
true
and
sharp
,
 
an
old
hound
whom
all
the
pack
believed
,
 
and
in
a
moment
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
fox
had
been
found
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
not
above
eight
or
nine
acres
in
it
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
and
he
ca
n't
hang
long
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
such
an
uneasy
brute
as
this
in
your
life
?
<EOS>
But
I
feel
certain
he
'll
go
well
when
he
gets
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
too
much
occupied
with
his
own
horse
to
think
much
of
that
on
which
Lord
Chiltern
was
mounted
.
<EOS>
Bonebreaker
,
the
very
moment
that
he
heard
the
old
hound
's
note
,
stretched
out
his
head
,
and
put
his
mouth
upon
the
bit
,
and
began
to
tremble
in
every
muscle
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
great
deal
more
anxious
for
it
than
you
<EOS>
and
I
are
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
they
've
given
you
that
gag
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
ride
him
on
it
till
he
wants
it
.
<EOS>
Give
him
lots
of
room
,
and
he
'll
go
in
the
snaffle
.
<EOS>
"
All
which
caution
made
Phineas
think
that
any
insurance
office
would
charge
very
dear
on
his
life
at
the
present
moment
.
  
<EOS>
The
fox
took
two
rings
of
the
gorse
,
and
then
he
went
,
 
up
wind
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
a
vixen
,
I
'll
swear
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
vixen
in
cub
never
went
away
like
that
yet
.
<EOS>
Now
then
,
Finn
,
my
boy
,
keep
to
the
right
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lord
Chiltern
,
with
the
horse
out
of
Lincolnshire
,
went
away
across
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
leaving
the
hounds
to
the
left
,
and
selected
,
as
his
point
of
exit
into
the
next
field
,
a
stiff
rail
,
which
,
had
there
been
an
accident
,
must
have
put
a
very
wide
margin
of
ground
between
the
rider
and
his
horse
.
<EOS>
"
Go
hard
at
your
fences
,
and
then
you
'll
fall
clear
,
"
he
had
said
to
Phineas
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
,
however
,
that
he
would
have
ridden
at
the
rail
as
he
did
,
but
that
there
was
no
help
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
brute
began
in
his
own
way
,
and
carried
on
after
in
the
same
fashion
all
through
,
"
he
said
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Phineas
took
the
fence
a
little
lower
down
,
and
what
it
was
at
which
he
rode
he
never
knew
.
<EOS>
Bonebreaker
sailed
over
it
,
whatever
it
was
,
and
he
soon
found
himself
by
his
friend
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
The
ruck
of
the
men
were
lower
down
than
our
two
heroes
,
and
there
were
others
far
away
to
the
left
,
and
others
,
again
,
who
had
been
at
the
end
of
the
gorse
,
and
were
now
behind
.
<EOS>
Our
friends
were
not
near
the
hounds
,
not
within
two
fields
of
them
,
but
the
hounds
were
below
them
,
and
therefore
could
be
seen
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
,
and
they
'll
be
round
upon
us
,
"
Lord
Chiltern
said
.
<EOS>
"
How
the
deuce
is
one
to
help
being
in
a
hurry
?
"
said
Phineas
,
who
was
doing
his
very
best
to
ride
Bonebreaker
with
the
snaffle
,
but
had
already
began
to
feel
that
Bonebreaker
cared
nothing
for
that
weak
instrument
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
George
,
I
should
like
to
change
with
you
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
The
Lincolnshire
horse
was
going
along
with
his
head
very
low
,
boring
as
he
galloped
,
but
throwing
his
neck
up
at
his
fences
,
just
when
he
ought
to
have
kept
himself
steady
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
though
Phineas
kept
near
Lord
Chiltern
throughout
the
run
,
they
were
not
again
near
enough
to
exchange
words
;
and
,
indeed
,
they
had
but
<EOS>
little
breath
for
such
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
rode
still
a
little
in
advance
,
and
Phineas
,
knowing
his
friend
's
partiality
for
solitude
when
taking
his
fences
,
kept
a
little
to
his
left
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
find
that
Bonebreaker
knew
pretty
well
what
he
was
about
.
<EOS>
As
for
not
using
the
gag
rein
,
that
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
When
a
horse
puts
out
what
strength
he
has
against
a
man
's
arm
,
a
man
must
put
out
what
strength
he
has
against
the
horse
's
mouth
.
<EOS>
But
Bonebreaker
was
cunning
,
and
had
had
a
gag
rein
on
before
.
<EOS>
He
contracted
his
lip
here
,
and
bent
out
his
jaw
there
,
till
he
had
settled
it
to
his
mind
,
and
then
went
away
after
his
own
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
have
a
passion
for
smashing
through
big
,
high
-
grown
ox
-
fences
,
and
by
degrees
his
rider
came
to
feel
that
if
there
was
nothing
worse
coming
,
the
fun
was
not
bad
.
  
<EOS>
The
fox
ran
up
wind
for
a
couple
of
miles
or
so
,
as
Lord
Chiltern
had
prophesied
,
and
then
turned
,
 
not
to
the
right
,
as
would
best
have
served
him
and
Phineas
,
but
to
the
left
,
 
so
that
they
were
forced
to
make
their
way
through
the
ruck
of
horses
before
they
could
place
themselves
again
.
<EOS>
Phineas
found
himself
crossing
a
road
,
in
and
out
of
it
,
before
he
knew
where
he
was
,
and
for
a
while
he
lost
sight
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
But
in
truth
he
was
leading
now
,
whereas
Lord
Chiltern
had
led
before
.
<EOS>
The
two
horses
having
been
together
all
the
morning
,
and
on
the
previous
day
,
were
willing
enough
to
remain
in
company
,
if
they
were
allowed
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
They
both
crossed
the
road
,
not
very
far
from
each
other
,
going
in
and
out
amidst
a
crowd
of
horses
,
and
before
long
were
again
placed
well
,
now
having
the
hunt
on
their
right
,
whereas
hitherto
it
had
been
on
their
left
.
<EOS>
They
went
over
large
pasture
fields
,
and
Phineas
began
to
think
that
as
long
as
Bonebreaker
would
be
able
to
go
through
the
thick
grown
-
up
hedges
,
all
would
be
right
.
<EOS>
Now
and
again
he
came
to
a
cut
fence
,
a
fence
that
had
been
cut
and
laid
,
and
these
were
not
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
Force
was
not
sufficient
for
them
,
and
they
admitted
of
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
But
the
horse
,
though
he
would
rush
at
them
unpleasantly
,
took
them
when
they
came
without
touching
them
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
all
right
yet
,
 
unless
the
beast
should
tire
with
him
;
and
then
,
Phineas
thought
,
a
misfortune
might
probably
occur
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
,
as
he
flew
over
one
such
impediment
,
that
he
rode
a
stone
heavier
than
his
friend
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
forty
-
five
minutes
Bonebreaker
also
might
become
aware
of
the
fact
.
  
<EOS>
The
hounds
were
running
well
in
sight
to
their
right
,
and
Phineas
began
to
feel
some
of
that
pride
which
a
man
indulges
when
he
becomes
aware
that
he
has
taken
his
place
comfortably
,
has
left
the
squad
behind
,
and
is
going
well
.
<EOS>
There
were
men
nearer
the
hounds
than
he
was
,
but
he
was
near
enough
even
for
ambition
.
<EOS>
There
had
already
been
enough
of
the
run
to
make
him
sure
that
it
would
be
a
"
good
thing
"
,
and
enough
to
make
him
aware
also
that
probably
it
might
be
too
good
.
<EOS>
When
a
run
is
over
,
men
are
very
apt
to
regret
the
termination
,
who
a
minute
or
two
before
were
anxiously
longing
that
the
hounds
might
pull
down
their
game
.
<EOS>
To
finish
well
is
everything
in
hunting
.
<EOS>
To
have
led
for
over
an
hour
is
nothing
,
let
the
pace
and
country
have
been
what
they
might
,
if
you
fall
away
during
the
last
half
mile
.
<EOS>
Therefore
it
is
that
those
behind
hope
that
the
fox
may
make
this
or
that
cover
,
while
the
forward
men
long
to
see
him
turned
over
in
every
field
.
<EOS>
To
ride
to
hounds
is
very
glorious
;
but
to
have
ridden
to
hounds
is
more
glorious
still
.
<EOS>
They
had
now
crossed
another
road
,
and
a
larger
one
,
and
had
got
into
a
somewhat
closer
country
.
<EOS>
The
fields
were
not
so
big
,
and
the
fences
were
not
so
high
.
<EOS>
Phineas
got
a
moment
to
look
about
him
,
and
saw
Lord
Chiltern
riding
without
his
cap
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
red
in
the
face
,
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
glare
,
and
he
was
tugging
at
his
horse
with
all
his
might
.
<EOS>
But
the
animal
seemed
still
to
go
with
perfect
command
of
strength
,
and
Phineas
had
too
much
work
on
his
own
hands
to
think
of
offering
Quixotic
assistance
to
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
He
saw
some
one
,
a
farmer
,
as
he
thought
,
speak
to
Lord
Chiltern
as
they
rode
close
together
;
but
Chiltern
only
shook
his
head
and
pulled
at
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
brooks
in
those
parts
.
<EOS>
The
river
Eye
forms
itself
thereabouts
,
or
some
of
its
tributaries
do
so
;
and
these
tributaries
,
though
small
as
rivers
,
are
considerable
to
men
on
one
side
who
are
called
by
the
exigencies
of
the
occasion
to
place
themselves
quickly
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Phineas
knew
nothing
of
these
brooks
;
but
Bonebreaker
had
gone
gallantly
over
two
,
and
now
that
there
came
a
third
in
the
way
<EOS>
,
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
he
might
go
gallantly
over
that
also
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
at
any
rate
,
had
no
power
to
decide
otherwise
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
the
brute
would
go
straight
with
him
he
could
sit
him
;
but
he
had
long
given
up
the
idea
of
having
a
will
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
till
he
was
within
twenty
yards
of
the
brook
,
he
did
not
see
that
it
was
larger
than
the
others
.
<EOS>
He
looked
around
,
and
there
was
Chiltern
close
to
him
,
still
fighting
with
his
horse
;
 
but
the
farmer
had
turned
away
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
Chiltern
nodded
to
him
,
as
much
as
to
tell
him
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
On
he
went
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
The
brook
,
when
he
came
to
it
,
seemed
to
be
a
huge
black
hole
,
yawning
beneath
him
.
<EOS>
The
banks
were
quite
steep
,
and
just
where
he
was
to
take
off
there
was
an
ugly
stump
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
to
think
of
anything
.
<EOS>
He
stuck
his
knees
against
his
saddle
,
 
and
in
a
moment
was
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
The
brute
,
who
had
taken
off
a
yard
before
the
stump
,
knowing
well
the
danger
of
striking
it
with
his
foot
,
came
down
with
a
grunt
,
and
did
,
I
think
,
begin
to
feel
the
weight
of
that
extra
stone
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
soon
as
he
was
safe
,
looked
back
,
and
there
was
Lord
Chiltern
's
horse
in
the
very
act
of
his
spring
,
 
higher
up
the
rivulet
,
where
it
was
even
broader
.
<EOS>
At
that
distance
Phineas
could
see
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
wild
with
rage
against
the
beast
.
<EOS>
But
whether
he
wished
to
take
the
leap
or
wished
to
avoid
it
,
there
was
no
choice
left
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
animal
rushed
at
the
brook
,
and
in
a
moment
the
horse
and
horseman
were
lost
to
sight
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
then
that
that
extra
stone
should
tell
,
as
it
enabled
Phineas
to
arrest
his
horse
and
to
come
back
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
The
Lincolnshire
horse
had
chested
the
further
bank
,
and
of
course
had
fallen
back
into
the
stream
.
<EOS>
When
Phineas
got
down
he
found
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
wedged
in
between
the
horse
and
the
bank
,
which
was
better
,
at
any
rate
,
than
being
under
the
horse
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
old
fellow
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
smile
,
when
he
saw
Phineas
.
"
You
go
on
;
it
's
too
good
to
lose
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
was
very
pale
,
and
seemed
to
be
quite
helpless
where
he
lay
.
<EOS>
The
horse
did
not
move
,
 
and
never
did
move
again
.
<EOS>
He
had
smashed
his
shoulder
to
pieces
against
a
stump
on
the
bank
,
and
was
afterwards
shot
on
that
very
spot
.
  
<EOS>
When
Phineas
got
down
he
found
that
there
was
but
little
water
where
the
horse
lay
.
<EOS>
The
depth
of
the
stream
had
been
on
the
side
from
which
they
had
taken
off
,
and
the
thick
black
mud
lay
within
a
foot
of
the
surface
,
close
to
the
bank
against
which
Lord
Chiltern
was
propped
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
worst
one
I
ever
was
on
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
think
he
's
gruelled
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
hurt
?
"
  
"
Well
;
 
I
fancy
there
is
something
amiss
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
move
my
arms
;
and
I
catch
my
breath
.
<EOS>
My
legs
are
all
right
if
I
could
get
away
from
this
accursed
brute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
so
,
"
said
the
farmer
,
coming
and
looking
down
upon
them
from
the
bank
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
so
,
but
you
would
n't
be
said
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
too
got
down
,
and
between
them
both
they
extricated
Lord
Chiltern
from
his
position
,
and
got
him
on
to
the
bank
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
un
's
a
dead
un
,
"
said
the
farmer
,
pointing
to
the
horse
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
,
"
said
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
us
a
drop
of
sherry
,
Finn
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
broken
his
collar
-
bone
and
three
of
his
ribs
.
<EOS>
They
got
a
farmer
's
trap
from
Wissindine
and
took
him
into
Oakham
.
<EOS>
When
there
,
he
insisted
on
being
taken
on
through
Stamford
to
the
Willingford
Bull
before
he
would
have
his
bones
set
,
 
picking
up
,
however
,
a
surgeon
at
Stamford
.
<EOS>
Phineas
remained
with
him
for
a
couple
of
days
,
losing
his
run
with
the
Fitzwilliams
and
a
day
at
the
potted
peas
,
and
became
very
fond
of
his
patient
as
he
sat
by
his
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
good
run
,
though
,
was
n't
it
?
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
as
Phineas
took
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
by
George
,
Phineas
,
you
rode
Bonebreaker
<EOS>
so
well
,
that
you
shall
have
him
as
often
as
you
'll
come
down
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
but
you
Irish
fellows
always
ride
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
's
Carriage
Stops
the
Way
 
When
Phineas
got
back
to
London
,
a
day
after
his
time
,
he
found
that
there
was
already
a
great
political
commotion
in
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
He
had
known
that
on
Easter
Monday
and
Tuesday
there
was
to
be
a
gathering
of
the
people
in
favour
of
the
ballot
,
and
that
on
Wednesday
there
was
to
be
a
procession
with
a
petition
which
Mr.
Turnbull
was
to
receive
from
the
hands
of
the
people
on
Primrose
Hill
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
at
first
intended
that
Mr.
Turnbull
should
receive
the
petition
at
the
door
of
Westminster
Hall
on
the
Thursday
;
but
he
had
been
requested
by
the
Home
Secretary
to
put
aside
this
intention
,
and
he
had
complied
with
the
request
made
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
was
to
move
the
second
reading
of
his
Reform
Bill
on
that
day
,
the
preliminary
steps
having
been
taken
without
any
special
notice
;
but
the
bill
of
course
included
no
clause
in
favour
of
the
ballot
;
and
this
petition
was
the
consequence
of
that
omission
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
had
predicted
evil
consequences
,
both
in
the
House
and
out
of
it
,
and
was
now
doing
the
best
in
his
power
to
bring
about
the
verification
of
his
own
prophecies
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
reached
his
lodgings
late
on
the
Thursday
,
found
that
the
town
had
been
in
a
state
of
ferment
for
three
days
,
that
on
the
Wednesday
forty
or
fifty
thousand
persons
had
been
collected
at
Primrose
Hill
,
and
that
the
police
had
been
forced
to
interfere
,
 
and
that
worse
was
expected
on
the
Friday
.
<EOS>
Though
Mr.
Turnbull
had
yielded
to
the
Government
as
to
receiving
the
petition
,
the
crowd
was
resolved
that
they
would
see
the
petition
carried
into
the
House
.
<EOS>
It
was
argued
that
the
Government
would
have
done
better
to
have
refrained
from
interfering
as
to
the
previously
intended
arrangement
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
easier
to
deal
with
a
procession
than
with
a
mob
of
men
gathered
together
without
any
semblance
of
form
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
had
been
asked
to
postpone
the
second
reading
of
his
bill
;
but
the
request
had
come
from
his
opponents
,
and
he
would
not
yield
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
said
that
it
would
be
a
bad
expedient
to
close
Parliament
from
fear
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
Phineas
found
at
the
Reform
Club
on
the
Thursday
evening
that
members
of
the
House
of
Commons
were
requested
to
enter
on
the
Friday
by
the
door
usually
used
by
the
peers
,
and
to
make
their
way
thence
to
their
own
House
.
<EOS>
He
found
that
his
landlord
,
Mr.
Bunce
,
had
been
out
with
the
people
during
the
entire
three
days
;
 
and
Mrs.
Bunce
,
with
a
flood
of
tears
,
begged
Phineas
to
interfere
as
to
the
Friday
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
that
headstrong
that
he
'll
be
took
if
anybody
's
took
;
and
they
say
that
all
Westminster
is
to
be
lined
with
soldiers
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
on
the
Friday
morning
did
have
some
conversation
with
his
landlord
;
but
his
first
work
on
reaching
London
was
to
see
Lord
Chiltern
's
friends
,
and
tell
them
of
the
accident
.
  
<EOS>
The
potted
peas
Committee
sat
on
the
Thursday
,
and
he
ought
to
have
been
there
.
<EOS>
His
absence
,
however
,
was
unavoidable
,
as
he
could
not
have
left
his
friend
's
bed
-
side
so
soon
after
the
accident
.
<EOS>
On
the
Wednesday
he
had
written
to
Lady
Laura
,
and
on
the
Thursday
evening
he
went
first
to
Portman
Square
and
then
to
Grosvenor
Place
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
will
kill
himself
some
day
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
 
with
a
tear
,
however
,
in
each
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
magnificent
horseman
;
but
accidents
of
course
will
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
many
of
his
bones
are
there
not
broken
,
I
wonder
?
"
said
the
father
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
to
talk
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
You
think
he
is
not
in
danger
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
should
fear
that
he
would
be
so
liable
to
inflammation
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
doctor
says
that
there
is
none
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
taking
an
enormous
deal
of
exercise
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
drinking
no
wine
.
<EOS>
All
that
is
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
drink
,
then
?
"
asked
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
I
rather
think
,
my
lord
,
you
are
mistaken
a
little
about
his
habits
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
fancy
he
ever
drinks
unless
he
is
provoked
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Provoked
!
<EOS>
Could
anything
provoke
you
to
make
a
brute
of
yourself
?
<EOS>
But
I
am
glad
that
he
is
in
no
danger
.
<EOS>
If
you
hear
of
him
,
let
me
know
how
he
goes
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
was
of
course
full
of
concern
.
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
to
go
down
to
him
,
"
she
said
,
"
but
Mr.
Kennedy
thought
that
there
was
no
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
is
there
any
;
 
I
mean
in
regard
to
danger
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
solitary
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
to
him
again
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
will
not
let
me
go
unless
I
can
say
that
there
is
danger
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
think
that
because
Oswald
has
had
accidents
before
,
it
is
nothing
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
can
not
leave
London
without
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
brother
makes
very
little
of
it
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
he
would
make
little
of
anything
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
were
ill
he
would
be
in
London
by
the
first
train
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kennedy
would
let
you
go
if
you
asked
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
advises
me
not
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
says
my
duty
does
not
require
it
,
unless
Oswald
be
in
danger
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
,
Mr.
Finn
,
how
hard
it
is
for
a
wife
not
to
take
advice
when
it
is
so
given
?
"
<EOS>
This
she
said
,
within
six
months
of
her
marriage
,
to
the
man
who
had
been
her
husband
's
rival
!
  
<EOS>
Phineas
asked
her
whether
Violet
had
heard
the
news
,
and
learned
that
she
was
still
ignorant
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
got
your
letter
only
this
morning
,
and
I
have
not
seen
her
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
am
so
angry
with
her
that
I
hardly
wish
to
see
her
.
"
<EOS>
Thursday
was
Lady
Baldock
's
night
,
and
Phineas
went
from
Grosvenor
Place
to
Berkeley
Square
.
<EOS>
There
he
saw
Violet
,
and
found
that
she
had
heard
of
the
accident
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Do
tell
me
;
 
is
it
much
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Much
in
inconvenience
,
certainly
;
but
not
much
in
danger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Laura
was
so
unkind
not
to
send
me
word
!
<EOS>
I
only
heard
it
just
now
.
<EOS>
Did
you
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
close
to
him
,
and
helped
him
up
.
<EOS>
The
horse
jumped
into
a
river
with
him
,
and
crushed
him
up
against
the
bank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
lucky
that
you
should
be
there
!
<EOS>
Had
you
jumped
the
river
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
almost
unintentionally
,
for
my
horse
was
rushing
so
that
I
could
not
hold
him
.
<EOS>
Chiltern
was
riding
a
brute
that
no
one
should
have
ridden
.
<EOS>
No
one
will
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
destroy
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
had
to
be
killed
afterwards
.
<EOS>
He
broke
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
very
lucky
that
you
should
have
been
near
him
,
 
and
,
again
,
how
lucky
that
you
should
not
have
been
hurt
yourself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
likely
that
we
should
both
come
to
grief
at
the
same
fence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
might
have
been
you
.
<EOS>
And
you
think
there
is
no
danger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
 
if
I
may
believe
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
His
hunting
is
done
for
this
year
,
and
he
will
be
very
desolate
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
down
again
to
him
in
a
few
days
,
and
try
to
bring
him
up
to
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
;
 
do
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
laid
up
in
his
father
's
house
,
his
father
must
see
him
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
had
not
looked
at
the
matter
in
that
light
;
but
he
thought
that
Miss
Effingham
might
probably
be
right
.
  
<EOS>
Early
on
the
next
morning
he
saw
Mr.
Bunce
,
and
used
all
his
eloquence
to
keep
that
respectable
member
of
society
at
home
;
 
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
good
do
you
expect
to
do
,
Mr.
Bunce
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
with
perhaps
some
little
tone
of
authority
in
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
carry
my
point
,
"
said
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
your
point
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
present
point
is
the
ballot
,
as
a
part
of
the
Government
measure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
expect
to
carry
that
by
going
out
into
the
streets
with
all
the
roughs
of
London
,
and
putting
yourself
in
direct
opposition
to
the
authority
of
the
magistrates
?
<EOS>
Do
you
really
believe
that
the
ballot
will
become
the
law
of
the
land
any
sooner
because
you
incur
this
danger
and
inconvenience
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Mr.
Finn
;
I
do
n't
believe
the
sea
will
become
any
fuller
because
the
Piddle
runs
into
it
out
of
the
Dorsetshire
fields
;
but
I
do
believe
that
the
waters
from
all
the
countries
is
what
makes
the
ocean
.
<EOS>
I
shall
help
;
and
it
's
my
duty
to
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
your
duty
as
a
respectable
citizen
,
with
a
wife
and
family
,
to
stay
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
everybody
with
a
wife
and
family
was
to
say
so
,
there
'd
be
none
there
but
roughs
,
and
then
where
should
we
be
?
<EOS>
What
would
the
Government
people
say
to
us
then
?
<EOS>
If
every
man
with
a
wife
and
family
was
to
show
hisself
in
the
streets
to
-
night
,
we
should
have
the
ballot
before
Parliament
breaks
up
,
and
if
none
of
'em
do
n't
do
it
,
we
shall
never
have
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
that
so
?
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
who
intended
to
be
honest
,
was
not
prepared
to
dispute
the
assertion
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
"
If
that
's
so
,
"
said
Bunce
,
triumphantly
,
"
a
man
's
duty
's
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
go
,
though
he
'd
two
wives
and
families
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
went
.
  
<EOS>
The
petition
was
to
be
presented
at
six
o'clock
,
but
the
crowd
,
who
collected
to
see
it
carried
into
Westminster
Hall
,
began
to
form
itself
by
noon
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
afterwards
that
many
of
the
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Palace
Yard
and
the
Bridge
were
filled
with
soldiers
;
but
if
so
,
the
men
did
not
show
themselves
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
evening
three
or
four
companies
of
the
Guards
in
St.
James
's
Park
did
show
themselves
,
and
had
some
rough
work
to
do
,
for
many
of
the
people
took
themselves
away
from
Westminster
by
that
route
.
<EOS>
The
police
,
who
were
very
numerous
in
Palace
Yard
,
had
a
hard
time
of
it
all
the
afternoon
,
and
it
was
said
afterwards
that
it
would
have
been
much
better
to
have
allowed
the
petition
to
have
been
brought
up
by
the
procession
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
A
procession
,
let
it
be
who
it
will
that
proceeds
,
has
in
it
,
of
its
own
nature
something
of
order
.
<EOS>
But
now
there
was
no
order
.
<EOS>
The
petition
,
which
was
said
to
fill
fifteen
cabs
,
 
though
the
absolute
sheets
of
signatures
were
carried
into
the
House
by
four
men
,
 
was
being
dragged
about
half
the
day
and
it
certainly
would
have
been
impossible
for
a
member
to
have
made
his
way
into
the
House
through
Westminster
Hall
between
the
hours
of
four
and
six
.
<EOS>
To
effect
an
entrance
at
all
they
were
obliged
to
go
round
at
the
back
of
the
Abbey
,
as
all
the
spaces
round
St.
Margaret
's
Church
and
Canning
's
monument
were
filled
with
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Parliament
Street
was
quite
impassable
at
five
o
clock
,
and
there
was
no
traffic
across
the
bridge
from
that
hour
till
after
eight
.
<EOS>
As
the
evening
went
on
,
the
mob
extended
itself
to
Downing
Street
and
the
front
of
the
Treasury
Chambers
,
and
before
the
night
was
over
<EOS>
all
the
hoardings
round
the
new
Government
offices
had
been
pulled
down
.
<EOS>
The
windows
also
of
certain
obnoxious
members
of
Parliament
were
broken
,
when
those
obnoxious
members
lived
within
reach
.
<EOS>
One
gentleman
who
unfortunately
held
a
house
in
Richmond
Terrace
,
and
who
was
said
to
have
said
that
the
ballot
was
the
resort
of
cowards
,
fared
very
badly
;
 
for
his
windows
were
not
only
broken
,
but
his
furniture
and
mirrors
were
destroyed
by
the
stones
that
were
thrown
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
I
say
,
was
much
blamed
.
<EOS>
But
after
all
,
it
may
be
a
doubt
whether
the
procession
on
Wednesday
might
not
have
ended
worse
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
was
heard
to
say
afterwards
that
the
number
of
people
collected
would
have
been
much
greater
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
moved
the
second
reading
of
his
bill
,
and
made
his
speech
.
<EOS>
He
made
his
speech
with
the
knowledge
that
the
Houses
of
Parliament
were
surrounded
by
a
mob
,
and
I
think
that
the
fact
added
to
its
efficacy
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
gave
him
an
appropriate
opportunity
for
a
display
which
was
not
difficult
.
<EOS>
His
voice
faltered
on
two
or
three
occasions
,
and
faltered
through
real
feeling
;
but
this
sort
of
feeling
,
though
it
be
real
,
is
at
the
command
of
orators
on
certain
occasions
,
and
does
them
yeoman
's
service
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
was
an
old
man
,
nearly
worn
out
in
the
service
of
his
country
,
who
was
known
to
have
been
true
and
honest
,
and
to
have
loved
his
country
well
,
 
though
there
were
of
course
they
who
declared
that
his
hand
had
been
too
weak
for
power
,
and
that
his
services
had
been
naught
;
 
and
on
this
evening
his
virtues
were
remembered
.
<EOS>
Once
when
his
voice
failed
him
the
whole
House
got
up
and
cheered
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
a
Whig
Prime
Minister
's
speech
on
such
an
occasion
will
be
understood
by
most
of
my
readers
without
further
indication
.
<EOS>
The
bill
itself
had
been
read
before
,
and
it
was
understood
that
no
objection
would
be
made
to
the
extent
of
the
changes
provided
in
it
by
the
liberal
side
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
The
opposition
coming
from
liberal
members
was
to
be
confined
to
the
subject
of
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
And
even
as
yet
it
was
not
known
whether
Mr.
Turnbull
and
his
followers
would
vote
against
the
second
reading
,
or
whether
they
would
take
what
was
given
,
and
declare
their
intention
of
obtaining
the
remainder
on
a
separate
motion
.
<EOS>
The
opposition
of
a
large
party
of
Conservatives
was
a
matter
of
certainty
;
but
to
this
party
Mr.
Mildmay
did
not
conceive
himself
bound
to
offer
so
large
an
amount
of
argument
as
he
would
have
given
<EOS>
had
there
been
at
the
moment
<EOS>
no
crowd
in
Palace
Yard
.
<EOS>
And
he
probably
felt
that
that
crowd
would
assist
him
with
his
old
Tory
enemies
.
<EOS>
When
,
in
the
last
words
of
his
speech
,
he
declared
that
under
no
circumstances
would
he
disfigure
the
close
of
his
political
career
by
voting
for
the
ballot
,
 
not
though
the
people
,
on
whose
behalf
he
had
been
fighting
battles
all
his
life
,
should
be
there
in
any
number
to
coerce
him
,
 
there
came
another
round
of
applause
from
the
opposition
benches
,
and
Mr.
Daubeny
began
to
fear
that
some
young
horses
in
his
team
might
get
loose
from
their
traces
.
<EOS>
With
great
dignity
Mr.
Daubeny
had
kept
aloof
from
Mr.
Turnbull
and
from
Mr.
Turnbull
's
tactics
;
but
he
was
not
the
less
alive
to
the
fact
that
Mr.
Turnbull
,
with
his
mob
and
his
big
petition
,
might
be
of
considerable
assistance
to
him
in
this
present
duel
between
himself
and
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
I
think
Mr.
Daubeny
was
in
the
habit
of
looking
at
these
contests
as
duels
between
himself
and
the
leader
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
,
 
in
which
assistance
from
any
quarter
might
be
accepted
if
offered
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
's
speech
did
not
occupy
much
over
an
hour
,
and
at
half
-
past
seven
Mr.
Turnbull
got
up
to
reply
.
<EOS>
It
was
presumed
that
he
would
do
so
,
and
not
a
member
left
his
place
,
though
that
time
of
the
day
is
an
interesting
time
,
and
though
Mr.
Turnbull
was
accustomed
to
be
long
.
<EOS>
There
soon
came
to
be
but
little
ground
for
doubting
what
would
be
the
nature
of
Mr.
Turnbull
's
vote
on
the
second
reading
.
<EOS>
"
How
may
I
dare
,
"
said
he
,
"
to
accept
so
small
a
measure
of
reform
as
this
with
such
a
message
from
the
country
as
is
now
conveyed
to
me
through
the
presence
of
fifty
thousand
of
my
countrymen
,
who
are
at
this
moment
demanding
their
measure
of
reform
just
beyond
the
frail
walls
of
this
chamber
?
<EOS>
The
right
honourable
gentleman
has
told
us
that
he
will
never
be
intimidated
by
a
concourse
of
people
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
there
was
any
need
that
he
should
speak
of
intimidation
.
<EOS>
No
one
has
accused
the
right
honourable
gentleman
of
political
cowardice
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
has
so
said
,
I
will
follow
in
his
footsteps
.
<EOS>
Neither
will
I
be
intimidated
by
the
large
majority
which
this
House
presented
the
other
night
against
the
wishes
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
I
will
support
no
great
measure
of
reform
which
does
not
include
the
ballot
among
its
clauses
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
Mr.
Turnbull
threw
down
the
gauntlet
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
spoke
for
two
hours
,
and
then
the
debate
was
adjourned
till
the
Monday
.
<EOS>
The
adjournment
was
moved
by
an
independent
member
,
who
,
as
was
known
,
would
support
the
Government
,
and
at
once
received
Mr.
Turnbull
's
assent
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
great
hurry
with
the
bill
,
and
it
was
felt
that
it
would
be
well
to
let
the
ferment
subside
.
<EOS>
Enough
had
been
done
for
glory
when
Mr.
Mildmay
moved
the
second
reading
,
and
quite
enough
in
the
way
of
debate
,
 
with
such
an
audience
almost
within
hearing
,
 
when
Mr.
Turnbull
's
speech
had
been
made
.
<EOS>
Then
the
House
emptied
itself
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
elderly
,
cautious
members
made
their
exit
through
the
peers
'
door
.
<EOS>
The
younger
men
got
out
into
the
crowd
through
Westminster
Hall
,
and
were
pushed
about
among
the
roughs
for
an
hour
or
so
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
made
his
way
through
the
hall
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
found
Mr.
Turnbull
's
carriage
waiting
at
the
entrance
with
a
dozen
policemen
round
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
wo
n't
get
home
to
dinner
before
midnight
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
understands
all
about
it
,
"
said
Laurence
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
a
good
meal
at
three
,
before
he
left
home
,
and
you
'd
find
sandwiches
and
sherry
in
plenty
if
you
were
to
search
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
knows
how
to
remedy
the
costs
of
mob
popularity
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
time
poor
Bunce
was
being
hustled
about
in
the
crowd
in
the
vicinity
of
Mr.
Turnbull
's
carriage
.
<EOS>
Phineas
and
Fitzgibbon
made
their
way
out
,
and
by
degrees
worked
a
passage
for
themselves
into
Parliament
Street
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
had
been
somewhat
behind
them
in
coming
down
the
hall
,
and
had
not
been
without
a
sense
of
enjoyment
in
the
ovation
which
was
being
given
to
him
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
wrong
in
what
he
was
doing
.
<EOS>
That
affair
of
the
carriage
was
altogether
wrong
,
and
did
Mr.
Turnbull
much
harm
for
many
a
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
When
he
got
outside
the
door
,
where
were
the
twelve
policemen
guarding
his
carriage
,
a
great
number
of
his
admirers
endeavoured
to
shake
hands
with
him
.
<EOS>
Among
them
was
the
devoted
Bunce
.
<EOS>
But
the
policemen
seemed
to
think
that
Mr.
Turnbull
was
to
be
guarded
,
even
from
the
affection
of
his
friends
,
and
were
as
careful
that
he
should
be
ushered
into
his
carriage
untouched
,
as
though
he
had
been
the
favourite
object
of
political
aversion
for
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
himself
,
when
he
began
to
perceive
that
men
were
crowding
close
upon
the
gates
,
and
to
hear
the
noise
,
and
to
feel
,
as
it
were
,
the
breath
of
the
mob
,
stepped
on
quickly
into
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
said
a
word
or
two
in
a
loud
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
my
friends
.
<EOS>
I
trust
you
may
obtain
all
your
just
demands
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
pause
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
could
hardly
have
done
so
,
as
the
policemen
were
manifestly
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
was
got
away
at
a
snail
's
pace
;
 
but
there
remained
in
the
spot
where
the
carriage
had
stood
the
makings
of
a
very
pretty
street
row
.
  
<EOS>
Bunce
had
striven
hard
to
shake
hands
with
his
hero
,
 
Bunce
and
some
other
reformers
as
ardent
and
as
decent
as
himself
.
<EOS>
The
police
were
very
determinate
that
there
should
be
no
such
interruption
to
their
programme
for
getting
Mr.
Turnbull
off
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunce
,
who
had
his
own
ideas
as
to
his
right
to
shake
hands
with
any
gentleman
at
Westminster
Hall
who
might
choose
to
shake
hands
with
him
,
became
uneasy
under
the
impediments
that
were
placed
in
his
way
,
and
expressed
himself
warmly
as
to
his
civil
rights
.
<EOS>
Now
a
London
policeman
in
a
political
row
is
,
I
believe
,
the
most
forbearing
of
men
.
<EOS>
So
long
as
he
meets
with
no
special
political
opposition
,
ordinary
ill
-
usage
does
not
even
put
him
out
of
temper
.
<EOS>
He
is
paid
for
rough
work
among
roughs
,
and
takes
his
rubs
gallantly
.
<EOS>
But
he
feels
himself
to
be
an
instrument
for
the
moment
of
despotic
power
as
opposed
to
civil
rights
,
and
he
wo
n't
stand
what
he
calls
"
jaw
.
<EOS>
"
Trip
up
a
policeman
in
such
a
scramble
,
and
he
will
take
it
in
good
spirit
;
but
mention
the
words
"
Habeas
Corpus
,
"
and
he
'll
lock
you
up
if
he
can
.
<EOS>
As
a
rule
,
his
instincts
are
right
;
for
the
man
who
talks
about
"
Habeas
Corpus
"
in
a
political
crowd
will
generally
do
more
harm
than
can
be
effected
by
the
tripping
up
of
any
constable
.
<EOS>
But
these
instincts
may
be
the
means
of
individual
injustice
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
were
so
when
Mr.
Bunce
was
arrested
and
kept
a
fast
prisoner
.
<EOS>
His
wife
had
shown
her
knowledge
of
his
character
when
she
declared
that
he
'd
be
"
took
"
if
any
one
was
"
took
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bunce
was
taken
into
custody
with
some
three
or
four
others
like
himself
,
 
decent
men
,
who
meant
no
harm
,
but
who
thought
that
as
men
they
were
bound
to
show
their
political
opinions
,
perhaps
at
the
expense
of
a
little
martyrdom
,
 
and
was
carried
into
a
temporary
stronghold
,
which
had
been
provided
for
the
necessities
of
the
police
,
under
the
clock
-
tower
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
me
,
at
your
peril
!
"
said
Bunce
,
indignantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
means
it
,
"
said
the
sergeant
who
had
him
in
custody
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
done
no
ha'porth
to
break
the
law
,
"
said
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
was
breaking
the
law
when
you
was
upsetting
my
men
,
as
I
saw
you
,
"
said
the
sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
upset
nobody
,
"
said
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
rejoined
the
sergeant
;
"
you
can
say
it
all
before
the
magistrate
,
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
am
I
to
be
locked
up
all
night
?
"
said
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
you
will
,
"
replied
the
sergeant
.
  
<EOS>
Bunce
,
who
was
not
by
nature
a
very
talkative
man
,
said
no
more
;
but
he
swore
in
his
heart
that
there
should
be
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Between
eleven
and
twelve
he
was
taken
to
the
regular
police
-
station
,
and
from
thence
he
was
enabled
to
send
word
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bunce
has
been
taken
,
"
said
she
,
with
something
of
the
tragic
queen
,
and
something
also
of
the
injured
wife
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
as
soon
as
Phineas
let
himself
in
with
the
latchkey
between
twelve
and
one
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
mingled
with
,
and
at
last
dominant
over
,
those
severer
tones
,
came
the
voice
of
the
loving
woman
whose
beloved
one
was
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
how
it
'd
be
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
?
<EOS>
And
what
must
we
do
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
he
'd
had
a
bit
to
eat
from
the
moment
he
went
out
;
 
and
as
for
a
drop
of
beer
,
he
never
thinks
of
it
,
except
what
I
puts
down
for
him
at
his
meals
.
<EOS>
Them
nasty
police
always
take
the
best
.
<EOS>
That
's
why
I
was
so
afeard
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
said
all
that
he
could
to
comfort
her
,
and
promised
to
go
to
the
police
-
office
early
in
the
morning
and
look
after
Bunce
.
<EOS>
No
serious
evil
would
,
he
thought
,
probably
come
of
it
;
but
still
Bunce
had
been
wrong
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
might
have
been
took
yourself
,
"
argued
Mrs.
Bunce
,
"
just
as
well
as
he
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
explained
that
he
had
gone
forth
in
the
execution
of
a
public
duty
.
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
been
took
,
all
the
same
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bunce
,
"
for
I
'm
sure
Bunce
did
n't
do
nothing
amiss
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
First
Speech
"
 
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
which
was
Saturday
,
Phineas
was
early
at
the
police
-
office
at
Westminster
looking
after
the
interests
of
his
landlord
;
but
there
had
been
a
considerable
number
of
men
taken
up
during
the
row
,
and
our
friend
could
hardly
procure
that
attention
for
Mr.
Bunce
's
case
to
which
he
thought
the
decency
of
his
client
and
his
own
position
as
a
member
of
Parliament
were
entitled
.
<EOS>
The
men
who
had
been
taken
up
were
taken
in
batches
before
the
magistrates
;
but
as
the
soldiers
in
the
park
had
been
maltreated
,
and
a
considerable
injury
had
been
done
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Downing
Street
,
there
was
a
good
deal
of
strong
feeling
against
the
mob
,
and
the
magistrates
were
disposed
to
be
severe
.
<EOS>
If
decent
men
chose
to
go
out
among
such
companions
,
and
thereby
get
into
trouble
,
decent
men
must
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
During
the
Saturday
and
Sunday
a
very
strong
feeling
grew
up
against
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
The
story
of
the
carriage
was
told
,
and
he
was
declared
to
be
a
turbulent
demagogue
,
only
desirous
of
getting
popularity
.
<EOS>
And
together
with
this
feeling
there
arose
a
general
verdict
of
"
Serve
them
right
"
against
all
who
had
come
into
contact
with
the
police
in
the
great
Turnbull
row
;
and
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
Mr.
Bunce
had
not
been
liberated
up
to
the
Monday
morning
.
<EOS>
On
the
Sunday
Mrs.
Bunce
was
in
hysterics
,
and
declared
her
conviction
that
Mr.
Bunce
would
be
imprisoned
for
life
.
<EOS>
Poor
Phineas
had
an
unquiet
time
with
her
on
the
morning
of
that
day
.
<EOS>
In
every
ecstasy
of
her
grief
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
,
either
metaphorically
or
materially
,
according
to
the
excess
of
her
agony
at
the
moment
,
and
expressed
repeatedly
an
assured
conviction
that
all
her
children
would
die
of
starvation
,
and
that
she
herself
would
be
picked
up
under
the
arches
of
one
of
the
bridges
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
was
soft
-
hearted
,
did
what
he
could
to
comfort
her
,
and
allowed
himself
to
be
worked
up
to
strong
parliamentary
anger
against
the
magistrates
and
police
.
<EOS>
"
When
they
think
that
they
have
public
opinion
on
their
side
,
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
or
arbitrary
excess
which
is
too
great
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
This
he
said
to
Barrington
Erle
,
who
angered
him
and
increased
the
warmth
of
his
feeling
by
declaring
that
a
little
close
confinement
would
be
good
for
the
Bunces
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
do
n't
keep
the
mob
down
,
the
mob
will
keep
us
down
,
"
said
the
Whig
private
secretary
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
no
opportunity
of
answering
this
,
but
declared
to
himself
that
Barrington
Erle
was
no
more
a
Liberal
at
heart
than
was
Mr.
Daubeny
.
<EOS>
"
He
was
born
on
that
side
of
the
question
,
and
has
been
receiving
Whig
wages
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
history
of
his
politics
!
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
Sunday
afternoon
Phineas
went
to
Lord
Brentford
's
in
Portman
Square
,
intending
to
say
a
word
or
two
about
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
meaning
also
to
induce
,
if
possible
,
the
Cabinet
Minister
to
take
part
with
him
against
the
magistrates
,
 
having
a
hope
also
,
in
which
he
was
not
disappointed
,
that
he
might
find
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
with
her
father
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
understand
that
Lady
Laura
was
not
to
be
visited
at
her
own
house
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
So
much
indeed
she
had
told
him
in
so
many
words
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
come
to
understand
also
,
without
any
plain
telling
,
that
she
rebelled
in
heart
against
this
Sabbath
tyranny
,
 
and
that
she
would
escape
from
it
when
escape
was
possible
.
<EOS>
She
had
now
come
to
talk
to
her
father
about
her
brother
,
and
had
brought
Violet
Effingham
with
her
.
<EOS>
They
had
walked
together
across
the
park
after
church
,
and
intended
to
walk
back
again
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
did
not
like
to
have
any
carriage
out
on
a
Sunday
,
and
to
this
arrangement
his
wife
made
no
objection
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
received
a
letter
from
the
Stamford
surgeon
,
and
was
able
to
report
favourably
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
says
that
he
had
better
not
be
moved
for
a
month
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
that
means
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
always
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Will
it
not
be
best
for
him
to
remain
where
he
is
?
"
said
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
a
soul
to
speak
to
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
were
with
him
,
"
said
his
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
,
of
course
,
out
of
the
question
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
They
know
him
at
that
inn
,
and
it
really
seems
to
me
best
that
he
should
stay
there
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
would
be
so
much
at
his
ease
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
dreadful
for
a
man
to
be
confined
to
his
room
without
a
creature
near
him
,
except
the
servants
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
frowned
,
but
said
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
They
all
perceived
that
as
soon
as
he
had
learned
that
there
was
no
real
danger
as
to
his
son
's
life
,
he
was
determined
that
this
accident
should
not
work
him
up
to
any
show
of
tenderness
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
hope
he
will
come
up
to
London
,
"
continued
Violet
,
who
was
not
afraid
of
the
Earl
,
and
was
determined
not
to
be
put
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
what
you
are
talking
about
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lord
Brentford
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
Phineas
found
it
very
difficult
to
extract
any
sympathy
from
the
Earl
on
behalf
of
the
men
who
had
been
locked
up
.
<EOS>
He
was
moody
and
cross
,
and
could
not
be
induced
to
talk
on
the
great
subject
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
declared
that
she
did
not
care
how
many
Bunces
were
locked
up
;
nor
for
how
long
,
 
adding
,
however
,
a
wish
that
Mr.
Turnbull
himself
had
been
among
the
number
of
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
was
somewhat
softer
than
this
,
and
consented
to
express
pity
in
the
case
of
Mr.
Bunce
himself
;
but
Phineas
perceived
that
the
pity
was
awarded
to
him
and
not
to
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
against
Mr.
Turnbull
was
at
the
present
moment
so
strong
among
all
the
upper
classes
,
that
Mr.
Bunce
and
his
brethren
might
have
been
kept
in
durance
for
a
week
without
commiseration
from
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
hard
certainly
on
a
man
like
Mr.
Bunce
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
not
Mr.
Bunce
stay
at
home
and
mind
his
business
?
"
said
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
spent
the
remainder
of
that
day
alone
,
and
came
to
a
resolution
that
on
the
coming
occasion
he
certainly
would
speak
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
The
debate
would
be
resumed
on
the
Monday
,
and
he
would
rise
to
his
legs
on
the
very
first
moment
that
it
became
possible
for
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
And
he
would
do
nothing
towards
preparing
a
speech
;
 
<EOS>
nothing
whatever
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
he
would
trust
entirely
to
such
words
as
might
come
to
him
at
the
moment
;
 
ay
,
and
to
such
thoughts
.
<EOS>
He
had
before
burdened
his
memory
with
preparations
,
and
the
very
weight
of
the
burden
had
been
too
much
for
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
had
feared
to
trust
himself
to
speak
,
because
he
had
felt
that
he
was
not
capable
of
performing
the
double
labour
of
saying
his
lesson
by
heart
,
and
of
facing
the
House
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
There
should
be
nothing
now
for
him
to
remember
.
<EOS>
His
thoughts
were
full
of
his
subject
.
<EOS>
He
would
support
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
with
all
his
eloquence
,
but
he
would
implore
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
the
Home
Secretary
,
and
the
Government
generally
,
to
abstain
from
animosity
against
the
populace
of
London
,
because
they
desired
one
special
boon
which
Mr.
Mildmay
did
not
think
that
it
was
his
duty
to
give
them
.
<EOS>
He
hoped
that
ideas
and
words
would
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
Ideas
and
words
had
been
free
enough
with
him
in
the
old
days
of
the
Dublin
debating
society
.
<EOS>
If
they
failed
him
now
,
he
must
give
the
thing
up
,
and
go
back
to
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Monday
morning
Phineas
was
for
two
hours
at
the
police
-
court
in
Westminster
,
and
at
about
one
on
that
day
Mr.
Bunce
was
liberated
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
brought
up
before
the
magistrate
,
Mr.
Bunce
spoke
his
mind
very
freely
as
to
the
usage
he
had
received
,
and
declared
his
intention
of
bringing
an
action
against
the
sergeant
who
had
detained
him
.
<EOS>
The
magistrate
,
of
course
,
took
the
part
of
the
police
,
and
declared
that
,
from
the
evidence
of
two
men
who
were
examined
,
Bunce
had
certainly
used
such
violence
in
the
crowd
as
had
justified
his
arrest
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
used
no
violence
,
"
said
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
According
to
your
own
showing
,
you
endeavoured
to
make
your
way
up
to
Mr.
Turnbull
's
carriage
,
"
said
the
magistrate
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
close
to
the
carriage
before
the
police
even
saw
me
,
"
said
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
tried
to
force
your
way
round
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
used
no
force
till
a
man
had
me
by
the
collar
to
push
me
back
;
and
I
was
n't
violent
,
not
then
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
was
doing
what
I
had
a
right
to
do
,
 
and
<EOS>
it
was
that
as
made
him
hang
on
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
doing
what
you
had
a
right
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
were
assisting
to
create
a
riot
,
"
said
the
magistrate
,
with
that
indignation
which
a
London
magistrate
should
always
know
how
to
affect
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
however
,
was
allowed
to
give
evidence
as
to
his
landlord
's
character
,
and
then
Bunce
was
liberated
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
went
he
again
swore
that
that
should
not
be
the
last
of
it
,
and
he
told
the
magistrate
that
he
had
been
ill
-
used
.
<EOS>
When
liberated
,
he
was
joined
by
a
dozen
sympathising
friends
,
who
escorted
him
home
,
and
among
them
were
one
or
two
literary
gentlemen
,
employed
on
those
excellent
penny
papers
,
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
and
the
_
Ballot
-
box
_
.
<EOS>
It
was
their
intention
that
Mr.
Bunce
's
case
should
not
be
allowed
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
gentlemen
made
a
distinct
offer
to
Phineas
Finn
of
unbounded
popularity
during
life
and
of
immortality
afterwards
,
if
he
,
as
a
member
of
Parliament
,
would
take
up
Bunce
's
case
with
vigour
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
not
quite
understanding
the
nature
of
the
offer
,
and
not
as
yet
knowing
the
profession
of
the
gentleman
,
gave
some
general
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
out
strong
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
we
'll
see
that
you
are
properly
reported
.
<EOS>
I
'm
on
the
_
Banner
_
,
sir
,
and
I
'll
answer
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
had
been
somewhat
eager
in
expressing
his
sympathy
with
Bunce
,
and
had
not
given
very
close
attention
to
the
gentleman
who
was
addressing
him
,
was
still
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
the
_
Banner
_
,
which
the
gentleman
was
on
,
did
not
at
once
come
home
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Something
ought
to
be
done
,
certainly
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
take
it
up
strong
,
"
said
the
gentleman
,
"
and
we
shall
be
happy
to
have
you
among
us
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
,
Mr.
Finn
,
that
in
public
life
there
's
nothing
like
having
a
horgan
to
back
you
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
most
you
can
do
in
the
'
ouse
?
<EOS>
Nothing
,
if
you
're
not
reported
.
<EOS>
You
're
speaking
to
the
country
;
 
ai
n't
you
?
<EOS>
And
you
ca
n't
do
that
without
a
horgan
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
You
come
among
us
on
the
_
Banner
_
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
do
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
understood
the
nature
of
the
offer
made
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
they
parted
,
the
literary
gentleman
gave
our
hero
his
card
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
much
was
printed
.
<EOS>
Then
,
on
the
corner
of
the
card
was
written
,
"
_
Banner
_
Office
,
137
,
Fetter
Lane
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
was
a
young
man
,
under
thirty
,
not
remarkable
for
clean
linen
,
and
who
always
talked
of
the
"
'
ouse
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
was
a
well
-
known
and
not
undistinguished
member
of
a
powerful
class
of
men
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
reporter
,
and
as
such
knew
the
"
'
ouse
"
well
,
and
was
a
writer
for
the
press
.
<EOS>
And
,
though
he
talked
of
"
'
Ouses
"
and
"
horgans
"
,
he
wrote
good
English
with
great
rapidity
,
and
was
possessed
of
that
special
sort
of
political
fervour
which
shows
itself
in
a
man
's
work
rather
than
in
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Slide
's
taste
to
be
an
advanced
reformer
,
and
in
all
his
operations
on
behalf
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
he
was
a
reformer
very
much
advanced
.
<EOS>
No
man
could
do
an
article
on
the
people
's
indefeasible
rights
with
more
pronounced
vigour
than
Mr.
Slide
.
<EOS>
But
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
as
yet
that
he
ought
to
care
for
anything
else
than
the
fight
,
 
than
the
advantage
of
having
a
good
subject
on
which
to
write
slashing
articles
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slide
was
an
energetic
but
not
a
thoughtful
man
;
but
in
his
thoughts
on
politics
,
as
far
as
they
went
with
him
,
he
regarded
the
wrongs
of
the
people
as
being
of
infinitely
greater
value
than
their
rights
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
he
was
insincere
in
all
that
he
was
daily
saying
;
 
but
simply
that
he
never
thought
about
it
.
<EOS>
Very
early
in
life
he
had
fallen
among
"
people
's
friends
,
"
and
an
opening
on
the
liberal
press
had
come
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
To
be
a
"
people
's
friend
"
suited
the
turn
of
his
ambition
,
and
he
was
a
"
people
's
friend
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
his
business
to
abuse
Government
,
and
to
express
on
all
occasions
an
opinion
that
as
a
matter
of
course
the
ruling
powers
were
the
"
people
's
enemies
.
"
<EOS>
Had
the
ruling
powers
ceased
to
be
the
"
people
's
enemies
,
"
Mr.
Slide
's
ground
would
have
been
taken
from
under
his
feet
.
<EOS>
But
such
a
catastrophe
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
That
excellent
old
arrangement
that
had
gone
on
since
demagogues
were
first
invented
was
in
full
vigour
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
ruling
powers
and
there
were
the
people
,
 
devils
on
one
side
and
angels
on
the
other
,
 
and
as
long
as
a
people
's
friend
had
a
pen
in
his
hand
<EOS>
all
was
right
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
when
he
left
the
indignant
Bunce
to
go
among
his
friends
,
walked
to
the
House
thinking
a
good
deal
of
what
Mr.
Slide
had
said
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
potted
peas
Committee
was
again
on
,
and
he
had
intended
to
be
in
the
Committee
Room
by
twelve
punctually
:
but
he
had
been
unable
to
leave
Mr.
Bunce
in
the
lurch
,
and
it
was
now
past
one
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
,
from
one
unfortunate
circumstance
after
another
,
failed
hitherto
in
giving
to
the
potted
peas
that
resolute
attention
which
the
subject
demanded
.
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
his
mind
was
full
of
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
and
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
was
there
not
something
in
Mr.
Slide
's
proposition
?
<EOS>
He
,
Phineas
,
had
come
into
Parliament
as
it
were
under
the
wing
of
a
Government
pack
,
and
his
friendships
,
which
had
been
very
successful
,
had
been
made
with
Ministers
,
and
with
the
friends
of
Ministers
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
Whig
Ministerial
,
and
to
look
for
his
profession
in
that
line
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
specially
fortified
in
this
resolution
by
his
dislike
to
the
ballot
,
 
which
dislike
had
been
the
result
of
Mr.
Monk
's
teaching
.
<EOS>
Had
Mr.
Turnbull
become
his
friend
instead
<EOS>
,
it
may
well
be
that
he
would
have
liked
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
On
such
subjects
men
must
think
long
,
and
be
sure
that
they
have
thought
in
earnest
,
before
they
are
justified
in
saying
that
their
opinions
are
the
results
of
their
own
thoughts
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
began
to
reflect
how
far
this
ministerial
profession
would
suit
him
.
<EOS>
Would
it
be
much
to
be
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
subject
to
the
dominion
of
Mr.
Ratler
?
<EOS>
Such
lordship
and
such
subjection
would
be
the
result
of
success
.
<EOS>
He
told
himself
that
he
was
at
heart
a
true
Liberal
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
better
for
him
to
abandon
the
idea
of
office
trammels
,
and
go
among
them
on
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
?
<EOS>
A
glow
of
enthusiasm
came
over
him
as
he
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
what
would
Violet
Effingham
say
to
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
and
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
?
<EOS>
And
he
would
have
liked
the
_
Banner
_
<EOS>
better
had
not
Mr.
Slide
talked
about
the
'
ouse
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
Committee
Room
,
in
which
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
took
no
active
part
in
reference
to
the
potted
peas
,
he
went
down
to
the
House
,
and
was
present
when
the
debate
was
resumed
.
<EOS>
Not
unnaturally
,
one
speaker
after
another
made
some
allusion
to
the
row
in
the
streets
,
and
the
work
which
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
the
magistrates
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
had
declared
that
he
would
vote
against
the
second
reading
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
,
and
had
explained
that
he
would
do
so
because
he
could
consent
to
no
Reform
Bill
which
did
not
include
the
ballot
as
one
of
its
measures
.
<EOS>
The
debate
fashioned
itself
after
this
speech
of
Mr.
Turnbull
's
,
and
turned
again
very
much
upon
the
ballot
,
 
although
it
had
been
thought
that
the
late
debate
had
settled
that
question
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
of
Mr.
Turnbull
's
followers
declared
that
they
also
would
vote
against
the
bill
,
 
of
course
,
as
not
going
far
enough
;
and
one
or
two
gentlemen
from
the
Conservative
benches
extended
a
spoken
welcome
to
these
new
colleagues
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Palliser
got
up
and
addressed
the
House
for
an
hour
,
struggling
hard
to
bring
back
the
real
subject
,
and
to
make
the
House
understand
that
the
ballot
,
whether
good
or
bad
,
had
been
knocked
on
the
head
,
and
that
members
had
no
right
at
the
present
moment
to
consider
anything
but
the
expediency
or
inexpediency
of
so
much
Reform
as
Mr.
Mildmay
presented
to
them
in
the
present
bill
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
determined
to
speak
,
and
to
speak
on
this
evening
if
he
could
catch
the
Speaker
's
eye
.
<EOS>
Again
the
scene
before
him
was
going
round
before
him
;
again
things
became
dim
,
and
again
he
felt
his
blood
beating
hard
at
his
heart
.
<EOS>
But
things
were
not
so
bad
with
him
as
they
had
been
before
,
because
he
had
nothing
to
remember
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
knew
,
indeed
,
what
he
intended
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
had
an
idea
that
he
was
desirous
of
joining
in
earnest
support
of
the
measure
,
with
a
vehement
protest
against
the
injustice
which
had
been
done
to
the
people
in
general
,
and
to
Mr.
Bunce
in
particular
.
<EOS>
He
had
firmly
resolved
that
no
fear
of
losing
favour
with
the
Government
should
induce
him
to
hold
his
tongue
as
to
the
Buncean
cruelties
.
<EOS>
Sooner
than
do
<EOS>
so
he
would
certainly
"
go
among
them
"
at
the
_
Banner
_
office
.
  
<EOS>
He
started
up
,
wildly
,
when
Mr.
Palliser
had
completed
his
speech
;
but
the
Speaker
's
eye
,
not
unnaturally
,
had
travelled
to
the
other
side
of
the
House
,
and
there
was
a
Tory
of
the
old
school
upon
his
legs
,
 
Mr.
Western
,
the
member
for
East
Barsetshire
,
one
of
the
gallant
few
who
dared
to
vote
against
Sir
Robert
Peel
's
bill
for
repealing
the
Corn
Laws
in
1846
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Western
spoke
with
a
slow
,
ponderous
,
unimpressive
,
but
very
audible
voice
,
for
some
twenty
minutes
,
disdaining
to
make
reference
to
Mr.
Turnbull
and
his
politics
,
but
pleading
against
any
Reform
,
with
all
the
old
arguments
.
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
hear
a
word
that
he
said
;
 
did
not
attempt
to
hear
.
<EOS>
He
was
keen
in
his
resolution
to
make
another
attempt
at
the
Speaker
's
eye
,
and
at
the
present
moment
was
thinking
of
that
,
and
of
that
only
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
even
give
himself
a
moment
's
reflection
as
to
what
his
own
speech
should
be
.
<EOS>
He
would
dash
at
it
and
take
his
chance
,
resolved
that
at
least
he
would
not
fail
in
courage
.
<EOS>
Twice
he
was
on
his
legs
before
Mr.
Western
had
finished
his
slow
harangue
,
and
twice
he
was
compelled
to
reseat
himself
,
 
thinking
that
he
had
subjected
himself
to
ridicule
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
member
for
East
Barset
sat
down
,
and
Phineas
was
conscious
that
he
had
lost
a
moment
or
two
in
presenting
himself
again
to
the
Speaker
.
  
<EOS>
He
held
his
ground
,
however
,
though
he
saw
that
he
had
various
rivals
for
the
right
of
speech
.
<EOS>
He
held
his
ground
,
and
was
instantly
aware
that
he
had
gained
his
point
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
slight
pause
,
and
as
some
other
urgent
member
did
not
reseat
himself
,
Phineas
heard
the
president
of
that
august
assembly
call
upon
himself
to
address
the
House
.
<EOS>
The
thing
was
now
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
There
he
was
with
the
House
of
Commons
at
his
feet
,
 
a
crowded
House
,
bound
to
be
his
auditors
as
long
as
he
should
think
fit
to
address
them
,
and
reporters
by
tens
and
twenties
in
the
gallery
ready
and
eager
to
let
the
country
know
what
the
young
member
for
Loughshane
would
say
in
this
his
maiden
speech
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
had
sundry
gifts
,
a
powerful
and
pleasant
voice
,
which
he
had
learned
to
modulate
,
a
handsome
presence
,
and
a
certain
natural
mixture
of
modesty
and
self
-
reliance
,
which
would
certainly
protect
him
from
the
faults
of
arrogance
and
pomposity
,
and
which
,
perhaps
,
might
carry
him
through
the
perils
of
his
new
position
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
also
the
great
advantage
of
friends
in
the
House
who
were
anxious
that
he
should
do
well
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
that
gift
of
slow
blood
which
on
the
former
occasion
would
have
enabled
him
to
remember
his
prepared
speech
,
and
which
would
now
have
placed
all
his
own
resources
within
his
own
reach
.
<EOS>
He
began
with
the
expression
of
an
opinion
that
every
true
reformer
ought
to
accept
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
,
even
if
it
were
accepted
only
as
an
instalment
,
 
but
before
he
had
got
through
these
sentences
,
he
became
painfully
conscious
that
he
was
repeating
his
own
words
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
cheered
almost
from
the
outset
,
and
yet
he
knew
as
he
went
on
that
he
was
failing
.
<EOS>
He
had
certain
arguments
at
his
fingers
'
ends
,
 
points
with
which
he
was
,
in
truth
,
so
familiar
that
he
need
hardly
have
troubled
himself
to
arrange
them
for
special
use
,
 
and
he
forgot
even
these
.
<EOS>
He
found
that
he
was
going
on
with
one
platitude
after
another
as
to
the
benefit
of
reform
,
in
a
manner
that
would
have
shamed
him
six
or
seven
years
ago
at
a
debating
club
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
on
,
fearing
that
words
would
fail
him
altogether
if
he
paused
;
 
but
he
did
in
truth
speak
very
much
too
fast
,
knocking
his
words
together
so
that
no
reporter
could
properly
catch
them
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
nothing
to
say
for
the
bill
except
what
hundreds
had
said
before
,
and
hundreds
would
say
again
.
<EOS>
Still
he
was
cheered
,
and
still
he
went
on
;
and
as
he
became
more
and
more
conscious
of
his
failure
there
grew
upon
him
the
idea
,
 
the
dangerous
hope
,
that
he
might
still
save
himself
from
ignominy
by
the
eloquence
of
his
invective
against
the
police
.
  
<EOS>
He
tried
it
,
and
succeeded
thoroughly
in
making
the
House
understand
that
he
was
very
angry
,
 
but
he
succeeded
in
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
catch
the
words
to
express
the
thoughts
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
explain
his
idea
that
the
people
out
of
the
House
had
as
much
right
to
express
their
opinion
in
favour
of
the
ballot
as
members
in
the
House
had
to
express
theirs
against
it
;
and
that
animosity
had
been
shown
to
the
people
by
the
authorities
because
they
had
so
expressed
their
opinion
.
<EOS>
Then
he
attempted
to
tell
the
story
of
Mr.
Bunce
in
a
light
and
airy
way
,
failed
,
and
sat
down
in
the
middle
of
it
.
<EOS>
Again
he
was
cheered
by
all
around
him
,
 
cheered
as
a
new
member
is
usually
cheered
,
 
and
in
the
midst
of
the
cheer
would
have
blown
out
his
brains
<EOS>
had
there
been
a
pistol
there
ready
for
such
an
operation
.
  
<EOS>
That
hour
with
him
was
very
bad
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
how
to
get
up
and
go
away
,
or
how
to
keep
his
place
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
he
sat
with
his
hat
off
,
forgetful
of
his
privilege
of
wearing
it
;
and
then
put
it
on
hurriedly
,
as
though
the
fact
of
his
not
wearing
it
must
have
been
observed
by
everybody
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
at
about
two
,
the
debate
was
adjourned
,
and
then
as
he
was
slowly
leaving
the
House
,
thinking
how
he
might
creep
away
without
companionship
,
Mr.
Monk
took
him
by
the
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
walk
?
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
"
,
said
Phineas
;
"
I
shall
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
may
go
together
as
far
as
Pall
Mall
.
<EOS>
Come
along
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
had
no
means
of
escape
,
and
left
the
House
hanging
on
Mr.
Monk
's
arm
,
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
Mr.
Monk
speak
till
they
were
out
in
Palace
Yard
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
much
amiss
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
'll
do
better
than
that
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Monk
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
I
have
made
an
ass
of
myself
so
thoroughly
,
that
there
will
at
any
rate
be
this
good
result
,
that
I
shall
never
make
an
ass
of
myself
again
after
the
same
fashion
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
some
such
feeling
as
that
,
and
therefore
I
was
determined
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
,
Finn
,
that
I
do
not
care
to
flatter
you
,
and
I
think
you
ought
to
know
that
,
as
far
as
I
am
able
,
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Your
speech
,
which
was
certainly
nothing
great
,
was
about
on
a
par
with
other
maiden
speeches
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
yourself
neither
good
nor
harm
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
desirable
that
you
should
.
<EOS>
My
advice
to
you
now
is
,
never
to
avoid
speaking
on
any
subject
that
interests
you
,
but
never
to
speak
for
above
three
minutes
till
you
find
yourself
as
much
at
home
on
your
legs
as
you
are
when
sitting
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
suppose
that
you
have
made
an
ass
of
yourself
,
 
that
is
,
in
any
special
degree
.
<EOS>
Now
,
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Phineas
Discussed
 
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
heard
two
accounts
of
her
friend
's
speech
,
 
and
both
from
men
who
had
been
present
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
was
in
his
place
,
in
accordance
with
his
constant
practice
,
and
Lord
Brentford
had
been
seated
,
perhaps
unfortunately
,
in
the
peers
'
gallery
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
think
it
was
a
failure
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
said
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
was
not
a
success
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
particular
about
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
deal
of
it
you
could
hardly
hear
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
she
got
the
morning
newspapers
,
and
turned
with
great
interest
to
the
report
.
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
had
been
,
as
it
were
,
adopted
by
her
as
her
own
political
offspring
,
 
or
at
any
rate
as
her
political
godchild
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
promises
on
his
behalf
to
various
personages
of
high
political
standing
,
 
to
her
father
,
to
Mr.
Monk
,
to
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
and
even
to
Mr.
Mildmay
himself
.
<EOS>
She
had
thoroughly
intended
that
Phineas
Finn
should
be
a
political
success
from
the
first
;
and
since
her
marriage
,
she
had
,
I
think
,
been
more
intent
upon
it
than
before
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
was
a
feeling
on
her
part
that
having
wronged
him
in
one
way
,
she
would
repay
him
in
another
.
<EOS>
She
had
become
so
eager
for
his
success
,
 
for
a
while
scorning
to
conceal
her
feeling
,
 
that
her
husband
had
unconsciously
begun
to
entertain
a
dislike
to
her
eagerness
.
<EOS>
We
know
how
quickly
women
arrive
at
an
understanding
of
the
feelings
of
those
with
whom
they
live
;
and
now
,
on
that
very
occasion
,
Lady
Laura
perceived
that
her
husband
did
not
take
in
good
part
her
anxiety
on
behalf
of
her
friend
.
<EOS>
She
saw
that
it
was
so
as
she
turned
over
the
newspaper
looking
for
the
report
of
the
speech
.
<EOS>
It
was
given
in
six
lines
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
there
was
an
intimation
,
 
expressed
in
the
shape
of
advice
,
 
that
the
young
orator
had
better
speak
more
slowly
if
he
wished
to
be
efficacious
either
with
the
House
or
with
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
seems
to
have
been
cheered
a
good
deal
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
members
are
cheered
at
their
first
speech
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
doubt
he
'll
do
well
yet
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
to
his
newspaper
,
and
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
it
as
long
as
his
wife
remained
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Later
in
the
day
Lady
Laura
saw
her
father
,
and
Miss
Effingham
was
with
her
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
said
something
which
indicated
that
he
had
heard
the
debate
on
the
previous
evening
,
and
Lady
Laura
instantly
began
to
ask
him
about
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
less
said
the
better
,
"
was
the
Earl
's
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
it
was
so
bad
as
that
?
"
asked
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
very
bad
at
first
;
 
though
indeed
nobody
could
say
it
was
very
good
.
<EOS>
But
he
got
himself
into
a
mess
about
the
police
and
the
magistrates
before
he
had
done
,
and
nothing
but
the
kindly
feeling
always
shown
to
a
first
effort
saved
him
from
being
coughed
down
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
not
a
word
more
to
say
about
Phineas
to
her
father
;
but
,
womanlike
,
she
resolved
that
she
would
not
abandon
him
.
<EOS>
How
many
first
failures
in
the
world
had
been
the
precursors
of
ultimate
success
!
"
<EOS>
Mildmay
will
lose
his
bill
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
sorrowfully
.
<EOS>
"
There
does
not
seem
to
be
a
doubt
about
that
.
"
  
"
And
what
will
you
all
do
?
"
asked
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
go
to
the
country
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
have
a
more
liberal
House
than
you
have
now
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
have
one
less
liberal
,
 
or
rather
less
radical
,
 
with
fewer
men
to
support
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
what
else
we
can
do
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
there
are
no
less
than
twenty
-
seven
men
on
our
side
of
the
House
who
will
either
vote
with
Turnbull
against
us
,
or
will
decline
to
vote
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Every
one
of
them
ought
to
lose
his
seat
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
can
we
do
?
<EOS>
How
is
the
Queen
's
Government
to
be
carried
on
?
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
the
sad
earnestness
which
impressed
itself
on
the
Earl
's
brow
as
he
asked
these
momentous
questions
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
that
Mr.
Turnbull
can
form
a
Ministry
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
Mr.
Daubeny
as
whipper
-
in
,
perhaps
he
might
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
Mr.
Finn
lose
his
seat
?
"
asked
Violet
Effingham
.
"
<EOS>
Most
probably
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
"
<EOS>
He
only
got
it
by
an
accident
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
find
him
a
seat
somewhere
in
England
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
might
be
difficult
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
who
then
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
women
remained
together
for
some
quarter
of
an
hour
before
they
spoke
again
.
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Laura
said
something
about
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
be
a
dissolution
,
I
hope
Oswald
will
stand
for
Loughton
.
<EOS>
"
Loughton
was
a
borough
close
to
Saulsby
,
in
which
,
as
regarded
its
political
interests
,
Lord
Brentford
was
supposed
to
have
considerable
influence
.
<EOS>
To
this
Violet
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
time
,
"
continued
Lady
Laura
,
"
that
old
Mr.
Standish
should
give
way
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
the
seat
for
twenty
-
five
years
,
and
has
never
done
anything
,
and
he
seldom
goes
to
the
House
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
your
uncle
,
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
he
is
papa
's
cousin
;
but
he
is
ever
so
much
older
than
papa
;
 
nearly
eighty
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
not
that
be
just
the
place
for
Mr.
Finn
?
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Laura
became
very
serious
.
<EOS>
"
Oswald
would
of
course
have
a
better
right
to
it
than
anybody
else
.
"
  
"
But
would
Lord
Chiltern
go
into
Parliament
?
<EOS>
I
have
heard
him
declare
that
he
would
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
could
get
papa
to
ask
him
,
I
think
he
would
change
his
mind
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
again
silence
for
a
few
moments
,
after
which
Violet
returned
to
the
original
subject
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
thousand
pities
that
Mr.
Finn
should
be
turned
out
into
the
cold
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
for
one
,
should
be
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
should
I
,
 
and
the
more
so
from
what
Lord
Brentford
says
about
his
not
speaking
well
last
night
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
that
it
is
very
much
of
an
accomplishment
for
a
gentleman
to
speak
well
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
,
I
suppose
,
speaks
well
;
and
they
say
that
that
horrid
man
,
Mr.
Bonteen
,
can
talk
by
the
hour
together
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
that
it
shows
a
man
to
be
clever
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
I
believe
Mr.
Finn
would
do
it
,
if
he
set
his
mind
to
it
,
and
I
shall
think
it
a
great
shame
if
they
turn
him
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
depend
very
much
,
I
suppose
,
on
Lord
Tulla
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
Lord
Tulla
,
"
said
Violet
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
'm
quite
sure
that
he
might
have
Loughton
,
if
we
manage
it
properly
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Lord
Chiltern
should
have
it
if
he
wants
it
,
but
I
do
n't
think
he
will
stand
in
Mr.
Finn
's
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
it
's
out
of
the
question
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Papa
thinks
so
much
about
the
borough
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
reader
will
remember
that
both
Lord
Brentford
and
his
daughter
were
thorough
reformers
!
<EOS>
The
use
of
a
little
borough
of
his
own
,
however
,
is
a
convenience
to
a
great
peer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Those
difficult
things
have
always
to
be
talked
of
for
a
long
while
,
and
then
they
become
easy
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
if
you
were
to
propose
to
Mr.
Kennedy
to
give
all
his
property
to
the
Church
Missionaries
and
emigrate
to
New
Zealand
,
he
'd
begin
to
consider
it
seriously
after
a
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
try
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Because
you
do
n't
want
to
go
to
New
Zealand
;
 
but
you
might
try
about
Loughton
for
poor
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Violet
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
;
 
and
she
spoke
sharply
;
"
Violet
,
I
believe
you
are
in
love
with
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
just
like
you
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
made
such
an
accusation
against
you
before
,
or
against
anybody
else
that
I
can
remember
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
begin
to
believe
that
you
are
in
love
with
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
I
be
in
love
with
him
,
if
I
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
nothing
about
that
;
 
only
he
has
not
got
a
penny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
doubt
whether
you
have
any
reason
for
supposing
that
he
is
in
love
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
my
affair
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
in
love
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
affair
also
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
;
and
if
you
tell
me
to
hold
my
tongue
,
of
course
I
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
If
you
ask
me
whether
I
think
it
a
good
match
,
of
course
I
must
say
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
tell
you
to
hold
your
tongue
,
and
I
do
n't
ask
you
what
you
think
about
the
match
.
<EOS>
You
are
quite
welcome
to
talk
as
much
about
me
as
you
please
;
 
but
as
to
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
,
you
have
no
business
to
think
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
talk
to
anybody
but
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
growing
to
be
quite
indifferent
as
to
what
people
say
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
asked
me
the
other
day
whether
I
was
going
to
throw
myself
away
on
Mr.
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
she
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
you
answer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
her
that
it
was
not
quite
settled
;
but
that
as
I
had
only
spoken
to
him
once
during
the
last
two
years
,
and
then
for
not
more
than
half
a
minute
,
and
as
I
was
n't
sure
whether
I
knew
him
by
sight
,
and
as
I
had
reason
to
suppose
he
did
n't
know
my
name
,
there
might
,
perhaps
,
be
a
delay
of
a
week
or
two
before
the
thing
came
off
.
<EOS>
Then
she
flounced
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
made
her
ask
about
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Somebody
had
been
hoaxing
her
.
<EOS>
I
am
beginning
to
think
that
Augusta
does
it
for
her
private
amusement
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
shall
think
more
highly
of
my
dear
cousin
than
I
have
hitherto
done
.
<EOS>
But
,
Laura
,
as
you
have
made
a
similar
accusation
against
me
,
and
as
I
can
not
get
out
of
it
with
you
as
I
do
with
my
aunt
,
I
must
ask
you
to
hear
my
protestation
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
in
love
with
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
Heaven
help
me
;
 
as
far
as
I
can
tell
,
I
am
not
in
love
with
any
one
,
and
never
shall
be
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
looked
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
"
continued
Violet
,
"
that
I
think
I
could
be
in
love
with
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
,
if
I
could
be
in
love
with
anybody
?
"
Then
Lady
Laura
looked
displeased
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
he
is
a
gentleman
,
"
continued
Violet
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
is
a
man
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
has
not
too
much
spirit
;
 
not
that
kind
of
spirit
which
makes
some
men
think
that
they
are
the
finest
things
going
.
<EOS>
His
manners
are
perfect
;
 
not
Chesterfieldian
,
and
yet
never
offensive
.
<EOS>
He
never
browbeats
any
one
,
and
never
toadies
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
knows
how
to
live
easily
with
men
of
all
ranks
,
without
any
appearance
of
claiming
a
special
status
for
himself
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
made
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
to
-
morrow
,
I
believe
he
would
settle
down
into
the
place
of
the
first
subject
in
the
land
without
arrogance
,
and
without
false
shame
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
his
eulogist
with
a
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
his
eulogist
;
but
I
am
not
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
to
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
to
-
morrow
,
I
should
be
distressed
,
and
should
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
to
marry
my
dearest
friend
in
the
world
,
I
should
tell
him
to
kiss
me
and
be
my
brother
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
,
 
those
are
my
sentiments
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
say
is
very
odd
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
odd
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Simply
because
mine
are
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
they
the
same
?
<EOS>
I
once
thought
,
Laura
,
that
you
did
love
him
;
 
that
you
meant
to
be
his
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
sat
for
a
while
without
making
any
reply
to
this
.
<EOS>
She
sat
with
her
elbow
on
the
table
and
with
her
face
leaning
on
her
hand
,
 
thinking
how
far
it
would
tend
to
her
comfort
if
she
spoke
in
true
confidence
.
<EOS>
Violet
during
the
time
never
took
her
eyes
from
her
friend
's
face
,
but
remained
silent
as
though
waiting
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
very
explicit
as
to
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
Would
Laura
Kennedy
be
equally
explicit
?
<EOS>
She
was
too
clever
to
forget
that
such
plainness
of
speech
would
be
,
must
be
more
difficult
to
Lady
Laura
than
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
was
a
married
woman
;
but
she
felt
that
her
friend
would
have
been
wrong
to
search
for
secrets
,
unless
she
were
ready
to
tell
her
own
.
<EOS>
It
was
probably
some
such
feeling
which
made
Lady
Laura
speak
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
did
,
nearly
 
"
said
Lady
Laura
;
"
very
nearly
.
<EOS>
You
told
me
just
now
that
you
had
money
,
and
could
therefore
do
as
you
pleased
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
money
,
and
could
not
do
as
I
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
told
me
also
that
I
had
no
reason
for
thinking
that
he
cared
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
?
<EOS>
Well
;
 
I
suppose
you
have
no
reason
.
<EOS>
He
did
care
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
did
love
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
told
you
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
he
told
me
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
answer
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
that
very
morning
become
engaged
to
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
That
was
my
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
he
say
when
you
told
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
remember
.
<EOS>
But
he
behaved
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
 
if
he
were
to
love
me
,
you
would
grudge
me
his
love
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
for
that
reason
,
 
not
if
I
know
myself
.
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
so
selfish
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
what
reason
then
?
"
  
"
Because
I
look
upon
it
as
written
in
heaven
that
you
are
to
be
Oswald
's
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
's
writings
then
are
false
,
"
said
Violet
,
getting
up
and
walking
away
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Phineas
was
very
wretched
at
home
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
his
lodgings
after
leaving
the
House
,
 
after
his
short
conversation
with
Mr.
Monk
,
 
he
tried
to
comfort
himself
with
what
that
gentleman
had
said
to
him
.
<EOS>
For
a
while
,
while
he
was
walking
,
there
had
been
some
comfort
in
Mr.
Monk
's
words
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
had
much
experience
,
and
doubtless
knew
what
he
was
saying
,
 
and
there
might
yet
be
hope
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
hope
faded
away
when
Phineas
was
in
his
own
rooms
.
<EOS>
There
came
upon
him
,
as
he
looked
round
them
,
an
idea
that
he
had
no
business
to
be
in
Parliament
,
that
he
was
an
impostor
,
that
he
was
going
about
the
world
under
false
pretences
,
and
that
he
would
never
set
himself
aright
,
even
unto
himself
,
till
he
had
gone
through
some
terrible
act
of
humiliation
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
cheat
even
to
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
of
the
_
Banner
_
,
in
accepting
an
invitation
to
come
among
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
cheat
to
Lady
Laura
,
in
that
he
had
induced
her
to
think
that
he
was
fit
to
live
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
cheat
to
Violet
Effingham
,
in
assuming
that
he
was
capable
of
making
himself
agreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
cheat
to
Lord
Chiltern
when
riding
his
horses
,
and
pretending
to
be
a
proper
associate
for
a
man
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
Why
,
 
what
was
his
income
?
<EOS>
What
his
birth
?
<EOS>
What
his
proper
position
?
<EOS>
And
now
he
had
got
the
reward
which
all
cheats
deserve
.
<EOS>
Then
he
went
to
bed
,
and
as
he
lay
there
,
he
thought
of
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
Had
he
plighted
his
troth
to
Mary
,
and
then
worked
like
a
slave
under
Mr.
Low
's
auspices
,
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
have
been
a
cheat
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
hardly
been
asleep
when
the
girl
came
into
his
room
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
she
,
"
there
's
that
gentleman
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
gentleman
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
knew
that
Mr.
Clarkson
was
in
his
sitting
-
room
,
and
that
he
would
not
leave
it
till
he
had
seen
the
owner
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
 
Phineas
was
pretty
sure
that
Mr.
Clarkson
would
come
into
the
bedroom
,
if
he
were
kept
long
waiting
.
<EOS>
"
Damn
the
old
gentleman
,
"
said
Phineas
in
his
wrath
;
 
and
the
maid
-
servant
heard
him
say
so
.
  
<EOS>
In
about
twenty
minutes
he
went
out
into
the
sitting
-
room
,
with
his
slippers
on
and
in
his
dressing
-
gown
.
<EOS>
Suffering
under
the
circumstances
of
such
an
emergency
,
how
is
any
man
to
go
through
the
work
of
dressing
and
washing
with
proper
exactness
?
<EOS>
As
to
the
prayers
which
he
said
on
that
morning
,
I
think
that
no
question
should
be
asked
.
<EOS>
He
came
out
with
a
black
cloud
on
his
brow
,
and
with
his
mind
half
made
up
to
kick
Mr.
Clarkson
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
,
when
he
saw
him
,
moved
his
chin
round
within
his
white
cravat
,
as
was
a
custom
with
him
,
and
put
his
thumb
and
forefinger
on
his
lips
,
and
then
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
bad
,
Mr.
Finn
;
very
bad
indeed
;
very
bad
,
ai
n't
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
coming
here
in
this
way
at
all
times
in
the
day
is
very
bad
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
would
you
have
me
go
?
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
see
me
down
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
Mr.
Clarkson
,
I
do
n't
want
to
see
you
anywhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
yes
;
I
daresay
!
<EOS>
And
that
's
what
you
call
honest
,
being
a
Parliament
gent
!
<EOS>
You
had
my
money
,
and
then
you
tell
me
you
do
n't
want
to
see
me
any
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
had
your
money
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
let
me
tell
you
,
"
continued
Mr.
Clarkson
,
"
that
I
want
to
see
you
;
 
and
shall
go
on
seeing
you
till
the
money
is
paid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
not
had
any
of
your
money
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
again
twitched
his
chin
about
on
the
top
of
his
cravat
and
smiled
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
he
,
showing
the
bill
,
"
is
that
your
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
want
my
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
money
to
give
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
be
punctual
now
.
<EOS>
Why
ai
n't
you
punctual
?
<EOS>
I
'd
do
anything
for
you
if
you
were
punctual
.
<EOS>
I
would
indeed
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
,
as
he
said
this
,
sat
down
in
the
chair
which
had
been
placed
for
our
hero
's
breakfast
,
and
cutting
a
slice
off
the
loaf
,
began
to
butter
it
with
great
composure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Clarkson
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
I
can
not
ask
you
to
breakfast
here
.
<EOS>
I
am
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
just
take
a
bit
of
bread
and
butter
all
the
same
,
"
said
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
get
your
butter
?
<EOS>
Now
I
could
tell
you
a
woman
who
'd
give
it
you
cheaper
and
a
deal
better
than
this
.
<EOS>
This
is
all
lard
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
her
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
tea
ready
,
and
therefore
Mr.
Clarkson
emptied
the
milk
into
a
cup
and
drank
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
this
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
I
must
beg
,
Mr.
Clarkson
,
that
you
will
never
come
to
my
room
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
at
home
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
lobby
of
the
House
is
the
same
thing
to
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
They
know
me
there
well
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
'd
be
punctual
,
and
then
we
'd
be
the
best
of
friends
.
<EOS>
"
After
that
Mr.
Clarkson
,
having
finished
his
bread
and
butter
,
took
his
leave
.
   
<EOS>
The
Second
Reading
Is
Carried
 
<EOS>
The
debate
on
the
bill
was
prolonged
during
the
whole
of
that
week
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
,
who
loved
his
seat
in
the
Cabinet
and
the
glory
of
being
a
Minister
,
better
even
than
he
loved
his
borough
,
had
taken
a
gloomy
estimate
when
he
spoke
of
twenty
-
seven
defaulters
,
and
of
the
bill
as
certainly
lost
.
<EOS>
Men
who
were
better
able
than
he
to
make
estimates
,
 
the
Bonteens
and
Fitzgibbons
on
each
side
of
the
House
,
and
above
all
,
the
Ratlers
and
Robys
,
produced
lists
from
day
to
day
which
varied
now
by
three
names
in
one
direction
,
then
by
two
in
another
,
and
which
fluctuated
at
last
by
units
only
.
<EOS>
They
all
concurred
in
declaring
that
it
would
be
a
very
near
division
.
<EOS>
A
great
effort
was
made
to
close
the
debate
on
the
Friday
,
but
it
failed
,
and
the
full
tide
of
speech
was
carried
on
till
the
following
Monday
.
<EOS>
On
that
morning
Phineas
heard
Mr.
Ratler
declare
at
the
club
that
,
as
far
as
his
judgment
went
,
the
division
at
that
moment
was
a
fair
subject
for
a
bet
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
two
men
doubtful
in
the
House
,
"
said
Ratler
,
"
and
if
one
votes
on
one
side
and
one
on
the
other
,
or
if
neither
votes
at
all
,
it
will
be
a
tie
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Roby
,
however
,
the
whip
on
the
other
side
,
was
quite
sure
that
one
at
least
of
these
gentlemen
would
go
into
his
lobby
,
and
that
the
other
would
not
go
into
Mr.
Ratler
's
lobby
.
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
town
was
generally
inclined
to
put
more
confidence
in
the
accuracy
of
Mr.
Roby
than
in
that
of
Mr.
Ratler
;
and
among
betting
men
there
certainly
was
a
point
given
by
those
who
backed
the
Conservatives
.
<EOS>
The
odds
,
however
,
were
lost
,
for
on
the
division
the
numbers
in
the
two
lobbies
were
equal
,
and
the
Speaker
gave
his
casting
vote
in
favour
of
the
Government
.
<EOS>
The
bill
was
read
a
second
time
,
and
was
lost
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
in
reference
to
any
subsequent
action
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Roby
declared
that
even
Mr.
Mildmay
could
not
go
on
with
nothing
but
the
Speaker
's
vote
to
support
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
had
no
doubt
felt
that
he
could
not
go
on
with
his
bill
from
the
moment
in
which
Mr.
Turnbull
had
declared
his
opposition
;
but
he
could
not
with
propriety
withdraw
it
in
deference
to
Mr.
Turnbull
's
opinion
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
week
Phineas
had
had
his
hands
sufficiently
full
.
<EOS>
Twice
he
had
gone
to
the
potted
peas
inquiry
;
but
he
had
been
at
the
office
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
more
often
than
that
.
<EOS>
Bunce
had
been
very
resolute
in
his
determination
to
bring
an
action
against
the
police
for
false
imprisonment
,
even
though
he
spent
every
shilling
of
his
savings
in
doing
so
.
<EOS>
And
when
his
wife
,
in
the
presence
of
Phineas
,
begged
that
bygones
might
be
bygones
,
reminding
him
that
spilt
milk
could
not
be
recovered
,
he
called
her
a
mean
-
spirited
woman
.
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Bunce
wept
a
flood
of
tears
,
and
told
her
favourite
lodger
that
for
her
all
comfort
in
this
world
was
over
.
"
<EOS>
Drat
the
reformers
<EOS>
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
And
I
wish
there
was
no
Parliament
;
so
I
do
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
all
the
voting
,
when
it
means
nothing
but
dry
bread
and
cross
words
?
<EOS>
"
Phineas
by
no
means
encouraged
his
landlord
in
his
litigious
spirit
,
advising
him
rather
to
keep
his
money
in
his
pocket
,
and
leave
the
fighting
of
the
battle
to
the
columns
of
the
_
Banner
_
,
 
which
would
fight
it
,
at
any
rate
,
with
economy
.
<EOS>
But
Bunce
,
though
he
delighted
in
the
_
Banner
_
,
and
showed
an
unfortunate
readiness
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
,
would
have
his
action
at
law
;
 
in
which
resolution
Mr.
Slide
did
,
I
fear
,
encourage
him
behind
the
back
of
his
better
friend
,
Phineas
Finn
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
went
with
Bunce
to
Mr.
Low
's
chambers
,
 
for
Mr.
Low
had
in
some
way
become
acquainted
with
the
law
-
stationer
's
journeyman
,
 
and
there
some
very
good
advice
was
given
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
asked
yourself
what
is
your
object
,
Mr.
Bunce
?
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunce
declared
he
had
asked
himself
that
question
,
and
had
answered
it
.
<EOS>
His
object
was
redress
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
shape
of
compensation
to
yourself
,
"
suggested
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
No
;
Mr.
Bunce
would
not
admit
that
he
personally
required
any
compensation
.
<EOS>
The
redress
wanted
was
punishment
to
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
for
vengeance
?
"
asked
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
No
;
it
was
not
for
vengeance
,
Mr.
Bunce
declared
.
<EOS>
"
It
ought
not
to
be
,
"
continued
Mr.
Low
;
"
because
,
though
you
think
that
the
man
exceeded
in
his
duty
,
you
must
feel
that
he
was
doing
so
through
no
personal
ill
-
will
to
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
want
is
,
to
have
the
fellows
kept
in
their
proper
places
,
"
said
Mr.
Bunce
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
;
 
and
therefore
these
things
,
when
they
occur
,
are
mentioned
in
the
press
and
in
Parliament
,
 
and
<EOS>
the
attention
of
a
Secretary
of
State
is
called
to
them
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
we
do
n't
have
very
much
of
that
kind
of
thing
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maybe
we
shall
have
more
if
we
do
n't
look
to
it
,
"
said
Bunce
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
always
are
looking
to
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
;
 
"
looking
to
it
very
carefully
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
think
anything
is
to
be
done
in
that
way
by
indictment
against
a
single
man
,
whose
conduct
has
been
already
approved
by
the
magistrates
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
notoriety
,
Mr.
Bunce
,
and
do
n't
mind
what
you
pay
for
it
;
or
have
got
anybody
else
to
pay
for
it
;
then
indeed
 
"
  
"
There
ai
n't
nobody
to
pay
for
it
,
"
said
Bunce
,
waxing
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
certainly
should
not
pay
for
it
myself
if
I
were
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
But
Bunce
was
not
to
be
counselled
out
of
his
intention
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
out
in
the
square
with
Phineas
he
expressed
great
anger
against
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
He
do
n't
know
what
patriotism
means
,
"
said
the
law
scrivener
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
talks
to
me
about
notoriety
!
<EOS>
It
has
always
been
the
same
way
with
'em
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
shows
a
spark
of
public
feeling
,
it
's
all
hambition
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
no
notoriety
.
<EOS>
I
wants
to
earn
my
bread
peaceable
,
and
to
be
let
alone
when
I
'm
about
my
own
business
.
<EOS>
I
pays
rates
for
the
police
to
look
after
rogues
,
not
to
haul
folks
about
and
lock
'em
up
for
days
and
nights
,
who
is
doing
what
they
has
a
legal
right
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
After
that
,
Bunce
went
to
his
attorney
,
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
business
at
the
stationer
's
shop
,
and
Phineas
visited
the
office
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
<EOS>
There
he
wrote
a
leading
article
about
Bunce
's
case
,
for
which
he
was
in
due
time
to
be
paid
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
might
do
more
for
him
in
this
way
than
ever
would
be
done
by
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slide
,
however
,
and
another
gentleman
at
the
_
Banner
_
office
,
much
older
than
Mr.
Slide
,
who
announced
himself
as
the
actual
editor
,
were
anxious
that
Phineas
should
rid
himself
of
his
heterodox
political
resolutions
about
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
they
cared
much
about
his
own
opinions
;
and
when
Phineas
attempted
to
argue
with
the
editor
on
the
merits
of
the
ballot
,
the
editor
put
him
down
very
shortly
.
<EOS>
"
We
go
in
for
it
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Finn
would
go
in
for
it
too
,
the
editor
seemed
to
think
that
Mr.
Finn
might
make
himself
very
useful
at
the
_
Banner
_
Office
.
<EOS>
Phineas
stoutly
maintained
that
this
was
impossible
,
 
and
was
therefore
driven
to
confine
his
articles
in
the
service
of
the
people
to
those
open
subjects
on
which
his
opinions
agreed
with
those
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
second
article
,
and
the
editor
seemed
to
think
that
,
backward
as
he
was
about
the
ballot
,
he
was
too
useful
an
aid
to
be
thrown
aside
.
<EOS>
A
member
of
Parliament
is
not
now
all
that
he
was
once
,
but
still
there
is
a
prestige
in
the
letters
affixed
to
his
name
which
makes
him
loom
larger
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
than
other
men
.
<EOS>
Get
into
Parliament
,
if
it
be
but
for
the
borough
of
Loughshane
,
and
the
_
People
's
Banners
<EOS>
_
all
round
will
be
glad
of
your
assistance
,
as
will
also
companies
limited
and
unlimited
to
a
very
marvellous
extent
.
<EOS>
Phineas
wrote
his
article
and
promised
to
look
in
again
,
and
so
they
went
on
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
continued
to
assure
him
that
a
"
horgan
"
was
indispensable
to
him
,
and
Phineas
began
to
accommodate
his
ears
to
the
sound
which
had
at
first
been
so
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
He
found
that
his
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Slide
,
had
ideas
of
his
own
as
to
getting
into
the
'
ouse
at
some
future
time
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
look
upon
the
'
ouse
as
my
oyster
,
and
'
ere
's
my
sword
,
"
said
Mr.
Slide
,
brandishing
an
old
quill
pen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
feel
that
if
once
there
I
could
get
along
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
a
man
wants
?
<EOS>
It
's
only
pluck
,
 
that
he
should
n't
funk
because
a
"
undred
other
men
are
looking
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
asked
him
whether
he
had
any
idea
of
a
constituency
,
to
which
Mr.
Slide
replied
that
he
had
no
absolutely
formed
intention
.
<EOS>
Many
boroughs
,
however
,
would
doubtless
be
set
free
from
aristocratic
influence
by
the
redistribution
of
seats
which
must
take
place
,
as
Mr.
Slide
declared
,
at
any
rate
in
the
next
session
.
<EOS>
Then
he
named
the
borough
of
Loughton
;
and
Phineas
Finn
,
thinking
of
Saulsby
,
thinking
of
the
Earl
,
thinking
of
Lady
Laura
,
and
thinking
of
Violet
,
walked
away
disgusted
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
better
that
the
quiet
town
,
clustering
close
round
the
walls
of
Saulsby
,
should
remain
as
it
was
,
than
that
it
should
be
polluted
by
the
presence
of
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
?
  
<EOS>
On
the
last
day
of
the
debate
,
at
a
few
moments
before
four
o'clock
,
Phineas
encountered
another
terrible
misfortune
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
at
the
potted
peas
since
twelve
,
and
had
on
this
occasion
targed
two
or
three
commissariat
officers
very
tightly
with
questions
respecting
cabbages
and
potatoes
,
and
had
asked
whether
the
officers
on
board
a
certain
ship
did
not
always
eat
preserved
asparagus
while
the
men
had
not
even
a
bean
.
<EOS>
I
fear
that
he
had
been
put
up
to
this
business
by
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
,
and
that
he
made
himself
nasty
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
so
much
nastiness
of
the
kind
going
,
that
his
little
effort
made
no
great
difference
.
<EOS>
The
conservative
members
of
the
Committee
,
on
whose
side
of
the
House
the
inquiry
had
originated
,
did
not
scruple
to
lay
all
manner
of
charges
to
officers
whom
,
were
they
themselves
in
power
,
they
would
be
bound
to
support
and
would
support
with
all
their
energies
.
<EOS>
About
a
quarter
before
four
the
members
of
the
Committee
had
dismissed
their
last
witness
for
the
day
,
being
desirous
of
not
losing
their
chance
of
seats
on
so
important
an
occasion
,
and
hurried
down
into
the
lobby
,
 
so
that
they
might
enter
the
House
before
prayers
.
<EOS>
Phineas
here
was
button
-
holed
by
Barrington
Erle
,
who
said
something
to
him
as
to
the
approaching
division
.
<EOS>
They
were
standing
in
front
of
the
door
of
the
House
,
almost
in
the
middle
of
the
lobby
,
with
a
crowd
of
members
around
them
,
 
on
a
spot
which
,
as
frequenters
know
,
is
hallowed
ground
,
and
must
not
be
trodden
by
strangers
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
act
of
answering
Erle
,
when
he
was
touched
on
the
arm
,
and
on
turning
round
,
saw
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
"
About
that
little
bill
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
the
horrible
man
,
turning
his
chin
round
over
his
white
cravat
.
<EOS>
"
They
always
tell
me
at
your
lodgings
that
you
ai
n't
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
this
time
a
policeman
was
explaining
to
Mr.
Clarkson
with
gentle
violence
that
he
must
not
stand
there
,
 
that
he
must
go
aside
into
one
of
the
corners
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Clarkson
,
retreating
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
a
man
to
do
when
a
gent
wo
n't
see
him
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
stood
aside
in
his
corner
quietly
,
giving
the
policeman
no
occasion
for
further
action
against
him
;
but
in
retreating
he
spoke
loud
,
and
there
was
a
lull
of
voices
around
,
and
twenty
members
at
least
had
heard
what
had
been
said
.
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
no
doubt
had
his
privilege
,
but
Mr.
Clarkson
was
determined
that
the
privilege
should
avail
him
as
little
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
hard
.
<EOS>
The
real
offender
,
the
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
the
peer
's
son
,
with
a
thousand
a
year
paid
by
the
country
was
not
treated
with
this
cruel
persecution
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
in
truth
never
taken
a
farthing
from
any
one
but
his
father
;
and
though
doubtless
he
owed
something
at
this
moment
,
he
had
no
creditor
of
his
own
that
was
even
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
As
the
world
goes
he
was
a
clear
man
,
 
but
for
this
debt
of
his
friend
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
He
left
Barrington
Erle
in
the
lobby
,
and
hurried
into
the
House
,
blushing
up
to
the
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
looked
for
Fitzgibbon
in
his
place
,
but
the
Lord
of
the
Treasury
was
not
as
yet
there
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
he
would
be
there
for
the
division
,
and
Phineas
resolved
that
he
would
speak
a
bit
of
his
mind
before
he
let
his
friend
out
of
his
sight
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
some
great
speeches
made
on
that
evening
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
delivered
an
oration
of
which
men
said
that
it
would
be
known
in
England
as
long
as
there
were
any
words
remaining
of
English
eloquence
.
<EOS>
In
it
he
taunted
Mr.
Turnbull
with
being
a
recreant
to
the
people
,
of
whom
he
called
himself
so
often
the
champion
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Turnbull
was
not
in
the
least
moved
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
knew
well
enough
that
Mr.
Turnbull
was
not
to
be
moved
by
any
words
;
 
but
the
words
were
not
the
less
telling
to
the
House
and
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
Men
,
who
heard
it
,
said
that
Mr.
Gresham
forgot
himself
in
that
speech
,
forgot
his
party
,
forgot
his
strategy
,
forgot
his
long
-
drawn
schemes
,
 
even
his
love
of
applause
,
and
thought
only
of
his
cause
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
replied
to
him
with
equal
genius
,
and
with
equal
skill
,
 
if
not
with
equal
heart
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
had
asked
for
the
approbation
of
all
present
and
of
all
future
reformers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
denied
him
both
,
 
the
one
because
he
would
not
succeed
,
and
the
other
because
he
would
not
have
deserved
success
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Mildmay
made
his
reply
,
getting
up
at
about
three
o'clock
,
and
uttered
a
prayer
,
 
a
futile
prayer
,
 
that
this
his
last
work
on
behalf
of
his
countrymen
might
be
successful
.
<EOS>
His
bill
was
read
a
second
time
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
in
obedience
to
the
casting
vote
of
the
Speaker
,
 
but
a
majority
such
as
that
was
tantamount
to
a
defeat
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
,
of
course
,
on
that
night
no
declaration
as
to
what
ministers
would
do
.
<EOS>
Without
a
meeting
of
the
Cabinet
,
and
without
some
further
consideration
,
though
each
might
know
that
the
bill
would
be
withdrawn
,
they
could
not
say
in
what
way
they
would
act
.
<EOS>
But
late
as
was
the
hour
,
there
were
many
words
on
the
subject
before
members
were
in
their
beds
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
and
Mr.
Monk
left
the
House
together
,
and
perhaps
no
two
gentlemen
in
it
had
in
former
sessions
been
more
in
the
habit
of
walking
home
arm
-
in
-
arm
and
discussing
what
each
had
heard
and
what
each
had
said
in
that
assembly
.
<EOS>
Latterly
these
two
men
had
gone
strangely
asunder
in
their
paths
,
 
very
strangely
for
men
who
had
for
years
walked
so
closely
together
.
<EOS>
And
this
separation
had
been
marked
by
violent
words
spoken
against
each
other
,
 
by
violent
words
,
at
least
,
spoken
against
him
in
office
by
the
one
who
had
never
contaminated
his
hands
by
the
Queen
's
shilling
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
,
they
were
able
to
walk
away
from
the
House
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
and
did
not
fly
at
each
other
's
throat
by
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Singular
enough
,
is
it
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
,
"
that
the
thing
should
have
been
so
close
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
odd
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
;
"
but
men
have
said
that
it
would
be
so
all
the
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gresham
was
very
fine
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
fine
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
never
have
heard
anything
like
it
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Daubeny
was
very
powerful
too
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
The
occasion
was
great
,
and
he
answered
to
the
spur
.
<EOS>
But
Gresham
's
was
the
speech
of
the
debate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
;
 
yes
;
perhaps
it
was
,
"
said
Mr.
Turnbull
,
who
was
thinking
of
his
own
flight
the
other
night
,
and
who
among
his
special
friends
had
been
much
praised
for
what
he
had
then
done
.
<EOS>
But
of
course
he
made
no
allusion
to
his
own
doings
,
 
or
to
those
of
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
conversed
for
some
twenty
minutes
,
till
they
parted
;
but
neither
of
them
interrogated
the
other
as
to
what
either
might
be
called
upon
to
do
in
consequence
of
the
division
which
had
just
been
effected
.
<EOS>
They
might
still
be
intimate
friends
,
but
the
days
of
confidence
between
them
were
passed
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
seen
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
enter
the
House
,
 
which
he
did
quite
late
in
the
night
,
so
as
to
be
in
time
for
the
division
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
had
dined
in
the
House
,
and
had
been
all
the
evening
in
the
library
,
 
or
in
the
smoking
-
room
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Mildmay
was
on
his
legs
making
his
reply
,
Fitzgibbon
had
sauntered
in
,
not
choosing
to
wait
till
he
might
be
rung
up
by
the
bell
at
the
last
moment
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
near
him
as
they
passed
by
the
tellers
,
near
him
in
the
lobby
,
and
near
him
again
as
they
all
passed
back
into
the
House
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
last
moment
he
thought
that
he
would
miss
his
prey
.
<EOS>
In
the
crowd
as
they
left
the
House
he
failed
to
get
his
hand
upon
his
friend
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
But
he
hurried
down
the
members
'
passage
,
and
just
at
the
gate
leading
out
into
Westminster
Hall
he
overtook
Fitzgibbon
walking
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Barrington
Erle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Laurence
,
"
he
said
,
taking
hold
of
his
countryman
's
arm
with
a
decided
grasp
,
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Speak
away
,
"
said
Laurence
.
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
,
looking
up
into
his
face
,
knew
very
well
that
he
had
been
 
what
the
world
calls
,
dining
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
remembered
at
the
moment
that
Barrington
Erle
had
been
close
to
him
when
the
odious
money
-
lender
had
touched
his
arm
and
made
his
inquiry
about
that
"
little
bill
.
"
<EOS>
He
much
wished
to
make
Erle
understand
that
the
debt
was
not
his
own
,
 
that
he
was
not
in
the
hands
of
usurers
in
reference
to
his
own
concerns
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
feeling
within
him
that
he
still
,
 
even
still
,
 
owed
something
to
his
friendship
to
Fitzgibbon
.
"
<EOS>
Just
give
me
your
arm
,
and
come
on
with
me
for
a
minute
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
Erle
will
excuse
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
blazes
!
<EOS>
"
said
Laurence
,
"
what
is
it
<EOS>
you
're
after
?
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
good
at
private
conferences
at
three
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
We
're
all
out
,
and
is
n't
that
enough
for
ye
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
dreadfully
annoyed
to
-
night
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
I
wished
to
speak
to
you
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bedad
,
Finn
,
my
boy
,
and
there
are
a
good
many
of
us
<EOS>
are
annoyed
;
 
eh
,
Barrington
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
perceived
clearly
that
though
Fitzgibbon
had
been
dining
,
there
was
as
much
of
cunning
in
all
this
as
of
wine
,
and
he
was
determined
not
to
submit
to
such
unlimited
ill
-
usage
.
<EOS>
"
My
annoyance
comes
from
your
friend
,
Mr.
Clarkson
,
who
had
the
impudence
to
address
me
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
serve
you
right
,
too
,
Finn
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
Why
the
devil
did
you
sport
your
oak
to
him
?
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
There
ai
n't
such
a
patient
little
fellow
as
Clarkson
anywhere
,
if
you
'll
only
let
him
have
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
He
'll
look
in
,
as
he
calls
it
,
three
times
a
week
for
a
whole
season
,
and
do
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
do
n't
like
to
be
locked
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
gentleman
with
whom
the
police
interfered
in
the
lobby
?
"
<EOS>
Erle
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
confounded
bill
discounter
to
whom
our
friend
here
has
introduced
me
,
 
for
his
own
purposes
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
gentleman
-
like
fellow
,
"
said
Laurence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Barrington
knows
him
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Finn
,
my
boy
,
take
my
advice
.
<EOS>
Ask
him
to
breakfast
,
and
let
him
understand
that
the
house
will
always
be
open
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
After
this
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
and
Barrington
Erle
got
into
a
cab
together
,
and
were
driven
away
.
   
<EOS>
A
Cabinet
Meeting
 
<EOS>
And
now
will
the
Muses
assist
me
while
I
sing
an
altogether
new
song
?
<EOS>
On
the
Tuesday
the
Cabinet
met
at
the
First
Lord
's
official
residence
in
Downing
Street
,
and
I
will
attempt
to
describe
what
,
according
to
the
bewildered
brain
of
a
poor
fictionist
,
was
said
or
might
have
been
said
,
what
was
done
or
might
have
been
done
,
on
so
august
an
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
fictionist
very
frequently
finds
himself
to
have
been
wrong
in
his
description
of
things
in
general
,
and
is
told
so
,
roughly
by
the
critics
,
and
tenderly
by
the
friends
of
his
bosom
.
<EOS>
He
is
moved
to
tell
of
things
of
which
he
omits
to
learn
the
nature
before
he
tells
of
them
 
as
should
be
done
by
a
strictly
honest
fictionist
.
<EOS>
He
catches
salmon
in
October
;
or
shoots
his
partridges
in
March
.
<EOS>
His
dahlias
bloom
in
June
,
and
his
birds
sing
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
He
opens
the
opera
-
houses
before
Easter
,
and
makes
Parliament
sit
on
a
Wednesday
evening
.
<EOS>
And
then
those
terrible
meshes
of
the
Law
!
<EOS>
How
is
a
fictionist
,
in
these
excited
days
,
to
create
the
needed
biting
interest
without
legal
difficulties
;
and
how
again
is
he
to
steer
his
little
bark
clear
of
so
many
rocks
,
 
when
the
rocks
and
the
shoals
have
been
purposely
arranged
to
make
the
taking
of
a
pilot
on
board
a
necessity
?
<EOS>
As
to
those
law
meshes
,
a
benevolent
pilot
will
,
indeed
,
now
and
again
give
a
poor
fictionist
a
helping
hand
,
 
not
used
,
however
,
generally
,
with
much
discretion
.
<EOS>
But
from
whom
is
any
assistance
to
come
in
the
august
matter
of
a
Cabinet
assembly
?
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
such
assistance
.
<EOS>
No
man
can
tell
aught
but
they
who
will
tell
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
again
,
there
is
this
safety
<EOS>
,
that
let
the
story
be
ever
so
mistold
,
 
let
the
fiction
be
ever
so
far
removed
from
the
truth
,
no
critic
short
of
a
Cabinet
Minister
himself
can
convict
the
narrator
of
error
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
dingy
room
,
covered
with
a
Turkey
carpet
,
and
containing
a
dark
polished
mahogany
dinner
-
table
,
on
very
heavy
carved
legs
,
which
an
old
messenger
was
preparing
at
two
o'clock
in
the
day
for
the
use
of
her
Majesty
's
Ministers
.
<EOS>
The
table
would
have
been
large
enough
for
fourteen
guests
,
and
along
the
side
further
from
the
fire
,
there
were
placed
some
six
heavy
chairs
,
good
comfortable
chairs
,
stuffed
at
the
back
as
well
as
the
seat
,
 
but
on
the
side
nearer
to
the
fire
the
chairs
were
placed
irregularly
;
and
there
were
four
armchairs
,
 
two
on
one
side
and
two
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
There
were
four
windows
to
the
room
,
which
looked
on
to
St.
James
's
Park
,
and
the
curtains
of
the
windows
were
dark
and
heavy
,
 
as
became
the
gravity
of
the
purposes
to
which
that
chamber
was
appropriated
.
<EOS>
In
old
days
it
had
been
the
dining
-
room
of
one
Prime
Minister
after
another
.
<EOS>
To
Pitt
it
had
been
the
abode
of
his
own
familiar
prandial
Penates
,
and
Lord
Liverpool
had
been
dull
there
among
his
dull
friends
for
long
year
after
year
.
<EOS>
The
Ministers
of
the
present
day
find
it
more
convenient
to
live
in
private
homes
,
and
,
indeed
,
not
unfrequently
carry
their
Cabinets
with
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
under
Mr.
Mildmay
's
rule
,
the
meetings
were
generally
held
in
the
old
room
at
the
official
residence
.
<EOS>
Thrice
did
the
aged
messenger
move
each
armchair
,
now
a
little
this
way
<EOS>
and
now
a
little
that
,
and
then
look
at
them
as
though
something
of
the
tendency
of
the
coming
meeting
might
depend
on
the
comfort
of
its
leading
members
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Mildmay
should
find
himself
to
be
quite
comfortable
,
so
that
he
could
hear
what
was
said
without
a
struggle
to
his
ear
,
and
see
his
colleagues
'
faces
clearly
,
and
feel
the
fire
without
burning
his
shins
,
it
might
be
possible
that
he
would
not
insist
upon
resigning
.
<EOS>
If
this
were
so
,
how
important
was
the
work
now
confided
to
the
hands
of
that
aged
messenger
!
<EOS>
When
his
anxious
eyes
had
glanced
round
the
room
<EOS>
some
half
a
dozen
times
,
when
he
had
touched
each
curtain
,
laid
his
hand
upon
every
chair
,
and
dusted
certain
papers
which
lay
upon
a
side
-
table
,
 
and
which
had
been
lying
there
for
two
years
,
and
at
which
no
one
ever
looked
or
would
look
,
 
he
gently
crept
away
and
ensconced
himself
in
an
easy
chair
not
far
from
the
door
of
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
For
it
might
be
necessary
to
stop
the
attempt
of
a
rash
intruder
on
those
secret
counsels
.
  
<EOS>
Very
shortly
there
was
heard
the
ring
of
various
voices
in
the
passages
,
 
the
voices
of
men
speaking
pleasantly
,
the
voices
of
men
with
whom
it
seemed
,
from
their
tone
,
that
things
were
doing
well
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
And
then
a
cluster
of
four
or
five
gentlemen
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
At
first
sight
they
seemed
to
be
as
ordinary
gentlemen
as
you
shall
meet
anywhere
about
Pall
Mall
on
an
afternoon
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
about
their
outward
appearance
of
the
august
wiggery
of
statecraft
,
nothing
of
the
ponderous
dignity
of
ministerial
position
.
<EOS>
That
little
man
in
the
square
-
cut
coat
,
 
<EOS>
we
may
almost
call
it
a
shooting
-
coat
,
 
swinging
an
umbrella
and
wearing
no
gloves
,
is
no
less
a
person
than
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
 
Lord
Weazeling
,
 
who
made
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
as
Attorney
-
General
,
and
is
supposed
to
be
the
best
lawyer
of
his
age
.
<EOS>
He
is
fifty
,
but
he
looks
to
be
hardly
over
forty
,
and
one
might
take
him
to
be
,
from
his
appearance
,
 
perhaps
a
clerk
in
the
War
Office
,
well
-
to
-
do
,
and
popular
among
his
brother
-
clerks
.
<EOS>
Immediately
with
him
is
Sir
Harry
Coldfoot
,
also
a
lawyer
by
profession
,
though
he
has
never
practised
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
in
the
House
for
nearly
thirty
years
,
and
is
now
at
the
Home
Office
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
stout
,
healthy
,
grey
-
haired
gentleman
,
who
certainly
does
not
wear
the
cares
of
office
on
his
face
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
however
,
no
minister
gets
more
bullied
than
he
by
the
press
,
and
men
say
that
he
will
be
very
willing
to
give
up
to
some
political
enemy
the
control
of
the
police
,
and
the
onerous
duty
of
judging
in
all
criminal
appeals
.
<EOS>
Behind
these
come
our
friend
Mr.
Monk
,
young
Lord
Cantrip
from
the
colonies
next
door
,
than
whom
no
smarter
young
peer
now
does
honour
to
our
hereditary
legislature
,
and
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
,
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
of
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Why
Sir
Marmaduke
has
always
been
placed
in
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Cabinets
nobody
ever
knew
.
<EOS>
As
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
he
has
nothing
to
do
,
 
and
were
there
anything
,
he
would
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
He
rarely
speaks
in
the
House
,
and
then
does
not
speak
well
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
handsome
man
,
or
would
be
but
for
an
assumption
of
grandeur
in
the
carriage
of
his
eyes
,
giving
to
his
face
a
character
of
pomposity
which
he
himself
well
deserves
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
Guards
when
young
,
and
has
been
in
Parliament
since
he
ceased
to
be
young
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
supposed
that
Mr.
Mildmay
has
found
something
in
him
,
for
he
has
been
included
in
three
successive
liberal
Cabinets
.
<EOS>
He
has
probably
the
virtue
of
being
true
to
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
of
being
duly
submissive
to
one
whom
he
recognises
as
his
superior
.
  
<EOS>
Within
two
minutes
afterwards
the
Duke
followed
,
with
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
was
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
the
very
front
and
head
of
the
aristocratic
old
Whigs
of
the
country
,
 
a
man
who
has
been
thrice
spoken
of
as
Prime
Minister
,
and
who
really
might
have
filled
the
office
had
he
not
known
himself
to
be
unfit
for
it
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
has
been
consulted
as
to
the
making
of
Cabinets
for
the
last
five
-
and
-
thirty
years
,
and
is
even
now
not
an
old
man
in
appearance
;
 
a
fussy
,
popular
,
clever
,
conscientious
man
,
whose
digestion
has
been
too
good
to
make
politics
a
burden
to
him
,
but
who
has
thought
seriously
about
his
country
,
and
is
one
who
will
be
sure
to
leave
memoirs
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
born
in
the
semi
-
purple
of
ministerial
influences
,
and
men
say
of
him
that
he
is
honester
than
his
uncle
,
who
was
Canning
's
friend
,
but
not
so
great
a
man
as
his
grandfather
,
with
whom
Fox
once
quarrelled
,
and
whom
Burke
loved
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
himself
the
heir
to
a
dukedom
,
was
the
young
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
,
of
whom
some
statesmen
thought
much
as
the
rising
star
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
If
industry
,
rectitude
of
purpose
,
and
a
certain
clearness
of
intellect
may
prevail
,
Planty
Pall
,
as
he
is
familiarly
called
,
may
become
a
great
Minister
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
Viscount
Thrift
by
himself
;
 
the
First
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
,
with
the
whole
weight
of
a
new
iron
-
clad
fleet
upon
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
He
has
undertaken
the
Herculean
task
of
cleansing
the
dockyards
,
 
and
with
it
the
lesser
work
of
keeping
afloat
a
navy
that
may
be
esteemed
by
his
countrymen
to
be
the
best
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
And
he
thinks
that
he
will
do
both
,
if
only
Mr.
Mildmay
will
not
resign
;
 
an
industrious
,
honest
,
self
-
denying
nobleman
,
who
works
without
ceasing
from
morn
to
night
,
and
who
hopes
to
rise
in
time
to
high
things
,
 
to
the
translating
of
Homer
,
perhaps
,
and
the
wearing
of
the
Garter
.
  
<EOS>
Close
behind
him
<EOS>
there
was
a
ruck
of
Ministers
,
with
the
much
-
honoured
grey
-
haired
old
Premier
in
the
midst
of
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
Mr.
Gresham
,
the
Foreign
Minister
,
<EOS>
said
to
be
the
greatest
orator
in
Europe
,
on
whose
shoulders
it
was
thought
that
the
mantle
of
Mr.
Mildmay
would
fall
,
 
to
be
worn
<EOS>
,
however
,
quite
otherwise
than
Mr.
Mildmay
had
worn
it
.
<EOS>
For
Mr.
Gresham
is
a
man
with
no
feelings
for
the
past
,
void
of
historical
association
,
hardly
with
memories
,
 
living
altogether
for
the
future
which
he
is
anxious
to
fashion
anew
out
of
the
vigour
of
his
own
brain
.
<EOS>
Whereas
,
with
Mr.
Mildmay
,
even
his
love
of
reform
is
an
inherited
passion
for
an
old
-
world
Liberalism
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
with
them
<EOS>
Mr.
Legge
Wilson
,
the
brother
of
a
peer
,
Secretary
at
War
,
a
great
scholar
and
a
polished
gentleman
,
very
proud
of
his
position
as
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
but
conscious
that
he
has
hardly
earned
it
by
political
work
.
<EOS>
And
Lord
Plinlimmon
is
with
them
,
the
Comptroller
of
India
,
 
of
all
working
lords
the
most
jaunty
,
the
most
pleasant
,
and
the
most
popular
,
very
good
at
taking
chairs
at
dinners
,
and
making
becoming
speeches
at
the
shortest
notice
,
a
man
apparently
very
free
and
open
in
his
ways
of
life
,
 
but
cautious
enough
in
truth
as
to
every
step
,
knowing
well
how
hard
it
is
to
climb
and
how
easy
to
fall
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
entered
the
room
leaning
on
Lord
Plinlimmon
's
arm
,
and
when
he
made
his
way
up
among
the
armchairs
upon
the
rug
before
the
fire
,
the
others
clustered
around
him
with
cheering
looks
and
kindly
questions
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
Privy
Seal
,
our
old
friend
Lord
Brentford
,
last
,
 
<EOS>
and
I
would
say
least
,
but
that
the
words
of
no
councillor
could
go
for
less
in
such
an
assemblage
than
will
those
of
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
,
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
of
Lancaster
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
was
soon
seated
in
one
of
the
armchairs
,
while
Lord
Plinlimmon
leaned
against
the
table
close
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
stood
upright
at
the
corner
of
the
chimney
-
piece
furthest
from
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
at
that
nearest
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
took
the
armchair
close
at
Mr.
Mildmay
's
left
hand
.
<EOS>
Lord
Plinlimmon
was
,
as
I
have
said
,
leaning
against
the
table
,
but
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
who
was
next
to
him
,
sat
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Viscount
Thrift
and
Mr.
Monk
occupied
chairs
on
the
further
side
of
the
table
,
near
to
Mr.
Mildmay
's
end
,
and
Mr.
Legge
Wilson
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
thus
joining
them
as
it
were
into
a
body
.
<EOS>
The
Home
Secretary
stood
before
the
Lord
Chancellor
screening
him
from
the
fire
,
and
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
,
after
waiting
for
a
few
minutes
as
though
in
doubt
,
took
one
of
the
vacant
armchairs
.
<EOS>
The
young
lord
from
the
Colonies
stood
a
little
behind
the
shoulders
of
his
great
friend
from
the
Foreign
Office
;
and
the
Privy
Seal
,
after
moving
about
for
a
while
uneasily
,
took
a
chair
behind
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
.
<EOS>
One
armchair
was
thus
left
vacant
,
but
there
was
no
other
comer
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
so
bad
as
I
thought
it
would
be
,
"
said
the
Duke
,
speaking
aloud
,
but
nevertheless
addressing
himself
specially
to
his
chief
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
bad
enough
,
"
said
Mr.
Mildmay
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bad
enough
indeed
,
"
said
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
,
without
any
laughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
such
a
good
bill
lost
,
"
said
Lord
Plinlimmon
.
<EOS>
"
The
worst
of
these
failures
is
,
that
the
same
identical
bill
can
never
be
brought
in
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
that
if
the
lost
bill
was
best
,
the
bill
that
will
not
be
lost
can
only
be
second
best
,
"
said
the
Lord
Chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
did
think
that
after
the
debate
before
Easter
we
should
not
have
come
to
shipwreck
about
the
ballot
,
"
said
Mr.
Mildmay
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
brewing
for
us
all
along
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
,
who
then
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
and
a
pressure
of
his
lips
withheld
words
which
he
was
nearly
uttering
,
and
which
would
not
,
probably
,
have
been
complimentary
to
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
turned
half
round
and
said
something
to
Lord
Cantrip
which
was
not
audible
to
any
one
else
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
worthy
of
note
,
however
,
that
Mr.
Turnbull
's
name
was
not
once
mentioned
aloud
at
that
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
it
was
brewing
all
along
,
"
said
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
gravely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
gentlemen
,
we
must
take
it
as
we
get
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Mildmay
,
still
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
now
we
must
consider
what
we
shall
do
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
paused
as
though
expecting
that
counsel
would
come
to
him
first
from
one
colleague
and
then
from
another
.
<EOS>
But
no
such
counsel
came
,
and
probably
Mr.
Mildmay
did
not
in
the
least
expect
that
it
would
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
stay
where
we
are
,
of
course
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
privileged
to
say
as
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
But
though
every
man
in
the
room
knew
that
it
must
be
so
,
no
one
but
the
Duke
would
have
said
it
,
before
Mr.
Mildmay
had
spoken
plainly
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Mildmay
;
"
I
suppose
that
we
can
hardly
stay
where
we
are
.
<EOS>
Probably
none
of
us
wish
it
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
looked
round
upon
his
colleagues
,
and
there
came
a
sort
of
an
assent
,
though
there
were
no
spoken
words
.
<EOS>
The
sound
from
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
was
louder
than
that
from
the
others
;
 
but
yet
from
him
it
was
no
more
than
an
attesting
grunt
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
two
things
to
consider
,
"
continued
Mr.
Mildmay
,
 
and
though
he
spoke
in
a
very
low
voice
,
every
word
was
heard
by
all
present
,
 
"
two
things
chiefly
,
that
is
;
the
work
of
the
country
and
the
Queen
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
propose
to
see
her
Majesty
this
afternoon
at
five
,
 
that
is
,
in
something
less
than
two
hours
'
time
,
and
I
hope
to
be
able
to
tell
the
House
by
seven
what
has
taken
place
between
her
Majesty
and
me
.
<EOS>
My
friend
,
his
Grace
,
will
do
as
much
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
If
you
agree
with
me
,
gentlemen
,
I
will
explain
to
the
Queen
that
it
is
not
for
the
welfare
of
the
country
that
we
should
retain
our
places
,
and
I
will
place
your
resignations
and
my
own
in
her
Majesty
's
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
advise
her
Majesty
to
send
for
Lord
de
Terrier
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
;
 
there
will
be
no
other
course
open
to
me
.
"
  
"
Or
to
her
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
To
this
remark
from
the
rising
Minister
of
the
day
,
no
word
of
reply
was
made
;
but
of
those
present
in
the
room
three
or
four
of
the
most
experienced
servants
of
the
Crown
felt
that
Mr.
Gresham
had
been
imprudent
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
,
who
had
.
<EOS>
ever
been
afraid
of
Mr.
Gresham
,
told
Mr.
Palliser
afterwards
that
such
an
observation
should
not
have
been
made
;
and
Sir
Harry
Coldfoot
pondered
upon
it
uneasily
,
and
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
asked
Mr.
Mildmay
what
he
thought
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
Times
change
so
much
,
and
with
the
times
the
feelings
of
men
,
"
said
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
whether
Sir
Marmaduke
quite
understood
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
in
the
room
for
a
moment
or
two
after
Mr.
Gresham
had
spoken
,
and
then
Mr.
Mildmay
again
addressed
his
friends
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
may
be
possible
that
my
Lord
de
Terrier
may
foresee
difficulties
,
or
may
find
difficulties
which
will
oblige
him
,
either
at
once
,
or
after
an
attempt
has
been
made
,
to
decline
the
task
which
her
Majesty
will
probably
commit
to
him
.
<EOS>
All
of
us
,
no
doubt
,
know
that
the
arrangement
of
a
government
is
not
the
most
easy
task
in
the
world
;
and
that
it
is
not
made
the
more
easy
by
an
absence
of
a
majority
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
would
dissolve
,
I
presume
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
so
,
"
continued
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
may
not
improbably
come
to
pass
that
her
Majesty
will
feel
herself
obliged
to
send
again
for
some
one
or
two
of
us
,
that
we
may
tender
to
her
Majesty
the
advice
which
we
owe
to
her
;
 
for
me
,
for
instance
,
or
for
my
friend
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
matter
she
would
be
much
guided
probably
by
what
Lord
de
Terrier
might
have
suggested
to
her
.
<EOS>
Should
this
be
so
,
and
should
I
be
consulted
,
my
present
feeling
is
that
we
should
resume
our
offices
so
that
the
necessary
business
of
the
session
should
be
completed
,
and
that
we
should
then
dissolve
Parliament
,
and
thus
ascertain
the
opinion
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
In
such
case
,
however
,
we
should
of
course
meet
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
think
that
the
course
proposed
by
Mr.
Mildmay
will
be
the
best
,
"
said
the
Duke
,
who
had
no
doubt
already
discussed
the
matter
with
his
friend
the
Prime
Minister
in
private
.
<EOS>
No
one
else
said
a
word
either
of
argument
or
disagreement
,
and
the
Cabinet
Council
was
broken
up
.
<EOS>
The
old
messenger
,
who
had
been
asleep
in
his
chair
,
stood
up
and
bowed
as
the
Ministers
walked
by
him
,
and
then
went
in
and
rearranged
the
chairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
as
much
idea
of
giving
up
as
you
or
I
have
,
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
to
his
friend
Mr.
Gresham
,
as
they
walked
arm
-
in
-
arm
together
from
the
Treasury
Chambers
across
St.
James
's
Park
towards
the
clubs
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
sure
that
he
is
not
right
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
for
himself
or
for
the
country
?
"
asked
Lord
Cantrip
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
his
future
fame
.
<EOS>
They
who
have
abdicated
and
have
clung
to
their
abdication
have
always
lost
by
it
.
<EOS>
Cincinnatus
was
brought
back
again
,
and
Charles
V.
is
felt
to
have
been
foolish
.
<EOS>
The
peaches
of
retired
ministers
of
which
we
hear
so
often
have
generally
been
cultivated
in
a
constrained
seclusion
;
 
or
at
least
the
world
so
believes
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
talking
probably
of
Mr.
Mildmay
,
as
to
whom
some
of
his
colleagues
had
thought
it
probable
,
knowing
that
he
would
now
resign
,
that
he
would
have
to
-
day
declared
his
intention
of
laying
aside
for
ever
the
cares
of
office
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
walked
home
alone
,
and
as
he
went
there
was
something
of
a
feeling
of
disappointment
at
heart
,
which
made
him
ask
himself
whether
Mr.
Turnbull
might
not
have
been
right
in
rebuking
him
for
joining
the
Government
.
<EOS>
But
this
,
I
think
,
was
in
no
way
due
to
Mr.
Mildmay
's
resignation
,
but
rather
to
a
conviction
on
Mr.
Monk
's
part
that
that
he
had
contributed
but
little
to
his
country
's
welfare
by
sitting
in
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Cabinet
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
's
Luck
 
<EOS>
After
the
holding
of
that
Cabinet
Council
of
which
the
author
has
dared
to
attempt
a
slight
sketch
in
the
last
chapter
,
there
were
various
visits
made
to
the
Queen
,
first
by
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
then
by
Lord
de
Terrier
,
afterwards
by
Mr.
Mildmay
and
the
Duke
together
,
and
then
again
by
Lord
de
Terrier
;
and
there
were
various
explanations
made
to
Parliament
in
each
House
,
and
rivals
were
very
courteous
to
each
other
,
promising
assistance
;
 
and
at
the
end
of
it
the
old
men
held
their
seats
.
<EOS>
The
only
change
made
was
effected
by
the
retirement
of
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
,
who
was
raised
to
the
peerage
,
and
by
the
selection
of
 
Mr.
Kennedy
to
fill
his
place
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
during
the
late
debate
had
made
one
of
those
speeches
,
few
and
far
between
,
by
which
he
had
created
for
himself
a
Parliamentary
reputation
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
all
men
expressed
their
great
surprise
,
and
no
one
could
quite
understand
why
Mr.
Kennedy
had
been
made
a
Cabinet
Minister
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
to
say
whether
he
is
pleased
or
not
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
speaking
of
him
to
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
pleased
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
ambition
must
be
gratified
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
,
if
he
had
any
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
in
a
man
lacking
ambition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
to
say
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
by
no
means
wear
their
hearts
upon
their
sleeves
,
and
my
husband
is
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
it
would
be
unbecoming
in
him
to
refuse
,
and
that
was
all
he
said
to
me
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
men
held
their
seats
,
but
they
did
so
as
it
were
only
upon
further
trial
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
took
the
course
which
he
had
indicated
to
his
colleagues
at
the
Cabinet
meeting
.
<EOS>
Before
all
the
explanations
and
journeyings
were
completed
,
April
was
over
,
and
the
much
-
needed
Whitsuntide
holidays
were
coming
on
.
<EOS>
But
little
of
the
routine
work
of
the
session
had
been
done
;
and
,
as
Mr.
Mildmay
told
the
House
more
than
once
,
the
country
would
suffer
were
the
Queen
to
dissolve
Parliament
at
this
period
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
The
old
Ministers
would
go
on
with
the
business
of
the
country
,
Lord
de
Terrier
with
his
followers
having
declined
to
take
affairs
into
their
hands
;
and
at
the
close
of
the
session
,
which
should
be
made
as
short
as
possible
,
writs
should
be
issued
for
new
elections
.
<EOS>
This
was
Mr.
Mildmay
's
programme
,
and
it
was
one
of
which
no
one
dared
to
complain
very
loudly
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
,
indeed
,
did
speak
a
word
of
caution
.
<EOS>
He
told
Mr.
Mildmay
that
he
had
lost
his
bill
,
good
in
other
respects
,
because
he
had
refused
to
introduce
the
ballot
into
his
measure
.
<EOS>
Let
him
promise
to
be
wiser
for
the
future
,
and
to
obey
the
manifested
wishes
of
the
country
,
and
then
all
would
be
well
with
him
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
,
Mr.
Mildmay
declared
that
to
the
best
of
his
power
of
reading
the
country
,
his
countrymen
had
manifested
no
such
wish
;
and
that
if
they
did
so
,
if
by
the
fresh
election
it
should
be
shown
that
the
ballot
was
in
truth
desired
,
he
would
at
once
leave
the
execution
of
their
wishes
to
abler
and
younger
hands
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
expressed
himself
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
Minister
's
answers
,
and
said
that
the
coming
election
would
show
whether
he
or
Mr.
Mildmay
were
right
.
  
<EOS>
Many
men
,
and
among
them
some
of
his
colleagues
,
thought
that
Mr.
Mildmay
had
been
imprudent
.
"
<EOS>
No
man
ought
ever
to
pledge
himself
to
anything
,
"
said
Sir
Harry
Coldfoot
to
the
Duke
;
 
"
<EOS>
that
is
,
to
anything
unnecessary
.

The
Duke
,
who
was
very
true
to
Mr.
Mildmay
,
made
no
reply
to
this
,
but
even
he
thought
that
his
old
friend
had
been
betrayed
into
a
promise
too
rapidly
.
<EOS>
But
the
pledge
was
given
,
and
some
people
already
began
to
make
much
of
it
.
<EOS>
There
appeared
leader
after
leader
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
urging
the
constituencies
to
take
advantage
of
the
Prime
Minister
's
words
,
and
to
show
clearly
at
the
hustings
that
they
desired
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
come
over
to
us
,
Mr.
Finn
;
you
had
indeed
,
"
said
Mr.
Slide
.
<EOS>
"
Now
's
the
time
to
do
it
,
and
show
yourself
a
people
's
friend
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
do
it
sooner
or
later
,
 
whether
or
no
.
<EOS>
Come
to
us
and
we
'll
be
your
horgan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
in
those
days
Phineas
was
something
less
in
love
with
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
than
he
had
been
at
the
time
of
the
great
debate
,
for
he
was
becoming
more
and
more
closely
connected
with
people
who
in
their
ways
of
living
and
modes
of
expression
were
very
unlike
Mr.
Slide
.
<EOS>
This
advice
was
given
to
him
about
the
end
of
May
,
and
at
that
time
Lord
Chiltern
was
living
with
him
in
the
lodgings
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pouncefoot
had
temporarily
vacated
her
rooms
on
the
first
floor
,
and
the
Lord
with
the
broken
bones
had
condescended
to
occupy
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
like
having
a
Lord
,
"
Bunce
had
said
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
soon
come
to
you
not
liking
anybody
decent
anywhere
,
"
Mrs.
Bunce
had
replied
;
"
but
I
sha
n't
ask
any
questions
about
it
.
<EOS>
When
you
're
wasting
so
much
time
and
money
at
your
dirty
law
proceedings
,
it
's
well
that
somebody
should
earn
something
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
many
discussions
about
the
bringing
of
Lord
Chiltern
up
to
London
,
in
all
of
which
Phineas
had
been
concerned
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
had
thought
that
his
son
had
better
remain
down
at
the
Willingford
Bull
;
and
although
he
said
that
the
rooms
were
at
his
son
's
disposal
should
Lord
Chiltern
choose
to
come
to
London
,
still
he
said
it
in
such
a
way
that
Phineas
,
who
went
down
to
Willingford
,
could
not
tell
his
friend
that
he
would
be
made
welcome
in
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
leave
those
diggings
altogether
,
"
Lord
Chiltern
said
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
My
father
annoys
me
by
everything
he
says
and
does
,
and
I
annoy
him
by
saying
and
doing
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
Then
there
came
an
invitation
to
him
from
Lady
Laura
and
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Would
he
come
to
Grosvenor
Place
?
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
pressed
this
very
much
,
though
in
truth
Mr.
Kennedy
had
hardly
done
more
than
give
a
cold
assent
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Chiltern
would
not
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
reason
for
my
going
to
my
father
's
house
,
"
said
he
,
"
though
he
and
I
are
not
the
best
friends
in
the
world
;
but
there
can
be
no
reason
for
my
going
to
the
house
of
a
man
I
dislike
so
much
as
I
do
Robert
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
The
matter
was
settled
in
the
manner
told
above
.
<EOS>
Miss
Pouncefoot
's
rooms
were
prepared
for
him
at
Mr.
Bunce
's
house
,
and
Phineas
Finn
went
down
to
Willingford
and
brought
him
up
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
sold
Bonebreaker
,
"
he
said
,
 
"
to
a
young
fellow
whose
neck
will
certainly
be
the
sacrifice
if
he
attempts
to
ride
him
.
<EOS>
I
'd
have
given
him
to
you
,
Phineas
,
only
you
would
n't
have
known
what
to
do
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
when
he
came
up
to
London
was
still
in
bandages
,
though
,
as
the
surgeon
said
,
his
bones
seemed
to
have
been
made
to
be
broken
and
set
again
;
and
his
bandages
of
course
were
a
sufficient
excuse
for
his
visiting
the
house
neither
of
his
father
nor
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Laura
went
to
him
frequently
,
and
thus
became
acquainted
with
our
hero
's
home
and
with
Mrs.
Bunce
.
<EOS>
And
there
were
messages
taken
from
Violet
to
the
man
in
bandages
<EOS>
,
some
of
which
lost
nothing
in
the
carrying
.
<EOS>
Once
Lady
Laura
tried
to
make
Violet
think
that
it
would
be
right
,
or
rather
not
wrong
,
that
they
two
should
go
together
to
Lord
Chiltern
's
rooms
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
would
you
have
me
tell
my
aunt
,
or
would
you
have
me
not
tell
her
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Violet
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
you
do
just
as
you
pleased
,
"
Lady
Laura
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
shall
,
"
Violet
replied
,
"
but
I
will
do
nothing
that
I
should
be
ashamed
to
tell
any
one
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
professes
to
be
in
love
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
in
love
with
you
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
Even
you
do
not
pretend
to
doubt
his
faith
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
In
those
circumstances
a
girl
should
not
go
to
a
man
's
rooms
unless
she
means
to
consider
herself
as
engaged
to
him
,
even
with
his
sister
;
 
not
though
he
had
broken
every
bone
in
his
skin
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
may
do
,
Laura
,
and
I
know
what
I
may
n't
;
and
I
wo
n't
be
led
either
by
you
or
by
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
give
him
your
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
because
you
'll
give
it
in
a
wrong
spirit
.
<EOS>
He
knows
well
enough
that
I
wish
him
well
;
 
but
you
may
tell
him
that
from
me
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
He
has
from
me
all
those
wishes
which
one
friend
owes
to
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
there
were
other
messages
sent
from
Violet
through
Phineas
Finn
which
she
worded
with
more
show
of
affection
,
 
perhaps
as
much
for
the
discomfort
of
Phineas
as
for
the
consolation
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
to
take
care
of
himself
,
"
said
Violet
,
"
and
bid
him
not
to
have
any
more
of
those
wild
brutes
that
are
not
fit
for
any
Christian
to
ride
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
I
say
so
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
great
thing
to
be
brave
;
but
what
's
the
use
of
being
foolhardy
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
session
was
to
be
closed
at
the
end
of
June
,
to
the
great
dismay
of
London
tradesmen
and
of
young
ladies
who
had
not
been
entirely
successful
in
the
early
season
.
<EOS>
But
before
the
old
Parliament
was
closed
,
and
the
writs
for
the
new
election
were
despatched
,
there
occurred
an
incident
which
was
of
very
much
importance
to
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
Near
the
end
of
June
,
when
the
remaining
days
of
the
session
were
numbered
by
three
or
four
,
he
had
been
dining
at
Lord
Brentford
's
house
in
Portman
Square
in
company
with
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Laura
had
not
been
there
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
he
saw
Lord
Brentford
not
unfrequently
,
and
there
was
always
a
word
said
about
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
The
father
would
ask
how
the
son
occupied
himself
,
and
Phineas
would
hope
,
 
though
hitherto
he
had
hoped
in
vain
,
 
that
he
would
induce
the
Earl
to
come
and
see
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
could
never
be
brought
to
that
;
but
it
was
sufficiently
evident
that
he
would
have
done
so
,
had
he
not
been
afraid
to
descend
so
far
from
the
altitude
of
his
paternal
wrath
.
<EOS>
On
this
evening
,
at
about
eleven
,
Mr.
Kennedy
and
Phineas
left
the
house
together
,
and
walked
from
the
Square
through
Orchard
Street
into
Oxford
Street
.
<EOS>
Here
their
ways
parted
,
but
Phineas
crossed
the
road
with
Mr.
Kennedy
,
as
he
was
making
some
reply
to
a
second
invitation
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
considering
what
had
been
said
before
on
the
subject
,
thought
that
the
invitation
came
late
,
and
that
it
was
not
warmly
worded
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
therefore
,
declined
it
,
and
was
in
the
act
of
declining
it
,
when
he
crossed
the
road
with
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
In
walking
down
Orchard
Street
from
the
Square
he
had
seen
two
men
standing
in
the
shadow
a
few
yards
up
a
mews
or
small
alley
that
was
there
,
but
had
thought
nothing
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
that
period
of
the
year
when
there
is
hardly
any
of
the
darkness
of
night
;
but
at
this
moment
there
were
symptoms
of
coming
rain
,
and
heavy
drops
began
to
fall
;
and
there
were
big
clouds
coming
and
going
before
the
young
moon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
had
said
that
he
would
get
a
cab
,
but
he
had
seen
none
as
he
crossed
Oxford
Street
,
and
had
put
up
his
umbrella
as
he
made
his
way
towards
Park
Street
.
<EOS>
Phineas
as
he
left
him
distinctly
perceived
the
same
two
figures
on
the
other
side
of
Oxford
Street
,
and
then
turning
into
the
shadow
of
a
butcher
's
porch
,
he
saw
them
cross
the
street
in
the
wake
of
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
raining
in
earnest
,
and
the
few
passengers
who
were
out
were
scudding
away
quickly
,
this
way
and
that
.
  
<EOS>
It
hardly
occurred
to
Phineas
to
think
that
any
danger
was
imminent
to
Mr.
Kennedy
from
the
men
,
but
it
did
occur
to
him
that
he
might
as
well
take
some
notice
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Phineas
knew
that
Mr.
Kennedy
would
make
his
way
down
Park
Street
,
that
being
his
usual
route
from
Portman
Square
towards
his
own
home
,
and
knew
also
that
he
himself
could
again
come
across
Mr.
Kennedy
's
track
by
going
down
North
Audley
Street
to
the
corner
of
Grosvenor
Square
,
and
thence
by
Brook
Street
into
Park
Street
.
<EOS>
Without
much
thought
,
therefore
,
he
went
out
of
his
own
course
down
to
the
corner
of
the
Square
,
hurrying
his
steps
till
he
was
running
,
and
then
ran
along
Brook
Street
,
thinking
as
he
went
of
some
special
word
that
he
might
say
to
Mr.
Kennedy
as
an
excuse
,
should
he
again
come
across
his
late
companion
.
<EOS>
He
reached
the
corner
of
Park
Street
before
that
gentleman
could
have
been
there
unless
he
also
had
run
;
but
just
in
time
to
see
him
as
he
was
coming
on
,
 
and
also
to
see
in
the
dark
glimmering
of
the
slight
uncertain
moonlight
that
the
two
men
were
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
retreated
a
step
backwards
in
the
corner
,
resolving
that
when
Mr.
Kennedy
came
up
,
they
two
would
go
on
together
;
for
now
it
was
clear
that
Mr.
Kennedy
was
followed
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Kennedy
did
not
reach
the
corner
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
within
two
doors
of
it
,
one
of
the
men
had
followed
him
up
quickly
,
and
had
thrown
something
round
his
throat
from
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Phineas
understood
well
now
that
his
friend
was
in
the
act
of
being
garrotted
,
and
that
his
instant
assistance
was
needed
.
<EOS>
He
rushed
forward
,
and
as
the
second
ruffian
had
been
close
upon
the
footsteps
of
the
first
,
there
was
almost
instantaneously
a
concourse
of
the
four
men
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
fight
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
had
already
nearly
succeeded
in
putting
Mr.
Kennedy
on
to
his
back
,
made
no
attempt
to
seize
his
prey
when
he
found
that
so
unwelcome
an
addition
had
joined
the
party
,
but
instantly
turned
to
fly
.
<EOS>
His
companion
was
turning
also
,
but
Phineas
was
too
quick
for
him
,
and
having
seized
on
to
his
collar
,
held
to
him
with
all
his
power
.
<EOS>
"
Dash
it
all
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
did
n't
yer
see
as
how
I
was
a
-
hurrying
up
to
help
the
gen'leman
myself
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
however
,
had
n't
seen
this
,
and
held
on
gallantly
,
and
in
a
couple
of
minutes
the
first
ruffian
was
back
again
upon
the
spot
in
the
custody
of
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
done
it
uncommon
neat
,
sir
,
"
said
the
policeman
,
complimenting
Phineas
upon
his
performance
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
gen'leman
ai
n't
none
the
worst
for
it
,
it
'll
have
been
a
very
pretty
evening
's
amusement
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
was
now
leaning
against
the
railings
,
and
hitherto
had
been
unable
to
declare
whether
he
was
really
injured
or
not
,
and
it
was
not
till
a
second
policeman
came
up
that
the
hero
of
the
night
was
at
liberty
to
attend
closely
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
when
he
was
able
to
speak
,
declared
that
for
a
minute
or
two
he
had
thought
that
his
neck
had
been
broken
;
and
he
was
not
quite
convinced
till
he
found
himself
in
his
own
house
,
that
nothing
more
serious
had
really
happened
to
him
than
certain
bruises
round
his
throat
.
<EOS>
The
policeman
was
for
a
while
anxious
that
at
any
rate
Phineas
should
go
with
him
to
the
police
-
office
;
but
at
last
consented
to
take
the
addresses
of
the
two
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
When
he
found
that
Mr.
Kennedy
was
a
member
of
Parliament
,
and
that
he
was
designated
as
Right
Honourable
,
his
respect
for
the
garrotter
became
more
great
,
and
he
began
to
feel
that
the
night
was
indeed
a
night
of
great
importance
.
<EOS>
He
expressed
unbounded
admiration
at
Mr.
Finn
's
success
in
his
own
line
,
and
made
repeated
promises
that
the
men
should
be
forthcoming
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Could
a
cab
be
got
?
<EOS>
Of
course
a
cab
could
be
got
.
<EOS>
A
cab
was
got
,
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
making
of
the
attack
,
the
two
members
of
Parliament
were
on
their
way
to
Grosvenor
Place
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
hardly
a
word
spoken
in
the
cab
,
for
Mr.
Kennedy
was
in
pain
.
<EOS>
When
,
however
,
they
reached
the
door
in
Grosvenor
Place
,
Phineas
wanted
to
go
,
and
leave
his
friend
with
the
servants
,
but
this
the
Cabinet
Minister
would
not
allow
.
<EOS>

Of
course
you
must
see
my
wife
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
So
they
went
up
-
stairs
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
then
upon
the
stairs
,
by
the
lights
of
the
house
,
Phineas
could
perceive
that
his
companion
's
face
was
bruised
and
black
with
dirt
,
and
that
his
cravat
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
garrotted
,
"
said
the
Cabinet
Minister
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Simply
that
;
 
or
should
have
been
,
if
he
had
not
been
there
.
<EOS>
How
he
came
there
,
God
only
knows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
wife
's
anxiety
,
and
then
her
gratitude
,
need
hardly
be
described
,
 
nor
the
astonishment
of
the
husband
,
which
by
no
means
decreased
on
reflection
,
at
the
opportune
re
-
appearance
in
the
nick
of
time
of
the
man
whom
three
minutes
before
the
attack
he
had
left
in
the
act
of
going
in
the
opposite
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
seen
the
men
,
and
thought
it
best
to
run
round
by
the
corner
of
Grosvenor
Square
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
God
bless
you
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Amen
,
"
said
the
Cabinet
Minister
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
was
born
to
be
my
friend
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
The
Cabinet
Minister
said
nothing
more
that
night
.
<EOS>
He
was
never
given
to
much
talking
,
and
the
little
accident
which
had
just
occurred
to
him
did
not
tend
to
make
words
easy
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
pressed
our
hero
's
hand
,
and
Lady
Laura
said
that
of
course
Phineas
would
come
to
them
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Phineas
remarked
that
his
first
business
must
be
to
go
to
the
police
-
office
,
but
he
promised
that
he
would
come
down
to
Grosvenor
Place
immediately
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Laura
also
pressed
his
hand
,
and
looked
 
;
she
looked
,
I
think
,
as
though
she
thought
that
Phineas
would
only
have
done
right
had
he
repeated
the
offence
which
he
had
committed
under
the
waterfall
of
Loughlinter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Garrotted
!
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
when
Phineas
told
him
the
story
before
they
went
to
bed
that
night
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
smoking
,
sipping
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
waiting
for
Finn
's
return
.
"
<EOS>
Robert
Kennedy
garrotted
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
fellow
was
in
the
act
of
doing
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
stopped
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
got
there
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
Was
n't
it
lucky
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
be
garrotted
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
lent
the
man
<EOS>
a
hand
had
I
been
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
say
anything
so
horrible
?
<EOS>
But
you
are
drinking
too
much
,
old
fellow
,
and
I
shall
lock
the
bottle
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
were
no
one
in
London
drank
more
than
I
do
,
the
wine
merchants
would
have
a
bad
time
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
new
Cabinet
Minister
has
been
garrotted
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
'm
sorry
for
poor
Laura
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Luckily
he
's
not
much
the
worse
for
it
;
 
only
a
little
bruised
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
it
's
on
the
cards
he
should
be
improved
by
it
;
 
worse
,
except
in
the
way
of
being
strangled
,
he
could
not
be
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
he
's
my
brother
-
in
-
law
,
I
'm
obliged
to
you
for
rescuing
him
.
<EOS>
Come
,
I
'll
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
if
he
was
to
be
garrotted
I
should
like
to
have
been
there
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
was
the
manner
in
which
Lord
Chiltern
received
the
tidings
of
the
terrible
accident
which
had
occurred
to
his
near
relative
.
   
<EOS>
Finn
for
Loughton
 
<EOS>
By
three
o'clock
in
the
day
after
the
little
accident
which
was
told
in
the
last
chapter
,
all
the
world
knew
that
Mr.
Kennedy
,
the
new
Cabinet
Minister
,
had
been
garrotted
,
or
half
garrotted
,
and
that
that
child
of
fortune
,
Phineas
Finn
,
had
dropped
upon
the
scene
out
of
heaven
at
the
exact
moment
of
time
,
had
taken
the
two
garrotters
prisoners
,
and
saved
the
Cabinet
Minister
's
neck
and
valuables
,
 
if
not
his
life
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bedad
,
"
said
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
when
he
came
to
hear
this
,
"
that
fellow'll
marry
an
heiress
,
and
be
Secretary
for
Oireland
yet
.
<EOS>
"
A
good
deal
was
said
about
it
to
Phineas
at
the
clubs
,
but
a
word
or
two
that
was
said
to
him
by
Violet
Effingham
was
worth
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
a
Paladin
you
are
!
<EOS>
But
you
succour
men
in
distress
instead
of
maidens
.
"
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
bad
luck
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
The
other
will
come
no
doubt
in
time
,
"
Violet
replied
;
"
and
then
you
'll
get
your
reward
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
knew
that
such
words
from
a
girl
mean
nothing
,
 
especially
from
such
a
girl
as
Violet
Effingham
;
but
nevertheless
they
were
very
pleasant
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
come
to
us
at
Loughlinter
when
Parliament
is
up
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
said
the
same
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
really
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
must
go
over
to
Ireland
about
my
re
-
election
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
that
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
You
are
only
making
out
excuses
.
<EOS>
We
go
down
on
the
first
of
July
,
and
the
English
elections
wo
n't
begin
till
the
middle
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
August
before
the
men
of
Loughshane
are
ready
for
you
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
Lady
Laura
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
I
doubt
whether
the
men
of
Loughshane
,
 
or
rather
the
man
of
Loughshane
,
will
have
anything
more
to
say
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
man
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Tulla
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
passion
with
his
brother
before
,
and
I
got
the
advantage
of
it
.
<EOS>
Since
that
he
has
paid
his
brother
's
debts
for
the
fifteenth
time
,
and
of
course
is
ready
to
fight
any
battle
for
the
forgiven
prodigal
.
<EOS>
Things
are
not
as
they
were
,
and
my
father
tells
me
that
he
thinks
I
shall
be
beaten
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
bad
news
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
what
I
have
a
right
to
expect
.
"
  
<EOS>
Every
word
of
information
that
had
come
to
Phineas
about
Loughshane
since
Mr.
Mildmay
had
decided
upon
a
dissolution
,
had
gone
towards
making
him
feel
at
first
that
there
was
a
great
doubt
as
to
his
re
-
election
,
and
at
last
that
there
was
almost
a
certainty
against
him
.
<EOS>
And
as
these
tidings
reached
him
they
made
him
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Since
he
had
been
in
Parliament
he
had
very
frequently
regretted
that
he
had
left
the
shades
of
the
Inns
of
Court
for
the
glare
of
Westminster
;
and
he
had
more
than
once
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
desert
the
glare
and
return
to
the
shade
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
when
the
moment
came
in
which
such
desertion
seemed
to
be
compulsory
on
him
,
when
there
would
be
no
longer
a
choice
,
the
seat
in
Parliament
was
dearer
to
him
than
ever
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
gone
of
his
own
free
will
,
 
so
he
told
himself
,
 
there
would
have
been
something
of
nobility
in
such
going
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
would
have
respected
him
,
and
even
Mrs.
Low
might
have
taken
him
back
to
the
friendship
of
her
severe
bosom
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
go
back
now
as
a
cur
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
,
 
kicked
out
,
as
it
were
,
from
Parliament
.
<EOS>
Returning
to
Lincoln
's
Inn
soiled
with
failure
,
having
accomplished
nothing
,
having
broken
down
on
the
only
occasion
on
which
he
had
dared
to
show
himself
on
his
legs
,
not
having
opened
a
single
useful
book
during
the
two
years
in
which
he
had
sat
in
Parliament
,
burdened
with
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
's
debt
,
and
not
quite
free
from
debt
of
his
own
,
how
could
he
start
himself
in
any
way
by
which
he
might
even
hope
to
win
success
?
<EOS>
He
must
,
he
told
himself
,
give
up
all
thought
of
practising
in
London
and
betake
himself
to
Dublin
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
dare
to
face
his
friends
in
London
as
a
young
briefless
barrister
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
evening
,
the
evening
subsequent
to
that
on
which
Mr.
Kennedy
had
been
attacked
,
the
House
was
sitting
in
Committee
of
Ways
and
Means
,
and
there
came
on
a
discussion
as
to
a
certain
vote
for
the
army
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
known
that
there
would
be
such
discussion
;
and
Mr.
Monk
having
heard
from
Phineas
a
word
or
two
now
and
again
about
the
potted
peas
,
had
recommended
him
to
be
ready
with
a
few
remarks
if
he
wished
to
support
the
Government
in
the
matter
of
that
vote
.
<EOS>
Phineas
did
so
wish
,
having
learned
quite
enough
in
the
Committee
Room
up
-
stairs
to
make
him
believe
that
a
large
importation
of
the
potted
peas
from
Holstein
would
not
be
for
the
advantage
of
the
army
or
navy
,
 
or
for
that
of
the
country
at
large
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
had
made
his
suggestion
without
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
former
failure
,
 
just
as
though
Phineas
were
a
practised
speaker
accustomed
to
be
on
his
legs
three
or
four
times
a
week
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
find
a
chance
,
I
will
,
"
said
Phineas
,
taking
the
advice
just
as
it
was
given
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
prayers
,
a
word
was
said
in
the
House
as
to
the
ill
-
fortune
which
had
befallen
the
new
Cabinet
Minister
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
had
asked
Mr.
Mildmay
whether
violent
hands
had
not
been
laid
in
the
dead
of
night
on
the
sacred
throat
,
 
the
throat
that
should
have
been
sacred
,
 
of
the
new
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
of
Lancaster
;
and
had
expressed
regret
that
the
Ministry
,
 
which
was
,
he
feared
,
in
other
respects
somewhat
infirm
,
 
should
now
have
been
further
weakened
by
this
injury
to
that
new
bulwark
with
which
it
had
endeavoured
to
support
itself
.
<EOS>
The
Prime
Minister
,
answering
his
old
rival
in
the
same
strain
,
said
that
the
calamity
might
have
been
very
severe
,
both
to
the
country
and
to
the
Cabinet
;
but
that
fortunately
for
the
community
at
large
,
a
gallant
young
member
of
that
House
,
 
<EOS>
and
he
was
proud
to
say
a
supporter
of
the
Government
<EOS>
,
 
had
appeared
upon
the
spot
at
the
nick
of
time
;
 
"
<EOS>
As
a
god
out
of
a
machine
,
"
said
Mr.
Daubeny
,
interrupting
him
;
 
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
as
a
god
out
of
a
machine
,
"
continued
Mr.
Mildmay
,
"
but
as
a
real
help
in
a
very
real
trouble
,
and
succeeded
not
only
in
saving
my
right
honourable
friend
,
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
,
but
in
arresting
the
two
malefactors
who
attempted
to
rob
him
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
a
cry
of
"
name
;
"
and
Mr.
Mildmay
of
course
named
the
member
for
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
It
so
happened
that
Phineas
was
not
in
the
House
,
but
he
heard
it
all
when
he
came
down
to
attend
the
Committee
of
Ways
and
Means
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
on
the
discussion
about
provisions
in
the
army
,
the
subject
being
mooted
by
one
of
Mr.
Turnbull
's
close
allies
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
on
the
other
side
of
the
House
who
had
moved
for
the
Potted
Peas
Committee
,
was
silent
on
the
occasion
,
having
felt
that
the
result
of
that
committee
had
not
been
exactly
what
he
had
expected
.
<EOS>
The
evidence
respecting
such
of
the
Holstein
potted
peas
as
had
been
used
in
this
country
was
not
very
favourable
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
the
rebound
from
that
committee
,
 
the
very
fact
that
such
a
committee
had
been
made
to
sit
,
 
gave
ground
for
a
hostile
attack
.
<EOS>
To
attack
is
so
easy
,
when
a
complete
refutation
barely
suffices
to
save
the
Minister
<EOS>
attacked
,
 
does
not
suffice
to
save
him
from
future
dim
memories
of
something
having
been
wrong
,
 
and
brings
down
no
disgrace
whatsoever
on
the
promoter
of
the
false
charge
.
<EOS>
The
promoter
of
the
false
charge
simply
expresses
his
gratification
at
finding
that
he
had
been
misled
by
erroneous
information
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
customary
for
him
to
express
gratification
at
the
fact
,
that
out
of
all
the
mud
which
he
has
thrown
,
some
will
probably
stick
!
<EOS>
Phineas
,
when
the
time
came
,
did
get
on
his
legs
,
and
spoke
perhaps
two
or
three
dozen
words
.
<EOS>
The
doing
so
seemed
to
come
to
him
quite
naturally
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
very
little
about
it
beforehand
,
 
having
resolved
not
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
the
occasion
was
one
of
no
great
importance
.
<EOS>
The
Speaker
was
not
in
the
chair
,
and
the
House
was
thin
,
and
he
intended
to
make
no
speech
,
 
merely
to
say
something
which
he
had
to
say
.
<EOS>
Till
he
had
finished
he
hardly
remembered
that
he
was
doing
that
,
in
attempting
to
do
which
he
had
before
failed
so
egregiously
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
he
sat
down
that
he
began
to
ask
himself
whether
the
scene
was
swimming
before
his
eyes
as
it
had
done
on
former
occasions
;
as
it
had
done
even
when
he
had
so
much
as
thought
of
making
a
speech
.
<EOS>
Now
he
was
astonished
at
the
easiness
of
the
thing
,
and
as
he
left
the
House
told
himself
that
he
had
overcome
the
difficulty
just
when
the
victory
could
be
of
no
avail
to
him
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
more
eager
,
more
constant
in
his
purpose
,
he
might
at
any
rate
have
shown
the
world
that
he
was
fit
for
the
place
which
he
had
presumed
to
take
before
he
was
cast
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
he
received
a
letter
from
his
father
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
had
seen
Lord
Tulla
,
having
been
sent
for
to
relieve
his
lordship
in
a
fit
of
the
gout
,
and
had
been
informed
by
the
Earl
that
he
meant
to
fight
the
borough
to
the
last
man
;
 
<EOS>
had
he
said
to
the
last
shilling
he
would
have
spoken
with
perhaps
more
accuracy
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
doctor
,
your
son
has
had
it
for
two
years
,
as
you
may
say
for
nothing
,
and
I
think
he
ought
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
expect
that
he
's
to
go
on
there
as
though
it
were
his
own
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
his
lordship
,
upon
whom
this
touch
of
the
gout
had
come
somewhat
sharply
,
expressed
himself
with
considerable
animation
.
<EOS>
The
old
doctor
behaved
with
much
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
the
Earl
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
could
not
undertake
to
say
what
you
might
do
;
but
that
as
you
had
come
forward
at
first
with
my
sanction
,
I
could
not
withdraw
it
now
.
<EOS>
He
asked
me
if
I
should
support
you
with
money
;
I
said
that
I
should
to
a
moderate
extent
.
"
<EOS>
By
G
 
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
"
a
moderate
extent
will
go
a
very
little
way
,
I
can
tell
you
.
"
<EOS>
Since
that
he
has
had
Duggin
with
him
;
so
,
I
suppose
,
I
shall
not
see
him
any
more
.
<EOS>
You
can
do
as
you
please
now
;
but
,
from
what
I
hear
,
I
fear
you
will
have
no
chance
.
"
<EOS>
Then
with
much
bitterness
of
spirit
Phineas
resolved
that
he
would
not
interfere
with
Lord
Tulla
at
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
at
once
to
the
Reform
Club
and
explain
his
reasons
to
Barrington
Erle
and
others
there
who
would
be
interested
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
first
went
to
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
Here
he
was
shown
up
into
Mr.
Kennedy
's
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
was
up
and
seated
in
an
arm
-
chair
by
an
open
window
looking
over
into
the
Queen
's
garden
;
but
he
was
in
his
dressing
-
gown
,
and
was
to
be
regarded
as
an
invalid
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
as
he
could
not
turn
his
neck
,
or
thought
that
he
could
not
do
so
<EOS>
,
he
was
not
very
fit
to
go
out
about
his
work
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
that
the
affairs
of
the
Duchy
of
Lancaster
did
not
suffer
materially
by
his
absence
.
<EOS>
We
may
take
it
for
granted
that
<EOS>
with
a
man
so
sedulous
as
to
all
his
duties
there
was
no
arrear
of
work
when
the
accident
took
place
.
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
to
Phineas
,
and
said
some
word
in
a
whisper
,
 
some
word
or
two
among
which
Phineas
caught
the
sound
of
"
potted
peas
,
"
 
and
then
continued
to
look
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
are
utterly
prostrated
by
any
bodily
ailment
,
and
it
seemed
that
Mr.
Kennedy
was
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
was
full
of
his
own
bad
news
,
had
intended
to
tell
his
sad
story
at
once
.
<EOS>
But
he
perceived
that
the
neck
of
the
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
was
too
stiff
to
allow
of
his
taking
any
interest
in
external
matters
,
and
so
he
refrained
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
the
doctor
say
about
it
?
"
said
Phineas
,
perceiving
that
just
for
the
present
there
could
be
only
one
possible
subject
for
remark
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
was
beginning
to
describe
in
a
long
whisper
what
the
doctor
did
think
about
it
,
when
Lady
Laura
came
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
they
began
at
first
to
talk
about
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
been
kind
to
him
not
to
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
And
Lady
Laura
made
much
of
the
injury
,
as
it
behoves
a
wife
to
do
in
such
circumstances
for
the
sake
both
of
the
sufferer
and
of
the
hero
.
<EOS>
She
declared
her
conviction
<EOS>
that
had
Phineas
been
a
moment
later
her
husband
's
neck
would
have
been
irredeemably
broken
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
they
ever
do
kill
the
people
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
they
do
n't
mean
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
they
did
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
not
,
"
said
Phineas
,
eager
in
the
cause
of
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
this
man
was
very
clumsy
,
"
whispered
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
was
a
beginner
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
that
may
make
a
difference
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
'm
afraid
we
have
interfered
with
his
education
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
by
degrees
,
the
conversation
got
away
to
other
things
,
and
Lady
Laura
asked
him
after
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
made
up
my
mind
to
give
it
up
,
"
said
he
,
smiling
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
there
was
but
a
bad
chance
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
smiling
also
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
has
behaved
so
well
!
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
written
to
say
he
'll
find
the
money
,
if
I
determine
to
contest
the
borough
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
write
to
him
by
to
-
night
's
post
to
decline
the
offer
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
right
to
spend
the
money
,
and
I
should
n't
succeed
if
I
did
spend
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
makes
me
a
little
down
in
the
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
smiled
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
a
plan
of
my
own
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
plan
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Or
rather
it
is
n't
mine
,
but
papa
's
.
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Standish
is
going
to
give
up
Loughton
,
and
papa
wants
you
to
come
and
try
your
luck
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Laura
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
quite
a
certainty
,
you
know
,
but
I
suppose
it
's
as
near
a
certainty
as
anything
left
.
"
<EOS>
And
this
came
from
a
strong
Radical
Reformer
!
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Laura
,
I
could
n't
accept
such
a
favour
from
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Kennedy
nodded
his
head
very
slightly
and
whispered
,
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
think
of
it
,
"
said
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
right
to
such
a
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
matter
entirely
for
papa
's
consideration
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
with
an
affectation
of
solemnity
in
her
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
has
always
been
felt
that
any
politician
may
accept
such
an
offer
as
that
when
it
is
made
to
him
,
but
that
no
politician
should
ask
for
it
.
<EOS>
My
father
feels
that
he
has
to
do
the
best
he
can
with
his
influence
in
the
borough
,
and
therefore
he
comes
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
that
,
"
said
Phineas
,
somewhat
rudely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
private
feelings
have
their
weight
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
probable
that
papa
would
have
gone
to
a
perfect
stranger
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
may
own
that
Mr.
Kennedy
and
I
would
both
be
very
sorry
that
you
should
not
be
in
the
House
,
and
that
that
feeling
on
our
part
has
had
some
weight
with
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'll
stand
?
"
whispered
Mr.
Kennedy
,
still
looking
straight
out
of
the
window
,
as
though
the
slightest
attempt
to
turn
his
neck
would
be
fraught
with
danger
to
himself
and
the
Duchy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
has
desired
me
to
ask
you
to
call
upon
him
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
there
is
very
much
to
be
said
,
as
each
of
you
know
<EOS>
so
well
the
other
's
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
But
you
had
better
see
him
to
-
day
or
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Of
course
Phineas
was
persuaded
before
he
left
Mr.
Kennedy
's
room
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
,
there
appeared
to
him
to
be
no
valid
reason
why
he
should
not
sit
for
Loughton
.
<EOS>
The
favour
was
of
a
kind
that
had
prevailed
from
time
out
of
mind
in
England
,
between
the
most
respectable
of
the
great
land
magnates
,
and
young
rising
liberal
politicians
.
<EOS>
Burke
,
Fox
,
and
Canning
had
all
been
placed
in
Parliament
by
similar
influence
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
desired
earnestly
,
 
longed
in
his
very
heart
of
hearts
,
 
to
extinguish
all
such
Parliamentary
influence
,
to
root
out
for
ever
the
last
vestige
of
close
borough
nominations
;
but
while
the
thing
remained
it
was
better
that
the
thing
should
contribute
to
the
liberal
than
to
the
conservative
strength
of
the
House
,
 
and
if
to
the
liberal
<EOS>
,
how
was
this
to
be
achieved
but
by
the
acceptance
of
such
influence
by
some
liberal
candidate
?
<EOS>
And
if
it
were
right
that
it
should
be
accepted
by
any
liberal
candidate
,
 
then
,
why
not
by
him
?
<EOS>
The
logic
of
this
argument
seemed
to
him
to
be
perfect
.
<EOS>
He
felt
something
like
a
sting
of
reproach
as
he
told
himself
that
in
truth
this
great
offer
was
made
to
him
,
not
on
account
of
the
excellence
of
his
politics
,
but
because
he
had
been
instrumental
in
saving
Lord
Brentford
's
son
-
in
-
law
from
the
violence
of
garrotters
.
<EOS>
But
he
crushed
these
qualms
of
conscience
as
being
over
-
scrupulous
,
and
,
as
he
told
himself
,
not
practical
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
the
world
as
you
find
it
,
with
a
struggle
to
be
something
more
honest
than
those
around
you
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
preached
to
himself
this
sermon
,
declared
to
himself
that
they
who
attempted
more
than
this
flew
too
high
in
the
clouds
to
be
of
service
to
men
and
women
upon
earth
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
did
not
see
Lord
Brentford
that
day
he
postponed
writing
to
his
father
for
twenty
-
four
hours
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
he
found
the
Earl
at
home
in
Portman
Square
,
having
first
discussed
the
matter
fully
with
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
scruple
about
me
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
;
"
you
are
quite
welcome
to
the
borough
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
I
did
not
stand
,
would
you
do
so
?
<EOS>
There
are
so
many
reasons
which
ought
to
induce
you
to
accept
a
seat
in
Parliament
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whether
that
be
true
or
not
,
Phineas
,
I
shall
not
accept
my
father
's
interest
at
Loughton
,
unless
it
be
offered
to
me
in
a
way
in
which
it
never
will
be
offered
.
<EOS>
You
know
me
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
I
shall
not
change
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Nor
will
he
.
<EOS>
And
,
therefore
,
you
may
go
down
to
Loughton
with
a
pure
conscience
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
his
interview
with
the
Earl
,
and
in
ten
minutes
everything
was
settled
.
<EOS>
On
his
way
to
Portman
Square
there
had
come
across
his
mind
the
idea
of
a
grand
effort
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
What
if
he
could
persuade
the
father
so
to
conduct
himself
towards
his
son
,
that
the
son
should
consent
to
be
a
member
for
the
borough
?
<EOS>
And
he
did
say
a
word
or
two
to
this
effect
,
setting
forth
that
Lord
Chiltern
would
condescend
to
become
a
legislator
,
if
only
his
father
would
condescend
to
acknowledge
his
son
's
fitness
for
such
work
without
any
comments
on
the
son
's
past
life
.
<EOS>
But
the
Earl
simply
waived
the
subject
away
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
could
be
as
obstinate
as
his
son
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
been
the
Mercury
between
them
on
this
subject
,
and
Lady
Laura
had
failed
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
now
consent
to
employ
another
Mercury
.
<EOS>
Very
little
,
 
hardly
a
word
<EOS>
indeed
,
 
was
said
between
the
Earl
and
Phineas
about
politics
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
to
be
the
Saulsby
candidate
at
Loughton
for
the
next
election
,
and
was
to
come
to
Saulsby
with
the
Kennedys
from
Loughlinter
,
 
either
with
the
Kennedys
or
somewhat
in
advance
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
there
will
be
no
opposition
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
"
but
I
expect
none
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
very
courteous
,
 
nay
,
he
was
kind
,
feeling
doubtless
that
his
family
owed
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
young
man
with
whom
he
was
conversing
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
there
was
not
absent
on
his
part
a
touch
of
that
high
condescension
which
,
perhaps
,
might
be
thought
to
become
the
Earl
,
the
Cabinet
Minister
,
and
the
great
borough
patron
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
was
sensitive
,
felt
this
and
winced
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
quite
liked
Lord
Brentford
,
and
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
so
now
in
spite
of
the
kindness
which
the
Earl
was
showing
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
very
happy
when
he
sat
down
to
write
to
his
father
from
the
club
.
<EOS>
His
father
had
told
him
that
the
money
should
be
forthcoming
for
the
election
at
Loughshane
,
if
he
resolved
to
stand
,
but
that
the
chance
of
success
would
be
very
slight
,
 
indeed
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
there
would
be
no
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
his
father
had
evidently
believed
,
when
writing
,
that
Phineas
would
not
abandon
his
seat
without
a
useless
and
expensive
contest
.
<EOS>
He
now
thanked
his
father
with
many
expressions
of
gratitude
,
 
declared
his
conviction
that
his
father
was
right
about
Lord
Tulla
,
and
then
,
in
the
most
modest
language
that
he
could
use
,
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
found
another
borough
open
to
him
in
England
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
stand
for
Loughton
,
with
the
assistance
of
Lord
Brentford
,
and
thought
that
the
election
would
probably
not
cost
him
above
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
at
the
outside
.
<EOS>
Then
he
wrote
a
very
pretty
note
to
Lord
Tulla
,
thanking
him
for
his
former
kindness
,
and
telling
the
Irish
Earl
that
it
was
not
his
intention
to
interfere
with
the
borough
of
Loughshane
at
the
next
election
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
this
Phineas
was
very
much
surprised
at
a
visit
that
was
made
to
him
at
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
,
after
that
scene
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
,
called
again
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
 
and
was
admitted
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
let
him
sit
in
your
armchair
for
half
an
hour
or
so
,
"
Fitzgibbon
had
said
;
and
Phineas
almost
believed
that
it
would
be
better
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
a
terrible
nuisance
to
him
,
and
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
he
had
better
undertake
to
pay
the
debt
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
he
knew
,
quite
on
the
cards
that
Mr.
Clarkson
should
have
him
arrested
while
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
Since
that
scene
in
the
lobby
Mr.
Clarkson
had
been
with
him
twice
,
and
there
had
been
a
preliminary
conversation
as
to
real
payment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
wanted
a
hundred
pounds
down
,
and
another
bill
for
two
hundred
and
twenty
at
three
months
'
date
.
<EOS>
"
Think
of
my
time
and
trouble
in
coming
here
,
"
Mr.
Clarkson
had
urged
when
Phineas
had
objected
to
these
terms
.
<EOS>
"
Think
of
my
time
and
trouble
,
and
do
be
punctual
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
had
offered
him
ten
pounds
a
quarter
,
the
payments
to
be
marked
on
the
back
of
the
bill
,
a
tender
which
Mr.
Clarkson
had
not
seemed
to
regard
as
strong
evidence
of
punctuality
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
angry
,
but
had
simply
expressed
his
intention
of
calling
again
,
 
giving
Phineas
to
understand
that
business
would
probably
take
him
to
the
west
of
Ireland
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
If
only
business
might
not
take
him
down
either
to
Loughlinter
or
to
Saulsby
!
<EOS>
But
the
strange
visitor
who
came
to
Phineas
in
the
midst
of
these
troubles
put
an
end
to
them
all
.
  
<EOS>
The
strange
visitor
was
Miss
Aspasia
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
very
much
surprised
at
my
coming
to
your
chambers
,
no
doubt
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
which
Phineas
placed
for
her
.
<EOS>
Phineas
could
only
say
that
he
was
very
proud
to
be
so
highly
honoured
,
and
that
he
hoped
she
was
well
.
"
<EOS>
Pretty
well
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
come
about
a
little
business
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
I
hope
you
'll
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
sure
that
there
is
no
need
for
excuses
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Laurence
,
when
he
hears
about
it
,
will
say
that
I
've
been
an
impertinent
old
fool
;
but
I
never
care
what
Laurence
says
,
either
this
way
or
that
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
to
that
Mr.
Clarkson
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
I
've
paid
him
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
have
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
happened
to
hear
what
occurred
that
night
at
the
door
of
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
told
you
,
Miss
Fitzgibbon
?
"
  
"
Never
mind
who
told
me
.
<EOS>
I
heard
it
.
<EOS>
I
knew
before
that
you
had
been
foolish
enough
to
help
Laurence
about
money
,
and
so
I
put
two
and
two
together
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
the
first
time
I
have
had
to
do
with
Mr.
Clarkson
.
<EOS>
So
I
sent
to
him
,
and
I
've
bought
the
bill
.
<EOS>
There
it
is
.
"
<EOS>
And
Miss
Fitzgibbon
produced
the
document
which
bore
the
name
of
Phineas
Finn
across
the
front
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
you
pay
him
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
for
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
very
hard
tussle
,
and
got
it
at
last
for
two
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
you
do
it
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
All
myself
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
employed
a
lawyer
I
should
have
had
to
pay
two
hundred
and
forty
pounds
and
five
pounds
for
costs
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
hope
you
wo
n't
have
any
more
money
engagements
with
my
brother
Laurence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
said
that
he
thought
he
might
promise
that
he
would
have
no
more
.
"
<EOS>
Because
,
if
you
do
,
I
sha
n't
interfere
.
<EOS>
If
Laurence
began
to
find
that
he
could
get
money
out
of
me
in
that
way
,
there
would
be
no
end
to
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Clarkson
would
very
soon
be
spending
his
spare
time
in
my
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
If
Laurence
says
anything
,
just
tell
him
that
he
'd
better
come
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
was
left
looking
at
the
bill
.
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
a
great
relief
to
him
,
 
that
he
should
be
thus
secured
from
the
domiciliary
visits
of
Mr.
Clarkson
;
a
great
relief
to
him
to
be
assured
that
Mr.
Clarkson
would
not
find
him
out
down
at
Loughton
;
but
nevertheless
,
he
had
to
suffer
a
pang
of
shame
as
he
felt
that
Miss
Fitzgibbon
had
become
acquainted
with
his
poverty
and
had
found
herself
obliged
to
satisfy
his
pecuniary
liabilities
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
's
Headache
 
Phineas
went
down
to
Loughlinter
early
in
July
,
taking
Loughton
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
He
stayed
there
one
night
at
the
inn
,
and
was
introduced
to
sundry
influential
inhabitants
of
the
borough
by
Mr.
Grating
,
the
ironmonger
,
who
was
known
by
those
who
knew
Loughton
to
be
a
very
strong
supporter
of
the
Earl
's
interest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grating
and
about
half
a
dozen
others
of
the
tradesmen
of
the
town
came
to
the
inn
,
and
met
Phineas
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
He
told
them
he
was
a
good
sound
Liberal
and
a
supporter
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Government
,
of
which
their
neighbour
the
Earl
was
so
conspicuous
an
ornament
.
<EOS>
This
was
almost
all
that
was
said
about
the
Earl
out
loud
;
but
each
individual
man
of
Loughton
then
present
took
an
opportunity
during
the
meeting
of
whispering
into
Mr.
Finn
's
ear
a
word
or
two
to
show
that
he
also
was
admitted
to
the
secret
councils
of
the
borough
,
 
that
he
too
could
see
the
inside
of
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
must
support
the
Earl
,
"
one
said
.
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
what
you
hear
about
a
Tory
candidate
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
whispered
a
second
;
"
the
Earl
can
do
what
he
pleases
here
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
seemed
to
Phineas
that
it
was
thought
by
them
all
to
be
rather
a
fine
thing
to
be
thus
held
in
the
hand
by
an
English
nobleman
.
<EOS>
Phineas
could
not
but
reflect
much
upon
this
as
he
lay
in
his
bed
at
the
Loughton
inn
.
<EOS>
The
great
political
question
on
which
the
political
world
was
engrossed
up
in
London
was
the
enfranchisement
of
Englishmen
,
 
of
Englishmen
down
to
the
rank
of
artisans
and
labourers
;
 
and
yet
when
he
found
himself
in
contact
with
individual
Englishmen
,
with
men
even
very
much
above
the
artisan
and
the
labourer
,
he
found
that
they
rather
liked
being
bound
hand
and
foot
,
and
being
kept
as
tools
in
the
political
pocket
of
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
Every
one
of
those
Loughton
tradesmen
was
proud
of
his
own
personal
subjection
to
the
Earl
!
  
<EOS>
From
Loughton
he
went
to
Loughlinter
,
having
promised
to
be
back
in
the
borough
for
the
election
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grating
would
propose
him
,
and
he
was
to
be
seconded
by
Mr.
Shortribs
,
the
butcher
and
grazier
.
<EOS>
Mention
had
been
made
of
a
Conservative
candidate
,
and
Mr.
Shortribs
had
seemed
to
think
that
a
good
stand
-
up
fight
upon
English
principles
,
with
a
clear
understanding
,
of
course
,
that
victory
should
prevail
on
the
liberal
side
,
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
borough
.
<EOS>
But
the
Earl
's
man
of
business
saw
Phineas
on
the
morning
of
his
departure
,
and
told
him
not
to
regard
Mr.
Shortribs
.
<EOS>
"
They
'd
all
like
it
,
"
said
the
man
of
business
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
daresay
they
'll
have
enough
of
it
when
this
Reform
Bill
is
passed
;
but
at
present
no
one
will
be
fool
enough
to
come
and
spend
his
money
here
.
<EOS>
We
have
them
all
in
hand
too
well
for
that
,
Mr.
Finn
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
found
the
great
house
at
Loughlinter
nearly
empty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
's
mother
was
there
,
and
Lord
Brentford
was
there
,
and
Lord
Brentford
's
private
secretary
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
's
private
secretary
.
<EOS>
At
present
that
was
the
entire
party
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
was
expected
there
,
with
her
daughter
and
Violet
Effingham
;
but
,
as
well
as
Phineas
could
learn
,
they
would
not
be
at
Loughlinter
until
after
he
had
left
it
.
<EOS>
There
had
come
up
lately
a
rumour
that
there
would
be
an
autumn
session
,
 
that
the
Houses
would
sit
through
October
and
a
part
of
November
,
in
order
that
Mr.
Mildmay
might
try
the
feeling
of
the
new
Parliament
.
<EOS>
If
this
were
to
be
so
,
Phineas
had
resolved
that
,
in
the
event
of
his
election
at
Loughton
,
he
would
not
return
to
Ireland
till
after
this
autumn
session
should
be
over
.
<EOS>
He
gave
an
account
to
the
Earl
,
in
the
presence
of
the
Earl
's
son
-
in
-
law
,
of
what
had
taken
place
at
Loughton
,
and
the
Earl
expressed
himself
as
satisfied
.
<EOS>
It
was
manifestly
a
great
satisfaction
to
Lord
Brentford
that
he
should
still
have
a
borough
in
his
pocket
,
and
the
more
so
because
there
were
<EOS>
so
very
few
noblemen
left
who
had
such
property
belonging
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
careful
in
his
speech
,
never
saying
in
so
many
words
that
the
privilege
of
returning
a
member
was
his
own
;
but
his
meaning
was
not
the
less
clear
.
  
<EOS>
Those
were
dreary
days
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
There
was
fishing
,
 
if
Phineas
chose
to
fish
;
and
he
was
told
that
he
could
shoot
a
deer
if
he
was
minded
to
go
out
alone
.
<EOS>
But
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
the
intention
of
the
host
that
his
guests
should
spend
their
time
profitably
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
himself
was
shut
up
with
books
and
papers
all
the
morning
,
and
always
took
up
a
book
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
also
would
read
a
little
,
 
and
then
would
sleep
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
Old
Mrs.
Kennedy
slept
also
,
and
Lady
Laura
looked
as
though
she
would
like
to
sleep
if
it
were
not
that
her
husband
's
eye
was
upon
her
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
administered
tea
,
Mr.
Kennedy
not
liking
the
practice
of
having
it
handed
round
by
a
servant
when
none
were
there
but
members
of
the
family
circle
,
and
she
read
novels
.
<EOS>
Phineas
got
hold
of
a
stiff
bit
of
reading
for
himself
,
and
tried
to
utilise
his
time
.
<EOS>
He
took
Alison
in
hand
,
and
worked
his
way
gallantly
through
a
couple
of
volumes
.
<EOS>
But
even
he
,
more
than
once
or
twice
,
found
himself
on
the
very
verge
of
slumber
.
<EOS>
Then
he
would
wake
up
and
try
to
think
about
things
.
<EOS>
Why
was
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
an
Irishman
from
Killaloe
,
living
in
that
great
house
of
Loughlinter
as
though
he
were
one
of
the
family
,
striving
to
kill
the
hours
,
and
feeling
that
he
was
in
some
way
subject
to
the
dominion
of
his
host
?
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
better
for
him
to
get
up
and
go
away
?
<EOS>
In
his
heart
of
hearts
he
did
not
like
Mr.
Kennedy
,
though
he
believed
him
to
be
a
good
man
.
<EOS>
And
of
what
service
to
him
was
it
to
like
Lady
Laura
,
now
that
Lady
Laura
was
a
possession
in
the
hands
of
Mr.
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
Then
he
would
tell
himself
that
he
owed
his
position
in
the
world
entirely
to
Lady
Laura
,
and
that
he
was
ungrateful
to
feel
himself
ever
dull
in
her
society
.
<EOS>
And
,
moreover
,
there
was
something
to
be
done
in
the
world
beyond
making
love
and
being
merry
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
could
occupy
himself
with
a
blue
book
for
hours
together
without
wincing
.
<EOS>
So
Phineas
went
to
work
again
with
his
Alison
,
and
read
away
till
he
nodded
.
  
<EOS>
In
those
days
he
often
wandered
up
and
down
the
Linter
and
across
the
moor
to
the
Linn
,
and
so
down
to
the
lake
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
a
book
with
him
,
and
would
seat
himself
down
on
spots
which
he
loved
,
and
would
pretend
to
read
;
 
but
I
do
not
think
that
he
got
much
advantage
from
his
book
.
<EOS>
He
was
thinking
of
his
life
,
and
trying
to
calculate
whether
the
wonderful
success
which
he
had
achieved
would
ever
be
of
permanent
value
to
him
.
<EOS>
Would
he
be
nearer
to
earning
his
bread
when
he
should
be
member
for
Loughton
than
he
had
been
when
he
was
member
for
Loughshane
?
<EOS>
Or
was
there
before
him
any
slightest
probability
that
he
would
ever
earn
his
bread
?
<EOS>
And
then
he
thought
of
Violet
Effingham
,
and
was
angry
with
himself
for
remembering
at
that
moment
that
Violet
Effingham
was
the
mistress
of
a
large
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
Once
before
when
he
was
sitting
beside
the
Linter
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
declare
his
passion
to
Lady
Laura
;
 
and
he
had
done
so
on
the
very
spot
.
<EOS>
Now
,
within
a
twelvemonth
of
that
time
,
he
made
up
his
mind
on
the
same
spot
to
declare
his
passion
to
Miss
Effingham
,
and
he
thought
his
best
mode
of
carrying
his
suit
would
be
to
secure
the
assistance
of
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
no
doubt
,
had
been
very
anxious
that
her
brother
should
marry
Violet
;
but
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
Phineas
knew
,
had
asked
for
Violet
's
hand
twice
in
vain
;
and
,
moreover
,
Chiltern
himself
had
declared
to
Phineas
that
he
would
never
ask
for
it
again
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
who
was
always
reasonable
,
would
surely
perceive
that
there
was
no
hope
of
success
for
her
brother
.
<EOS>
That
Chiltern
would
quarrel
with
him
,
 
would
quarrel
with
him
to
the
knife
,
 
he
did
not
doubt
;
but
he
felt
that
no
fear
of
such
a
quarrel
as
that
should
deter
him
.
<EOS>
He
loved
Violet
Effingham
,
and
he
must
indeed
be
pusillanimous
if
,
loving
her
as
he
did
,
he
was
deterred
from
expressing
his
love
from
any
fear
of
a
suitor
whom
she
did
not
favour
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
willingly
be
untrue
to
his
friendship
for
Lady
Laura
's
brother
.
<EOS>
Had
there
been
a
chance
for
Lord
Chiltern
he
would
have
abstained
from
putting
himself
forward
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
the
use
of
his
abstaining
,
when
by
doing
so
he
could
in
no
wise
benefit
his
friend
,
 
when
the
result
of
his
doing
so
would
be
that
some
interloper
would
come
in
and
carry
off
the
prize
?
<EOS>
He
would
explain
all
this
to
Lady
Laura
,
and
,
if
the
prize
would
be
kind
to
him
,
he
would
disregard
the
anger
of
Lord
Chiltern
,
even
though
it
might
be
anger
to
the
knife
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
was
thinking
of
all
this
Lady
Laura
stood
before
him
where
he
was
sitting
at
the
top
of
the
falls
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
he
remembered
well
all
the
circumstances
of
the
scene
when
he
had
been
there
with
her
at
his
last
visit
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
How
things
had
changed
since
then
!
<EOS>
Then
he
had
loved
Lady
Laura
with
all
his
heart
,
and
he
had
now
already
brought
himself
to
regard
her
as
a
discreet
matron
whom
to
love
would
be
almost
as
unreasonable
as
though
he
were
to
entertain
a
passion
for
the
Lord
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
The
reader
will
understand
how
thorough
had
been
the
cure
effected
by
Lady
Laura
's
marriage
and
the
interval
of
a
few
months
,
when
the
swain
was
already
prepared
to
make
this
lady
the
depositary
of
his
confidence
in
another
matter
of
love
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
often
here
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
looking
down
upon
him
as
he
sat
upon
the
rock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
;
not
very
often
;
I
come
here
sometimes
because
the
view
down
upon
the
lake
is
so
fine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
prettiest
spot
about
the
place
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
ever
get
here
now
.
<EOS>
Indeed
this
is
only
the
second
time
that
I
have
been
up
since
we
have
been
at
home
,
and
then
I
came
to
bring
papa
here
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
little
wooden
seat
near
to
the
rock
upon
which
Phineas
had
been
lying
,
and
upon
this
Lady
Laura
sat
down
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
with
his
eyes
turned
upon
the
lake
,
was
considering
how
he
might
introduce
the
subject
of
his
love
for
Violet
Effingham
;
but
he
did
not
find
the
matter
very
easy
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
resolved
to
begin
by
saying
that
Violet
would
certainly
never
accept
Lord
Chiltern
,
when
Lady
Laura
spoke
a
word
or
two
which
stopped
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
well
I
remember
,
"
she
said
,
"
the
day
when
you
and
I
were
here
last
autumn
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I.
You
told
me
then
that
you
were
going
to
marry
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
How
much
has
happened
since
then
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
Much
indeed
!
<EOS>
Enough
for
a
whole
lifetime
.
<EOS>
And
yet
how
slow
the
time
has
gone
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
it
has
been
slow
with
me
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
have
been
active
.
<EOS>
You
have
had
your
hands
full
of
work
.
<EOS>
I
am
beginning
to
think
that
it
is
a
great
curse
to
have
been
born
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
I
have
heard
you
say
that
a
woman
may
do
as
much
as
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
before
I
had
learned
my
lesson
properly
.
<EOS>
I
know
better
than
that
now
.
<EOS>
Oh
dear
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
it
is
all
for
the
best
as
it
is
,
but
I
have
a
kind
of
wish
that
I
might
be
allowed
to
go
out
and
milk
the
cows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
may
you
not
milk
the
cows
if
you
wish
it
,
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
;
 
not
only
not
milk
them
,
but
hardly
look
at
them
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
I
must
not
talk
about
them
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
of
course
understood
that
she
was
complaining
of
her
husband
,
and
hardly
knew
how
to
reply
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
sharp
enough
to
perceive
already
that
Mr.
Kennedy
was
an
autocrat
in
his
own
house
,
and
he
knew
Lady
Laura
<EOS>
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
such
masterdom
would
be
very
irksome
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
imagined
that
she
would
complain
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
so
different
at
Saulsby
,
"
Lady
Laura
continued
.
<EOS>
"
Everything
there
seemed
to
be
my
own
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
everything
here
is
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
according
to
the
prayer
-
book
.
<EOS>
And
everything
in
truth
is
my
own
,
 
as
all
the
dainties
at
the
banquet
belonged
to
Sancho
the
Governor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
"
said
he
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
hesitated
;
"
you
mean
that
Mr.
Kennedy
stands
over
you
,
guarding
you
for
your
own
welfare
,
as
the
doctor
stood
over
Sancho
and
guarded
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
before
she
answered
,
 
a
long
pause
,
during
which
he
was
looking
away
over
the
lake
,
and
thinking
how
he
might
introduce
the
subject
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
But
long
as
was
the
pause
,
he
had
not
begun
when
Lady
Laura
was
again
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
my
friend
,
"
she
said
,
"
that
I
have
made
a
mistake
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
mistake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Phineas
,
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
have
blundered
as
fools
blunder
,
thinking
that
I
was
clever
enough
to
pick
my
footsteps
<EOS>
aright
without
asking
counsel
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
blundered
and
stumbled
and
fallen
,
and
now
I
am
so
bruised
that
I
am
not
able
to
stand
upon
my
feet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
word
that
struck
him
most
in
all
this
was
his
own
Christian
name
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
called
him
Phineas
before
.
<EOS>
He
was
aware
that
the
circle
of
his
acquaintance
had
fallen
into
a
way
of
miscalling
him
by
his
Christian
name
,
as
one
observes
to
be
done
now
and
again
in
reference
to
some
special
young
man
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
men
whom
he
called
his
friends
called
him
Phineas
.
<EOS>
Even
the
Earl
had
done
so
more
than
once
on
occasions
in
which
the
greatness
of
his
position
had
dropped
for
a
moment
out
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Low
had
called
him
Phineas
when
she
regarded
him
as
her
husband
's
most
cherished
pupil
;
and
Mrs.
Bunce
had
called
him
Mr.
Phineas
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
been
Phineas
to
everybody
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
But
still
he
was
quite
sure
that
Lady
Laura
had
never
so
called
him
before
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
she
have
done
so
now
in
her
husband
's
presence
.
<EOS>
He
was
sure
of
that
also
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
you
are
unhappy
?
"
he
said
,
still
looking
away
from
her
towards
the
lake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
mean
that
.
<EOS>
Though
I
do
not
know
why
I
should
come
and
tell
you
so
,
 
except
that
I
am
still
blundering
and
stumbling
,
and
have
fallen
into
a
way
of
hurting
myself
at
every
step
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
tell
no
one
who
is
more
anxious
for
your
happiness
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
very
pretty
speech
,
but
what
would
you
do
for
my
happiness
?
<EOS>
Indeed
,
what
is
it
possible
that
you
should
do
?
<EOS>
I
mean
it
as
no
rebuke
when
I
say
that
my
happiness
or
unhappiness
is
a
matter
as
to
which
you
will
soon
become
perfectly
indifferent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
say
so
,
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
it
is
natural
that
it
should
be
so
.
<EOS>
You
and
Mr.
Kennedy
might
have
been
friends
.
<EOS>
Not
that
you
will
be
,
because
you
are
unlike
each
other
in
all
your
ways
.
<EOS>
But
it
might
have
been
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
are
not
you
and
I
to
be
friends
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
In
a
very
few
months
you
will
not
think
of
telling
me
what
are
your
desires
or
what
your
sorrows
;
 
and
as
for
me
,
it
will
be
out
of
the
question
that
I
should
tell
mine
to
you
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
be
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
not
quite
sure
of
my
friendship
,
Lady
Laura
,
you
would
not
speak
to
me
as
you
are
speaking
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Still
he
did
not
look
at
her
,
but
lay
with
his
face
supported
on
his
hands
,
and
his
eyes
turned
away
upon
the
lake
.
<EOS>
But
she
,
where
she
was
sitting
,
could
see
him
,
and
was
aided
by
her
sight
in
making
comparisons
in
her
mind
between
the
two
men
who
had
been
her
lovers
,
 
between
him
whom
she
had
taken
and
<EOS>
him
whom
she
had
left
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
hard
,
dry
,
unsympathising
,
unchanging
virtues
of
her
husband
which
almost
revolted
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
a
fault
,
but
she
had
tried
him
at
every
point
and
had
been
able
to
strike
no
spark
of
fire
from
him
.
<EOS>
Even
by
disobeying
she
could
produce
no
heat
,
 
only
an
access
of
firmness
.
<EOS>
How
would
it
have
been
with
her
had
she
thrown
all
ideas
of
fortune
to
the
winds
,
and
linked
her
lot
to
that
of
the
young
Phoebus
who
was
lying
at
her
feet
?
<EOS>
If
she
had
ever
loved
any
one
she
had
loved
him
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
not
thrown
away
her
love
for
money
.
<EOS>
So
she
swore
to
herself
over
and
over
again
,
trying
to
console
herself
in
her
cold
unhappiness
.
<EOS>
She
had
married
a
rich
man
in
order
that
she
might
be
able
to
do
something
in
the
world
;
 
and
now
that
she
was
this
rich
man
's
wife
she
found
that
she
could
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
rich
man
thought
it
to
be
quite
enough
for
her
to
sit
at
home
and
look
after
his
welfare
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
young
Phoebus
,
 
<EOS>
her
Phoebus
as
he
had
been
once
<EOS>
,
 
was
thinking
altogether
of
some
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
"
she
said
,
slowly
,
"
I
have
in
you
such
perfect
confidence
that
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
;
 
as
one
man
may
tell
it
to
another
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
go
from
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
at
once
?
"
  
"
Not
to
-
day
,
or
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Stay
here
now
till
the
election
;
but
do
not
return
.
<EOS>
He
will
ask
you
to
come
,
and
press
you
hard
,
and
will
be
hurt
;
 
for
,
strange
to
say
,
with
all
his
coldness
,
he
really
likes
you
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
pleasure
in
seeing
you
here
.
<EOS>
But
he
must
not
have
that
pleasure
at
the
expense
of
trouble
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
is
it
a
trouble
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
Men
are
such
fools
;
 
so
awkward
,
so
unready
,
with
their
wits
ever
behind
the
occasion
by
a
dozen
seconds
or
so
!
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
he
knew
that
they
should
not
have
been
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
a
fool
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Why
else
?
Is
not
that
enough
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
 
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
 
no
;
I
will
have
none
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
fool
,
but
not
such
a
fool
as
to
suppose
that
any
cure
is
to
be
found
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
say
what
I
can
do
for
you
,
though
it
be
with
my
entire
life
,
and
I
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
nothing
,
 
except
to
keep
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
earnest
in
telling
me
that
?
"
<EOS>
Now
at
last
he
had
turned
himself
round
and
was
looking
at
her
,
and
as
he
looked
he
saw
the
hat
of
a
man
appearing
up
the
path
,
and
immediately
afterwards
the
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
hat
and
face
of
the
laird
of
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
said
Phineas
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
<EOS>
not
devoid
of
dismay
and
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
perceive
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
dismay
or
trouble
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
countenance
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
as
he
approached
closer
,
there
was
not
much
to
be
read
,
 
only
,
perhaps
,
some
slight
addition
of
gloom
,
or
rather
,
perhaps
,
of
that
frigid
propriety
of
moral
demeanour
for
which
he
had
always
been
conspicuous
,
which
had
grown
upon
him
at
his
marriage
,
and
which
had
been
greatly
increased
by
the
double
action
of
being
made
a
Cabinet
Minister
and
being
garrotted
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
that
your
headache
is
better
,
"
he
said
to
his
wife
,
who
had
risen
from
her
seat
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Phineas
also
had
risen
,
and
was
now
looking
somewhat
sheepish
where
he
stood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
out
because
it
was
worse
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
irritated
me
so
that
I
could
not
stand
the
house
any
longer
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
send
to
Callender
for
Dr.
Macnuthrie
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
do
nothing
of
the
kind
,
Robert
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
Dr.
Macnuthrie
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
there
is
illness
,
medical
advice
is
always
expedient
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
ill
.
<EOS>
A
headache
is
not
illness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
thought
it
was
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
very
drily
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
I
would
rather
not
have
Dr.
Macnuthrie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
it
can
not
do
you
any
good
to
climb
up
here
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Had
you
been
here
long
,
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
morning
;
 
here
,
or
hereabouts
.
<EOS>
I
clambered
up
from
the
lake
and
had
a
book
in
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
happened
to
come
across
him
by
accident
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
asked
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
simple
in
the
question
that
its
very
simplicity
proved
that
there
was
no
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
by
chance
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
But
every
one
at
Loughlinter
always
comes
up
here
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
ever
were
missing
whom
I
wanted
to
find
,
this
is
where
I
should
look
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
on
towards
Linter
forest
to
meet
Blane
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
Blane
was
the
gamekeeper
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
mind
the
trouble
,
Finn
,
I
wish
you
'd
take
Lady
Laura
down
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
her
stay
out
in
the
heat
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
that
somebody
goes
over
to
Callender
for
Dr.
Macnuthrie
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Kennedy
went
on
,
and
Phineas
was
left
with
the
charge
of
taking
Lady
Laura
back
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Kennedy
's
hat
had
first
appeared
coming
up
the
walk
,
Phineas
had
been
ready
to
proclaim
himself
prepared
for
any
devotion
in
the
service
of
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
begun
to
reply
with
criminal
tenderness
to
the
indiscreet
avowal
which
Lady
Laura
had
made
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
felt
now
,
after
what
had
just
occurred
in
the
husband
's
presence
,
that
any
show
of
tenderness
,
 
of
criminal
tenderness
,
 
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
The
absence
of
all
suspicion
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Kennedy
had
made
Phineas
feel
that
he
was
bound
by
all
social
laws
to
refrain
from
such
tenderness
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
began
to
descend
the
path
before
him
without
a
word
;
 
and
went
on
,
and
on
,
as
though
she
would
have
reached
the
house
without
speaking
,
had
he
not
addressed
her
.
"
<EOS>
Does
your
head
still
pain
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
is
right
in
saying
that
you
should
not
be
out
in
the
heat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
worth
while
to
think
about
that
.
<EOS>
He
sends
me
in
,
and
so
of
course
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
And
he
tells
you
to
take
me
,
and
so
of
course
you
must
take
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
wish
that
I
should
let
you
go
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
would
.
<EOS>
Only
he
will
be
sure
to
find
it
out
;
and
you
must
not
tell
him
that
you
left
me
at
my
request
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
that
I
am
afraid
of
him
?
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
think
you
are
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
am
,
and
that
papa
is
;
and
that
his
mother
hardly
dares
to
call
her
soul
her
own
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
why
you
should
escape
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
is
nothing
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
something
to
me
,
and
so
I
suppose
I
had
better
go
on
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
shall
have
that
horrid
man
from
the
little
town
pawing
me
and
covering
everything
with
snuff
,
and
bidding
me
take
Scotch
physic
,
 
which
seems
to
increase
in
quantity
and
nastiness
as
doses
in
England
decrease
.
<EOS>
And
he
will
stand
over
me
to
see
that
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
;
 
the
doctor
from
Callender
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
but
Mr.
Kennedy
will
.
<EOS>
If
he
advised
me
to
have
a
hole
in
my
glove
<EOS>
mended
,
he
would
ask
me
before
he
went
to
bed
whether
it
was
done
.
<EOS>
He
never
forgot
anything
in
his
life
,
and
was
never
unmindful
of
anything
.
<EOS>
That
I
think
will
do
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
You
have
brought
me
out
from
the
trees
,
and
that
may
be
taken
as
bringing
me
home
.
<EOS>
We
shall
hardly
get
scolded
if
we
part
here
.
<EOS>
Remember
what
I
told
you
up
above
.
<EOS>
And
remember
also
that
it
is
in
your
power
to
do
nothing
else
for
me
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
he
turned
away
towards
the
lake
,
and
let
Lady
Laura
go
across
the
wide
lawn
to
the
house
by
herself
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
failed
altogether
in
his
intention
of
telling
his
friend
of
his
love
for
Violet
,
and
had
come
to
perceive
that
he
could
not
for
the
present
carry
out
that
intention
.
<EOS>
After
what
had
passed
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
go
to
Lady
Laura
with
a
passionate
tale
of
his
longing
for
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
even
to
speak
to
her
of
love
at
all
,
it
must
be
quite
of
another
love
than
that
.
<EOS>
But
he
never
would
speak
to
her
of
love
;
nor
,
 
as
he
felt
quite
sure
,
 
would
she
allow
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
what
astounded
him
most
as
he
thought
of
the
interview
which
had
just
passed
,
was
the
fact
that
the
Lady
Laura
whom
he
had
known
,
 
whom
he
had
thought
he
had
known
,
 
should
have
become
so
subject
to
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Kennedy
,
a
man
whom
he
had
despised
as
being
weak
,
irresolute
,
and
without
a
purpose
!
<EOS>
For
the
day
or
two
that
he
remained
at
Loughlinter
,
he
watched
the
family
closely
,
and
became
aware
that
Lady
Laura
had
been
right
when
she
declared
that
her
father
was
afraid
of
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
follow
you
almost
immediately
,
"
said
the
Earl
confidentially
to
Phineas
,
when
the
candidate
for
the
borough
took
his
departure
from
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
to
be
there
just
when
the
election
is
going
on
,
but
I
'll
be
at
Saulsby
to
receive
you
the
day
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
took
his
leave
from
Mr.
Kennedy
,
with
a
warm
expression
of
friendship
on
the
part
of
his
host
,
and
from
Lady
Laura
with
a
mere
touch
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
say
a
word
;
but
she
was
sullen
,
or
,
if
not
,
she
put
on
some
mood
like
to
sullenness
,
and
said
never
a
word
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
after
the
departure
of
Phineas
Finn
for
Loughton
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
still
had
a
headache
.
<EOS>
She
had
complained
of
a
headache
ever
since
she
had
been
at
Loughlinter
,
and
Dr.
Macnuthrie
had
been
over
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
it
is
that
ails
you
,
"
said
her
husband
,
standing
over
her
in
her
own
sitting
-
room
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
room
,
looking
away
to
the
mountains
,
with
just
a
glimpse
of
the
lake
to
be
caught
from
the
window
,
and
it
had
been
prepared
for
her
with
all
the
skill
and
taste
of
an
accomplished
upholsterer
.
<EOS>
She
had
selected
the
room
for
herself
soon
after
her
engagement
,
and
had
thanked
her
future
husband
with
her
sweetest
smile
for
giving
her
the
choice
.
<EOS>
She
had
thanked
him
and
told
him
that
she
always
meant
to
be
happy
,
 
so
happy
in
that
room
!
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
not
much
given
to
romance
,
but
he
thought
of
this
promise
as
he
stood
over
her
and
asked
after
her
health
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
he
could
see
she
had
never
been
even
comfortable
since
she
had
been
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
A
shadow
of
the
truth
came
across
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
his
wife
was
bored
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
what
was
to
be
the
future
of
his
life
and
of
hers
?
<EOS>
He
went
up
to
London
every
year
,
and
to
Parliament
,
as
a
duty
;
and
then
,
during
some
period
of
the
recess
,
would
have
his
house
full
of
guests
,
 
as
another
duty
.
<EOS>
But
his
happiness
was
to
consist
in
such
hours
as
these
which
seemed
to
inflict
upon
his
wife
the
penalty
of
a
continual
headache
.
<EOS>
A
shadow
of
the
truth
came
upon
him
.
<EOS>
What
if
his
wife
did
not
like
living
quietly
at
home
as
the
mistress
of
her
husband
's
house
?
<EOS>
What
if
a
headache
was
always
to
be
the
result
of
a
simple
performance
of
domestic
duties
?
  
<EOS>
More
than
a
shadow
of
truth
had
come
upon
Lady
Laura
herself
.
<EOS>
The
dark
cloud
created
by
the
entire
truth
was
upon
her
,
making
everything
black
and
wretched
around
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
asked
herself
a
question
or
two
,
and
had
discovered
that
she
had
no
love
for
her
husband
,
that
the
kind
of
life
which
he
intended
to
exact
from
her
was
insupportable
to
her
,
and
that
she
had
blundered
and
fallen
in
her
entrance
upon
life
.
<EOS>
She
perceived
that
her
father
had
already
become
weary
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
that
,
lonely
and
sad
as
he
would
be
at
Saulsby
by
himself
,
it
was
his
intention
to
repudiate
the
idea
of
making
a
home
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
she
would
be
deserted
by
everyone
,
except
of
course
by
her
husband
;
and
then---
<EOS>
Then
she
would
throw
herself
on
some
early
morning
into
the
lake
,
for
life
would
be
insupportable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
it
is
that
ails
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
serious
.
<EOS>
One
ca
n't
always
help
having
a
headache
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
you
take
enough
exercise
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
I
would
propose
that
you
should
walk
four
miles
every
day
after
breakfast
.
<EOS>
I
will
always
be
ready
to
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
to
Dr.
Macnuthrie
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
hate
Dr.
Macnuthrie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
hate
Dr.
Macnuthrie
,
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
tell
why
?
<EOS>
I
do
.
<EOS>
That
is
quite
reason
enough
why
you
should
not
send
for
him
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
unreasonable
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
One
chooses
a
doctor
on
account
of
his
reputation
in
his
profession
,
and
that
of
Dr.
Macnuthrie
stands
high
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
any
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
are
ill
,
my
dear
 
"
  
"
I
am
not
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
said
you
had
a
headache
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
so
for
the
last
ten
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Having
a
headache
is
not
being
ill
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
you
would
not
talk
of
it
,
and
then
perhaps
I
should
get
rid
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
believe
that
.
<EOS>
Headache
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
comes
from
the
stomach
.
<EOS>
"
Though
he
said
this
,
 
saying
it
because
it
was
the
common
-
place
common
-
sense
sort
of
thing
to
say
,
still
at
the
very
moment
there
was
the
shadow
of
the
truth
before
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
What
if
this
headache
meant
simple
dislike
to
him
,
and
to
his
modes
of
life
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
nothing
of
that
sort
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
impatient
at
having
her
ailment
inquired
into
with
so
much
accuracy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
is
it
?
<EOS>
You
can
not
think
that
I
can
be
happy
to
hear
you
complaining
of
headache
every
day
,
 
making
it
an
excuse
for
absolute
idleness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
that
you
want
me
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
jumping
up
from
her
seat
.
"
<EOS>
Set
me
a
task
,
and
if
I
do
n't
go
mad
over
it
,
I
'll
get
through
it
.
<EOS>
There
are
the
account
books
.
<EOS>
Give
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
I
can
see
the
figures
,
but
I
'll
try
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
this
is
unkind
of
you
,
 
and
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
;
 
it
is
everything
that
is
bad
.
<EOS>
What
a
pity
that
you
did
not
find
it
out
last
year
!
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
what
am
I
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
threw
herself
down
upon
the
sofa
,
and
put
both
her
hands
up
to
her
temples
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
send
for
Dr.
Macnuthrie
at
once
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
walking
towards
the
door
very
slowly
,
and
speaking
as
slowly
as
he
walked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
do
no
such
thing
,
"
she
said
,
springing
to
her
feet
again
and
intercepting
him
before
he
reached
the
door

<EOS>
"
If
he
comes
I
will
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
give
you
my
word
that
I
will
not
speak
to
him
if
he
comes
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
understand
,
"
she
said
;
"
you
do
not
understand
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
that
I
ought
to
understand
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
a
woman
does
not
like
to
be
bothered
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
no
reply
at
once
,
but
stood
there
twisting
the
handle
of
the
door
,
and
collecting
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
he
at
last
;
"
I
am
beginning
to
find
that
out
;
 
and
to
find
out
also
what
it
is
that
bothers
a
woman
,
as
you
call
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
see
now
what
it
is
that
makes
your
head
ache
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
the
stomach
.
<EOS>
You
are
quite
right
there
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
prospect
of
a
quiet
decent
life
,
to
which
would
be
attached
the
performance
of
certain
homely
duties
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Macnuthrie
is
a
learned
man
,
but
I
doubt
whether
he
can
do
anything
for
such
a
malady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
,
Robert
;
he
can
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
malady
you
must
cure
for
yourself
,
Laura
;
 
and
which
is
to
be
cured
by
perseverance
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
bring
yourself
to
try
 
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
bring
myself
to
try
at
all
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
Laura
,
that
you
will
make
no
effort
to
do
your
duty
as
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
tell
you
that
I
will
not
try
to
cure
a
headache
by
doing
sums
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
that
I
mean
to
say
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
leave
me
for
awhile
,
so
that
I
may
lie
down
<EOS>
,
perhaps
I
shall
be
able
to
come
to
dinner
.
"
<EOS>
He
still
hesitated
,
standing
with
the
door
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
go
on
scolding
me
,
"
she
continued
,
"
what
I
shall
do
is
to
go
to
bed
<EOS>
directly
you
go
away
.
"
<EOS>
He
hesitated
for
a
moment
longer
,
and
then
left
the
room
without
another
word
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Slide
's
Grievance
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
was
elected
member
for
Loughton
without
any
trouble
to
him
or
,
as
far
as
he
could
see
,
to
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
He
made
one
speech
from
a
small
raised
booth
that
was
called
a
platform
,
and
that
was
all
that
he
was
called
upon
to
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Grating
made
a
speech
in
proposing
him
,
and
Mr.
Shortribs
another
in
seconding
him
;
and
these
were
all
the
speeches
that
were
required
.
<EOS>
The
thing
seemed
to
be
so
very
easy
that
he
was
afterwards
almost
offended
when
he
was
told
that
the
bill
for
so
insignificant
a
piece
of
work
came
to
£
247
13s
.
<EOS>
9d
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
no
occasion
for
spending
even
the
odd
forty
-
seven
pounds
.
<EOS>
But
then
he
was
member
for
Loughton
;
and
as
he
passed
the
evening
alone
at
the
inn
,
having
dined
in
company
with
Messrs.
Grating
,
Shortribs
,
and
sundry
other
influential
electors
,
he
began
to
reflect
that
,
after
all
,
it
was
not
so
very
great
a
thing
to
be
a
member
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
It
almost
seemed
that
that
which
had
come
to
him
so
easily
could
not
be
of
much
value
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
he
went
to
the
castle
,
and
was
there
when
the
Earl
arrived
.
<EOS>
They
two
were
alone
together
,
and
the
Earl
was
very
kind
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
had
no
opponent
after
all
,
"
said
the
great
man
of
Loughton
,
with
a
slight
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
the
ghost
of
another
candidate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
think
there
would
be
.
<EOS>
They
have
tried
it
once
or
twice
and
have
always
failed
.
<EOS>
There
are
only
one
or
two
in
the
place
who
like
to
go
one
way
just
because
their
neighbours
go
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
there
is
no
conservative
feeling
in
the
place
!
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
although
he
was
at
the
present
moment
the
member
for
Loughton
himself
,
could
not
but
enjoy
the
joke
of
this
.
<EOS>
Could
there
be
any
liberal
feeling
in
such
a
place
,
or
,
indeed
,
any
political
feeling
whatsoever
?
<EOS>
Would
not
Messrs.
Grating
and
Shortribs
have
done
just
the
same
<EOS>
had
it
happened
that
Lord
Brentford
had
been
a
Tory
peer
?
<EOS>
"
They
all
seemed
to
be
very
obliging
,
"
said
Phineas
,
in
answer
to
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
they
are
.
<EOS>
There
is
n't
a
house
in
the
town
,
you
know
,
let
for
longer
than
seven
years
,
and
most
of
them
merely
from
year
to
year
.
<EOS>
And
,
do
you
know
,
I
have
n't
a
farmer
on
the
property
with
a
lease
,
 
not
one
;
and
they
do
n't
want
leases
.
<EOS>
They
know
they
're
safe
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
like
the
people
round
me
to
be
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
as
myself
about
politics
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
second
day
after
dinner
,
 
the
last
evening
of
Finn
's
visit
to
Saulsby
,
 
the
Earl
fell
suddenly
into
a
confidential
conversation
about
his
daughter
and
his
son
,
and
about
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
So
sudden
,
indeed
,
and
so
confidential
was
the
conversation
,
that
Phineas
was
almost
silenced
for
awhile
.
<EOS>
A
word
or
two
had
been
said
about
Loughlinter
,
of
the
beauty
of
the
place
and
of
the
vastness
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
almost
afraid
,
"
said
Lord
Brentford
,
"
that
Laura
is
not
happy
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
is
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
so
hard
and
dry
,
and
what
I
call
exacting
.
<EOS>
That
is
just
the
word
for
it
.
<EOS>
Now
Laura
has
never
been
used
to
that
.
<EOS>
With
me
she
always
had
her
own
way
in
everything
,
and
I
always
found
her
fit
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
why
her
husband
should
treat
her
differently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
is
the
temper
of
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Temper
,
yes
;
but
what
a
bad
prospect
is
that
for
her
!
<EOS>
And
she
,
too
,
has
a
temper
,
and
so
he
will
find
if
he
tries
her
too
far
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stand
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
I
told
Laura
so
fairly
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
those
houses
in
which
a
man
can
not
call
his
hours
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
told
Laura
that
I
could
not
undertake
to
remain
there
for
above
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
sad
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
;
it
is
sad
for
her
,
poor
girl
;
and
very
sad
for
me
too
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
one
else
<EOS>
but
Laura
,
 
literally
no
one
;
and
now
I
am
divided
from
her
!
<EOS>
It
seems
that
she
has
been
taken
as
much
away
from
me
as
though
her
husband
lived
in
China
.
<EOS>
I
have
lost
them
both
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
I
have
.
<EOS>
As
to
Chiltern
,
I
can
perceive
that
he
becomes
more
and
more
indifferent
to
me
every
day
.
<EOS>
He
thinks
of
me
only
as
a
man
in
his
way
who
must
die
some
day
and
may
die
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wrong
him
,
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wrong
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
Why
has
he
answered
every
offer
I
have
made
him
with
so
much
insolence
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
put
myself
into
further
communion
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
thinks
that
you
have
wronged
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
because
I
have
been
unable
to
shut
my
eyes
to
his
mode
of
living
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
go
on
paying
his
debts
,
and
taking
no
other
notice
whatsoever
of
his
conduct
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
is
in
debt
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Because
his
sister
the
other
day
spent
every
shilling
of
her
fortune
in
paying
them
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
£
40,000
!
<EOS>
Do
you
think
she
would
have
married
Kennedy
but
for
that
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
prevent
her
.
<EOS>
I
had
said
that
I
would
not
cripple
my
remaining
years
of
life
by
raising
the
money
,
and
I
could
not
go
back
from
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
and
Chiltern
might
raise
the
money
between
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
do
no
good
now
.
<EOS>
She
has
married
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
the
money
is
nothing
to
her
or
to
him
.
<EOS>
Chiltern
might
have
put
things
right
by
marrying
Miss
Effingham
if
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
did
his
best
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
he
did
his
worst
.
<EOS>
He
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
as
a
man
asks
for
a
railway
-
ticket
or
a
pair
of
gloves
,
which
he
buys
with
a
price
;
and
because
she
would
not
jump
into
his
mouth
he
gave
it
up
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
he
even
really
wanted
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
has
some
disreputable
connection
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
He
would
marry
her
to
-
morrow
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
My
belief
is
that
Miss
Effingham
is
sincere
in
refusing
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
doubt
her
sincerity
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
that
she
will
never
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
well
;
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
,
and
I
daresay
I
know
them
both
better
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
But
everything
goes
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
set
my
heart
upon
it
,
and
therefore
of
course
I
shall
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
What
is
he
going
to
do
this
autumn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
yachting
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
are
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
the
boat
belongs
to
Captain
Colepepper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
greatest
blackguard
in
all
England
!
<EOS>
A
man
who
shoots
pigeons
and
rides
steeple
-
chases
!
<EOS>
And
the
worst
of
Chiltern
is
this
,
that
even
if
he
did
n't
like
the
man
,
and
if
he
were
tired
of
this
sort
of
life
,
he
would
go
on
just
the
same
because
he
thinks
it
a
fine
thing
not
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
so
true
that
Phineas
did
not
dare
to
contradict
the
statement
,
and
therefore
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
some
faint
hope
,
"
continued
the
Earl
,
"
while
Laura
could
always
watch
him
;
because
,
in
his
way
,
he
was
fond
of
his
sister
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
She
will
have
enough
to
do
to
watch
herself
!
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
felt
that
the
Earl
had
put
him
down
rather
sharply
when
he
had
said
that
Violet
would
never
accept
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
he
was
therefore
not
a
little
surprised
when
Lord
Brentford
spoke
again
of
Miss
Effingham
the
following
morning
,
holding
in
his
hand
a
letter
which
he
had
just
received
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
to
be
at
Loughlinter
on
the
tenth
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
she
purposes
to
come
here
for
a
couple
of
nights
on
her
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Baldock
and
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
;
Lady
Baldock
and
all
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
very
fond
of
Lady
Baldock
,
but
I
will
put
up
with
her
for
a
couple
of
days
for
the
sake
of
having
Violet
.
<EOS>
She
is
more
like
a
child
of
my
own
now
than
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
see
her
all
the
autumn
afterwards
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stand
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
better
when
the
house
is
full
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
there
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
no
;
I
think
not
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
enough
of
it
,
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
made
no
reply
to
this
,
but
smiled
slightly
.
<EOS>
"
By
Jove
,
I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
would
have
given
all
he
had
in
the
world
to
be
staying
in
the
same
country
house
with
Violet
Effingham
,
could
not
explain
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
he
was
obliged
to
absent
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
were
asked
?
"
said
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
I
was
asked
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
kinder
than
they
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Kennedy
told
me
that
you
were
coming
as
a
matter
of
course
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
explained
to
him
after
that
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
that
I
should
not
return
.
<EOS>
I
shall
go
over
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
deal
of
hard
reading
to
do
,
and
I
can
get
through
it
there
without
interruption
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
up
from
Saulsby
to
London
on
that
day
,
and
found
himself
quite
alone
in
Mrs.
Bunce
's
lodgings
.
<EOS>
I
mean
not
only
that
he
was
alone
at
his
lodgings
,
but
he
was
alone
at
his
club
,
and
alone
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
July
was
not
quite
over
,
and
yet
all
the
birds
of
passage
had
migrated
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
by
his
short
session
,
had
half
ruined
the
London
tradesmen
,
and
had
changed
the
summer
mode
of
life
of
all
those
who
account
themselves
to
be
anybody
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
sat
alone
in
his
room
,
felt
himself
to
be
nobody
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
the
Earl
that
he
was
going
to
Ireland
,
and
to
Ireland
he
must
go
;
 
because
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
asked
indeed
to
join
one
or
two
parties
in
their
autumn
plans
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
had
wanted
him
to
go
to
the
Pyrenees
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
had
suggested
that
he
should
join
the
yacht
;
 
but
neither
plan
suited
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
suited
him
to
be
at
Loughlinter
with
Violet
Effingham
,
but
Loughlinter
was
a
barred
house
to
him
.
<EOS>
His
old
friend
,
Lady
Laura
,
had
told
him
not
to
come
thither
,
explaining
,
with
sufficient
clearness
,
her
reasons
for
excluding
him
from
the
number
of
her
husband
's
guests
.
<EOS>
As
he
thought
of
it
the
past
scenes
of
his
life
became
very
marvellous
to
him
.
<EOS>
Twelve
months
since
he
would
have
given
all
the
world
for
a
word
of
love
from
Lady
Laura
,
and
had
barely
dared
to
hope
that
such
a
word
,
at
some
future
day
,
might
possibly
be
spoken
.
<EOS>
Now
such
a
word
had
in
truth
been
spoken
,
and
it
had
come
to
be
simply
a
trouble
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
owned
to
him
,
 
for
,
in
truth
,
such
had
been
the
meaning
of
her
warning
to
him
,
 
that
,
though
she
had
married
another
man
,
she
had
loved
and
did
love
him
.
<EOS>
But
in
thinking
of
this
he
took
no
pride
in
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
he
had
thought
of
it
long
that
he
began
to
ask
himself
whether
he
might
not
be
justified
in
gathering
from
what
happened
some
hope
that
Violet
also
might
learn
to
love
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
so
little
of
himself
as
to
have
been
afraid
at
first
to
press
his
suit
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Might
he
not
venture
to
think
more
of
himself
,
having
learned
how
far
he
had
succeeded
?
  
<EOS>
But
how
was
he
to
get
at
Violet
Effingham
?
<EOS>
From
the
moment
at
which
he
had
left
Saulsby
he
had
been
angry
with
himself
for
not
having
asked
Lord
Brentford
to
allow
him
to
remain
there
till
after
the
Baldock
party
should
have
gone
on
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
who
was
very
lonely
in
his
house
,
would
have
consented
at
once
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
indeed
,
was
driven
to
confess
to
himself
<EOS>
that
success
with
Violet
would
at
once
have
put
an
end
to
all
his
friendship
with
Lord
Brentford
;
 
as
also
to
all
his
friendship
with
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
He
would
,
in
such
case
,
be
bound
in
honour
to
vacate
his
seat
and
give
back
Loughton
to
his
offended
patron
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
have
given
up
much
more
than
his
seat
for
Violet
Effingham
!
<EOS>
At
present
,
however
,
he
had
no
means
of
getting
at
her
to
ask
her
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
go
to
Loughlinter
in
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
adventure
happened
to
him
in
London
which
somewhat
relieved
the
dulness
of
the
days
of
the
first
week
in
August
.
<EOS>
He
remained
in
London
till
the
middle
of
August
,
half
resolving
to
rush
down
to
Saulsby
when
Violet
Effingham
should
be
there
,
 
endeavouring
to
find
some
excuse
for
such
a
proceeding
,
but
racking
his
brains
in
vain
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
there
came
about
his
little
adventure
.
<EOS>
The
adventure
was
commenced
by
the
receipt
of
the
following
letter
:
    
Banner
of
the
People
Office
,
3rd
August
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FINN
,
  
<EOS>
I
must
say
I
think
you
have
treated
me
badly
,
and
without
that
sort
of
brotherly
fairness
which
we
on
the
public
press
expect
from
one
another
.
<EOS>
However
,
perhaps
we
can
come
to
an
understanding
,
and
if
so
,
things
may
yet
go
smoothly
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
turn
<EOS>
and
I
am
not
at
all
adverse
to
give
you
one
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
to
me
here
,
or
shall
I
call
upon
you
?
  
<EOS>
Yours
always
,
Q.
S.
  
Phineas
was
not
only
surprised
,
but
disgusted
also
,
at
the
receipt
of
this
letter
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
imagine
what
was
the
deed
by
which
he
had
offended
Mr.
Slide
.
<EOS>
He
thought
over
all
the
circumstances
of
his
short
connection
with
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
but
could
remember
nothing
which
might
have
created
offence
.
<EOS>
But
his
disgust
was
greater
than
his
surprise
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
had
done
nothing
and
said
nothing
to
justify
Quintus
Slide
in
calling
him
"
dear
Finn
.
"
<EOS>
He
,
who
had
Lady
Laura
's
secret
in
his
keeping
;
he
who
hoped
to
be
the
possessor
of
Violet
Effingham
's
affections
,
 
he
to
be
called
"
dear
Finn
"
by
such
a
one
as
Quintus
Slide
!
<EOS>
He
soon
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
answer
the
note
,
but
would
go
at
once
to
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
office
at
the
hour
at
which
Quintus
Slide
was
always
there
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
would
not
write
to
"
dear
Slide
;
"
and
,
until
he
had
heard
something
more
of
this
cause
of
offence
,
he
would
not
make
an
enemy
for
ever
by
calling
the
man
"
dear
Sir
.
"
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
office
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
and
found
Mr.
Slide
ensconced
in
a
little
glass
cupboard
,
writing
an
article
for
the
next
day
's
copy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
're
very
busy
,
"
said
Phineas
,
inserting
himself
with
some
difficulty
on
to
a
little
stool
in
the
corner
of
the
cupboard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
particular
but
<EOS>
what
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
You
shoot
,
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shoot
!
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
possible
that
Mr.
Slide
was
intending
,
after
this
abrupt
fashion
,
to
propose
a
duel
with
pistols
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grouse
and
pheasants
,
and
them
sort
of
things
?
"
asked
Mr.
Slide
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
ah
;
I
understand
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
shoot
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
the
12th
or
20th
for
grouse
in
Scotland
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
The
12th
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
What
makes
you
ask
that
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
doing
a
letter
about
it
,
 
advising
men
not
to
shoot
too
many
of
the
young
birds
,
and
showing
that
they
'll
have
none
next
year
if
they
do
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
fellow
here
just
now
who
knew
all
about
it
,
and
he
put
down
a
lot
;
but
I
forgot
to
make
him
tell
me
the
day
of
beginning
.
<EOS>
What
's
a
good
place
to
date
from
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
suggested
Callender
or
Stirling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stirling
's
too
much
of
a
town
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
Callender
sounds
better
for
game
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
the
letter
which
was
to
save
the
young
grouse
was
dated
from
Callender
;
and
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
having
written
the
word
,
threw
down
his
pen
,
came
off
his
stool
,
and
rushed
at
once
at
his
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
now
,
Finn
,
"
he
said
,
"
do
n't
you
know
that
you
've
treated
me
badly
about
Loughton
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Treated
you
badly
about
Loughton
!
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
repeated
the
words
,
was
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
Mr.
Slide
's
meaning
.
<EOS>
Did
Mr.
Slide
intend
to
convey
a
reproach
because
Phineas
had
not
personally
sent
some
tidings
of
the
election
to
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
?
  
<EOS>
"
Very
badly
,
"
said
Mr.
Slide
,
with
his
arms
akimbo
,
 
"
very
badly
indeed
!
<EOS>
Men
on
the
press
together
do
expect
that
they
're
to
be
stuck
by
,
and
not
thrown
over
.
<EOS>
Damn
it
,
I
say
;
what
's
the
good
of
a
brotherhood
if
it
ai
n't
to
be
brotherhood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
tell
you
that
I
had
Loughton
in
my
heye
?
"
said
Quintus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
 
h
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
well
to
say
ho
,
and
look
guilty
,
but
did
n't
I
tell
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
such
nonsense
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
on
earth
could
you
have
stood
for
Loughton
?
<EOS>
What
interest
would
you
have
there
?
<EOS>
You
could
not
even
have
found
an
elector
to
propose
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
,
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
thrown
me
over
most
shabby
,
but
I
wo
n't
stand
about
that
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
Loughton
this
session
if
you
'll
promise
to
make
way
for
me
after
the
next
election
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
agree
to
that
,
we
'll
have
a
special
leader
to
say
how
well
Lord
What's
-
his
-
name
has
done
with
the
borough
;
and
we
'll
be
your
horgan
through
the
whole
session
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
such
nonsense
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
Loughton
is
safe
to
be
in
the
schedule
of
reduced
boroughs
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
thrown
into
the
county
,
or
joined
with
a
group
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
stand
the
chance
of
that
.
<EOS>
Will
you
agree
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Agree
!
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
It
's
the
most
absurd
proposal
that
was
ever
made
.
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
ask
me
whether
I
would
agree
that
you
should
go
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
Go
to
heaven
if
you
can
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
slightest
objection
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
nothing
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Quintus
Slide
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
well
!
<EOS>
Now
we
understand
each
other
,
and
that
's
all
that
I
desire
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
I
can
show
you
what
it
is
to
come
among
gentlemen
of
the
press
,
and
then
to
throw
them
over
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
Phineas
,
quite
satisfied
at
the
result
of
the
interview
as
regarded
himself
,
and
by
no
means
sorry
that
there
should
have
arisen
a
cause
of
separation
between
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
and
his
"
dear
Finn
,
"
shook
off
a
little
dust
from
his
foot
as
he
left
the
office
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
and
resolved
that
in
future
he
would
attempt
to
make
no
connection
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
As
he
returned
home
he
told
himself
that
a
member
of
Parliament
should
be
altogether
independent
of
the
press
.
<EOS>
On
the
second
morning
after
his
meeting
with
his
late
friend
,
he
saw
the
result
of
his
independence
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
startling
article
,
a
tremendous
article
,
showing
the
pressing
necessity
of
immediate
reform
,
and
proving
the
necessity
by
an
illustration
of
the
borough
-
mongering
rottenness
of
the
present
system
.
<EOS>
When
such
a
patron
as
Lord
Brentford
,
 
himself
a
Cabinet
Minister
with
a
sinecure
,
 
could
by
his
mere
word
put
into
the
House
such
a
stick
as
Phineas
Finn
,
 
a
man
who
had
struggled
to
stand
on
his
legs
before
the
Speaker
,
but
had
wanted
both
the
courage
and
the
capacity
,
nothing
further
could
surely
be
wanted
to
prove
that
the
Reform
Bill
of
1832
required
to
be
supplemented
by
some
more
energetic
measure
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
laughed
as
he
read
the
article
,
and
declared
to
himself
that
the
joke
was
a
good
joke
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
he
suffered
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
,
when
he
was
really
anxious
to
use
his
thong
earnestly
,
could
generally
raise
a
wale
.
   
<EOS>
Was
He
Honest
?
 
<EOS>
On
the
10th
of
August
,
Phineas
Finn
did
return
to
Loughton
.
<EOS>
He
went
down
by
the
mail
train
on
the
night
of
the
10th
,
having
telegraphed
to
the
inn
for
a
bed
,
and
was
up
eating
his
breakfast
in
that
hospitable
house
at
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
and
landlady
with
all
their
staff
were
at
a
loss
to
imagine
what
had
brought
down
their
member
again
so
quickly
to
his
borough
;
but
the
reader
,
who
will
remember
that
Lady
Baldock
with
her
daughter
and
Violet
Effingham
were
to
pass
the
11th
of
the
month
at
Saulsby
,
may
perhaps
be
able
to
make
a
guess
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
been
thinking
of
making
this
sudden
visit
to
Loughton
ever
since
he
had
been
up
in
town
,
but
he
could
suggest
to
himself
no
reason
to
be
given
to
Lord
Brentford
for
his
sudden
reappearance
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
had
been
very
kind
to
him
,
but
he
had
said
nothing
which
could
justify
his
young
friend
in
running
in
and
out
of
Saulsby
Castle
at
pleasure
,
without
invitation
and
without
notice
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
so
well
aware
of
this
himself
that
often
as
he
had
half
resolved
during
the
last
ten
days
to
return
to
Saulsby
,
so
often
had
he
determined
that
he
could
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
could
think
of
no
excuse
.
<EOS>
Then
the
heavens
favoured
him
,
and
he
received
a
letter
from
Lord
Chiltern
,
in
which
there
was
a
message
for
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
see
my
father
,
tell
him
that
I
am
ready
at
any
moment
to
do
what
is
necessary
for
raising
the
money
for
Laura
.
"
<EOS>
Taking
this
as
his
excuse
he
returned
to
Loughton
.
  
<EOS>
As
chance
arranged
it
,
he
met
the
Earl
standing
on
the
great
steps
before
his
own
castle
doors
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
Finn
;
is
this
you
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
my
lord
,
as
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
opened
his
budget
at
once
,
and
blushed
at
his
own
hypocrisy
as
he
went
on
with
his
story
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
he
said
,
felt
the
message
from
Chiltern
to
be
so
all
-
important
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
go
over
to
Ireland
without
delivering
it
.
<EOS>
He
urged
upon
the
Earl
that
he
might
learn
from
this
how
anxious
Lord
Chiltern
was
to
effect
a
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
When
it
occurred
to
him
,
he
said
,
that
there
might
be
a
hope
of
doing
anything
towards
such
an
object
,
he
could
not
go
to
Ireland
leaving
the
good
work
behind
him
.
<EOS>
In
love
and
war
all
things
are
fair
.
<EOS>
So
he
declared
to
himself
;
but
as
he
did
so
he
felt
that
his
story
was
so
weak
that
it
would
hardly
gain
for
him
an
admittance
into
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
In
this
he
was
completely
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
swallowing
the
bait
,
put
his
arm
through
that
of
the
intruder
,
and
,
walking
with
him
through
the
paths
of
the
shrubbery
,
at
length
confessed
that
he
would
be
glad
to
be
reconciled
to
his
son
if
it
were
possible
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
here
,
and
she
shall
be
here
also
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
speaking
of
Violet
.
<EOS>
To
this
Phineas
could
say
nothing
out
loud
,
but
he
told
himself
that
all
should
be
fair
between
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
no
dishonest
advantage
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
He
would
give
Lord
Chiltern
the
whole
message
as
it
was
given
to
him
by
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
But
should
it
so
turn
out
that
he
himself
got
an
opportunity
of
saying
to
Violet
all
that
he
had
come
to
say
,
and
should
it
also
turn
out
,
 
an
event
which
he
acknowledged
to
himself
to
be
most
unlikely
,
 
that
Violet
did
not
reject
him
,
then
how
could
he
write
his
letter
to
Lord
Chiltern
?
<EOS>
So
he
resolved
that
the
letter
should
be
written
before
he
saw
Violet
.
<EOS>
But
how
could
he
write
such
a
letter
and
instantly
afterwards
do
that
which
would
be
false
to
the
spirit
of
a
letter
so
written
?
<EOS>
Could
he
bid
Lord
Chiltern
come
home
to
woo
Violet
Effingham
,
and
instantly
go
forth
to
woo
her
for
himself
?
<EOS>
He
found
that
he
could
not
do
so
,
 
unless
he
told
the
whole
truth
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
In
no
other
way
could
he
carry
out
his
project
and
satisfy
his
own
idea
of
what
was
honest
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
bade
him
send
to
the
hotel
for
his
things
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Baldock
people
are
all
here
,
you
know
,
but
they
go
very
early
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
declared
that
he
also
must
return
to
London
very
early
on
the
morrow
;
 
but
in
the
meantime
he
would
go
to
the
inn
and
fetch
his
things
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
thanked
him
again
and
again
for
his
generous
kindness
;
and
Phineas
,
blushing
as
he
received
the
thanks
,
went
back
and
wrote
his
letter
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
elaborate
letter
,
written
,
as
regards
the
first
and
larger
portion
of
it
,
with
words
intended
to
bring
the
prodigal
son
back
to
the
father
's
home
.
<EOS>
And
everything
was
said
about
Miss
Effingham
that
could
or
should
have
been
said
.
<EOS>
Then
,
on
the
last
page
,
he
told
his
own
story
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
must
speak
of
myself
:
"
 
and
he
went
on
to
explain
to
his
friend
,
in
the
plainest
language
that
he
could
use
,
his
own
position
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
loved
her
,
"
he
said
,
"
for
six
months
,
and
I
am
here
with
the
express
intention
of
asking
her
to
take
me
.
<EOS>
The
chances
are
ten
to
one
that
she
refuses
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
deprecate
your
anger
,
 
if
you
choose
to
be
angry
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
endeavouring
to
treat
you
well
,
and
I
ask
you
to
do
the
same
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
convey
to
you
your
father
's
message
,
and
after
doing
so
I
can
not
address
myself
to
Miss
Effingham
without
telling
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
feel
myself
to
be
false
<EOS>
were
I
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
In
the
event
,
 
the
probable
,
nay
,
almost
certain
event
of
my
being
refused
,
 
I
shall
trust
you
to
keep
my
secret
.
<EOS>
Do
not
quarrel
with
me
if
you
can
help
it
;
 
but
if
you
must
I
will
be
ready
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
posted
the
letter
and
went
up
to
the
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
only
the
one
day
for
his
action
,
and
he
knew
that
Violet
was
watched
by
Lady
Baldock
as
by
a
dragon
.
<EOS>
He
was
told
that
the
Earl
was
out
with
the
young
ladies
,
and
was
shown
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
On
going
to
the
drawing
-
room
he
found
Lady
Baldock
,
with
whom
he
had
been
,
to
a
certain
degree
,
a
favourite
,
and
was
soon
deeply
engaged
in
a
conversation
as
to
the
practicability
of
shutting
up
all
the
breweries
and
distilleries
by
Act
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
But
lunch
relieved
him
,
and
brought
the
young
ladies
in
at
two
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
seemed
to
be
really
glad
to
see
him
,
and
even
Miss
Boreham
,
Lady
Baldock
's
daughter
,
was
very
gracious
to
him
.
<EOS>
For
the
Earl
had
been
speaking
well
of
his
young
member
,
and
Phineas
had
in
a
way
grown
into
the
good
graces
of
sober
and
discreet
people
.
<EOS>
After
lunch
they
were
to
ride
;
 
the
Earl
,
that
is
,
and
Violet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
and
her
daughter
were
to
have
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
mount
you
,
Finn
,
if
you
would
like
it
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
he
'll
like
it
,
"
said
Violet
;
"
do
you
suppose
Mr.
Finn
will
object
to
ride
with
me
in
Saulsby
Woods
?
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
be
the
first
time
,
will
it
?
"
<EOS>
"
Violet
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
,
"
you
have
the
most
singular
way
of
talking
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
have
,
"
said
Violet
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
do
n't
think
I
can
change
it
now
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
knows
me
too
well
to
mind
it
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
past
five
before
they
were
on
horseback
,
and
up
to
that
time
Phineas
had
not
found
himself
alone
with
Violet
Effingham
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
They
had
sat
together
after
lunch
in
the
dining
-
room
for
nearly
an
hour
,
and
had
sauntered
into
the
hall
and
knocked
about
the
billiard
balls
,
and
then
stood
together
at
the
open
doors
of
a
conservatory
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Baldock
or
Miss
Boreham
had
always
been
there
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
pleasant
than
Miss
Effingham
's
words
,
or
more
familiar
than
her
manner
to
Phineas
.
<EOS>
She
had
expressed
strong
delight
at
his
success
in
getting
a
seat
in
Parliament
,
and
had
talked
to
him
about
the
Kennedys
as
though
they
had
created
some
special
bond
of
union
between
her
and
Phineas
which
ought
to
make
them
intimate
.
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
that
,
she
could
not
be
got
to
separate
herself
from
Lady
Baldock
;
 
and
when
she
was
told
that
if
she
meant
to
ride
she
must
go
and
dress
herself
,
she
went
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
thought
that
he
might
have
a
chance
on
horseback
;
and
after
they
had
been
out
about
half
an
hour
,
chance
did
favour
him
.
<EOS>
For
awhile
he
rode
behind
with
the
carriage
,
calculating
that
by
his
so
doing
the
Earl
would
be
put
off
his
guard
,
and
would
be
disposed
after
awhile
to
change
places
with
him
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
fell
out
.
<EOS>
At
a
certain
fall
of
ground
in
the
park
,
where
the
road
turned
round
and
crossed
a
bridge
over
the
little
river
,
the
carriage
came
up
with
the
first
two
horses
,
and
Lady
Baldock
spoke
a
word
to
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
Then
Violet
pulled
up
,
allowing
the
vehicle
to
pass
the
bridge
first
,
and
in
this
way
she
and
Phineas
were
brought
together
,
 
and
in
this
way
they
rode
on
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
aware
that
he
must
greatly
increase
the
distance
between
them
and
the
others
of
their
party
before
he
could
dare
to
plead
his
suit
,
and
even
were
that
done
<EOS>
he
felt
that
he
would
not
know
how
to
plead
it
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
gone
on
some
half
mile
in
this
way
when
they
reached
a
spot
on
which
a
green
ride
led
away
from
the
main
road
through
the
trees
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
"
You
remember
this
place
,
do
you
not
?
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
Phineas
declared
that
he
remembered
it
well
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
round
by
the
woodman
's
cottage
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
mind
coming
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
said
that
he
would
not
mind
,
and
trotted
on
to
tell
them
in
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
going
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Lady
Baldock
;
and
then
,
when
Phineas
explained
,
she
begged
the
Earl
to
go
back
to
Violet
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
feeling
the
absurdity
of
this
,
declared
that
Violet
knew
her
way
very
well
herself
,
and
thus
Phineas
got
his
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
They
rode
on
almost
without
speaking
for
nearly
a
mile
,
cantering
through
the
trees
,
and
then
they
took
another
turn
to
the
right
,
and
came
upon
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
They
rode
to
the
door
,
and
spoke
a
word
or
two
to
the
woman
there
,
and
then
passed
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
come
here
when
I
am
at
Saulsby
,
"
said
Violet
,
"
that
I
may
teach
myself
to
think
kindly
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
it
all
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
used
to
be
so
nice
;
 
and
is
so
still
,
I
believe
,
only
that
he
has
taught
himself
to
be
so
rough
.
<EOS>
Will
he
ever
change
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
knew
that
in
this
emergency
it
was
his
especial
duty
to
be
honest
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
would
be
changed
altogether
if
we
could
bring
him
here
,
 
so
that
he
should
live
among
his
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
he
would
?
<EOS>
We
must
put
our
heads
together
,
and
do
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
that
it
is
to
be
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
replied
that
he
thought
it
was
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
the
truth
at
once
,
Miss
Effingham
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
do
it
by
a
single
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
yes
;
"
she
said
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
mean
that
;
 
without
that
.
<EOS>
It
is
absurd
,
you
know
,
that
a
father
should
make
such
a
condition
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
said
that
he
thought
it
was
absurd
;
and
then
they
rode
on
again
,
cantering
through
the
wood
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
bold
to
speak
to
her
about
Lord
Chiltern
as
he
had
done
,
and
she
had
answered
just
as
he
would
have
wished
to
be
answered
.
<EOS>
But
how
could
he
press
his
suit
for
himself
while
she
was
cantering
by
his
side
?
  
<EOS>
Presently
they
came
to
rough
ground
over
which
they
were
forced
to
walk
,
and
he
was
close
by
her
side
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
said
,
"
I
wonder
whether
I
may
ask
a
question
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
question
,
"
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
quarrel
between
you
and
Lady
Laura
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Or
between
you
and
him
?
"
  
"
No
;
 
none
.
<EOS>
We
are
greater
allies
than
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
are
you
not
going
to
be
at
Loughlinter
?
<EOS>
She
has
written
to
me
expressly
saying
you
would
not
be
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
before
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
did
not
suit
,
"
he
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
secret
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
it
is
a
secret
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
angry
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Angry
;
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
a
secret
of
my
own
,
or
I
should
not
keep
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
can
guess
it
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
try
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
even
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
cause
,
whatever
it
be
,
has
been
full
of
sorrow
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
given
my
left
hand
to
have
been
at
Loughlinter
this
autumn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
so
fond
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
staying
there
with
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
He
paused
,
and
for
a
moment
there
was
no
word
spoken
by
either
of
them
;
but
he
could
perceive
that
the
hand
in
which
she
held
her
whip
was
playing
with
her
horse
's
mane
with
a
nervous
movement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
I
found
how
it
must
be
,
and
that
I
must
miss
you
,
I
rushed
down
here
that
I
might
see
you
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
am
here
<EOS>
I
do
not
dare
to
speak
to
you
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
now
beyond
the
rocks
,
and
Violet
,
without
speaking
a
word
,
again
put
her
horse
into
a
trot
.
<EOS>
He
was
by
her
side
in
a
moment
,
but
he
could
not
see
her
face
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
not
a
word
to
say
to
me
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
no
;
 
no
<EOS>
;
"
she
replied
,
"
not
a
word
when
you
speak
to
me
like
that
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
Come
;
 
we
will
join
them
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
cantered
on
,
and
he
followed
her
till
they
reached
the
Earl
and
Lady
Baldock
and
Miss
Boreham
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
my
devotions
now
,
"
said
Miss
Effingham
,
"
and
am
ready
to
return
to
ordinary
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
could
not
find
another
moment
in
which
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
Though
he
spent
the
evening
with
her
,
and
stood
over
her
as
she
sang
at
the
Earl
's
request
,
and
pressed
her
hand
as
she
went
to
bed
,
and
was
up
to
see
her
start
in
the
morning
,
he
could
not
draw
from
her
either
a
word
or
a
look
.
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
upon
Reform
 
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
went
to
Ireland
immediately
after
his
return
from
Saulsby
,
having
said
nothing
further
to
Violet
Effingham
,
and
having
heard
nothing
further
from
her
than
what
is
recorded
in
the
last
chapter
.
<EOS>
He
felt
very
keenly
that
his
position
was
unsatisfactory
,
and
brooded
over
it
all
the
autumn
and
early
winter
;
but
he
could
form
no
plan
for
improving
it
.
<EOS>
A
dozen
times
he
thought
of
writing
to
Miss
Effingham
,
and
asking
for
an
explicit
answer
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
bring
himself
to
write
the
letter
,
thinking
that
written
expressions
of
love
are
always
weak
and
vapid
,
 
and
deterred
also
by
a
conviction
that
Violet
,
if
driven
to
reply
in
writing
,
would
undoubtedly
reply
by
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
Fifty
times
he
rode
again
in
his
imagination
his
ride
in
Saulsby
Wood
,
and
he
told
himself
as
often
that
the
syren
's
answer
to
him
,
 
her
<EOS>
no
,
no
,
no
,
 
had
been
,
of
all
possible
answers
,
the
most
indefinite
and
provoking
.
<EOS>
The
tone
of
her
voice
as
she
galloped
away
from
him
,
the
bearing
of
her
countenance
when
he
rejoined
her
,
her
manner
to
him
when
he
saw
her
start
from
the
Castle
in
the
morning
,
all
forbade
him
to
believe
that
his
words
to
her
had
been
taken
as
an
offence
.
<EOS>
She
had
replied
to
him
with
a
direct
negative
,
simply
with
the
word
"
no
;
"
but
she
had
so
said
it
that
there
had
hardly
been
any
sting
in
the
no
;
and
he
had
known
at
the
moment
that
whatever
might
be
the
result
of
his
suit
,
he
need
not
regard
Violet
Effingham
as
his
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
doubt
made
his
sojourn
in
Ireland
very
wearisome
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
there
were
other
matters
which
tended
also
to
his
discomfort
,
though
he
was
not
left
even
at
this
period
of
his
life
without
a
continuation
of
success
which
seemed
to
be
very
wonderful
.
<EOS>
And
,
first
,
I
will
say
a
word
of
his
discomfort
.
<EOS>
He
heard
not
a
line
from
Lord
Chiltern
in
answer
to
the
letter
which
he
had
written
to
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
From
Lady
Laura
he
did
hear
frequently
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
wrote
to
him
exactly
as
though
she
had
never
warned
him
away
from
Loughlinter
,
and
as
though
there
had
been
no
occasion
for
such
warning
.
<EOS>
She
sent
him
letters
filled
chiefly
with
politics
,
saying
something
also
of
the
guests
at
Loughlinter
,
something
of
the
game
,
and
just
a
word
or
two
here
<EOS>
and
there
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
The
letters
were
very
good
letters
,
and
he
preserved
them
carefully
.
<EOS>
It
was
manifest
to
him
that
they
were
intended
to
be
good
letters
,
and
,
as
such
,
to
be
preserved
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
,
which
he
received
about
the
end
of
November
,
she
told
him
that
her
brother
was
again
in
his
old
haunt
,
at
the
Willingford
Bull
,
and
that
he
had
sent
to
Portman
Square
for
all
property
of
his
own
that
had
been
left
there
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
word
in
that
letter
of
Violet
Effingham
;
and
though
Lady
Laura
did
speak
more
than
once
of
Violet
,
she
always
did
so
as
though
Violet
were
simply
a
joint
acquaintance
of
herself
and
her
correspondent
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
allusion
to
the
existence
of
any
special
regard
on
his
part
for
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
that
Violet
might
probably
tell
her
friend
what
had
occurred
at
Saulsby
;
 
but
if
she
did
so
,
Lady
Laura
was
happy
in
her
powers
of
reticence
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
was
disturbed
also
when
he
reached
home
by
finding
that
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
and
Miss
Flood
Jones
had
retired
from
Killaloe
for
the
winter
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
he
might
not
have
been
more
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
the
young
lady
,
for
he
would
have
found
himself
constrained
to
exhibit
towards
her
some
tenderness
of
manner
;
and
any
such
tenderness
of
manner
would
,
in
his
existing
circumstances
,
have
been
dangerous
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
made
to
understand
that
Mary
Flood
Jones
had
been
taken
away
from
Killaloe
because
it
was
thought
that
he
had
ill
-
treated
the
lady
,
and
the
accusation
made
him
unhappy
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
the
heat
of
the
last
session
he
had
received
a
letter
from
his
sister
,
in
which
some
pushing
question
had
been
asked
as
to
his
then
existing
feeling
about
poor
Mary
.
<EOS>
This
he
had
answered
petulantly
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
had
been
written
to
him
about
Miss
Jones
,
and
nothing
was
said
to
him
when
he
reached
home
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
but
ask
after
Mary
,
and
when
he
did
ask
,
the
accusation
was
made
again
in
that
quietly
severe
manner
with
which
,
perhaps
,
most
of
us
have
been
made
acquainted
at
some
period
of
our
lives
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Phineas
,
"
said
his
sister
,
"
we
had
better
say
nothing
about
dear
Mary
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
here
at
present
,
and
probably
you
may
not
see
her
while
you
remain
with
us
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
's
all
that
about
?
<EOS>
"
Phineas
had
demanded
,
 
understanding
the
whole
matter
thoroughly
.
<EOS>
Then
his
sister
had
demurely
refused
to
say
a
word
further
on
the
subject
,
and
not
a
word
further
was
said
about
Miss
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
They
were
at
Floodborough
,
living
<EOS>
,
he
did
not
doubt
,
in
a
very
desolate
way
,
 
and
quite
willing
,
he
did
not
doubt
also
,
to
abandon
their
desolation
if
he
would
go
over
there
in
the
manner
that
would
become
him
after
what
had
passed
on
one
or
two
occasions
between
him
and
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
But
how
was
he
to
do
this
with
such
work
on
his
hands
as
he
had
undertaken
?
<EOS>
Now
that
he
was
in
Ireland
,
he
thought
that
he
did
love
dear
Mary
very
dearly
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
had
two
identities
,
 
that
he
was
,
as
it
were
,
two
separate
persons
,
 
and
that
he
could
,
without
any
real
faithlessness
,
be
very
much
in
love
with
Violet
Effingham
in
his
position
of
man
of
fashion
and
member
of
Parliament
in
England
,
and
also
warmly
attached
to
dear
little
Mary
Flood
Jones
as
an
Irishman
of
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
He
was
aware
,
however
,
that
there
was
a
prejudice
against
such
fulness
of
heart
,
and
,
therefore
,
resolved
sternly
that
it
was
his
duty
to
be
constant
to
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
How
was
it
possible
that
he
should
marry
dear
Mary
,
 
he
,
with
such
extensive
jobs
of
work
on
his
hands
!
<EOS>
It
was
not
possible
.
<EOS>
He
must
abandon
all
thought
of
making
dear
Mary
his
own
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
they
had
been
right
to
remove
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
still
,
as
he
took
his
solitary
walks
along
the
Shannon
,
and
up
on
the
hills
that
overhung
the
lake
above
the
town
,
he
felt
somewhat
ashamed
of
himself
,
and
dreamed
of
giving
up
Parliament
,
of
leaving
Violet
to
some
noble
suitor
,
 
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
if
she
would
take
him
,
 
and
of
going
to
Floodborough
with
an
honest
proposal
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
press
Mary
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
would
probably
reject
him
at
last
;
whereas
Mary
,
dear
Mary
,
would
come
to
his
heart
without
a
scruple
of
doubt
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mary
!
<EOS>
In
these
days
of
dreaming
,
he
told
himself
that
,
after
all
,
dear
Mary
was
his
real
love
.
<EOS>
But
,
of
course
,
such
days
were
days
of
dreaming
only
.
<EOS>
He
had
letters
in
his
pocket
from
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
think
in
earnest
of
giving
up
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
there
came
a
wonderful
piece
of
luck
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
There
lived
,
or
had
lived
,
in
the
town
of
Galway
a
very
eccentric
old
lady
,
one
Miss
Marian
Persse
,
who
was
the
aunt
of
Mrs.
Finn
,
the
mother
of
our
hero
.
<EOS>
With
this
lady
Dr.
Finn
had
quarrelled
persistently
ever
since
his
marriage
,
because
the
lady
had
expressed
her
wish
to
interfere
in
the
management
of
his
family
,
 
offering
to
purchase
such
right
by
favourable
arrangements
in
reference
to
her
will
.
<EOS>
This
the
doctor
had
resented
,
and
there
had
been
quarrels
.
<EOS>
Miss
Persse
was
not
a
very
rich
old
lady
,
but
she
thought
a
good
deal
of
her
own
money
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
died
,
leaving
£
3,000
to
her
nephew
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
Another
sum
of
about
equal
amount
she
bequeathed
to
a
Roman
Catholic
seminary
;
and
thus
was
her
worldly
wealth
divided
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
n't
have
done
better
with
it
,
"
said
the
old
doctor
;
"
and
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
,
the
windfall
is
the
more
pleasant
as
being
wholly
unexpected
.
<EOS>
"
In
these
days
the
doctor
was
undoubtedly
gratified
by
his
son
's
success
in
life
,
and
never
said
much
about
the
law
.
<EOS>
Phineas
in
truth
did
do
some
work
during
the
autumn
,
reading
blue
-
books
,
reading
law
books
,
reading
perhaps
a
novel
or
two
at
the
same
time
,
 
but
shutting
himself
up
very
carefully
as
he
studied
,
so
that
his
sisters
were
made
to
understand
that
for
a
certain
four
hours
in
the
day
not
a
sound
was
to
be
allowed
to
disturb
him
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
receipt
of
his
legacy
he
at
once
offered
to
repay
his
father
all
money
that
had
been
advanced
him
over
and
above
his
original
allowance
;
but
this
the
doctor
refused
to
take
.
<EOS>
"
It
comes
to
the
same
thing
,
Phineas
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
you
have
of
your
share
now
you
ca
n't
have
hereafter
.
<EOS>
As
regards
my
present
income
,
it
has
only
made
me
work
a
little
longer
than
I
had
intended
;
and
I
believe
that
the
later
in
life
a
man
works
,
the
more
likely
he
is
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
therefore
,
when
he
returned
to
London
,
had
his
£
3,000
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
owed
some
£
500
;
and
the
remainder
he
would
,
of
course
,
invest
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
some
talk
of
an
autumnal
session
,
but
Mr.
Mildmay
's
decision
had
at
last
been
against
it
.
<EOS>
Who
can
not
understand
that
such
would
be
the
decision
of
any
Minister
to
whom
was
left
the
slightest
fraction
of
free
will
in
the
matter
?
<EOS>
Why
should
any
Minister
court
the
danger
of
unnecessary
attack
,
submit
himself
to
unnecessary
work
,
and
incur
the
odium
of
summoning
all
his
friends
from
their
rest
?
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
doubts
as
to
the
new
and
old
Ministry
,
when
the
political
needle
was
vacillating
so
tremulously
on
its
pivot
,
pointing
now
to
one
set
of
men
as
the
coming
Government
and
then
to
another
,
vague
suggestions
as
to
an
autumn
session
might
be
useful
.
<EOS>
And
they
were
thrown
out
in
all
good
faith
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
,
when
he
spoke
on
the
subject
to
the
Duke
,
was
earnest
in
thinking
that
the
question
of
Reform
should
not
be
postponed
even
for
six
months
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
pledge
yourself
,
"
said
the
Duke
;
 
and
Mr.
Mildmay
did
not
pledge
himself
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
when
Mr.
Mildmay
found
that
he
was
once
more
assuredly
Prime
Minister
,
he
changed
his
mind
,
and
felt
himself
to
be
under
a
fresh
obligation
to
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
Lord
de
Terrier
had
altogether
failed
,
and
the
country
might
very
well
wait
till
February
.
<EOS>
The
country
did
wait
till
February
,
somewhat
to
the
disappointment
of
Phineas
Finn
,
who
had
become
tired
of
blue
-
books
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
The
difference
between
his
English
life
and
his
life
at
home
was
so
great
,
that
it
was
hardly
possible
that
he
should
not
become
weary
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
He
did
become
weary
of
it
,
but
strove
gallantly
to
hide
his
weariness
from
his
father
and
mother
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
world
was
talking
much
about
Reform
,
though
Mr.
Mildmay
had
become
placidly
patient
.
<EOS>
The
feeling
was
growing
,
and
Mr.
Turnbull
,
with
his
friends
,
was
doing
all
he
could
to
make
it
grow
fast
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
amount
of
excitement
on
the
subject
;
but
the
excitement
had
grown
downwards
,
from
the
leaders
to
the
people
,
 
from
the
self
-
instituted
leaders
of
popular
politics
down
,
by
means
of
the
press
,
to
the
ranks
of
working
men
,
instead
of
growing
upwards
,
from
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
masses
,
till
it
expressed
itself
by
this
mouthpiece
and
that
,
chosen
by
the
people
themselves
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
strong
throb
through
the
country
,
making
men
feel
that
safety
was
to
be
had
by
Reform
,
and
could
not
be
had
without
Reform
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
an
understanding
that
the
press
and
the
orators
were
too
strong
to
be
ignored
,
and
that
some
new
measure
of
Reform
must
be
conceded
to
them
.
<EOS>
The
sooner
the
concession
was
made
,
the
less
it
might
be
necessary
to
concede
.
<EOS>
And
all
men
of
all
parties
were
agreed
on
this
point
.
<EOS>
That
Reform
was
in
itself
odious
to
many
of
those
who
spoke
of
it
freely
,
who
offered
themselves
willingly
to
be
its
promoters
,
was
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
odious
to
Lord
de
Terrier
and
to
most
of
those
who
worked
with
him
,
but
was
equally
so
to
many
of
Mr.
Mildmay
's
most
constant
supporters
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
had
no
wish
for
Reform
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
is
hard
to
suppose
that
such
a
Duke
can
wish
for
any
change
in
a
state
of
things
that
must
seem
to
him
to
be
so
salutary
.
<EOS>
Workmen
were
getting
full
wages
.
<EOS>
Farmers
were
paying
their
rent
.
<EOS>
Capitalists
by
the
dozen
were
creating
capitalists
by
the
hundreds
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
wrong
in
the
country
,
but
the
over
-
dominant
spirit
of
speculative
commerce
;
 
and
there
was
nothing
in
Reform
to
check
that
.
<EOS>
Why
should
the
Duke
want
Reform
?
<EOS>
As
for
such
men
as
Lord
Brentford
,
Sir
Harry
Coldfoot
,
Lord
Plinlimmon
,
and
Mr.
Legge
Wilson
,
it
was
known
to
all
men
that
they
advocated
Reform
as
we
all
of
us
advocate
doctors
.
<EOS>
Some
amount
of
doctoring
is
necessary
for
us
.
<EOS>
We
may
hardly
hope
to
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
have
as
little
of
the
doctor
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
,
and
the
cheap
press
,
and
the
rising
spirit
of
the
loudest
among
the
people
,
made
it
manifest
that
something
must
be
conceded
.
<EOS>
Let
us
be
generous
in
our
concession
.
<EOS>
That
was
now
the
doctrine
of
many
,
 
perhaps
of
most
of
the
leading
politicians
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Let
us
be
generous
.
<EOS>
Let
us
at
any
rate
seem
to
be
generous
.
<EOS>
Let
us
give
with
an
open
hand
,
 
but
still
with
a
hand
which
,
though
open
,
shall
not
bestow
too
much
.
<EOS>
The
coach
must
be
allowed
to
run
down
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
unless
the
coach
goes
on
running
no
journey
will
be
made
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
have
the
drag
on
both
the
hind
wheels
.
<EOS>
And
we
must
remember
that
coaches
running
down
hill
without
drags
are
apt
to
come
to
serious
misfortune
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
were
men
,
even
in
the
Cabinet
,
who
had
other
ideas
of
public
service
than
that
of
dragging
the
wheels
of
the
coach
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
was
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Plantagenet
Palliser
was
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
That
exceedingly
intelligent
young
nobleman
Lord
Cantrip
was
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
threw
,
perhaps
,
as
much
of
earnestness
into
the
matter
as
was
compatible
with
his
age
and
his
full
appreciation
of
the
manner
in
which
the
present
cry
for
Reform
had
been
aroused
.
<EOS>
He
was
thoroughly
honest
,
thoroughly
patriotic
,
and
thoroughly
ambitious
that
he
should
be
written
of
hereafter
as
one
who
to
the
end
of
a
long
life
had
worked
sedulously
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
;
 
but
he
disbelieved
in
Mr.
Turnbull
,
and
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
indulged
an
aristocratic
contempt
for
the
penny
press
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
no
man
in
England
more
in
earnest
,
more
truly
desirous
of
Reform
,
than
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
great
political
idea
that
political
advantages
should
be
extended
to
the
people
,
whether
the
people
clamoured
for
them
or
did
not
clamour
for
them
,
 
even
whether
they
desired
them
or
did
not
desire
them
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
ask
a
child
whether
he
would
like
to
learn
his
lesson
,
"
he
would
say
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
you
do
not
wait
till
he
cries
for
his
book
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
,
therefore
,
men
said
to
him
that
there
was
no
earnestness
in
the
cry
for
Reform
,
that
the
cry
was
a
false
cry
,
got
up
for
factious
purposes
by
interested
persons
,
he
would
reply
that
the
thing
to
be
done
should
not
be
done
in
obedience
to
any
cry
,
but
because
it
was
demanded
by
justice
,
and
was
a
debt
due
to
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
Our
hero
in
the
autumn
had
written
to
Mr.
Monk
on
the
politics
of
the
moment
,
and
the
following
had
been
Mr.
Monk
's
reply
:
    
Longroyston
,
October

.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FINN
,
  
<EOS>
I
am
staying
here
with
the
Duke
and
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
The
house
is
very
full
,
and
Mr.
Mildmay
was
here
last
week
;
but
as
I
do
n't
shoot
,
and
ca
n't
play
billiards
,
and
have
no
taste
for
charades
,
I
am
becoming
tired
of
the
gaieties
,
and
shall
leave
them
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
know
that
we
are
not
to
have
the
autumn
session
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
Mr.
Mildmay
is
right
.
<EOS>
Could
we
have
been
sure
of
passing
our
measure
<EOS>
,
it
would
have
been
very
well
;
but
we
could
not
have
been
sure
,
and
failure
with
our
bill
in
a
session
convened
for
the
express
purpose
of
passing
it
would
have
injured
the
cause
greatly
.
<EOS>
We
could
hardly
have
gone
on
with
it
again
in
the
spring
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
we
must
have
resigned
.
<EOS>
And
though
I
may
truly
say
that
I
would
as
lief
have
a
good
measure
from
Lord
de
Terrier
as
from
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
that
I
am
indifferent
to
my
own
present
personal
position
,
still
I
think
that
we
should
endeavour
to
keep
our
seats
as
long
as
we
honestly
believe
ourselves
to
be
more
capable
of
passing
a
good
measure
than
are
our
opponents
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
astonished
by
the
difference
of
opinion
which
exists
about
Reform
,
 
not
only
as
to
the
difference
in
the
extent
and
exact
tendency
of
the
measure
that
is
needed
,
 
but
that
there
should
be
such
a
divergence
of
ideas
as
to
the
grand
thing
to
be
done
and
the
grand
reason
for
doing
it
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
agreed
that
we
want
Reform
in
order
that
the
House
of
Commons
may
be
returned
by
a
larger
proportion
of
the
people
than
is
at
present
employed
upon
that
work
,
and
that
each
member
when
returned
should
represent
a
somewhat
more
equal
section
of
the
whole
constituencies
of
the
country
than
our
members
generally
do
at
present
.
<EOS>
All
men
confess
that
a
£
50
county
franchise
must
be
too
high
,
and
that
a
borough
with
less
than
two
hundred
registered
voters
must
be
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
to
me
that
but
few
among
us
perceive
,
or
at
any
rate
acknowledge
,
the
real
reasons
for
changing
these
things
and
reforming
what
is
wrong
without
delay
.
<EOS>
One
great
authority
told
us
the
other
day
that
the
sole
object
of
legislation
on
this
subject
should
be
to
get
together
the
best
possible
658
members
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
That
to
me
would
be
a
most
repulsive
idea
if
it
were
not
that
by
its
very
vagueness
it
becomes
inoperative
.
<EOS>
Who
shall
say
what
is
best
;
or
what
characteristic
constitutes
excellence
in
a
member
of
Parliament
?
<EOS>
If
the
gentleman
means
excellence
in
general
wisdom
,
or
in
statecraft
,
or
in
skill
in
talking
,
or
in
private
character
,
or
even
excellence
in
patriotism
,
then
I
say
that
he
is
utterly
wrong
,
and
has
never
touched
with
his
intellect
the
true
theory
of
representation
.
<EOS>
One
only
excellence
may
be
acknowledged
,
and
that
is
the
excellence
of
likeness
.
<EOS>
As
a
portrait
should
be
like
the
person
portrayed
,
so
should
a
representative
House
be
like
the
people
whom
it
represents
.
<EOS>
Nor
in
arranging
a
franchise
does
it
seem
to
me
that
we
have
a
right
to
regard
any
other
view
.
<EOS>
If
a
country
be
unfit
for
representative
government
,
 
<EOS>
and
it
may
be
that
there
are
still
peoples
unable
to
use
properly
that
greatest
of
all
blessings
,
 
<EOS>
the
question
as
to
what
state
policy
may
be
best
for
them
is
a
different
question
.
<EOS>
But
if
we
do
have
representation
,
let
the
representative
assembly
be
like
the
people
<EOS>
,
whatever
else
may
be
its
virtues
,
 
and
whatever
else
its
vices
.
  
<EOS>
Another
great
authority
has
told
us
that
our
House
of
Commons
should
be
the
mirror
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
not
its
mirror
,
but
its
miniature
.
<EOS>
And
let
the
artist
be
careful
to
put
in
every
line
of
the
expression
of
that
ever
-
moving
face
.
<EOS>
To
do
this
is
a
great
work
,
and
the
artist
must
know
his
trade
well
.
<EOS>
In
America
the
work
has
been
done
with
so
coarse
a
hand
that
nothing
is
shown
in
the
picture
but
the
broad
,
plain
,
unspeaking
outline
of
the
face
.
<EOS>
As
you
look
from
the
represented
to
the
representation
you
can
not
but
acknowledge
the
likeness
;
  
but
there
is
in
that
portrait
more
of
the
body
than
of
the
mind
.
<EOS>
The
true
portrait
should
represent
more
than
the
body
.
<EOS>
With
us
,
hitherto
,
there
have
been
snatches
of
the
countenance
of
the
nation
which
have
been
inimitable
,
 
a
turn
of
the
eye
here
and
a
curl
of
the
lip
there
,
which
have
seemed
to
denote
a
power
almost
divine
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
marvels
on
the
canvas
so
beautiful
that
one
approaches
the
work
of
remodelling
it
with
awe
.
<EOS>
But
not
only
is
the
picture
imperfect
,
 
a
thing
of
snatches
,
 
but
with
years
it
becomes
less
and
still
less
like
its
original
.
  
<EOS>
The
necessity
for
remodelling
it
is
imperative
,
and
we
shall
be
cowards
if
we
decline
the
work
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
be
specially
careful
to
retain
as
much
as
possible
of
those
lines
which
we
all
acknowledge
to
be
so
faithfully
representative
of
our
nation
.
<EOS>
To
give
to
a
bare
numerical
majority
of
the
people
that
power
which
the
numerical
majority
has
in
the
United
States
,
would
not
be
to
achieve
representation
.
<EOS>
The
nation
as
it
now
exists
would
not
be
known
by
such
a
portrait
;
 
but
neither
can
it
now
be
known
by
that
which
exists
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
they
who
are
adverse
to
change
,
looking
back
with
an
unmeasured
respect
on
what
our
old
Parliaments
have
done
for
us
,
ignore
the
majestic
growth
of
the
English
people
,
and
forget
the
present
in
their
worship
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
They
think
that
we
must
be
what
we
were
,
 
at
any
rate
,
what
we
were
thirty
years
since
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
,
perhaps
,
gone
into
the
houses
of
artisans
,
or
,
if
there
,
they
have
not
looked
into
the
breasts
of
the
men
.
<EOS>
With
population
vice
has
increased
,
and
these
politicians
,
with
ears
but
no
eyes
,
hear
of
drunkenness
and
sin
and
ignorance
.
<EOS>
And
then
they
declare
to
themselves
that
this
wicked
,
half
-
barbarous
,
idle
people
should
be
controlled
and
not
represented
.
<EOS>
A
wicked
,
half
-
barbarous
,
idle
people
may
be
controlled
;
 
but
not
a
people
thoughtful
,
educated
,
and
industrious
.
<EOS>
We
must
look
to
it
that
we
do
not
endeavour
to
carry
our
control
beyond
the
wickedness
and
the
barbarity
,
and
that
we
be
ready
to
submit
to
control
from
thoughtfulness
and
industry
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
find
you
helping
at
the
good
work
early
in
the
spring
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
always
faithfully
,
  
JOSHUA
MONK
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
up
in
London
before
the
end
of
January
,
but
did
not
find
there
many
of
those
whom
he
wished
to
see
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
was
there
,
and
to
him
he
showed
Mr.
Monk
's
letter
,
thinking
that
it
must
be
convincing
even
to
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
This
he
did
in
Mrs.
Low
's
drawing
-
room
,
knowing
that
Mrs.
Low
would
also
condescend
to
discuss
politics
on
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
had
dined
with
them
,
and
they
had
been
glad
to
see
him
,
and
Mrs.
Low
had
been
less
severe
than
hitherto
against
the
great
sin
of
her
husband
's
late
pupil
.
<EOS>
She
had
condescended
to
congratulate
him
on
becoming
member
for
an
English
borough
instead
of
an
Irish
one
,
and
had
asked
him
questions
about
Saulsby
Castle
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
Mr.
Monk
's
letter
was
not
received
with
that
respectful
admiration
which
Phineas
thought
that
it
deserved
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
foolishly
,
had
read
it
out
loud
,
so
that
the
attack
came
upon
him
simultaneously
from
the
husband
and
from
the
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
just
the
usual
claptrap
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
,
"
only
put
into
language
somewhat
more
grandiloquent
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Claptrap
!
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
what
I
call
downright
Radical
nonsense
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
,
nodding
her
head
energetically
.
<EOS>
"
Portrait
indeed
!
<EOS>
Why
should
we
want
to
have
a
portrait
of
ignorance
and
ugliness
?
<EOS>
What
we
all
want
is
to
have
things
quiet
and
orderly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
'd
better
have
a
paternal
government
at
once
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
,
 
"
only
that
what
you
call
a
paternal
government
is
not
always
quiet
and
orderly
.
<EOS>
National
order
I
take
to
be
submission
to
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
think
it
quiet
and
orderly
if
I
were
sent
to
Cayenne
without
being
brought
before
a
jury
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
such
a
man
as
you
would
not
be
sent
to
Cayenne
,
"
said
Phineas
,
  
"
<EOS>
My
next
-
door
neighbour
might
be
,
 
which
would
be
almost
as
bad
.
<EOS>
Let
him
be
sent
to
Cayenne
if
he
deserves
it
,
but
let
a
jury
say
that
he
has
deserved
it
.
<EOS>
My
idea
of
government
is
this
,
 
that
we
want
to
be
governed
by
law
and
not
by
caprice
,
and
that
we
must
have
a
legislature
to
make
our
laws
.
<EOS>
If
I
thought
that
Parliament
as
at
present
established
made
the
laws
badly
,
I
would
desire
a
change
;
but
I
doubt
whether
we
shall
have
them
better
from
any
change
in
Parliament
which
Reform
will
give
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
shall
have
a
lot
of
beggars
put
on
horseback
,
and
we
all
know
where
they
ride
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
became
aware
that
it
is
not
easy
to
convince
any
man
or
any
woman
on
a
point
of
politics
,
 
not
even
though
he
who
argues
may
have
an
eloquent
letter
from
a
philosophical
Cabinet
Minister
in
his
pocket
to
assist
him

Phineas
Finn
Makes
<EOS>
Progress
 
February
was
far
advanced
and
the
new
Reform
Bill
had
already
been
brought
forward
,
before
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
came
up
to
town
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
of
course
seen
Mr.
Kennedy
and
had
heard
from
him
tidings
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
Saulsby
with
Lady
Baldock
and
Miss
Boreham
and
Violet
Effingham
,
but
was
to
be
in
London
soon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
as
it
appeared
,
did
not
quite
know
when
he
was
to
expect
his
wife
;
and
Phineas
thought
that
he
could
perceive
from
the
tone
of
the
husband
's
voice
that
something
was
amiss
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
however
ask
any
questions
excepting
such
as
referred
to
the
expected
arrival
.
<EOS>
Was
Miss
Effingham
to
come
to
London
with
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
believed
that
Miss
Effingham
would
be
up
before
Easter
,
but
he
did
not
know
whether
she
would
come
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
Women
,
"
he
said
,
"
are
so
fond
of
mystery
that
one
can
never
quite
know
what
they
intend
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
He
corrected
himself
at
once
however
,
perceiving
that
he
had
seemed
to
say
something
against
his
wife
,
and
explained
that
his
general
accusation
against
the
sex
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
he
did
so
awkwardly
as
to
strengthen
the
feeling
with
Phineas
that
something
assuredly
was
wrong
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
never
seems
to
know
her
own
mind
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
is
like
other
beautiful
girls
who
are
petted
on
all
sides
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
for
her
beauty
,
I
do
n't
think
much
of
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
;
"
and
as
for
petting
,
I
do
not
understand
it
in
reference
to
grown
persons
.
<EOS>
Children
may
be
petted
,
and
dogs
,
 
though
that
too
is
bad
;
but
what
you
call
petting
for
grown
persons
is
I
think
frivolous
and
almost
indecent
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
could
not
help
thinking
of
Lord
Chiltern
's
opinion
that
it
would
have
been
wise
to
have
left
Mr.
Kennedy
in
the
hands
of
the
garrotters
.
  
<EOS>
The
debate
on
the
second
reading
of
the
bill
was
to
be
commenced
on
the
1st
of
March
,
and
two
days
before
that
Lady
Laura
arrived
in
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
Phineas
got
a
note
from
her
in
three
words
to
say
that
she
was
at
home
and
would
see
him
if
he
called
on
Sunday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
Sunday
to
which
she
alluded
was
the
last
day
of
February
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
now
more
certain
than
ever
that
something
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
Had
there
been
nothing
wrong
between
Lady
Laura
and
her
husband
<EOS>
,
she
would
not
have
rebelled
against
him
by
asking
visitors
to
the
house
on
a
Sunday
.
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
,
however
,
and
of
course
he
did
as
he
was
desired
.
<EOS>
He
called
on
the
Sunday
,
and
found
Mrs.
Bonteen
sitting
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
just
in
time
for
the
debate
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
when
the
first
greeting
was
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
you
intend
to
sit
it
out
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Every
word
of
it
,
 
unless
I
lose
my
seat
.
<EOS>
What
else
is
there
to
be
done
at
present
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
place
they
give
us
is
so
unpleasant
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
worse
places
even
than
the
Ladies
'
Gallery
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
And
perhaps
it
is
as
well
to
make
oneself
used
to
inconveniences
of
all
kinds
.
<EOS>
You
will
speak
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
.
<EOS>
The
great
speeches
will
be
Mr.
Gresham
's
,
Mr.
Daubeny
's
,
and
Mr.
Monk
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Palliser
intends
to
be
very
strong
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
can
not
be
strong
or
not
as
he
likes
it
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
I
believe
to
be
a
most
useful
man
,
but
he
never
can
become
an
orator
.
<EOS>
He
is
of
the
same
class
as
Mr.
Kennedy
,
 
only
of
course
higher
in
the
class
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
all
look
for
a
great
speech
from
Mr.
Kennedy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
slightest
idea
whether
he
will
open
his
lips
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
that
Mrs.
Bonteen
took
her
leave
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
that
woman
like
poison
,
"
continued
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
always
playing
a
game
,
and
it
is
such
a
small
game
that
she
plays
!
<EOS>
And
she
contributes
so
little
to
society
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
witty
nor
well
-
informed
,
 
not
even
sufficiently
ignorant
or
ridiculous
to
be
a
laughing
-
stock
.
<EOS>
One
gets
nothing
from
her
,
and
yet
she
has
made
her
footing
good
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
she
was
a
friend
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
think
so
!
<EOS>
You
could
not
have
thought
so
!
<EOS>
How
can
you
bring
such
an
accusation
against
me
,
knowing
me
as
you
do
?
<EOS>
But
never
mind
Mrs.
Bonteen
now
.
<EOS>
On
what
day
shall
you
speak
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
Tuesday
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
can
arrange
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
endeavour
to
do
so
,
as
far
as
any
arrangement
can
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
carry
the
second
reading
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Phineas
;
"
I
think
we
shall
;
but
by
the
votes
of
men
who
are
determined
so
to
pull
the
bill
to
pieces
in
committee
,
that
its
own
parents
will
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
Mr.
Mildmay
will
have
the
temper
to
stand
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
tell
me
that
Mr.
Mildmay
will
abandon
the
custody
of
the
bill
to
Mr.
Gresham
after
his
first
speech
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
Mr.
Gresham
's
temper
is
more
enduring
than
Mr.
Mildmay
's
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
we
shall
see
.
<EOS>
My
own
impression
is
that
nothing
would
save
the
country
so
effectually
at
the
present
moment
as
the
removal
of
Mr.
Turnbull
to
a
higher
and
a
better
sphere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
say
the
House
of
Lords
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
!
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
sat
there
for
half
an
hour
and
then
got
up
to
go
,
having
spoken
no
word
on
any
other
subject
than
that
of
politics
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
ask
after
Violet
.
<EOS>
He
longed
to
make
some
inquiry
respecting
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
And
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
felt
painfully
curious
to
hear
Lady
Laura
say
something
about
her
own
self
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
remember
what
had
been
said
between
them
up
over
the
waterfall
,
and
how
he
had
been
warned
not
to
return
to
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
And
then
again
,
did
Lady
Laura
know
anything
of
what
had
passed
between
him
and
Violet
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
your
brother
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
is
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
was
here
not
an
hour
before
you
came
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
staying
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
At
Moroni
's
.
<EOS>
He
goes
down
on
Tuesday
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
He
is
to
see
his
father
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
By
agreement
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
by
agreement
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
new
trouble
,
 
about
money
that
they
think
to
be
due
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
tell
you
all
now
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
some
words
between
Mr.
Kennedy
and
papa
.
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
talk
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
would
find
Oswald
at
Moroni
's
at
any
hour
before
eleven
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
say
anything
about
me
?
"
asked
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
mentioned
your
name
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
ask
from
vanity
,
but
I
want
to
know
whether
he
is
angry
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Angry
with
you
!
<EOS>
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
just
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
should
not
wish
to
live
even
with
you
,
but
that
he
would
sooner
try
it
with
you
than
with
any
man
he
ever
knew
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
had
got
a
letter
from
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
say
so
;
 
but
he
did
not
say
he
had
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
him
to
-
morrow
if
I
can
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
Phineas
prepared
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
word
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
hardly
looking
him
in
the
face
and
yet
making
an
effort
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
forget
what
I
said
to
you
at
Loughlinter
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
as
though
it
were
forgotten
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
it
be
absolutely
forgotten
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
case
a
man
is
bound
to
do
all
that
a
woman
asks
him
,
and
no
man
has
a
truer
spirit
of
chivalry
than
yourself
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
.
<EOS>
Look
in
when
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
ask
you
to
dine
here
as
yet
,
because
we
are
so
frightfully
dull
.
<EOS>
Do
your
best
on
Tuesday
,
and
then
let
us
see
you
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
as
he
walked
across
the
park
towards
his
club
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
forget
the
scene
by
the
waterfall
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
quite
known
what
it
had
meant
,
and
he
would
wipe
it
away
from
his
mind
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
acknowledged
to
himself
that
chivalry
did
demand
of
him
that
he
should
never
allow
himself
to
think
of
Lady
Laura
's
rash
words
to
him
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
not
happy
with
her
husband
<EOS>
was
very
clear
to
him
;
 
but
that
was
altogether
another
affair
.
<EOS>
She
might
be
unhappy
with
her
husband
without
indulging
any
guilty
love
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
thought
it
possible
that
she
could
be
happy
living
with
such
a
husband
as
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
All
that
,
however
,
was
now
past
remedy
,
and
she
must
simply
endure
the
mode
of
life
which
she
had
prepared
for
herself
.
<EOS>
There
were
other
men
and
women
in
London
tied
together
for
better
and
worse
,
in
reference
to
whose
union
their
friends
knew
that
there
would
be
no
better
;
 
that
it
must
be
all
worse
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
must
bear
it
,
as
it
was
borne
by
many
another
married
woman
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Monday
morning
Phineas
called
at
Moroni
's
Hotel
at
ten
o'clock
,
but
in
spite
of
Lady
Laura
's
assurance
to
the
contrary
,
he
found
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
out
.
<EOS>
He
had
felt
some
palpitation
at
the
heart
as
he
made
his
inquiry
,
knowing
well
the
fiery
nature
of
the
man
he
expected
to
see
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
there
would
be
some
actual
personal
conflict
between
him
and
this
half
-
mad
lord
before
he
got
back
again
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
What
Lady
Laura
had
said
about
her
brother
did
not
in
the
estimation
of
Phineas
make
this
at
all
the
less
probable
.
<EOS>
The
half
-
mad
lord
was
so
singular
in
his
ways
that
it
might
well
be
that
he
should
speak
handsomely
of
a
rival
behind
his
back
and
yet
take
him
by
the
throat
as
soon
as
they
were
together
,
face
to
face
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
Phineas
thought
,
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
see
the
half
-
mad
lord
.
<EOS>
He
had
written
a
letter
to
which
he
had
received
no
reply
,
and
he
considered
it
to
be
incumbent
on
him
to
ask
whether
it
had
been
received
and
whether
any
answer
to
it
was
intended
to
be
given
.
<EOS>
He
went
therefore
to
Lord
Chiltern
at
once
,
 
as
I
have
said
,
with
some
feeling
at
his
heart
that
there
might
be
violence
,
at
any
rate
of
words
,
before
he
should
find
himself
again
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Chiltern
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
All
that
the
porter
knew
was
that
Lord
Chiltern
intended
to
leave
the
house
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
wrote
a
note
and
left
it
with
the
porter
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
CHILTERN
,
  
I
particularly
want
to
see
you
with
reference
to
a
letter
I
wrote
to
you
last
summer
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
in
the
House
to
-
day
from
four
till
the
debate
is
over
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
at
the
Reform
Club
from
two
till
half
-
past
three
,
and
will
come
if
you
will
send
for
me
,
or
I
will
meet
you
anywhere
at
any
hour
to
-
morrow
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
always
,
P.
F.
  
No
message
came
to
him
at
the
Reform
Club
,
and
he
was
in
his
seat
in
the
House
by
four
o'clock
.
<EOS>
During
the
debate
a
note
was
brought
to
him
,
which
ran
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
I
have
got
your
letter
this
moment
.
<EOS>
Of
course
we
must
meet
.
<EOS>
I
hunt
on
Tuesday
,
and
go
down
by
the
early
train
;
but
I
will
come
to
town
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
We
shall
require
to
be
private
,
and
I
will
therefore
be
at
your
rooms
at
one
o'clock
on
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
C.
  
Phineas
at
once
perceived
that
the
note
was
a
hostile
note
,
written
in
an
angry
spirit
,
 
written
to
one
whom
the
writer
did
not
at
the
moment
acknowledge
to
be
his
friend
.
<EOS>
This
was
certainly
the
case
,
whatever
Lord
Chiltern
may
have
said
to
his
sister
as
to
his
friendship
for
Phineas
.
<EOS>
Phineas
crushed
the
note
into
his
pocket
,
and
of
course
determined
that
he
would
be
in
his
rooms
at
the
hour
named
.
  
<EOS>
The
debate
was
opened
by
a
speech
from
Mr.
Mildmay
,
in
which
that
gentleman
at
great
length
and
with
much
perspicuity
explained
his
notion
of
that
measure
of
Parliamentary
Reform
which
he
thought
to
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
was
listened
to
with
the
greatest
attention
to
the
close
,
 
and
perhaps
,
at
the
end
of
his
speech
,
with
more
attention
than
usual
,
as
there
had
gone
abroad
a
rumour
that
the
Prime
Minister
intended
to
declare
that
this
would
be
the
last
effort
of
his
life
in
that
course
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
he
ever
intended
to
utter
such
a
pledge
,
his
heart
misgave
him
when
the
time
came
for
uttering
it
.
<EOS>
He
merely
said
that
as
the
management
of
the
bill
in
committee
would
be
an
affair
of
much
labour
,
and
probably
spread
over
many
nights
,
he
would
be
assisted
in
his
work
by
his
colleagues
,
and
especially
by
his
right
honourable
friend
the
Secretary
of
State
for
Foreign
Affairs
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
understood
that
Mr.
Gresham
would
take
the
lead
<EOS>
should
the
bill
go
into
committee
;
 
but
it
was
understood
also
that
no
resignation
of
leadership
had
been
made
by
Mr.
Mildmay
.
  
<EOS>
The
measure
now
proposed
to
the
House
was
very
much
the
same
as
that
which
had
been
brought
forward
in
the
last
session
.
<EOS>
The
existing
theory
of
British
representation
was
not
to
be
changed
,
but
the
actual
practice
was
to
be
brought
nearer
to
the
ideal
theory
.
<EOS>
The
ideas
of
manhood
suffrage
,
and
of
electoral
districts
,
were
to
be
as
for
ever
removed
from
the
bulwarks
of
the
British
Constitution
.
<EOS>
There
were
to
be
counties
with
agricultural
constituencies
,
purposely
arranged
to
be
purely
agricultural
,
whenever
the
nature
of
the
counties
would
admit
of
its
being
so
.
<EOS>
No
artificer
at
Reform
,
let
him
be
Conservative
or
Liberal
,
can
make
Middlesex
or
Lancashire
agricultural
;
but
Wiltshire
and
Suffolk
were
to
be
preserved
inviolable
to
the
plough
,
 
and
the
apples
of
Devonshire
were
still
to
have
their
sway
.
<EOS>
Every
town
in
the
three
kingdoms
with
a
certain
population
was
to
have
two
members
.
<EOS>
But
here
there
was
much
room
for
cavil
,
 
as
all
men
knew
would
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
Who
shall
say
what
is
a
town
,
or
where
shall
be
its
limits
?
<EOS>
Bits
of
counties
might
be
borrowed
,
so
as
to
lessen
the
Conservatism
of
the
county
without
endangering
the
Liberalism
of
the
borough
.
<EOS>
And
then
there
were
the
boroughs
with
one
member
,
 
and
then
the
groups
of
little
boroughs
.
<EOS>
In
the
discussion
of
any
such
arrangement
how
easy
is
the
picking
of
holes
;
how
impossible
the
fabrication
of
a
garment
that
shall
be
impervious
to
such
picking
!
<EOS>
Then
again
there
was
that
great
question
of
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
On
that
there
was
to
be
no
mistake
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
again
pledged
himself
to
disappear
from
the
Treasury
bench
should
any
motion
,
clause
,
or
resolution
be
carried
by
that
House
in
favour
of
the
ballot
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
for
three
hours
,
and
then
left
the
carcass
of
his
bill
to
be
fought
for
by
the
opposing
armies
.
  
<EOS>
No
reader
of
these
pages
will
desire
that
the
speeches
in
the
debate
should
be
even
indicated
.
<EOS>
It
soon
became
known
that
the
Conservatives
would
not
divide
the
House
against
the
second
reading
of
the
bill
.
<EOS>
They
declared
,
however
,
very
plainly
their
intention
of
so
altering
the
clauses
of
the
bill
in
committee
,
 
or
at
least
of
attempting
so
to
do
,
 
as
to
make
the
bill
their
bill
,
rather
than
the
bill
of
their
opponents
.
<EOS>
To
this
Mr.
Palliser
replied
that
as
long
as
nothing
vital
was
touched
,
the
Government
would
only
be
too
happy
to
oblige
their
friends
opposite
.
<EOS>
If
anything
vital
were
touched
,
the
Government
could
only
fall
back
upon
their
friends
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
And
in
this
way
men
were
very
civil
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Turnbull
,
who
opened
the
debate
on
the
Tuesday
,
thundered
out
an
assurance
to
gods
and
men
that
he
would
divide
the
House
on
the
second
reading
of
the
bill
itself
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
doubt
but
that
there
were
many
good
men
and
true
to
go
with
him
into
the
lobby
,
but
into
the
lobby
he
would
go
if
he
had
no
more
than
a
single
friend
to
support
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
warned
the
Sovereign
,
and
he
warned
the
House
,
and
he
warned
the
people
of
England
,
that
the
measure
of
Reform
now
proposed
by
a
so
-
called
liberal
Minister
was
a
measure
prepared
in
concert
with
the
ancient
enemies
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
loud
,
very
angry
,
and
quite
successful
in
hallooing
down
sundry
attempts
which
were
made
to
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
find
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
there
are
many
members
here
who
do
not
know
me
yet
,
 
young
members
,
probably
,
who
are
green
from
the
waste
lands
and
road
-
sides
of
private
life
.
<EOS>
They
will
know
me
soon
,
and
then
,
may
be
,
there
will
be
less
of
this
foolish
noise
,
less
of
this
elongation
of
unnecessary
necks
.
<EOS>
Our
Rome
must
be
aroused
to
a
sense
of
its
danger
by
other
voices
than
these
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
called
to
order
,
but
it
was
ruled
that
he
had
not
been
out
of
order
,
 
and
he
was
very
triumphant
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
answered
him
,
and
it
was
declared
afterwards
that
Mr.
Monk
's
speech
was
one
of
the
finest
pieces
of
oratory
that
had
ever
been
uttered
in
that
House
.
<EOS>
He
made
one
remark
personal
to
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agreed
with
the
right
honourable
gentleman
in
the
chair
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
he
declared
that
the
honourable
member
was
not
out
of
order
just
now
.
<EOS>
We
all
of
us
agree
with
him
always
on
such
points
.
<EOS>
The
rules
of
our
House
have
been
laid
down
with
the
utmost
latitude
,
so
that
the
course
of
our
debates
may
not
be
frivolously
or
too
easily
interrupted
.
<EOS>
But
a
member
may
be
so
in
order
as
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
House
,
and
to
merit
the
reproaches
of
his
countrymen
.
<EOS>
"
This
little
duel
gave
great
life
to
the
debate
;
but
it
was
said
that
those
two
great
Reformers
,
Mr.
Turnbull
and
Mr.
Monk
,
could
never
again
meet
as
friends
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
debate
on
Tuesday
,
Phineas
got
upon
his
legs
.
<EOS>
The
reader
,
I
trust
,
will
remember
that
hitherto
he
had
failed
altogether
as
a
speaker
.
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
he
had
lacked
even
the
spirit
to
use
and
deliver
an
oration
which
he
had
prepared
.
<EOS>
On
a
second
occasion
he
had
broken
down
,
 
woefully
,
and
past
all
redemption
,
as
said
those
who
were
not
his
friends
,
 
unfortunately
,
but
not
past
redemption
,
as
said
those
who
were
his
true
friends
.
<EOS>
After
that
once
again
he
had
arisen
and
said
a
few
words
which
had
called
for
no
remark
,
and
had
been
spoken
as
though
he
were
in
the
habit
of
addressing
the
House
daily
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubted
whether
there
were
half
-
a
-
dozen
men
now
present
who
recognised
the
fact
that
this
man
,
who
was
so
well
known
to
so
many
of
them
,
was
now
about
to
make
another
attempt
at
a
first
speech
.
<EOS>
Phineas
himself
diligently
attempted
to
forget
that
such
was
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
had
prepared
for
himself
a
few
headings
of
what
he
intended
to
say
,
and
on
one
or
two
points
had
arranged
his
words
.
<EOS>
His
hope
was
that
even
though
he
should
forget
the
words
,
he
might
still
be
able
to
cling
to
the
thread
of
his
discourse
.
<EOS>
When
he
found
himself
again
upon
his
legs
amidst
those
crowded
seats
,
for
a
few
moments
there
came
upon
him
that
old
sensation
of
awe
.
<EOS>
Again
things
grew
dim
before
his
eyes
,
and
again
he
hardly
knew
at
which
end
of
that
long
chamber
the
Speaker
was
sitting
.
<EOS>
But
there
arose
within
him
a
sudden
courage
,
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
in
that
room
had
made
itself
intimate
to
his
ear
;
and
after
the
first
few
sentences
,
all
fear
,
all
awe
,
was
gone
from
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
read
his
speech
in
the
report
afterwards
,
he
found
that
he
had
strayed
very
wide
of
his
intended
course
,
but
he
had
strayed
without
tumbling
into
ditches
,
or
falling
into
sunken
pits
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
much
from
Mr.
Monk
's
letter
,
but
had
had
the
grace
to
acknowledge
whence
had
come
his
inspiration
.
<EOS>
He
hardly
knew
,
however
,
whether
he
had
failed
again
or
not
,
till
Barrington
Erle
came
up
to
him
as
they
were
leaving
the
House
,
with
his
old
easy
pressing
manner
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
have
got
into
form
at
last
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
thought
that
it
would
come
.
<EOS>
I
never
for
a
moment
believed
but
that
it
would
come
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
answered
not
a
word
;
but
he
went
home
and
lay
awake
all
night
triumphant
.
<EOS>
The
verdict
of
Barrington
Erle
sufficed
to
assure
him
that
he
had
succeeded
.
   
<EOS>
A
Rough
Encounter
 
Phineas
,
when
he
woke
,
had
two
matters
to
occupy
his
mind
,
 
his
success
of
the
previous
night
,
and
his
coming
interview
with
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
He
stayed
at
home
the
whole
morning
,
knowing
that
nothing
could
be
done
before
the
hour
Lord
Chiltern
had
named
for
his
visit
.
<EOS>
He
read
every
word
of
the
debate
,
studiously
postponing
the
perusal
of
his
own
speech
till
he
should
come
to
it
in
due
order
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
wrote
to
his
father
,
commencing
his
letter
as
though
his
writing
had
no
reference
to
the
affairs
of
the
previous
night
.
<EOS>
But
he
soon
found
himself
compelled
to
break
into
some
mention
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
send
you
a
_
Times
_
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
order
that
you
may
see
that
I
have
had
my
finger
in
the
pie
.
<EOS>
I
have
hitherto
abstained
from
putting
myself
forward
in
the
House
,
partly
through
a
base
fear
for
which
I
despise
myself
,
and
partly
through
a
feeling
of
prudence
that
a
man
of
my
age
should
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
gather
laurels
.
<EOS>
This
is
literally
true
.
<EOS>
There
has
been
the
fear
,
and
there
has
been
the
prudence
.
<EOS>
My
wonder
is
,
that
I
have
not
incurred
more
contempt
from
others
because
I
have
been
a
coward
.
<EOS>
People
have
been
so
kind
to
me
that
I
must
suppose
them
to
have
judged
me
more
leniently
than
I
have
judged
myself
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
as
he
was
putting
up
the
paper
,
he
looked
again
at
his
own
speech
,
and
of
course
read
every
word
of
it
once
more
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
reporters
had
been
more
than
courteous
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
had
followed
him
had
been
,
he
thought
,
at
any
rate
as
long
-
winded
as
himself
;
but
to
this
orator
less
than
half
a
column
had
been
granted
.
<EOS>
To
him
had
been
granted
ten
lines
in
big
type
,
and
after
that
a
whole
column
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
Let
Lord
Chiltern
come
and
do
his
worst
!
  
<EOS>
When
it
wanted
but
twenty
minutes
to
one
,
and
he
was
beginning
to
think
in
what
way
he
had
better
answer
the
half
-
mad
lord
,
should
the
lord
in
his
wrath
be
very
mad
,
there
came
to
him
a
note
by
the
hand
of
some
messenger
.
<EOS>
He
knew
at
once
that
it
was
from
Lady
Laura
,
and
opened
it
in
hot
haste
<EOS>
It
was
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
DEAR
MR
.
FINN
,
  
<EOS>
We
are
all
talking
about
your
speech
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
in
the
gallery
and
heard
it
,
 
and
said
that
he
had
to
thank
me
for
sending
you
to
Loughton
.
<EOS>
That
made
me
very
happy
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
declares
that
you
were
eloquent
,
but
too
short
.
<EOS>
That
coming
from
him
is
praise
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
Barrington
,
who
takes
pride
to
himself
that
you
are
his
political
child
.
<EOS>
Violet
says
that
it
is
the
only
speech
she
ever
read
.
<EOS>
I
was
there
,
and
was
delighted
.
<EOS>
I
was
sure
that
it
was
in
you
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
L.
K.
  
I
suppose
we
shall
see
you
after
the
House
is
up
,
but
I
write
this
as
I
shall
barely
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
then
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
in
Portman
Square
,
not
at
home
,
from
six
till
seven
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
in
which
Phineas
refolded
this
note
and
put
it
into
his
breast
coat
-
pocket
was
,
I
think
,
the
happiest
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
Then
,
before
he
had
withdrawn
his
hand
from
his
breast
,
he
remembered
that
what
was
now
about
to
take
place
between
him
and
Lord
Chiltern
would
probably
be
the
means
of
separating
him
altogether
from
Lady
Laura
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
might
it
not
render
it
necessary
that
he
should
abandon
the
seat
in
Parliament
which
had
been
conferred
upon
him
by
the
personal
kindness
of
Lord
Brentford
?
<EOS>
Let
that
be
as
it
might
.
<EOS>
One
thing
was
clear
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
abandon
Violet
Effingham
till
he
should
be
desired
to
do
so
in
the
plainest
language
by
Violet
Effingham
herself
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
his
watch
he
saw
that
it
was
one
o'clock
,
and
at
that
moment
Lord
Chiltern
was
announced
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
went
forward
immediately
with
his
hand
out
to
meet
his
visitor
.
<EOS>
"
Chiltern
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
.
"
<EOS>
But
Lord
Chiltern
did
not
take
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Passing
on
to
the
table
,
with
his
hat
still
on
his
head
,
and
with
a
dark
scowl
upon
his
brow
,
the
young
lord
stood
for
a
few
moments
perfectly
silent
.
<EOS>
Then
he
chucked
a
letter
across
the
table
to
the
spot
at
which
Phineas
was
standing
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
taking
up
the
letter
,
perceived
that
it
was
that
which
he
,
in
his
great
attempt
to
be
honest
,
had
written
from
the
inn
at
Loughton
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
own
letter
to
you
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
it
is
your
letter
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
received
it
oddly
enough
together
with
your
own
note
at
Moroni
's
,
 
on
Monday
morning
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
round
the
world
,
I
suppose
,
and
reached
me
only
then
.
<EOS>
You
must
withdraw
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Withdraw
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
withdraw
it
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
can
learn
,
without
asking
any
question
which
would
have
committed
myself
or
the
young
lady
,
you
have
not
acted
upon
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
yet
done
what
you
there
threaten
to
do
.
<EOS>
In
that
you
have
been
very
wise
,
and
there
can
be
no
difficulty
in
your
withdrawing
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
shall
not
withdraw
it
,
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
 
<EOS>
what
 
I
once
 
told
you
,
 
about
myself
and
Miss
Effingham
?
<EOS>
"
This
question
he
asked
very
slowly
,
pausing
between
the
words
,
and
looking
full
into
the
face
of
his
rival
,
towards
whom
he
had
gradually
come
nearer
.
<EOS>
And
his
countenance
,
as
he
did
so
,
was
by
no
means
pleasant
.
<EOS>
The
redness
of
his
complexion
had
become
more
ruddy
than
usual
;
he
still
wore
his
hat
as
though
with
studied
insolence
;
his
right
hand
was
clenched
;
and
there
was
that
look
of
angry
purpose
in
his
eye
which
no
man
likes
to
see
in
the
eye
of
an
antagonist
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
afraid
of
no
violence
,
personal
to
himself
;
but
he
was
afraid
of
,
 
of
what
I
may
,
perhaps
,
best
call
"
a
row
.
"
<EOS>
To
be
tumbling
over
the
chairs
and
tables
with
his
late
friend
and
present
enemy
in
Mrs.
Bunce
's
room
would
be
most
unpleasant
to
him
.
<EOS>
If
there
were
to
be
blows
he
,
too
,
must
strike
;
 
and
he
was
very
averse
to
strike
Lady
Laura
's
brother
,
Lord
Brentford
's
son
,
Violet
Effingham
's
friend
.
<EOS>
If
need
be
,
however
,
he
would
strike
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
remember
what
you
mean
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
declared
that
you
would
quarrel
with
any
man
who
might
presume
to
address
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Is
it
that
to
which
you
allude
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
that
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
what
you
said
very
well
.
<EOS>
If
nothing
else
was
to
deter
me
from
asking
Miss
Effingham
to
be
my
wife
,
you
will
hardly
think
that
that
ought
to
have
any
weight
.
<EOS>
The
threat
had
no
weight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
spoken
as
a
threat
,
sir
,
and
that
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
from
a
friend
to
a
friend
,
 
as
I
thought
then
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
the
less
true
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
you
can
think
of
faith
and
truth
and
honesty
of
purpose
when
you
took
advantage
of
my
absence
,
 
you
,
whom
I
had
told
a
thousand
times
that
I
loved
her
better
than
my
own
soul
!
<EOS>
You
stand
before
the
world
as
a
rising
man
,
and
I
stand
before
the
world
as
a
man
 
damned
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
chosen
by
my
father
to
sit
for
our
family
borough
,
while
I
am
an
outcast
from
his
house
.
<EOS>
You
have
Cabinet
Ministers
for
your
friends
,
while
I
have
hardly
a
decent
associate
left
to
me
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
say
of
myself
that
I
have
never
done
anything
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
,
while
this
thing
that
you
are
doing
is
unworthy
of
the
lowest
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
nothing
unworthy
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
wrote
to
you
instantly
when
I
had
resolved
,
 
though
it
was
painful
to
me
to
have
to
tell
such
a
secret
to
any
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wrote
!
<EOS>
Yes
;
when
I
was
miles
distant
;
weeks
,
months
away
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
come
here
to
bullyrag
like
an
old
woman
.
<EOS>
I
got
your
letter
only
on
Monday
,
and
know
nothing
of
what
has
occurred
.
<EOS>
Is
Miss
Effingham
to
be
 
your
wife
?
"
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
had
now
come
quite
close
to
Phineas
,
and
Phineas
felt
that
that
clenched
fist
might
be
in
his
face
in
half
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
of
course
was
not
engaged
to
him
,
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
were
now
so
to
declare
,
such
declaration
would
appear
to
have
been
drawn
from
him
by
fear
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
in
what
position
you
now
stand
towards
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
not
a
coward
you
will
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whether
I
tell
you
or
not
,
you
know
that
I
am
not
a
coward
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
to
try
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
please
I
will
ask
you
for
an
answer
to
my
question
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
paused
for
a
moment
,
thinking
what
honesty
of
purpose
and
a
high
spirit
would
,
when
combined
together
,
demand
of
him
,
and
together
with
these
requirements
<EOS>
he
felt
that
he
was
bound
to
join
some
feeling
of
duty
towards
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
was
standing
there
,
fiery
red
,
with
his
hand
still
clenched
,
and
his
hat
still
on
,
waiting
for
his
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
have
your
question
again
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
I
will
answer
it
if
I
find
that
I
can
do
so
without
loss
of
self
-
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
in
what
position
you
stand
towards
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Mind
,
I
do
not
doubt
at
all
,
but
I
choose
to
have
a
reply
from
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
remember
,
of
course
,
that
I
can
only
answer
to
the
best
of
my
belief
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
to
the
best
of
your
belief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
regards
me
as
an
intimate
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
said
as
an
indifferent
acquaintance
,
you
would
,
I
think
,
have
been
nearer
the
mark
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
let
that
be
.
<EOS>
I
presume
I
may
understand
that
you
have
given
up
any
idea
of
changing
that
position
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
understand
nothing
of
the
kind
,
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
;
 
what
hope
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
another
thing
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
speak
of
that
;
 
at
any
rate
not
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
sir
,
 
"
and
now
Lord
Chiltern
advanced
another
step
and
raised
his
hand
as
though
he
were
about
to
put
it
with
some
form
of
violence
on
the
person
of
his
rival
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
Chiltern
,
"
said
Phineas
,
stepping
back
,
so
that
there
was
some
article
of
furniture
between
him
and
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
choose
that
there
should
be
a
riot
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
a
riot
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
believe
that
after
all
you
are
a
poltroon
.
<EOS>
What
I
require
of
you
is
that
you
shall
meet
me
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
,
 
to
fight
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
to
fight
;
to
fight
;
to
fight
.
<EOS>
For
what
other
purpose
do
you
suppose
that
I
can
wish
to
meet
you
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
felt
at
the
moment
that
the
fighting
of
a
duel
would
be
destructive
to
all
his
political
hopes
.
<EOS>
Few
Englishmen
fight
duels
in
these
days
.
<EOS>
They
who
do
so
are
always
reckoned
to
be
fools
.
<EOS>
And
a
duel
between
him
and
Lord
Brentford
's
son
must
,
as
he
thought
,
separate
him
from
Violet
,
from
Lady
Laura
,
from
Lord
Brentford
,
and
from
his
borough
.
<EOS>
But
yet
how
could
he
refuse
?
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
to
think
of
,
sir
,
when
such
an
offer
as
that
is
made
to
you
?
"
said
the
fiery
-
red
lord
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
think
whether
I
have
courage
enough
to
refuse
to
make
myself
an
ass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
say
that
you
do
not
wish
to
have
a
riot
.
<EOS>
That
is
your
way
to
escape
what
you
call
 
a
riot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
bully
me
,
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
sir
;
 
I
simply
want
this
,
that
you
should
leave
me
where
you
found
me
,
and
not
interfere
with
that
which
you
have
long
known
<EOS>
I
claim
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
not
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
can
only
fight
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
send
some
friend
to
me
,
and
I
will
name
some
one
,
whom
he
shall
meet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
will
do
that
if
I
have
your
promise
to
meet
me
.
<EOS>
We
can
be
in
Belgium
in
an
hour
or
two
,
and
back
again
in
a
few
more
hours
;
 
that
is
,
any
one
of
us
who
may
chance
to
be
alive
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
select
a
friend
,
and
will
tell
him
everything
,
and
will
then
do
as
he
bids
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
some
old
steady
-
going
buffer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
certainly
not
be
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
probably
ask
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
to
manage
for
me
in
such
an
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
see
him
at
once
,
then
,
so
that
Colepepper
may
arrange
with
him
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
And
let
me
assure
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
that
there
will
be
a
meeting
between
us
after
some
fashion
,
let
the
ideas
of
your
friend
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
be
what
they
may
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lord
Chiltern
purposed
to
go
,
but
turned
again
as
he
was
going
.
"
<EOS>
And
remember
this
,
"
he
said
,
"
my
complaint
is
that
you
have
been
false
to
me
,
 
damnably
false
;
not
that
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
this
young
lady
or
with
that
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
fiery
-
red
lord
opened
the
door
for
himself
and
took
his
departure
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
,
walked
down
to
the
House
,
at
which
there
was
an
early
sitting
.
<EOS>
As
he
went
there
was
one
great
question
which
he
had
to
settle
with
himself
,
 
<EOS>
Was
there
any
justice
in
the
charge
made
against
him
that
he
had
been
false
to
his
friend
?
<EOS>
When
he
had
thought
over
the
matter
at
Saulsby
,
after
rushing
down
there
that
he
might
throw
himself
at
Violet
's
feet
,
he
had
assured
himself
that
such
a
letter
as
that
which
he
resolved
to
write
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
would
be
even
chivalrous
in
its
absolute
honesty
.
<EOS>
He
would
tell
his
purpose
to
Lord
Chiltern
the
moment
that
his
purpose
was
formed
;
 
and
would
afterwards
speak
of
Lord
Chiltern
behind
his
back
as
one
dear
friend
should
speak
of
another
.
<EOS>
Had
Miss
Effingham
shown
the
slightest
intention
of
accepting
Lord
Chiltern
's
offer
,
he
would
have
acknowledged
to
himself
that
the
circumstances
of
his
position
made
it
impossible
that
he
should
,
with
honour
,
become
his
friend
's
rival
.
<EOS>
But
was
he
to
be
debarred
for
ever
from
getting
that
which
he
wanted
because
Lord
Chiltern
wanted
it
also
,
 
<EOS>
knowing
,
<EOS>
as
he
did
so
well
,
that
Lord
Chiltern
could
not
get
the
thing
which
he
wanted
?
<EOS>
All
this
had
been
quite
sufficient
for
him
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
charge
against
him
that
he
had
been
false
to
his
friend
rang
in
his
ears
and
made
him
unhappy
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
was
true
that
Lord
Chiltern
had
not
given
up
his
hopes
,
and
that
he
had
spoken
probably
more
openly
to
Phineas
respecting
them
than
he
had
done
to
any
other
human
being
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
true
that
he
had
been
false
,
then
he
must
comply
with
any
requisition
which
Lord
Chiltern
might
make
,
 
short
of
voluntarily
giving
up
the
lady
.
<EOS>
He
must
fight
if
he
were
asked
to
do
so
,
even
though
fighting
were
his
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
When
again
in
the
House
yesterday
's
scene
came
back
upon
him
,
and
more
than
one
man
came
to
him
congratulating
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
took
his
hand
and
spoke
a
word
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
old
Premier
nodded
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
greeted
him
;
and
Plantagenet
Palliser
openly
told
him
that
he
had
made
a
good
speech
.
<EOS>
How
sweet
would
all
this
have
been
had
there
not
been
ever
at
his
heart
the
remembrance
of
his
terrible
difficulty
,
 
the
consciousness
that
he
was
about
to
be
forced
into
an
absurdity
which
would
put
an
end
to
all
this
sweetness
!
<EOS>
Why
was
the
world
in
England
so
severe
against
duelling
?
<EOS>
After
all
,
as
he
regarded
the
matter
now
,
a
duel
might
be
the
best
way
,
nay
,
the
only
way
out
of
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
If
he
might
only
be
allowed
to
go
out
with
Lord
Chiltern
the
whole
thing
might
be
arranged
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
not
shot
he
might
carry
on
his
suit
with
Miss
Effingham
unfettered
by
any
impediment
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
were
shot
,
what
matter
was
that
to
any
one
but
himself
?
<EOS>
Why
should
the
world
be
so
thin
-
skinned
,
 
so
foolishly
chary
of
human
life
?
  
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
did
not
come
to
the
House
,
and
Phineas
looked
for
him
at
both
the
clubs
which
he
frequented
,
 
leaving
a
note
at
each
as
he
did
not
find
him
.
<EOS>
He
also
left
a
note
for
him
at
his
lodgings
in
Duke
Street
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
you
this
evening
.
<EOS>
I
shall
dine
at
the
Reform
Club
,
 
<EOS>
pray
come
there
.
"
<EOS>
After
that
,
Phineas
went
up
to
Portman
Square
,
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
received
from
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
There
he
saw
Violet
Effingham
,
meeting
her
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
parted
from
her
on
the
great
steps
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
spoke
to
her
,
and
of
course
she
was
gracious
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
her
graciousness
was
only
a
smile
and
his
speech
was
only
a
word
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
in
the
room
,
but
not
enough
to
make
privacy
possible
,
 
as
it
becomes
possible
at
a
crowded
evening
meeting
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
was
there
,
and
the
Bonteens
,
and
Barrington
Erle
,
and
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
,
and
Lord
Cantrip
with
his
young
wife
.
<EOS>
It
was
manifestly
a
meeting
of
Liberals
,
semi
-
social
and
semi
-
political
;
 
so
arranged
that
ladies
might
feel
that
some
interest
in
politics
was
allowed
to
them
,
and
perhaps
some
influence
also
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
Mr.
Palliser
himself
came
in
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
however
,
was
most
struck
by
finding
that
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
was
there
,
and
that
Mr.
Kennedy
was
not
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
Mr.
Kennedy
,
he
was
quite
sure
that
had
such
a
meeting
taken
place
before
Lady
Laura
's
marriage
,
Mr.
Kennedy
would
have
been
present
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
speak
to
you
as
we
go
away
,
"
said
Phineas
,
whispering
a
word
into
Fitzgibbon
's
ear
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
leaving
notes
for
you
all
about
the
town
.
"
<EOS>
"
Not
a
duel
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
How
pleasant
it
was
,
 
that
meeting
;
or
would
have
been
had
<EOS>
there
not
been
that
nightmare
on
his
breast
!
<EOS>
They
all
talked
as
though
there
were
perfect
accord
between
them
and
perfect
confidence
.
<EOS>
There
were
there
great
men
,
 
Cabinet
Ministers
,
and
beautiful
women
,
 
the
wives
and
daughters
of
some
of
England
's
highest
nobles
.
<EOS>
And
Phineas
Finn
,
throwing
back
,
now
and
again
,
a
thought
to
Killaloe
,
found
himself
among
them
as
one
of
themselves
.
<EOS>
How
could
any
Mr.
Low
say
that
he
was
wrong
?
  
<EOS>
On
a
sofa
near
to
him
,
so
that
he
could
almost
touch
her
foot
with
his
,
was
sitting
Violet
Effingham
,
and
as
he
leaned
over
from
his
chair
discussing
some
point
in
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
with
that
most
inveterate
politician
,
Lady
Glencora
,
<EOS>
Violet
looked
into
his
face
and
smiled
.
<EOS>
Oh
heavens
!
<EOS>
If
Lord
Chiltern
and
he
might
only
toss
up
as
to
which
of
them
should
go
to
Patagonia
and
remain
there
for
the
next
ten
years
,
and
which
should
have
Violet
Effingham
for
a
wife
in
London
!
  
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
Phineas
,
if
you
mean
to
come
,
"
said
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
of
course
bound
to
go
,
though
Lady
Glencora
was
still
talking
Radicalism
,
and
Violet
Effingham
was
still
smiling
ineffably
.
     
<EOS>
The
Duel
 
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
was
a
duel
;
 
bedad
I
did
,
"
said
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
standing
at
the
corner
of
Orchard
Street
and
Oxford
Street
,
when
Phineas
had
half
told
his
story
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
sure
of
it
from
the
tone
of
your
voice
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
We
must
n't
let
it
come
off
,
that
's
all
;
 
not
if
we
can
help
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
was
allowed
to
proceed
and
finish
his
story
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
any
way
out
of
it
;
I
do
n't
,
indeed
,
"
said
Laurence
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Phineas
had
come
to
think
that
the
duel
was
in
very
truth
the
best
way
out
of
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
bad
way
out
,
but
then
it
was
a
way
;
 
and
he
could
not
see
any
other
.
"
<EOS>
As
for
ill
treating
him
,
that
's
nonsense
,
"
said
Laurence
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
the
girls
to
do
,
if
one
fellow
may
n't
come
on
as
soon
as
another
fellow
is
down
?
<EOS>
But
then
,
you
see
,
a
fellow
never
knows
when
he
's
down
himself
,
and
therefore
he
thinks
that
he
's
ill
used
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
now
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
if
we
could
n't
do
it
on
the
sly
,
 
unless
one
of
you
is
stupid
enough
to
hit
the
other
in
an
awkward
place
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
certain
of
your
hand
now
,
the
right
shoulder
is
the
best
spot
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
felt
very
certain
that
he
would
not
hit
Lord
Chiltern
in
an
awkward
place
,
although
he
was
by
no
means
sure
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Let
come
what
might
,
he
would
not
aim
at
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
But
of
this
he
had
thought
it
proper
to
say
nothing
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
duel
did
come
off
on
the
sly
.
<EOS>
The
meeting
in
the
drawing
-
room
in
Portman
Square
,
of
which
mention
was
made
in
the
last
chapter
,
took
place
on
a
Wednesday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
On
the
Thursday
,
Friday
,
Monday
,
and
Tuesday
following
,
the
great
debate
on
Mr.
Mildmay
's
bill
was
continued
,
and
at
three
on
the
Tuesday
night
the
House
divided
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
majority
in
favour
of
the
Ministers
,
not
large
enough
to
permit
them
to
claim
a
triumph
for
their
party
,
or
even
an
ovation
for
themselves
;
but
still
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
send
their
bill
into
committee
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
and
Mr.
Turnbull
had
again
joined
their
forces
together
in
opposition
to
the
ministerial
measure
.
<EOS>
On
the
Thursday
Phineas
had
shown
himself
in
the
House
,
but
during
the
remainder
of
this
interesting
period
he
was
absent
from
his
place
,
nor
was
he
seen
at
the
clubs
,
nor
did
any
man
know
of
his
whereabouts
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
was
the
first
to
miss
him
with
any
real
sense
of
his
absence
.
<EOS>
She
would
now
go
to
Portman
Square
on
the
afternoon
of
every
Sunday
,
 
at
which
time
her
husband
was
attending
the
second
service
of
his
church
,
 
<EOS>
and
there
she
would
receive
those
whom
she
called
her
father
's
guests
.
<EOS>
But
as
her
father
was
never
there
on
the
Sundays
,
and
as
these
gatherings
had
been
created
by
herself
,
the
reader
will
probably
think
that
she
was
obeying
her
husband
's
behests
in
regard
to
the
Sabbath
after
a
very
indifferent
fashion
.
<EOS>
The
reader
may
be
quite
sure
,
however
,
that
Mr.
Kennedy
knew
well
what
was
being
done
in
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
Whatever
might
be
Lady
Laura
's
faults
,
she
did
not
commit
the
fault
of
disobeying
her
husband
in
secret
.
<EOS>
There
were
,
probably
,
a
few
words
on
the
subject
;
but
we
need
not
go
very
closely
into
that
matter
at
the
present
moment
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Sunday
which
afforded
some
rest
in
the
middle
of
the
great
Reform
debate
Lady
Laura
asked
for
Mr.
Finn
,
and
no
one
could
answer
her
question
.
<EOS>
And
then
it
was
remembered
that
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
was
also
absent
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
knew
nothing
of
Phineas
,
 
had
heard
nothing
;
but
was
able
to
say
that
Fitzgibbon
had
been
with
Mr.
Ratler
,
the
patronage
secretary
and
liberal
whip
,
early
on
Thursday
,
expressing
his
intention
of
absenting
himself
for
two
days
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
had
been
wroth
,
bidding
him
remain
at
his
duty
,
and
pointing
out
to
him
the
great
importance
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Then
Barrington
Erle
quoted
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
My
boy
,
"
said
Laurence
to
poor
Ratler
,
"
the
path
of
duty
leads
but
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
All
the
same
;
I
'll
be
in
at
the
death
,
Ratler
,
my
boy
,
as
sure
as
the
sun
's
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
"
Not
ten
minutes
after
the
telling
of
this
little
story
,
Fitzgibbon
entered
the
room
in
Portman
Square
,
and
Lady
Laura
at
once
asked
him
after
Phineas
.
"
<EOS>
Bedad
,
Lady
Laura
,
I
have
been
out
of
town
myself
for
two
days
,
and
I
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Finn
has
not
been
with
you
,
then
?
"
  
"
With
me
!
<EOS>
No
,
 
not
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
job
of
business
of
my
own
which
took
me
over
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
And
has
Phinny
fled
too
?
<EOS>
Poor
Ratler
!
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
if
it
is
n't
an
asylum
<EOS>
he
's
in
before
the
session
is
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
certainly
possessed
the
rare
accomplishment
of
telling
a
lie
with
a
good
grace
.
<EOS>
Had
any
man
called
him
a
liar
he
would
have
considered
himself
to
be
not
only
insulted
,
but
injured
also
.
<EOS>
He
believed
himself
to
be
a
man
of
truth
.
<EOS>
There
were
,
however
,
in
his
estimation
certain
subjects
on
which
a
man
might
depart
as
wide
as
the
poles
are
asunder
from
truth
without
subjecting
himself
to
any
ignominy
for
falsehood
.
<EOS>
In
dealing
with
a
tradesman
as
to
his
debts
,
or
with
a
rival
as
to
a
lady
,
or
with
any
man
or
woman
in
defence
of
a
lady
's
character
,
or
in
any
such
matter
as
that
of
a
duel
,
Laurence
believed
that
a
gentleman
was
bound
to
lie
,
and
that
he
would
be
no
gentleman
if
he
hesitated
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Not
the
slightest
prick
of
conscience
disturbed
him
when
he
told
Lady
Laura
that
he
had
been
in
Paris
,
and
that
he
knew
nothing
of
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
truth
,
during
the
last
day
or
two
he
had
been
in
Flanders
,
and
not
in
Paris
,
and
had
stood
as
second
with
his
friend
Phineas
on
the
sands
at
Blankenberg
,
a
little
fishing
-
town
some
twelve
miles
distant
from
Bruges
,
and
had
left
his
friend
since
that
at
an
hotel
at
Ostend
,
 
with
a
wound
just
under
the
shoulder
,
from
which
a
bullet
had
been
extracted
.
  
<EOS>
The
manner
of
the
meeting
had
been
in
this
wise
.
<EOS>
Captain
Colepepper
and
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
held
their
meeting
,
and
at
this
meeting
Laurence
had
taken
certain
standing
-
ground
on
behalf
of
his
friend
,
and
in
obedience
to
his
friend
's
positive
instruction
;
 
which
was
this
,
that
his
friend
could
not
abandon
his
right
of
addressing
the
young
lady
,
should
he
hereafter
ever
think
fit
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Let
that
be
granted
,
and
Laurence
would
do
anything
.
<EOS>
But
then
that
could
not
be
granted
,
and
Laurence
could
only
shrug
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
Laurence
admit
that
his
friend
had
been
false
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
question
lies
in
a
nutshell
,
"
said
Laurence
,
with
that
sweet
Connaught
brogue
which
always
came
to
him
when
he
desired
to
be
effective
;
 
"
here
it
is
.
<EOS>
One
gentleman
tells
another
that
he
's
sweet
upon
a
young
lady
,
but
that
the
young
lady
has
refused
him
,
and
always
will
refuse
him
,
for
ever
and
ever
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
truth
anyhow
.
<EOS>
Is
the
second
gentleman
bound
by
that
not
to
address
the
young
lady
?
<EOS>
I
say
he
is
not
bound
.
<EOS>
It
'd
be
a
d
 
d
hard
tratement
,
Captain
Colepepper
,
if
a
man
's
mouth
and
all
the
ardent
affections
of
his
heart
were
to
be
stopped
in
that
manner
!
<EOS>
By
Jases
,
I
do
n't
know
who
'd
like
to
be
the
friend
of
any
man
<EOS>
if
that
's
to
be
the
way
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Colepepper
was
not
very
good
at
an
argument
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
they
'd
better
see
each
other
,
"
said
Colepepper
,
pulling
his
thick
grey
moustache
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
choose
to
have
it
so
,
so
be
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
it
the
hardest
thing
in
the
world
;
 
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
Then
they
put
their
heads
together
in
the
most
friendly
way
,
and
declared
that
the
affair
should
,
if
possible
,
be
kept
private
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Thursday
night
Lord
Chiltern
and
Captain
Colepepper
went
over
by
Calais
and
Lille
to
Bruges
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
with
his
friend
Dr.
O'Shaughnessy
,
crossed
by
the
direct
boat
from
Dover
to
Ostend
.
<EOS>
Phineas
went
to
Ostend
by
Dover
and
Calais
,
but
he
took
the
day
route
on
Friday
.
<EOS>
It
had
all
been
arranged
among
them
,
so
that
there
might
be
no
suspicion
as
to
the
job
in
hand
.
<EOS>
Even
O'Shaughnessy
and
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
left
London
by
separate
trains
.
<EOS>
They
met
on
the
sands
at
Blankenberg
about
nine
o'clock
on
the
Saturday
morning
,
having
reached
that
village
in
different
vehicles
from
Ostend
and
Bruges
,
and
had
met
quite
unobserved
amidst
the
sand
-
heaps
.
<EOS>
But
one
shot
had
been
exchanged
,
and
Phineas
had
been
wounded
in
the
right
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
had
proposed
to
exchange
another
shot
with
his
left
hand
,
declaring
his
capability
of
shooting
quite
as
well
with
the
left
as
with
the
right
;
but
to
this
both
Colepepper
and
Fitzgibbon
had
objected
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
had
offered
to
shake
hands
with
his
late
friend
in
a
true
spirit
of
friendship
,
if
only
his
late
friend
would
say
that
he
did
not
intend
to
prosecute
his
suit
with
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
In
all
these
disputes
the
young
lady
's
name
was
never
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Phineas
indeed
had
not
once
named
Violet
to
Fitzgibbon
,
speaking
of
her
always
as
the
lady
in
question
;
and
though
Laurence
correctly
surmised
the
identity
of
the
young
lady
,
he
never
hinted
that
he
had
even
guessed
her
name
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
Lord
Chiltern
had
been
so
wary
when
alone
with
Captain
Colepepper
;
but
then
Lord
Chiltern
was
,
when
he
spoke
at
all
,
a
very
plain
-
spoken
man
.
<EOS>
Of
course
his
lordship
's
late
friend
Phineas
would
give
no
such
pledge
,
and
therefore
Lord
Chiltern
moved
off
the
ground
and
back
to
Blankenberg
and
Bruges
,
and
into
Brussels
,
in
still
living
enmity
with
our
hero
.
<EOS>
Laurence
and
the
doctor
took
Phineas
back
to
Ostend
,
and
though
the
bullet
was
then
in
his
shoulder
,
Phineas
made
his
way
through
Blankenberg
after
such
a
fashion
that
no
one
there
knew
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Not
a
living
soul
,
except
the
five
concerned
,
was
at
that
time
aware
that
a
duel
had
been
fought
among
the
sand
-
hills
.
  
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
made
his
way
to
Dover
by
the
Saturday
night
's
boat
,
and
was
able
to
show
himself
in
Portman
Square
on
the
Sunday
.
"
<EOS>
Know
anything
about
Phinny
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
afterwards
to
Barrington
Erle
,
in
answer
to
an
inquiry
from
that
anxious
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
Not
a
word
!
<EOS>
I
think
you
'd
better
send
the
town
-
crier
round
after
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Barrington
,
however
,
did
not
feel
quite
so
well
assured
of
Fitzgibbon
's
truth
as
Lady
Laura
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
O'Shaughnessy
remained
during
the
Sunday
and
Monday
at
Ostend
with
his
patient
,
and
the
people
at
the
inn
only
knew
that
Mr.
Finn
had
sprained
his
shoulder
badly
;
and
on
the
Tuesday
they
came
back
to
London
again
,
via
Calais
and
Dover
.
<EOS>
No
bone
had
been
broken
,
and
Phineas
,
though
his
shoulder
was
very
painful
,
bore
the
journey
well
.
<EOS>
O'Shaughnessy
had
received
a
telegram
on
the
Monday
,
telling
him
that
the
division
would
certainly
take
place
on
the
Tuesday
,
 
and
on
the
Tuesday
,
at
about
ten
in
the
evening
,
Phineas
went
down
to
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
---
,
you
're
here
,
"
said
Ratler
,
taking
hold
of
him
with
an
affection
that
was
too
warm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
'm
here
,
"
said
Phineas
,
wincing
in
agony
;
"
but
be
a
little
careful
<EOS>
,
there
's
a
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
down
in
Kent
and
put
my
arm
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
your
arm
out
,
have
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Ratler
,
observing
the
sling
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sorry
for
that
.
<EOS>
But
you
'll
stop
and
vote
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
'll
stop
and
vote
.
<EOS>
I
've
come
up
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
it
wo
n't
be
very
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
both
Daubeny
and
Gresham
to
speak
yet
,
and
at
least
three
others
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
it
will
be
much
before
three
.
<EOS>
But
you
're
all
right
now
.
<EOS>
You
can
go
down
and
smoke
if
you
like
!
"
<EOS>
In
this
way
Phineas
Finn
spoke
in
the
debate
,
and
heard
the
end
of
it
,
voting
for
his
party
,
and
fought
his
duel
with
Lord
Chiltern
in
the
middle
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
go
and
sit
on
a
well
-
cushioned
bench
in
the
smoking
-
room
,
and
then
was
interrogated
by
many
of
his
friends
as
to
his
mysterious
absence
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
he
said
,
been
down
in
Kent
,
and
had
had
an
accident
with
his
arm
,
by
which
he
had
been
confined
.
<EOS>
When
this
questioner
and
that
perceived
that
there
was
some
little
mystery
in
the
matter
,
the
questioners
did
not
push
their
questions
,
but
simply
entertained
their
own
surmises
.
<EOS>
One
indiscreet
questioner
,
however
,
did
trouble
Phineas
sorely
,
declaring
that
there
must
have
been
some
affair
in
which
a
woman
had
had
a
part
,
and
asking
after
the
young
lady
of
Kent
.
<EOS>
This
indiscreet
questioner
was
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
who
,
as
Phineas
thought
,
carried
his
spirit
of
intrigue
a
little
too
far
.
<EOS>
Phineas
stayed
and
voted
,
and
then
he
went
painfully
home
to
his
lodgings
.
  
<EOS>
How
singular
would
it
be
if
this
affair
of
the
duel
should
pass
away
,
and
no
one
be
a
bit
the
wiser
but
those
four
men
who
had
been
with
him
on
the
sands
at
Blankenberg
!
<EOS>
Again
he
wondered
at
his
own
luck
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
himself
that
a
duel
with
Lord
Chiltern
must
create
a
quarrel
between
him
and
Lord
Chiltern
's
relations
,
and
also
between
him
and
Violet
Effingham
;
that
it
must
banish
him
from
his
comfortable
seat
for
Loughton
,
and
ruin
him
in
regard
to
his
political
prospects
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
had
fought
his
duel
,
and
was
back
in
town
,
 
and
the
thing
seemed
to
have
been
a
thing
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
as
yet
seen
Lady
Laura
or
Violet
,
but
he
had
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
they
both
were
as
much
in
the
dark
as
other
people
.
<EOS>
The
day
might
arrive
,
he
thought
,
on
which
it
would
be
pleasant
for
him
to
tell
Violet
Effingham
what
had
occurred
,
but
that
day
had
not
come
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Whither
Lord
Chiltern
had
gone
,
or
what
Lord
Chiltern
intended
to
do
,
he
had
not
any
idea
;
but
he
imagined
that
he
should
soon
hear
something
of
her
brother
from
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
That
Lord
Chiltern
should
say
a
word
to
Lady
Laura
of
what
had
occurred
,
 
or
to
any
other
person
in
the
world
,
 
he
did
not
in
the
least
suspect
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
man
more
likely
to
be
reticent
in
such
matters
than
Lord
Chiltern
,
 
or
more
sure
to
be
guided
by
an
almost
exaggerated
sense
of
what
honour
required
of
him
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
doubt
the
discretion
of
his
friend
Fitzgibbon
;
 
if
only
his
friend
might
not
damage
the
secret
by
being
too
discreet
.
<EOS>
Of
the
silence
of
the
doctor
and
the
captain
he
was
by
no
means
equally
sure
;
but
even
though
they
should
gossip
,
the
gossiping
would
take
so
long
a
time
in
oozing
out
and
becoming
recognised
information
,
as
to
have
lost
much
of
its
power
for
injuring
him
.
<EOS>
Were
Lady
Laura
to
hear
at
this
moment
that
he
had
been
over
to
Belgium
,
and
had
fought
a
duel
with
Lord
Chiltern
respecting
Violet
<EOS>
,
she
would
probably
feel
herself
obliged
to
quarrel
with
him
;
but
no
such
obligation
would
rest
on
her
,
if
in
the
course
of
six
or
nine
months
she
should
gradually
have
become
aware
that
such
an
encounter
had
taken
place
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
during
their
interview
at
the
rooms
in
Great
Marlborough
Street
,
had
said
a
word
to
him
about
the
seat
in
Parliament
;
 
had
expressed
some
opinion
that
as
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
was
interfering
with
the
views
of
the
Standish
family
in
regard
to
Miss
Effingham
,
he
ought
not
to
keep
the
Standish
seat
,
which
had
been
conferred
upon
him
in
ignorance
of
any
such
intended
interference
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
thought
of
this
,
could
not
remember
Lord
Chiltern
's
words
,
but
there
was
present
to
him
an
idea
that
such
had
been
their
purport
.
<EOS>
Was
he
bound
,
in
circumstances
as
they
now
existed
,
to
give
up
Loughton
?
<EOS>
He
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
not
so
bound
unless
Lord
Chiltern
should
demand
from
him
that
he
should
do
so
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
was
uneasy
in
his
position
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
true
that
the
seat
now
was
his
for
this
session
by
all
parliamentary
law
,
even
though
the
electors
themselves
might
wish
to
be
rid
of
him
,
and
that
Lord
Brentford
could
not
even
open
his
mouth
upon
the
matter
in
a
tone
more
loud
than
that
of
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
But
Phineas
,
feeling
that
he
had
consented
to
accept
the
favour
of
a
corrupt
seat
from
Lord
Brentford
,
felt
also
that
he
was
bound
to
give
up
the
spoil
if
it
were
demanded
from
him
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
demanded
from
him
,
either
by
the
father
or
the
son
,
it
should
be
given
up
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
he
found
a
leading
article
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
devoted
solely
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
During
the
late
debate
,
"
 
so
ran
a
passage
in
the
leading
article
,
 
"
Mr.
Finn
,
Lord
Brentford
's
Irish
nominee
for
his
pocket
-
borough
at
Loughton
,
did
at
last
manage
to
stand
on
his
legs
and
open
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
If
we
are
not
mistaken
,
this
is
Mr.
Finn
's
third
session
in
Parliament
,
and
hitherto
he
has
been
unable
to
articulate
three
sentences
,
though
he
has
on
more
than
one
occasion
made
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
For
what
special
merit
this
young
man
has
been
selected
for
aristocratic
patronage
we
do
not
know
,
 
but
that
there
must
be
some
merit
recognisable
by
aristocratic
eyes
,
we
surmise
.
<EOS>
Three
years
ago
he
was
a
raw
young
Irishman
,
living
in
London
as
Irishmen
only
know
how
to
live
,
earning
nothing
,
and
apparently
without
means
;
and
then
suddenly
he
bursts
out
as
a
member
of
Parliament
and
as
the
friend
of
Cabinet
Ministers
.
<EOS>
The
possession
of
one
good
gift
must
be
acceded
to
the
honourable
member
for
Loughton
,
 
he
is
a
handsome
young
man
,
and
looks
to
be
as
strong
as
a
coal
-
porter
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
that
his
promotion
has
sprung
from
this
?
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
we
should
like
to
know
where
he
has
been
during
his
late
mysterious
absence
from
Parliament
,
and
in
what
way
he
came
by
the
wound
in
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Even
handsome
young
members
of
Parliament
,
fêted
by
titled
ladies
and
their
rich
lords
,
are
amenable
to
the
laws
,
 
to
the
laws
of
this
country
,
and
to
the
laws
of
any
other
which
it
may
suit
them
to
visit
for
a
while
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Infamous
scoundrel
!
"
said
Phineas
to
himself
,
as
he
read
this
.
<EOS>
"
Vile
,
low
,
disreputable
blackguard
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
was
clear
enough
,
however
,
that
Quintus
Slide
had
found
out
something
of
his
secret
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
his
only
hope
would
rest
on
the
fact
that
his
friends
were
not
likely
to
see
the
columns
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Is
Told
 
By
the
time
that
Mr.
Mildmay
's
great
bill
was
going
into
committee
Phineas
was
able
to
move
about
London
in
comfort
,
 
with
his
arm
,
however
,
still
in
a
sling
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
nothing
more
about
him
and
his
wound
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
and
he
was
beginning
to
hope
that
that
nuisance
would
also
be
allowed
to
die
away
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
Lady
Laura
,
 
having
dined
in
Grosvenor
Place
,
where
he
had
been
petted
to
his
heart
's
content
.
<EOS>
His
dinner
had
been
cut
up
for
him
,
and
his
wound
had
been
treated
with
the
tenderest
sympathy
.
<EOS>
And
,
singular
to
say
,
no
questions
were
asked
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
to
Kent
and
had
come
by
an
accident
.
<EOS>
No
more
than
that
was
told
,
and
his
dear
sympathising
friends
were
content
to
receive
so
much
information
,
and
to
ask
for
no
more
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
as
yet
seen
Violet
Effingham
,
and
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
this
romance
about
Violet
might
as
well
be
brought
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
,
however
,
as
yet
been
able
to
go
into
crowded
rooms
,
and
unless
he
went
out
to
large
parties
he
could
not
be
sure
that
he
would
meet
Miss
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
he
resolved
that
he
would
tell
Lady
Laura
the
whole
truth
,
 
not
the
truth
about
the
duel
,
but
the
truth
about
Violet
Effingham
,
and
ask
for
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
When
making
this
resolution
,
I
think
that
he
must
have
forgotten
much
that
he
had
learned
of
his
friend
's
character
;
and
by
making
it
,
I
think
that
he
showed
also
that
he
had
not
learned
as
much
as
his
opportunities
might
have
taught
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
Lady
Laura
's
obstinacy
of
purpose
,
he
knew
her
devotion
to
her
brother
,
and
he
knew
also
how
desirous
she
had
been
that
her
brother
should
win
Violet
Effingham
for
himself
.
<EOS>
This
knowledge
should
,
I
think
,
have
sufficed
to
show
him
how
improbable
it
was
that
Lady
Laura
should
assist
him
in
his
enterprise
.
<EOS>
But
beyond
all
this
was
the
fact
,
 
a
fact
as
to
the
consequences
of
which
Phineas
himself
was
entirely
blind
,
beautifully
ignorant
,
 
that
Lady
Laura
had
once
condescended
to
love
himself
.
<EOS>
Nay
;
 
she
had
gone
farther
than
this
,
and
had
ventured
to
tell
him
,
even
after
her
marriage
,
that
the
remembrance
of
some
feeling
that
had
once
dwelt
in
her
heart
in
regard
to
him
was
still
a
danger
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
warned
him
from
Loughlinter
,
and
then
had
received
him
in
London
;
 
and
now
he
selected
her
as
his
confidante
in
this
love
affair
!
<EOS>
Had
he
not
been
beautifully
ignorant
and
most
modestly
blind
,
he
would
surely
have
placed
his
confidence
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
ever
confessed
to
herself
the
existence
of
a
vicious
passion
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
indeed
,
learned
to
tell
herself
that
she
could
not
love
her
husband
;
and
once
,
in
the
excitement
of
such
silent
announcements
to
herself
,
she
had
asked
herself
whether
her
heart
was
quite
a
blank
,
and
had
answered
herself
by
desiring
Phineas
Finn
to
absent
himself
from
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
During
all
the
subsequent
winter
she
had
scourged
herself
inwardly
for
her
own
imprudence
,
her
quite
unnecessary
folly
in
so
doing
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
could
not
she
,
Laura
Standish
,
who
from
her
earliest
years
of
girlish
womanhood
had
resolved
that
she
would
use
the
world
as
men
use
it
,
and
not
as
women
do
,
 
could
not
she
have
felt
the
slight
shock
of
a
passing
tenderness
for
a
handsome
youth
without
allowing
the
feeling
to
be
a
rock
before
her
big
enough
and
sharp
enough
for
the
destruction
of
her
entire
barque
?
<EOS>
Could
not
she
command
,
if
not
her
heart
,
at
any
rate
her
mind
,
so
that
she
might
safely
assure
herself
that
,
whether
this
man
or
any
man
was
here
or
there
,
her
course
would
be
unaltered
?
<EOS>
What
though
Phineas
Finn
had
been
in
the
same
house
with
her
throughout
all
the
winter
,
could
not
she
have
so
lived
with
him
on
terms
of
friendship
,
that
every
deed
and
word
and
look
of
her
friendship
might
have
been
open
to
her
husband
,
 
or
open
to
all
the
world
?
<EOS>
She
could
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
She
told
herself
that
that
was
not
,
 
need
not
have
been
her
great
calamity
.
<EOS>
Whether
she
could
endure
the
dull
,
monotonous
control
of
her
slow
but
imperious
lord
,
 
or
whether
she
must
not
rather
tell
him
that
it
was
not
to
be
endured
,
 
that
was
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
So
she
told
herself
,
and
again
admitted
Phineas
to
her
intimacy
in
London
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
Phineas
,
had
he
not
been
beautifully
ignorant
and
most
blind
to
his
own
achievements
,
would
not
have
expected
from
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
assistance
with
Miss
Violet
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
knew
when
to
find
Lady
Laura
alone
,
and
he
came
upon
her
one
day
at
the
favourable
hour
.
<EOS>
The
two
first
clauses
of
the
bill
had
been
passed
after
twenty
fights
and
endless
divisions
.
<EOS>
Two
points
had
been
settled
,
as
to
which
,
however
,
Mr.
Gresham
had
been
driven
to
give
way
so
far
and
to
yield
so
much
,
that
men
declared
that
such
a
bill
as
the
Government
could
consent
to
call
its
own
could
never
be
passed
by
that
Parliament
in
that
session
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
his
entrance
into
her
room
Lady
Laura
began
about
the
third
clause
.
<EOS>
Would
the
House
let
Mr.
Gresham
have
his
way
about
the
 
?
<EOS>
Phineas
stopped
her
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
come
to
you
in
a
private
trouble
,
and
I
want
you
to
drop
politics
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
you
for
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
private
trouble
,
Mr.
Finn
!
<EOS>
Is
it
serious
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
serious
,
 
but
it
is
no
trouble
of
the
kind
of
which
you
are
thinking
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
serious
enough
to
take
up
every
thought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
help
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
can
.
<EOS>
Whether
you
will
or
no
is
a
different
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
help
you
in
anything
in
my
power
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
know
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
very
kind
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
would
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
can
not
help
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
,
 
in
plain
language
,
I
do
not
know
how
to
put
my
story
into
words
that
shall
fit
it
.
<EOS>
I
love
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Will
you
help
me
to
win
her
to
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
love
Violet
Effingham
!
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
the
look
of
her
countenance
towards
him
was
so
changed
that
he
became
at
once
aware
that
from
her
no
assistance
might
be
expected
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
not
opened
in
any
degree
to
the
second
reason
above
given
for
Lady
Laura
's
opposition
to
his
wishes
,
but
he
instantly
perceived
that
she
would
still
cling
to
that
destination
of
Violet
's
hand
which
had
for
years
past
<EOS>
been
the
favourite
scheme
of
her
life
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
not
always
known
,
Mr.
Finn
,
what
have
been
our
hopes
for
Violet
?
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
though
he
had
perceived
his
mistake
,
felt
that
he
must
go
on
with
his
cause
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
must
know
his
wishes
sooner
or
later
,
and
it
was
as
well
that
she
should
learn
them
in
this
way
as
in
any
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
but
I
have
known
also
,
from
your
brother
's
own
lips
,
 
and
indeed
from
yours
also
,
Lady
Laura
,
 
that
Chiltern
has
been
three
times
refused
by
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
that
matter
?
<EOS>
Do
men
never
ask
more
than
three
times
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
must
I
be
debarred
for
ever
while
he
prosecutes
a
hopeless
suit
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
you
of
all
men
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
so
,
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Because
in
this
matter
you
have
been
his
chosen
friend
,
 
and
mine
.
<EOS>
We
have
told
you
everything
,
trusting
to
you
.
<EOS>
We
have
believed
in
your
honour
.
<EOS>
We
have
thought
that
with
you
,
at
any
rate
,
we
were
safe
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
words
were
very
bitter
to
Phineas
,
and
yet
when
he
had
written
his
letter
at
Loughton
,
he
had
intended
to
be
so
perfectly
honest
,
chivalrously
honest
!
<EOS>
Now
Lady
Laura
spoke
to
him
and
looked
at
him
as
though
he
had
been
most
basely
false
 
most
untrue
to
that
noble
friendship
which
had
been
lavished
upon
him
by
all
her
family
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
would
become
the
prey
of
her
most
injurious
thoughts
unless
he
could
fully
explain
his
ideas
,
and
he
felt
,
also
,
that
the
circumstances
did
not
admit
of
his
explaining
them
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
take
up
the
argument
on
Violet
's
side
,
and
show
how
unfair
it
would
be
to
her
that
she
should
be
debarred
from
the
homage
due
to
her
by
any
man
who
really
loved
her
,
because
Lord
Chiltern
chose
to
think
that
he
still
had
a
claim
,
 
or
at
any
rate
a
chance
.
<EOS>
And
Phineas
knew
well
of
himself
,
 
or
thought
that
he
knew
well
,
 
that
he
would
not
have
interfered
<EOS>
had
there
been
any
chance
for
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
had
himself
told
him
more
than
once
that
there
was
no
such
chance
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
explain
all
this
to
Lady
Laura
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
I
can
hardly
believe
this
of
you
,
even
when
you
tell
it
me
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
Lady
Laura
,
for
a
moment
.
"
  
"
Certainly
,
I
will
listen
.
<EOS>
But
that
you
should
come
to
me
for
assistance
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
Men
sometimes
become
harder
than
stones
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
I
am
hard
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
blind
fool
!
<EOS>
He
was
still
thinking
only
of
Violet
,
and
of
the
accusation
made
against
him
that
he
was
untrue
to
his
friendship
for
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Of
that
other
accusation
which
could
not
be
expressed
in
open
words
he
understood
nothing
,
 
nothing
at
all
as
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hard
and
false
,
 
capable
of
receiving
no
impression
beyond
the
outside
husk
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lady
Laura
,
do
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
only
know
how
true
I
am
in
my
affection
for
you
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
do
you
show
it
?
 
<EOS>
by
coming
in
between
Oswald
and
the
only
means
that
are
open
to
us
of
reconciling
him
to
his
father
;
 
means
that
have
been
explained
to
you
exactly
as
though
you
had
been
one
of
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Oswald
has
treated
you
as
a
brother
in
the
matter
,
telling
you
everything
,
and
this
is
the
way
you
would
repay
him
for
his
confidence
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
help
it
,
that
I
have
learnt
to
love
this
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
 
you
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
What
if
she
had
been
Oswald
's
wife
;
 
would
you
have
loved
her
then
?
<EOS>
Do
you
speak
of
loving
a
woman
as
if
it
were
an
affair
of
fate
,
over
which
you
have
no
control
?
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
your
passions
are
so
strong
as
that
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
put
aside
your
love
for
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
I
feel
assured
that
it
will
never
hurt
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
some
remembrance
of
what
had
passed
between
him
and
Lady
Laura
Standish
near
the
falls
of
the
Linter
,
when
he
first
visited
Scotland
,
came
across
his
mind
.
"
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
"
she
said
with
a
smile
,
"
this
little
wound
in
your
heart
will
soon
be
cured
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stood
silent
before
her
,
looking
away
from
her
,
thinking
over
it
all
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
had
believed
himself
to
be
violently
in
love
with
Lady
Laura
,
and
yet
when
he
had
just
now
entered
her
drawing
-
room
,
he
had
almost
forgotten
that
there
had
been
such
a
passage
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
believed
that
she
had
forgotten
it
,
 
even
though
she
had
counselled
him
not
to
come
to
Loughlinter
within
the
last
nine
months
!
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
boy
then
,
and
had
not
known
himself
;
 
but
now
he
was
a
man
,
and
was
proud
of
the
intensity
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
There
came
upon
him
some
passing
throb
of
pain
from
his
shoulder
,
reminding
him
of
the
duel
,
and
he
was
proud
also
of
that
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
willing
to
risk
everything
,
 
life
,
prospects
,
and
position
,
 
sooner
than
abandon
the
slight
hope
which
was
his
of
possessing
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
was
told
that
this
wound
in
his
heart
would
soon
be
cured
,
and
was
told
so
by
a
woman
to
whom
he
had
once
sung
a
song
of
another
passion
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
hard
to
answer
a
woman
in
such
circumstances
,
because
her
womanhood
gives
her
so
strong
a
ground
of
vantage
!
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
might
venture
to
throw
in
his
teeth
the
fickleness
of
his
heart
,
but
he
could
not
in
reply
tell
her
that
to
change
a
love
was
better
than
to
marry
without
love
,
 
that
to
be
capable
of
such
a
change
showed
no
such
inferiority
of
nature
as
did
the
capacity
for
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
She
could
hit
him
with
her
argument
;
but
he
could
only
remember
his
,
and
think
how
violent
might
be
the
blow
he
could
inflict
,
 
if
it
were
not
that
she
were
a
woman
,
and
therefore
guarded
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
help
me
then
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
when
they
had
both
been
silent
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
Help
you
?
<EOS>
How
should
I
help
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
no
other
help
than
this
,
 
that
I
might
have
had
an
opportunity
of
meeting
Violet
here
,
and
of
getting
from
her
some
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
the
question
then
never
been
asked
already
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
To
this
Phineas
made
no
immediate
reply
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
reason
why
he
should
show
his
whole
hand
to
an
adversary
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
not
go
to
Lady
Baldock
's
house
?
"
<EOS>
continued
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
admitted
there
.
<EOS>
You
know
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
Go
and
ask
her
to
stand
your
friend
with
her
niece
.
<EOS>
See
what
she
will
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
understand
these
matters
,
that
is
the
fair
,
honourable
,
open
way
in
which
gentlemen
are
wo
nt
to
make
their
overtures
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
make
mine
to
none
but
to
herself
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
have
you
made
it
to
me
,
sir
?
"
demanded
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
you
as
I
would
to
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
?
<EOS>
Psha
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
your
sister
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
were
I
so
<EOS>
,
should
I
fail
to
remember
that
I
have
a
dearer
brother
to
whom
my
faith
is
pledged
.
<EOS>
Look
here
.
<EOS>
Within
the
last
three
weeks
Oswald
has
sacrificed
everything
to
his
father
,
because
he
was
determined
that
Mr.
Kennedy
should
have
the
money
which
he
thought
was
due
to
my
husband
.
<EOS>
He
has
enabled
my
father
to
do
what
he
will
with
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
Papa
will
never
hurt
him
;
 
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
Hard
as
papa
is
with
him
,
he
will
never
hurt
Oswald
's
future
position
.
<EOS>
Papa
is
too
proud
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
Violet
has
heard
what
Oswald
has
done
;
and
now
that
he
has
nothing
of
his
own
to
offer
her
for
the
future
but
his
bare
title
,
now
that
he
has
given
papa
power
to
do
what
he
will
with
the
property
,
I
believe
that
she
would
accept
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
That
is
her
disposition
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
again
paused
a
moment
before
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
try
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
away
,
 
in
Brussels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Send
to
him
,
and
bid
him
return
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
patient
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Let
him
come
and
try
,
and
I
will
bide
my
time
.
<EOS>
I
confess
that
I
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
him
if
there
be
a
chance
for
him
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
no
chance
,
my
right
is
as
good
as
that
of
any
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
this
which
made
Lady
Laura
feel
that
she
could
not
maintain
her
hostility
against
this
man
on
behalf
of
her
brother
;
 
and
yet
she
could
not
force
herself
to
be
other
than
hostile
to
him
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
sore
,
and
it
was
he
that
had
made
it
sore
.
<EOS>
She
had
lectured
herself
,
schooling
herself
with
mental
sackcloth
and
ashes
,
rebuking
herself
with
heaviest
censures
from
day
to
day
,
because
she
had
found
herself
to
be
in
danger
of
regarding
this
man
with
a
perilous
love
;
and
she
had
been
constant
in
this
work
of
penance
till
she
had
been
able
to
assure
herself
that
the
sackcloth
and
ashes
had
done
their
work
,
and
that
the
danger
was
past
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
him
still
and
love
him
well
,
"
she
had
said
to
herself
with
something
almost
of
triumph
,
"
but
I
have
ceased
to
think
of
him
as
one
who
might
have
been
my
lover
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
she
was
now
sick
and
sore
,
almost
beside
herself
with
the
agony
of
the
wound
,
because
this
man
whom
she
had
been
able
to
throw
aside
from
her
heart
had
also
been
able
so
to
throw
her
aside
.
<EOS>
And
she
felt
herself
constrained
to
rebuke
him
with
what
bitterest
words
she
might
use
.
<EOS>
She
had
felt
it
easy
to
do
this
at
first
,
on
her
brother
's
score
.
<EOS>
She
had
accused
him
of
treachery
to
his
friendship
,
 
both
as
to
Oswald
and
as
to
herself
.
<EOS>
On
that
she
could
say
cutting
words
without
subjecting
herself
to
suspicion
even
from
herself
.
<EOS>
But
now
this
power
was
taken
away
from
her
,
and
still
she
wished
to
wound
him
.
<EOS>
She
desired
to
taunt
him
with
his
old
fickleness
,
and
yet
to
subject
herself
to
no
imputation
.
"
<EOS>
Your
right
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
gives
you
any
right
in
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Simply
the
right
of
a
fair
field
,
and
no
favour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
come
to
me
for
favour
,
 
to
me
,
because
I
am
her
friend
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
win
her
yourself
,
and
think
I
may
help
you
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
in
your
love
for
her
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
If
there
were
no
other
reason
,
and
I
could
help
you
,
I
would
not
,
because
I
think
your
heart
is
a
sham
heart
.
<EOS>
She
is
pretty
,
and
has
money
 
"
  
"
Lady
Laura
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
pretty
,
and
has
money
,
and
is
the
fashion
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
that
you
should
wish
to
have
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
believe
that
Oswald
really
loves
her
;
 
and
that
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
His
nature
is
deeper
than
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
understood
it
all
now
as
he
listened
to
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
and
looked
into
the
lines
of
her
face
.
<EOS>
There
was
written
there
plainly
enough
<EOS>
that
spretæ
injuria
formæ
of
which
she
herself
was
conscious
,
but
only
conscious
.
<EOS>
Even
his
eyes
,
blind
as
he
had
been
,
were
opened
,
 
and
he
knew
that
he
had
been
a
fool
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
that
I
came
to
you
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
better
that
you
should
not
have
done
so
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
perhaps
it
is
well
that
there
should
be
no
misunderstanding
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
must
tell
my
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
but
for
a
moment
,
and
then
he
answered
her
with
a
sharp
voice
,
"
He
has
been
told
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
who
told
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
him
the
moment
that
I
knew
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
I
owed
it
to
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
my
letter
missed
him
,
and
he
only
learned
it
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
him
since
?
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
I
have
seen
him
.
"
  
"
And
what
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
How
did
he
take
it
?
<EOS>
Did
he
bear
it
from
you
quietly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
;
"
and
Phineas
smiled
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Mr.
Finn
;
what
happened
?
<EOS>
What
is
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
is
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Everything
has
been
done
.
<EOS>
I
may
as
well
tell
you
all
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
that
for
the
sake
of
me
,
as
well
as
of
your
brother
,
you
will
keep
our
secret
.
<EOS>
He
required
that
I
should
either
give
up
my
suit
,
or
that
I
should
,
 
fight
him
.
<EOS>
As
I
could
not
comply
with
the
one
request
,
I
found
myself
bound
to
comply
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
has
been
a
duel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
there
has
been
a
duel
.
<EOS>
We
went
over
to
Belgium
,
and
it
was
soon
settled
.
<EOS>
He
wounded
me
here
in
the
arm
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
you
had
killed
him
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
Lady
Laura
,
would
have
been
a
misfortune
so
terrible
that
I
was
bound
to
prevent
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
paused
again
,
regretting
what
he
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
surprised
me
,
Lady
Laura
,
into
an
answer
that
I
should
not
have
made
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
sure
,
 
may
I
not
,
 
that
my
words
will
not
go
beyond
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
you
may
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
This
she
said
plaintively
,
with
a
tone
of
voice
and
demeanour
of
body
altogether
different
from
that
which
she
lately
bore
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
knew
what
was
taking
place
between
them
;
but
she
was
,
in
truth
,
gradually
submitting
herself
again
to
this
man
's
influence
.
<EOS>
Though
she
rebuked
him
at
every
turn
for
what
he
said
,
for
what
he
had
done
,
for
what
he
proposed
to
do
,
still
she
could
not
teach
herself
to
despise
him
,
or
even
to
cease
to
love
him
for
any
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
knew
it
all
now
,
 
except
that
word
or
two
which
had
passed
between
Violet
and
Phineas
in
the
rides
of
Saulsby
Park
.
<EOS>
But
she
suspected
something
even
of
that
,
feeling
sure
that
the
only
matter
on
which
Phineas
would
say
nothing
would
be
that
of
his
own
success
,
 
if
success
there
had
been
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
and
Oswald
have
quarrelled
,
and
there
has
been
a
duel
.
<EOS>
That
is
why
you
were
away
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
why
I
was
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
wrong
of
you
,
 
how
very
wrong
!
<EOS>
Had
he
been
,
 
<EOS>
killed
,
how
could
you
have
looked
us
in
the
face
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
have
looked
you
in
the
face
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
that
is
over
now
.
<EOS>
And
were
you
friends
afterwards
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
we
did
not
part
as
friends
.
<EOS>
Having
gone
there
to
fight
with
him
,
 
most
unwillingly
,
 
I
could
not
afterwards
promise
him
that
I
would
give
up
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
You
say
she
will
accept
him
now
.
<EOS>
Let
him
come
and
try
.
"
<EOS>
She
had
nothing
further
to
say
,
 
no
other
argument
to
use
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
soreness
at
her
heart
still
present
to
her
,
making
her
wretched
,
instigating
her
to
hurt
him
if
she
knew
how
to
do
so
,
in
spite
of
her
regard
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
she
felt
that
she
was
weak
and
powerless
.
<EOS>
She
had
shot
her
arrows
at
him
,
 
all
but
one
,
 
and
if
she
used
that
,
its
poisoned
point
would
wound
herself
far
more
surely
than
it
would
touch
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
duel
was
very
silly
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
;
certainly
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
at
least
that
I
have
told
you
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
you
should
be
glad
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
say
nothing
to
Violet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
that
I
can
say
in
Oswald
's
favour
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
nothing
of
the
duel
;
but
beyond
that
you
have
no
right
to
demand
my
secrecy
with
her
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
you
had
better
go
,
Mr.
Finn
,
for
I
am
hardly
well
.
<EOS>
And
remember
this
,
 
If
you
can
forget
this
little
episode
about
Miss
Effingham
,
so
will
I
forget
it
also
;
and
so
will
Oswald
.
<EOS>
I
can
promise
for
him
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
smiled
and
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
he
went
.
  
<EOS>
She
rose
from
her
chair
as
he
left
the
room
,
and
waited
till
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
great
door
closing
behind
him
before
she
again
sat
down
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
he
was
gone
,
 
when
she
was
sure
that
he
was
no
longer
there
with
her
in
the
same
house
,
 
she
laid
her
head
down
upon
the
arm
of
the
sofa
,
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
<EOS>
She
was
no
longer
angry
with
Phineas
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
further
longing
in
her
heart
for
revenge
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
now
desire
to
injure
him
,
though
she
had
done
so
as
long
as
he
was
with
her
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
 
she
resolved
instantly
,
almost
instinctively
,
that
Lord
Brentford
must
know
nothing
of
all
this
,
lest
the
political
prospects
of
the
young
member
for
Loughton
should
be
injured
.
<EOS>
To
have
rebuked
him
,
to
rebuke
him
again
and
again
,
would
be
only
fair
,
 
would
at
least
be
womanly
;
but
she
would
protect
him
from
all
material
injury
as
far
as
her
power
of
protection
might
avail
.
<EOS>
And
why
was
she
weeping
now
so
bitterly
?
<EOS>
Of
course
she
asked
herself
,
as
she
rubbed
away
the
tears
with
her
hands
,
 
Why
should
she
weep
?
<EOS>
She
was
not
weak
enough
to
tell
herself
that
she
was
weeping
for
any
injury
that
had
been
done
to
Oswald
.
<EOS>
She
got
up
suddenly
from
the
sofa
,
and
pushed
away
her
hair
from
her
face
,
and
pushed
away
the
tears
from
her
cheeks
,
and
then
clenched
her
fists
as
she
held
them
out
at
full
length
from
her
body
,
and
stood
,
looking
up
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
wall
.
"
<EOS>
Ass
!
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Fool
!
<EOS>
Idiot
!
<EOS>
That
I
should
not
be
able
to
crush
it
into
nothing
and
have
done
with
it
!
<EOS>
Why
should
he
not
have
her
?
<EOS>
After
all
,
he
is
better
than
Oswald
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
 
is
that
you
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
room
had
been
opened
while
she
was
standing
thus
,
and
her
husband
had
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
it
is
I.
Is
anything
wrong
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
much
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Laura
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
in
trouble
you
should
tell
me
what
it
is
,
and
leave
it
to
me
to
try
to
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
shaking
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
that
is
uncourteous
,
 
not
to
say
undutiful
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
was
,
 
both
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
I
could
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
you
should
help
such
words
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
moments
,
Robert
,
when
even
a
married
woman
must
be
herself
rather
than
her
husband
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
,
though
you
can
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
make
a
woman
subject
to
you
as
a
dog
is
so
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
all
the
outside
and
as
much
of
the
inside
as
you
can
master
.
<EOS>
With
a
dog
you
may
be
sure
of
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
this
means
that
you
have
secrets
in
which
I
am
not
to
share
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
troubles
about
my
father
and
my
brother
which
you
can
not
share
.
<EOS>
My
brother
is
a
ruined
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
ruined
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
talk
about
it
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
speak
to
you
of
him
or
of
papa
.
<EOS>
I
only
want
you
to
understand
that
there
is
a
subject
which
must
be
secret
to
myself
,
and
on
which
I
may
be
allowed
to
shed
tears
,
 
if
I
am
so
weak
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
trouble
you
on
a
matter
in
which
I
have
not
your
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
left
him
,
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
depressed
by
what
had
occurred
,
 
but
not
thinking
of
it
as
of
a
trouble
which
would
do
more
than
make
him
uncomfortable
for
that
day
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
 
<EOS>
Day
after
day
,
and
clause
after
clause
,
the
bill
was
fought
in
committee
,
and
few
men
fought
with
more
constancy
on
the
side
of
the
Ministers
than
did
the
member
for
Loughton
.
<EOS>
Troubled
though
he
was
by
his
quarrel
with
Lord
Chiltern
,
by
his
love
for
Violet
Effingham
,
by
the
silence
of
his
friend
Lady
Laura
,
 
for
since
he
had
told
her
of
the
duel
she
had
become
silent
to
him
,
never
writing
to
him
,
and
hardly
speaking
to
him
when
she
met
him
in
society
,
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
Phineas
was
not
so
troubled
but
what
he
could
work
at
his
vocation
.
<EOS>
Now
,
when
he
would
find
himself
upon
his
legs
in
the
House
,
he
would
wonder
at
the
hesitation
which
had
lately
troubled
him
so
sorely
.
<EOS>
He
would
sit
sometimes
and
speculate
upon
that
dimness
of
eye
,
upon
that
tendency
of
things
to
go
round
,
upon
that
obtrusive
palpitation
of
heart
,
which
had
afflicted
him
so
seriously
for
so
long
a
time
.
<EOS>
The
House
now
was
no
more
to
him
than
any
other
chamber
,
and
the
members
no
more
than
other
men
.
<EOS>
He
guarded
himself
from
orations
,
speaking
always
very
shortly
,
 
because
he
believed
that
policy
and
good
judgment
required
that
he
should
be
short
.
<EOS>
But
words
were
very
easy
to
him
,
and
he
would
feel
as
though
he
could
talk
for
ever
.
<EOS>
And
there
quickly
came
to
him
a
reputation
for
practical
usefulness
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
with
strong
opinions
,
who
could
yet
be
submissive
.
<EOS>
And
no
man
seemed
to
know
how
his
reputation
had
come
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
one
good
speech
after
two
or
three
failures
.
<EOS>
All
who
knew
him
,
his
whole
party
,
had
been
aware
of
his
failure
;
and
his
one
good
speech
had
been
regarded
by
many
as
no
very
wonderful
effort
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
man
who
was
pleasant
to
other
men
,
 
not
combative
,
not
self
-
asserting
beyond
the
point
at
which
self
-
assertion
ceases
to
be
a
necessity
of
manliness
.
<EOS>
Nature
had
been
very
good
to
him
,
making
him
comely
inside
and
out
,
 
and
with
this
comeliness
he
had
crept
into
popularity
.
  
<EOS>
The
secret
of
the
duel
was
,
I
think
,
at
this
time
,
known
to
a
great
many
men
and
women
.
<EOS>
So
Phineas
perceived
;
but
it
was
not
,
he
thought
,
known
either
to
Lord
Brentford
or
to
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
And
in
this
he
was
right
.
<EOS>
No
rumour
of
it
had
yet
reached
the
ears
of
either
of
these
persons
;
 
and
rumour
,
though
she
flies
so
fast
and
so
far
,
is
often
slow
in
reaching
those
ears
which
would
be
most
interested
in
her
tidings
.
<EOS>
Some
dim
report
of
the
duel
reached
even
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
he
asked
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
Who
told
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bonteen
told
me
that
it
was
certainly
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Bonteen
always
knows
more
than
anybody
else
about
everything
except
his
own
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
is
not
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
paused
,
 
and
then
she
lied
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
not
true
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
ask
either
of
them
,
but
to
me
it
seems
to
be
the
most
improbable
thing
in
life
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Kennedy
believed
that
there
had
been
no
duel
.
<EOS>
In
his
wife
's
word
he
put
absolute
faith
,
and
he
thought
that
she
would
certainly
know
anything
that
her
brother
had
done
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
a
man
given
to
but
little
discourse
,
he
asked
no
further
questions
about
the
duel
either
in
the
House
or
at
the
Clubs
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
,
Phineas
had
been
greatly
dismayed
when
men
had
asked
him
questions
tending
to
elicit
from
him
some
explanation
of
the
mystery
;
 
but
by
degrees
<EOS>
he
became
used
to
it
,
and
as
the
tidings
which
had
got
abroad
did
not
seem
to
injure
him
,
and
as
the
questionings
were
not
pushed
very
closely
,
he
became
indifferent
.
<EOS>
There
came
out
another
article
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
in
which
Lord
C
 
n
and
Mr.
P
 
<EOS>
s
<EOS>
F
 
n
were
spoken
of
as
glaring
examples
of
that
aristocratic
snobility
,
 
<EOS>
that
was
the
expressive
word
coined
,
evidently
with
great
delight
,
for
the
occasion
,
 
which
the
rotten
state
of
London
society
in
high
quarters
now
produced
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
young
lord
,
infamously
notorious
,
quarrelling
with
one
of
his
boon
-
companions
,
whom
he
had
appointed
to
a
private
seat
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
fighting
duels
,
breaking
the
laws
,
scandalising
the
public
,
 
and
all
this
was
done
without
punishment
to
the
guilty
!
<EOS>
There
were
old
stories
afloat
,
 
so
said
the
article
 
of
what
in
a
former
century
had
been
done
by
Lord
Mohuns
and
Mr.
Bests
;
but
now
,
in
186
 
,
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
<EOS>
And
so
the
article
went
on
.
<EOS>
Any
reader
may
fill
in
without
difficulty
the
concluding
indignation
and
virtuous
appeal
for
reform
in
social
morals
as
well
as
Parliament
.
<EOS>
But
Phineas
had
so
far
progressed
that
he
had
almost
come
to
like
this
kind
of
thing
.
  
<EOS>
Certainly
I
think
that
the
duel
did
him
no
harm
in
society
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
he
would
hardly
have
been
asked
to
a
semi
-
political
dinner
at
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
's
,
even
though
he
might
have
been
invited
to
make
one
of
the
five
hundred
guests
who
were
crowded
into
her
saloons
and
staircases
after
the
dinner
was
over
.
<EOS>
To
have
been
one
of
the
five
hundred
was
nothing
;
but
to
be
one
of
the
sixteen
was
a
great
deal
,
 
was
indeed
so
much
that
Phineas
,
not
understanding
as
yet
the
advantage
of
his
own
comeliness
,
was
at
a
loss
to
conceive
why
so
pleasant
an
honour
was
conferred
upon
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
man
among
the
eight
men
at
the
dinner
-
party
not
in
Parliament
,
 
and
the
only
other
except
Phineas
not
attached
to
the
Government
<EOS>
was
Mr.
Palliser
's
great
friend
,
John
Grey
,
the
member
for
Silverbridge
.
<EOS>
There
were
four
Cabinet
Ministers
in
the
room
,
 
the
Duke
,
Lord
Cantrip
,
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
the
owner
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
There
was
also
Barrington
Erle
and
young
Lord
Fawn
,
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
But
the
wit
and
grace
of
the
ladies
present
lent
more
of
character
to
the
party
than
even
the
position
of
the
men
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
herself
was
a
host
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
woman
then
in
London
better
able
to
talk
to
a
dozen
people
on
a
dozen
subjects
;
and
then
,
moreover
,
she
was
still
in
the
flush
of
her
beauty
and
the
bloom
of
her
youth
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
was
there
;
 
by
what
means
divided
from
her
husband
Phineas
could
not
imagine
;
but
Lady
Glencora
was
good
at
such
divisions
.
<EOS>
Lady
Cantrip
had
been
allowed
to
come
with
her
lord
;
 
but
,
as
was
well
understood
,
Lord
Cantrip
was
not
so
manifestly
a
husband
as
was
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
There
are
men
who
can
not
guard
themselves
from
the
assertion
of
marital
rights
at
most
inappropriate
moments
.
<EOS>
Now
Lord
Cantrip
lived
with
his
wife
most
happily
;
yet
you
should
pass
hours
with
him
and
her
together
,
and
hardly
know
that
they
knew
each
other
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
Duke
's
daughters
was
there
,
 
but
not
the
Duchess
,
who
was
known
to
be
heavy
;
 
and
there
was
the
beauteous
Marchioness
of
Hartletop
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
was
in
the
room
also
,
 
giving
Phineas
a
blow
at
the
heart
as
he
saw
her
smile
.
<EOS>
Might
it
be
that
he
could
speak
a
word
to
her
on
this
occasion
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Grey
had
also
brought
his
wife
;
 
and
then
there
was
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Phineas
found
that
it
was
his
fortune
to
take
down
to
dinner
,
 
not
Violet
Effingham
,
but
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
And
,
when
he
was
placed
at
dinner
,
on
the
other
side
of
him
there
sat
Lady
Hartletop
,
who
addressed
the
few
words
which
she
spoke
exclusively
to
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
in
former
days
matters
difficult
of
arrangement
between
those
two
;
but
I
think
that
those
old
passages
had
now
been
forgotten
by
them
both
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
,
therefore
,
driven
to
depend
exclusively
on
Madame
Max
Goesler
for
conversation
,
and
he
found
that
he
was
not
called
upon
to
cast
his
seed
into
barren
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Up
to
that
moment
he
had
never
heard
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
in
introducing
them
,
had
pronounced
the
lady
's
name
so
clearly
that
he
had
caught
it
with
accuracy
,
but
he
could
not
surmise
whence
<EOS>
she
had
come
,
or
why
she
was
there
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
woman
probably
something
over
thirty
years
of
age
.
<EOS>
She
had
thick
black
hair
,
which
she
wore
in
curls
,
 
unlike
anybody
else
in
the
world
,
 
in
curls
which
hung
down
low
beneath
her
face
,
covering
,
and
perhaps
intended
to
cover
,
a
certain
thinness
in
her
cheeks
which
would
otherwise
have
taken
something
from
the
charm
of
her
countenance
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
large
,
of
a
dark
blue
colour
,
and
very
bright
,
 
and
she
used
them
in
a
manner
which
is
as
yet
hardly
common
with
Englishwomen
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
intend
that
you
should
know
that
she
employed
them
to
conquer
you
,
looking
as
a
knight
may
have
looked
in
olden
days
who
entered
a
chamber
with
his
sword
drawn
from
the
scabbard
and
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
forehead
was
broad
and
somewhat
low
.
<EOS>
Her
nose
was
not
classically
beautiful
,
being
broader
at
the
nostrils
than
beauty
required
,
and
,
moreover
,
not
perfectly
straight
in
its
line
.
<EOS>
Her
lips
were
thin
.
<EOS>
Her
teeth
,
which
she
endeavoured
to
show
as
little
as
possible
,
were
perfect
in
form
and
colour
.
<EOS>
They
who
criticised
her
severely
said
,
however
,
that
they
were
too
large
.
<EOS>
Her
chin
was
well
formed
,
and
divided
by
a
dimple
which
gave
to
her
face
a
softness
of
grace
which
would
otherwise
have
been
much
missed
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
her
great
beauty
was
in
the
brilliant
clearness
of
her
dark
complexion
.
<EOS>
You
might
almost
fancy
that
you
could
see
into
it
so
as
to
read
the
different
lines
beneath
the
skin
.
<EOS>
She
was
somewhat
tall
,
though
by
no
means
tall
to
a
fault
,
and
was
so
thin
as
to
be
almost
meagre
in
her
proportions
.
<EOS>
She
always
wore
her
dress
close
up
to
her
neck
,
and
never
showed
the
bareness
of
her
arms
.
<EOS>
Though
she
was
the
only
woman
so
clad
now
present
in
the
room
,
this
singularity
did
not
specially
strike
one
,
because
in
other
respects
her
apparel
was
so
rich
and
quaint
as
to
make
inattention
to
it
impossible
.
<EOS>
The
observer
who
did
not
observe
very
closely
would
perceive
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
dress
was
unlike
the
dress
of
other
women
,
but
seeing
that
it
was
unlike
in
make
,
unlike
in
colour
,
and
<EOS>
unlike
in
material
,
the
ordinary
observer
would
not
see
also
that
it
was
unlike
in
form
for
any
other
purpose
than
that
of
maintaining
its
general
peculiarity
of
character
.
<EOS>
In
colour
she
was
abundant
,
and
yet
the
fabric
of
her
garment
was
always
black
.
<EOS>
My
pen
may
not
dare
to
describe
the
traceries
of
yellow
and
ruby
silk
which
went
in
and
out
through
the
black
lace
,
across
her
bosom
,
and
round
her
neck
,
and
over
her
shoulders
,
and
along
her
arms
,
and
down
to
the
very
ground
at
her
feet
,
robbing
the
black
stuff
of
all
its
sombre
solemnity
,
and
producing
a
brightness
in
which
there
was
nothing
gaudy
.
<EOS>
She
wore
no
vestige
of
crinoline
,
and
hardly
anything
that
could
be
called
a
train
.
<EOS>
And
the
lace
sleeves
of
her
dress
,
with
their
bright
traceries
of
silk
,
were
fitted
close
to
her
arms
;
and
round
her
neck
<EOS>
she
wore
the
smallest
possible
collar
of
lace
,
above
which
there
was
a
short
chain
of
Roman
gold
with
a
ruby
pendant
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
rubies
in
her
ears
,
and
a
ruby
brooch
,
and
rubies
in
the
bracelets
on
her
arms
.
<EOS>
Such
,
as
regarded
the
outward
woman
,
was
Madame
Max
Goesler
;
and
Phineas
,
as
he
took
his
place
by
her
side
,
thought
that
fortune
for
the
nonce
had
done
well
with
him
,
 
only
that
he
should
have
liked
it
so
much
better
<EOS>
could
he
have
been
seated
next
to
Violet
Effingham
!
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
in
the
matter
of
conversation
his
morsel
of
seed
was
not
thrown
into
barren
ground
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
he
can
truly
be
said
to
have
produced
even
a
morsel
.
<EOS>
The
subjects
were
all
mooted
by
the
lady
,
and
so
great
was
her
fertility
in
discoursing
that
all
conversational
grasses
seemed
to
grow
with
her
spontaneously
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
said
,
"
what
would
I
not
give
to
be
a
member
of
the
British
Parliament
at
such
a
moment
as
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
at
such
a
moment
as
this
particularly
?
"
  
"
Because
there
is
something
to
be
done
,
which
,
let
me
tell
you
,
senator
though
you
are
,
is
not
always
the
case
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
experience
is
short
,
but
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
that
there
is
too
much
to
be
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
much
of
nothingness
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
the
case
?
<EOS>
But
now
there
is
a
real
fight
in
the
lists
.
<EOS>
The
one
great
drawback
to
the
life
of
women
is
that
they
can
not
act
in
politics
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
which
side
would
you
take
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
here
in
England
?
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
 
from
which
expression
,
and
from
one
or
two
others
of
a
similar
nature
,
Phineas
was
led
into
a
doubt
whether
the
lady
were
a
countrywoman
of
his
or
not
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
is
hard
to
say
.
<EOS>
Politically
I
should
want
to
out
-
Turnbull
Mr.
Turnbull
,
to
vote
for
everything
that
could
be
voted
for
,
 
ballot
,
manhood
suffrage
,
womanhood
suffrage
,
unlimited
right
of
striking
,
tenant
right
,
education
of
everybody
,
annual
parliaments
,
and
the
abolition
of
at
least
the
bench
of
bishops
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
strong
programme
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
strong
,
Mr.
Finn
,
but
that
's
what
I
should
like
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
however
,
that
I
should
be
tempted
to
feel
a
dastard
security
in
the
conviction
that
I
might
advocate
my
views
without
any
danger
of
seeing
them
carried
out
.
<EOS>
For
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
at
all
want
to
put
down
ladies
and
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
that
they
would
go
with
the
bench
of
bishops
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
anything
to
go
,
 
that
is
,
as
far
as
real
life
is
concerned
.
<EOS>
There
's
that
dear
good
Bishop
of
Abingdon
is
the
best
friend
I
have
in
the
world
,
 
and
as
for
the
Bishop
of
Dorchester
,
I
'd
walk
from
here
to
there
to
hear
him
preach
.
<EOS>
And
I
'd
sooner
hem
aprons
for
them
all
myself
than
that
they
should
want
those
pretty
decorations
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
Mr.
Finn
,
there
is
such
a
difference
between
life
and
theory
;
 
is
there
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
is
so
comfortable
to
have
theories
that
one
is
not
bound
to
carry
out
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
do
you
live
up
to
your
political
theories
?
<EOS>
"
At
this
moment
Mr.
Palliser
was
sitting
perfectly
silent
between
Lady
Hartletop
and
the
Duke
's
daughter
,
and
he
gave
a
little
spring
in
his
chair
as
this
sudden
address
was
made
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Your
House
of
Commons
theories
,
I
mean
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
is
saying
that
it
is
very
well
to
have
far
advanced
ideas
,
 
it
does
not
matter
how
far
advanced
,
 
because
one
is
never
called
upon
to
act
upon
them
practically
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
dangerous
doctrine
,
I
think
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
pleasant
,
 
so
at
least
Mr.
Finn
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
is
at
least
very
common
,
"
said
Phineas
,
not
caring
to
protect
himself
by
a
contradiction
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
myself
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
gravely
,
"
I
think
I
may
say
that
I
always
am
really
anxious
to
carry
into
practice
all
those
doctrines
of
policy
which
I
advocate
in
theory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
During
this
conversation
Lady
Hartletop
sat
as
though
no
word
of
it
reached
her
ears
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
understand
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
and
by
no
means
loved
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
,
when
he
had
made
his
little
speech
,
turned
to
the
Duke
's
daughter
and
asked
some
question
about
the
conservatories
at
Longroyston
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
called
forth
a
word
of
wisdom
,
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
taught
a
Cabinet
Minister
to
believe
that
I
am
a
most
unsound
politician
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
ruined
my
prospects
for
life
,
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
hope
not
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
can
understand
the
way
of
things
in
your
Government
,
the
aspirants
to
office
succeed
chiefly
by
making
themselves
uncommonly
unpleasant
to
those
who
are
in
power
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
can
hit
hard
enough
he
is
sure
to
be
taken
into
the
elysium
of
the
Treasury
bench
,
 
not
that
he
may
hit
others
,
but
that
he
may
cease
to
hit
those
who
are
there
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
men
are
chosen
because
they
are
useful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
severe
upon
us
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
one
man
is
as
useful
as
another
.
<EOS>
But
to
put
aside
joking
,
 
they
tell
me
that
you
are
sure
to
become
a
minister
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
felt
that
he
blushed
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
people
said
of
him
behind
his
back
that
he
was
a
man
likely
to
rise
high
in
political
position
?
<EOS>
"
Your
informants
are
very
kind
,
"
he
replied
awkwardly
,
"
but
I
do
not
know
who
they
are
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
get
up
in
the
way
you
describe
,
 
<EOS>
that
is
,
by
abusing
the
men
I
support
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
turned
round
to
Mr.
Grey
,
who
was
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
and
Phineas
was
left
for
a
moment
in
silence
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
say
a
word
to
Lady
Hartletop
,
but
Lady
Hartletop
only
bowed
her
head
gracefully
in
recognition
of
the
truth
of
the
statement
he
made
.
<EOS>
So
he
applied
himself
for
a
while
to
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
Miss
Effingham
?
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
again
addressing
him
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
I
think
about
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
her
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
I
know
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
closely
connected
with
the
Kennedys
,
who
are
friends
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
have
heard
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
that
scores
of
men
are
raving
about
her
.
<EOS>
Are
you
one
of
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
;
 
I
do
n't
mind
being
one
of
sundry
scores
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
particular
in
owning
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
admire
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
see
you
are
joking
.
<EOS>
I
do
amazingly
.
<EOS>
They
say
women
never
do
admire
women
,
but
I
most
sincerely
do
admire
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
a
friend
of
yours
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
;
 
<EOS>
I
must
not
dare
to
say
so
much
as
that
.
<EOS>
I
was
with
her
last
winter
for
a
week
at
Matching
,
and
of
course
I
meet
her
about
at
people
's
houses
.
<EOS>
She
seems
to
me
to
be
the
most
independent
girl
I
ever
knew
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
do
believe
that
nothing
would
make
her
marry
a
man
unless
she
loved
him
and
honoured
him
,
and
I
think
it
is
so
very
seldom
that
you
can
say
that
of
a
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
also
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
Then
he
paused
a
moment
before
he
continued
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
know
Miss
Effingham
very
intimately
,
but
from
what
I
have
seen
of
her
,
I
should
think
it
very
probable
that
she
may
not
marry
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
probably
,
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
who
then
again
turned
away
to
Mr.
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
after
this
,
when
the
moment
was
just
at
hand
in
which
the
ladies
were
to
retreat
,
Madame
Max
Goesler
again
addressed
Phineas
,
looking
very
full
into
his
face
as
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
the
time
will
ever
come
,
Mr.
Finn
,
in
which
you
will
give
me
an
account
of
that
day
's
journey
to
Blankenberg
?
"
  
"
To
Blankenberg
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
to
Blankenberg
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
asking
for
it
now
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
look
for
it
some
day
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
rose
from
her
seat
,
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
went
out
with
the
others
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
 
<EOS>
What
had
Madame
Max
Goesler
to
do
with
his
journey
to
Blankenberg
?
<EOS>
thought
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
sat
for
a
while
in
silence
between
Mr.
Palliser
and
Mr.
Grey
;
and
why
should
she
,
who
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
him
,
have
dared
to
ask
him
such
a
question
?
<EOS>
But
as
the
conversation
round
the
table
,
after
the
ladies
had
gone
,
soon
drifted
into
politics
and
became
general
,
Phineas
,
for
a
while
,
forgot
Madame
Max
Goesler
and
the
Blankenberg
journey
,
and
listened
to
the
eager
words
of
Cabinet
Ministers
,
now
and
again
uttering
a
word
of
his
own
,
and
showing
that
he
,
too
,
was
as
eager
as
others
.
<EOS>
But
the
session
in
Mr.
Palliser
's
dining
-
room
was
not
long
,
and
Phineas
soon
found
himself
making
his
way
amidst
a
throng
of
coming
guests
into
the
rooms
above
.
<EOS>
His
object
was
to
meet
Violet
Effingham
,
but
,
failing
that
,
he
would
not
be
unwilling
to
say
a
few
more
words
to
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
He
first
encountered
Lady
Laura
,
to
whom
he
had
not
spoken
as
yet
,
and
,
finding
himself
standing
close
to
her
for
a
while
,
he
asked
her
after
his
late
neighbour
.
"
<EOS>
Do
tell
me
one
thing
,
Lady
Laura
;
 
who
is
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
and
why
have
I
never
met
her
before
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
will
be
two
things
,
Mr.
Finn
;
but
I
will
answer
both
questions
as
well
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
met
her
before
,
because
she
was
in
Germany
last
spring
and
summer
,
and
in
the
year
before
that
you
were
not
about
so
much
as
you
have
been
since
.
<EOS>
Still
you
must
have
seen
her
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
widow
of
an
Austrian
banker
,
and
has
lived
the
greater
part
of
her
life
at
Vienna
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
rich
,
and
has
a
small
house
in
Park
Lane
,
where
she
receives
people
so
exclusively
that
it
has
come
to
be
thought
an
honour
to
be
invited
by
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Her
enemies
say
that
her
father
was
a
German
Jew
,
living
in
England
,
in
the
employment
of
the
Viennese
bankers
,
and
they
say
also
that
she
has
been
married
a
second
time
to
an
Austrian
Count
,
to
whom
she
allows
ever
so
much
a
year
to
stay
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
But
of
all
this
,
nobody
,
I
fancy
,
knows
anything
.
<EOS>
What
they
do
know
is
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
spends
seven
or
eight
thousand
a
year
,
and
that
she
will
give
no
man
an
opportunity
of
even
asking
her
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
People
used
to
be
shy
of
her
,
but
she
goes
almost
everywhere
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
not
been
at
Portman
Square
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
<EOS>
;
but
then
Lady
Glencora
is
so
much
more
advanced
than
we
are
!
<EOS>
After
all
,
we
are
but
humdrum
people
,
as
the
world
goes
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
began
to
roam
about
the
rooms
,
striving
to
find
an
opportunity
of
engrossing
five
minutes
of
Miss
Effingham
's
attention
.
<EOS>
During
the
time
that
Lady
Laura
was
giving
him
the
history
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
<EOS>
his
eyes
had
wandered
round
,
and
he
had
perceived
that
Violet
was
standing
in
the
further
corner
of
a
large
lobby
on
to
which
the
stairs
opened
,
 
so
situated
,
indeed
,
that
she
could
hardly
escape
,
because
of
the
increasing
crowd
,
but
on
that
very
account
almost
impossible
to
be
reached
.
<EOS>
He
could
see
,
also
,
that
she
was
talking
to
Lord
Fawn
,
an
unmarried
peer
of
something
over
thirty
years
of
age
,
with
an
unrivalled
pair
of
whiskers
,
a
small
estate
,
and
a
rising
political
reputation
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
been
talking
to
Violet
through
the
whole
dinner
,
and
Phineas
was
beginning
to
think
that
he
should
like
to
make
another
journey
to
Blankenberg
,
with
the
object
of
meeting
his
lordship
on
the
sands
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Laura
had
done
speaking
,
his
eyes
were
turned
through
a
large
open
doorway
towards
the
spot
on
which
his
idol
was
standing
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
of
no
use
,
my
friend
,
"
she
said
,
touching
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
make
you
know
that
it
is
of
no
use
,
because
then
I
think
you
would
be
happier
.
<EOS>
"
To
this
Phineas
made
no
answer
,
but
went
and
roamed
about
the
rooms
.
<EOS>
Why
should
it
be
of
no
use
?
<EOS>
Would
Violet
Effingham
marry
any
man
merely
because
he
was
a
lord
?
  
<EOS>
Some
half
-
hour
after
this
he
had
succeeded
in
making
his
way
up
to
the
place
in
which
Violet
was
still
standing
,
with
Lord
Fawn
beside
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
making
such
a
struggle
to
get
to
you
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
are
here
,
you
will
have
to
stay
,
for
it
is
impossible
to
get
out
,
"
she
answered
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
has
made
the
attempt
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
,
but
has
failed
grievously
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
quite
contented
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
;
 
"
more
than
contented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
felt
that
he
ought
to
give
some
special
reason
to
Miss
Effingham
to
account
for
his
efforts
to
reach
her
,
but
yet
he
had
nothing
special
to
say
.
<EOS>
Had
Lord
Fawn
not
been
there
,
he
would
immediately
have
told
her
that
he
was
waiting
for
an
answer
to
the
question
he
had
asked
her
in
Saulsby
Park
,
but
he
could
hardly
do
this
in
presence
of
the
noble
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
She
received
him
with
her
pleasant
genial
smile
,
looking
exactly
as
she
had
looked
when
he
had
parted
from
her
on
the
morning
after
their
ride
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
show
any
sign
of
anger
,
or
even
of
indifference
at
his
approach
.
<EOS>
But
still
it
was
almost
necessary
that
he
should
account
for
his
search
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
so
longed
to
hear
from
you
how
you
got
on
at
Loughlinter
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
yes
;
and
I
will
tell
you
something
of
it
some
day
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
not
come
to
Lady
Baldock
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
even
know
that
Lady
Baldock
was
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
have
known
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
is
in
town
.
<EOS>
Where
did
you
suppose
I
was
living
?
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
was
there
yesterday
,
and
can
tell
you
that
my

quite
blooming

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Baldock
is
blooming
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
;
"
certainly
blooming
;
 
that
is
,
if
evergreens
may
be
said
to
bloom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Evergreens
do
bloom
,
as
well
as
spring
plants
,
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
You
come
and
see
her
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
only
you
must
bring
a
little
money
with
you
for
the
Female
Protestant
Unmarried
Women
's
Emigration
Society
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
aunt
's
present
hobby
,
as
Lord
Fawn
knows
to
his
cost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
may
never
spend
half
-
a
-
sovereign
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
a
perilous
affair
for
me
,
as
my
aunt
wants
me
to
go
out
as
a
sort
of
leading
<EOS>
Protestant
unmarried
female
emigrant
pioneer
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
that
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
with
much
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'll
go
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
,
if
I
were
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
doubt
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
such
a
grand
prospect
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
an
opening
in
life
.
<EOS>
So
much
excitement
,
you
know
;
and
such
a
useful
career
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
there
were
not
plenty
of
opening
here
for
Miss
Effingham
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
"
and
plenty
of
excitement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
there
is
?
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
much
more
civil
than
Mr.
Finn
,
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
"
Then
Phineas
began
to
hope
that
he
need
not
be
afraid
of
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
happy
man
you
were
at
dinner
!
"
continued
Violet
,
addressing
herself
to
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
Lord
Fawn
was
the
happy
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
Madame
Max
Goesler
all
to
yourself
for
nearly
two
hours
,
and
I
suppose
there
was
not
a
creature
in
the
room
who
did
not
envy
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
doubt
that
ever
so
much
interest
was
made
with
Lady
Glencora
as
to
taking
Madame
Max
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
I
know
,
intrigued
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Effingham
,
really
I
must
 
contradict
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
Barrington
Erle
begged
for
it
as
a
particular
favour
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
,
with
a
sigh
,
owned
that
it
was
impossible
,
because
of
his
cumbrous
rank
;
and
Mr.
Gresham
,
when
it
was
offered
to
him
,
declared
that
he
was
fatigued
with
the
business
of
the
House
,
and
not
up
to
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
How
much
did
she
say
to
you
;
and
what
did
she
talk
about
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
ballot
chiefly
,
 
that
,
and
manhood
suffrage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
she
said
something
more
than
that
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
never
lets
any
man
go
without
entrancing
him
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
anything
near
your
heart
,
Mr.
Finn
,
Madame
Max
Goesler
touched
it
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
Now
Phineas
had
two
things
near
his
heart
,
 
political
promotion
and
Violet
Effingham
,
 
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
had
managed
to
touch
them
both
.
<EOS>
She
had
asked
him
respecting
his
journey
to
Blankenberg
,
and
had
touched
him
very
nearly
in
reference
to
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
of
course
?
"
said
Violet
to
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
I
know
the
lady
;
 
that
is
,
as
well
as
other
people
do
.
<EOS>
No
one
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
,
knows
much
of
her
;
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
world
is
becoming
tired
of
her
.
<EOS>
A
mystery
is
good
for
nothing
if
it
remains
always
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
is
good
for
nothing
at
all
when
it
is
found
out
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
it
is
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
is
a
bore
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
find
her
a
bore
?
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
,
choosing
to
oppose
Lord
Fawn
as
well
as
he
could
on
that
matter
,
as
on
every
other
,
declared
that
he
had
found
Madame
Max
Goesler
most
delightful
.
"
<EOS>
And
beautiful
,
 
is
she
not
?
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Beautiful
!
"
exclaimed
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
her
very
beautiful
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
she
is
a
dear
ally
of
mine
.
<EOS>
We
were
a
week
together
last
winter
,
and
swore
an
undying
friendship
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
ever
so
much
about
Mr.
Goesler
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
told
you
nothing
of
her
second
husband
?
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
that
you
have
run
into
scandal
,
I
shall
have
done
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
after
this
,
when
Phineas
was
preparing
to
fight
his
way
out
of
the
house
,
he
was
again
close
to
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
found
a
single
moment
in
which
to
ask
Violet
for
an
answer
to
his
old
question
,
and
was
retiring
from
the
field
discomfited
,
but
not
dispirited
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
he
thought
,
was
not
a
serious
obstacle
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
told
him
that
there
was
no
hope
for
him
;
but
then
Lady
Laura
's
mind
on
that
subject
was
,
he
thought
,
prejudiced
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
certainly
knew
what
were
his
wishes
,
and
knowing
them
,
smiled
on
him
and
was
gracious
to
him
.
<EOS>
Would
she
do
so
if
his
pretensions
were
thoroughly
objectionable
to
her
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
that
you
were
successful
this
evening
,
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
aware
of
any
success
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
call
it
great
success
to
be
able
to
make
your
way
where
you
will
through
such
a
crowd
as
there
is
here
.
<EOS>
You
seem
to
me
to
be
so
stout
a
cavalier
that
I
shall
ask
you
to
find
my
servant
,
and
bid
him
get
my
carriage
.
<EOS>
Will
you
mind
?
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
of
course
,
declared
that
he
would
be
delighted
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
a
German
,
and
not
in
livery
.
<EOS>
But
if
somebody
will
call
out
,
he
will
hear
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
sharp
,
and
much
more
attentive
than
your
English
footmen
.
<EOS>
An
Englishman
hardly
ever
makes
a
good
servant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
a
compliment
to
us
Britons
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
is
a
servant
,
he
should
be
clever
enough
to
be
a
good
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
had
now
given
the
order
for
the
carriage
,
and
,
having
returned
,
was
standing
with
Madame
Max
Goesler
in
the
cloak
-
room
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
we
are
surely
the
most
awkward
people
in
the
world
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
Lord
Fawn
,
who
was
talking
to
Miss
Effingham
just
now
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
heard
him
trying
to
pay
me
a
compliment
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
It
was
like
a
donkey
walking
a
minuet
,
and
yet
they
say
he
is
a
clever
man
and
can
make
speeches
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Could
it
be
possible
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
ears
were
so
sharp
that
she
had
heard
the
things
which
Lord
Fawn
had
said
of
her
?
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
well
-
informed
man
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
a
lord
,
you
mean
,
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
an
oaf
,
is
he
not
?
<EOS>
And
yet
they
say
he
is
to
marry
that
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
will
,
"
said
Phineas
,
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
with
all
my
heart
;
and
I
hope
that
somebody
else
may
,
 
unless
somebody
else
should
change
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
;
I
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
Mind
you
come
and
call
on
me
,
 
193
,
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
know
the
little
cottage
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
put
Madame
Max
Goesler
into
her
carriage
,
and
walked
away
to
his
club
.
   
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
Does
Not
Send
a
Card
to
Phineas
Finn
 
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
's
house
in
Berkeley
Square
was
very
stately
,
 
a
large
house
with
five
front
windows
in
a
row
,
and
a
big
door
,
and
a
huge
square
hall
,
and
a
fat
porter
in
a
round
-
topped
chair
;
 
but
it
was
dingy
and
dull
,
and
could
not
have
been
painted
for
the
last
ten
years
,
or
furnished
for
the
last
twenty
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Lady
Baldock
had
"
evenings
,
"
and
people
went
to
them
,
 
though
not
such
a
crowd
of
people
as
would
go
to
the
evenings
of
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
Now
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
had
not
been
asked
to
the
evenings
of
Lady
Baldock
for
the
present
season
,
and
the
reason
was
after
this
wise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
Lady
Baldock
had
said
to
her
daughter
,
who
,
early
in
the
spring
,
was
preparing
the
cards
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
send
one
to
Mr.
Finn
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
he
is
very
nice
,
"
said
Augusta
Boreham
,
whose
eyes
at
Saulsby
had
been
sharper
perhaps
than
her
mother
's
,
and
who
had
her
suspicions
.
  
<EOS>
But
Lady
Baldock
did
not
like
interference
from
her
daughter
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
certainly
,
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"
They
tell
me
that
he
is
a
very
rising
young
man
,
and
he
sits
for
Lord
Brentford
's
borough
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
is
a
Radical
,
but
we
can
not
help
that
.
<EOS>
All
the
rising
young
men
are
Radicals
now
.
<EOS>
I
thought
him
very
civil
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
,
mamma
 
"
  
"
Well
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
that
he
is
a
little
free
with
Violet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
do
you
mean
,
Augusta
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
not
fancied
that
he
is
 
fond
of
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
sometimes
fancied
that
she
is
fond
of
him
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
,
Augusta
,
 
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
seen
it
if
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sharp
in
seeing
such
things
.
<EOS>
They
never
escape
me
.
<EOS>
Even
Violet
would
not
be
such
a
fool
as
that
.
<EOS>
Send
him
a
card
,
and
if
he
comes
I
shall
soon
see
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Boreham
quite
understood
her
mother
,
though
she
could
never
master
her
,
 
and
the
card
was
prepared
.
<EOS>
Miss
Boreham
could
never
master
her
mother
by
her
own
efforts
;
but
it
was
,
I
think
,
by
a
little
intrigue
on
her
part
that
Lady
Baldock
was
mastered
,
and
,
indeed
,
altogether
cowed
,
in
reference
to
our
hero
,
and
that
this
victory
was
gained
on
that
very
afternoon
in
time
to
prevent
the
sending
of
the
card
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
mother
and
daughter
were
at
tea
,
before
dinner
,
Lord
Baldock
came
into
the
room
,
and
,
after
having
been
patted
and
petted
and
praised
by
his
mother
,
he
took
up
all
the
cards
out
of
a
china
bowl
and
ran
his
eyes
over
them
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
the
greatest
ass

all
London

<EOS>
Lady

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
she
should
n't
come
,

said
Lady
Baldock
;
 
"
a
mere

daughter

"
Julius

<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern

I
thought
you
were

daggers
drawn

Chiltern

"
<EOS>
"
They
say
he
is
going
to
be
reconciled
to
his
father
,
Gustavus
,
and
I
do
it
for
Lord
Brentford
's
sake
.
<EOS>
And
he
wo
n't
come
,
so
it
does
not
signify
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
believe
that
Violet
has
really
refused
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
about
his
not
coming
,
"
said
Lord
Baldock
,
continuing
to
read
the
cards
;
"
Chiltern
certainly
wo
n't
come

<EOS>
Count
Sparrowsky

I
wonder
what

"
He
is
asked
about
,

he
is

pleaded
Lady

believe

I
do

They
say

good

They
say
also
that

found

out

well

What
do
you

to
set
himself
up
in
the
world
by
marrying
your
niece
.
<EOS>
He
is
quite
right
to
try
it
on
,
if
he
has
a
chance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
he
would
be
right
at
all
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
,
with
much
energy
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
would
be
wrong
,
 
shamefully
wrong
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
is
the
son
of
an
Irish
doctor
,
and
that
he
has
n't
a
shilling
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
why
he
would
be
right
.
<EOS>
What
is
such
a
man
to
do
,
but
to
marry
money
?
<EOS>
He
's
a
deuced
good
-
looking
fellow
,
too
,
and
will
be
sure
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
should
work
for
his
money
in
the
city
,
then
,
or
somewhere
there
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
Gustavus
;
I
do
n't
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
only
tell
you
what
I
hear
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
that
he
and
Chiltern
have
already
quarrelled
about
her
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
tell
you
that
they
have
been
over
to
Holland
together
and
fought
a
duel
about
her
,
you
would
n't
believe
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fought
a
duel
about
Violet
!
<EOS>
People
do
n't
fight
duels
now
,
and
I
should
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Then
send
your
card
to
Mr.
Finn
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
so
saying
,
Lord
Baldock
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
sat
in
silence
for
some
time
toasting
her
toes
at
the
fire
,
and
Augusta
Boreham
sat
by
,
waiting
for
orders
.
<EOS>
She
felt
pretty
nearly
sure
that
new
orders
would
be
given
if
she
did
not
herself
interfere
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
put
by
that
card
for
the
present
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
inquiries
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
what
Gustavus
has
said
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
that
even
Violet
is
such
a
fool
as
that
.
<EOS>
But
if
rash
and
ill
-
natured
people
have
spoken
of
it
,
it
may
be
as
well
to
be
careful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
always
well
to
be
careful
;
 
is
it
not
,
mamma
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
but
<EOS>
what
I
think
it
very
improper
that
these
things
should
be
said
about
a
young
woman
;
and
as
for
the
story
of
the
duel
,
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
absurd
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
that
Gustavus
invented
it
at
the
moment
,
just
to
amuse
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
card
of
course
was
not
sent
,
and
Lady
Baldock
at
any
rate
put
so
much
faith
in
her
son
's
story
as
to
make
her
feel
it
to
be
her
duty
to
interrogate
her
niece
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
at
this
period
of
her
life
was
certainly
not
free
from
fear
of
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
In
the
numerous
encounters
which
took
place
between
them
,
the
aunt
seldom
gained
that
amount
of
victory
which
would
have
completely
satisfied
her
spirit
.
<EOS>
She
longed
to
be
dominant
over
her
niece
as
she
was
dominant
over
her
daughter
;
and
when
she
found
that
she
missed
such
supremacy
,
she
longed
to
tell
Violet
to
depart
from
out
her
borders
,
and
be
no
longer
niece
of
hers
.
<EOS>
But
had
she
ever
done
so
<EOS>
,
Violet
would
have
gone
at
the
instant
,
and
then
terrible
things
would
have
followed
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
satisfaction
in
turning
out
of
doors
a
nephew
or
niece
who
is
pecuniarily
dependent
,
but
when
the
youthful
relative
is
richly
endowed
,
the
satisfaction
is
much
diminished
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
duty
of
a
guardian
,
no
doubt
,
to
look
after
the
ward
;
but
if
this
can
not
be
done
,
the
ward
's
money
should
at
least
be
held
with
as
close
a
fist
as
possible
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Baldock
,
though
she
knew
that
she
would
be
sorely
wounded
,
poked
about
on
her
old
body
with
the
sharp
lances
of
disobedience
,
and
struck
with
the
cruel
swords
of
satire
,
if
she
took
upon
herself
to
scold
or
even
to
question
Violet
,
nevertheless
would
not
abandon
the
pleasure
of
lecturing
and
teaching
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
duty
,
"
she
would
say
to
herself
,
"
and
though
it
be
taken
in
a
bad
spirit
,
I
will
always
perform
my
duty
.
"
<EOS>
So
she
performed
her
duty
,
and
asked
Violet
Effingham
some
few
questions
respecting
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
"
do
you
remember
meeting
a
Mr.
Finn
at
Saulsby
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
Mr.
Finn
,
aunt
!
<EOS>
Why
,
he
is
a
particular
friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
do
,
and
he
was
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
I
have
met
him
there
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
that
we
were
riding
about
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
that
he
was
there
,
certainly
;
but
I
did
not
know
that
he
was
a
special
 
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
especial
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
A
1
,
I
may
say
;
 
among
young
men
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
was
certainly
the
most
indiscreet
of
old
women
in
such
a
matter
as
this
,
and
Violet
the
most
provoking
of
young
ladies
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
,
believing
that
there
was
something
to
fear
,
 
as
,
indeed
,
there
was
,
much
to
fear
,
 
should
have
been
content
to
destroy
the
card
,
and
to
keep
the
young
lady
away
from
the
young
gentleman
,
if
such
keeping
away
was
possible
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Effingham
was
certainly
very
wrong
to
speak
of
any
young
man
as
being
A
1
.
<EOS>
Fond
as
I
am
of
Miss
Effingham
,
I
can
not
justify
her
,
and
must
acknowledge
that
she
used
the
most
offensive
phrase
she
could
find
,
on
purpose
to
annoy
her
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
"
Violet
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
,
bridling
up
,
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
such
a
word
before
from
the
lips
of
a
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
as
A
1
?
<EOS>
I
thought
it
simply
meant
very
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
1
is
a
nobleman
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
aunt
;
 
<EOS>
A
1
is
a
ship
,
 
a
ship
that
is
very
good
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
mean
to
say
that
Mr.
Finn
is
,
 
is
,
 
is
,
 
very
good
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
ask
Lord
Brentford
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
You
know
he
saved
poor
Mr.
Kennedy
from
being
throttled
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
A
policeman
might
have
done
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
would
have
been
A
1
of
policemen
,
 
though
A
1
does
not
mean
a
policeman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
have
done
his
duty
,
and
so
perhaps
did
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
did
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
It
could
n't
have
been
his
duty
to
stand
by
and
see
Mr.
Kennedy
throttled
.
<EOS>
And
he
nearly
killed
one
of
the
men
,
and
took
the
other
prisoner
with
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
And
he
made
a
beautiful
speech
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
I
read
every
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
he
's
a
Liberal
.
<EOS>
I
do
like
young
men
to
be
Liberals
.
<EOS>
"
Now
Lord
Baldock
was
a
Tory
,
as
had
been
all
the
Lord
Baldocks
,
 
since
the
first
who
had
been
bought
over
from
the
Whigs
in
the
time
of
George
III
at
the
cost
of
a
barony
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
nothing
to
do
with
politics
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
I
have
something
to
do
with
politics
,
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
must
tell
you
that
your
name
is
being
very
unpleasantly
mentioned
in
connection
with
that
of
this
young
man
because
of
your
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
indiscretion
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Violet
,
as
she
made
her
demand
for
a
more
direct
accusation
,
stood
quite
upright
before
her
aunt
,
looking
the
old
woman
full
in
the
face
,
 
almost
with
her
arms
akimbo
.
  
<EOS>
"
Calling
him
A
1
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
People
have
been
talking
about
me
and
Mr.
Finn
,
because
I
just
now
,
at
this
very
moment
,
called
him
A
1
to
you
!
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
scold
me
about
anything
,
aunt
,
do
find
out
something
less
ridiculous
than
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
most
improper
language
,
 
and
if
you
used
it
to
me
,
I
am
sure
you
would
to
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
what
others
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
Mr.
Finn
,

those
sort
of
people

"
  
<EOS>
"
Call
Mr.
Finn
<EOS>
A
1
to
his
face
!
<EOS>
Well
,
 
upon
my
honour
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
not
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
says
he
rides
beautifully
,
and
if
we
were
talking
about
riding
I
might
do
so

<EOS>
"
You
have
no
business
to
talk
to
Lord
Chiltern
about
Mr.
Finn
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
not
?
<EOS>
I
thought
that
perhaps
the
one
sin
might
palliate
the
other
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
aunt
,
no
young
lady
,
let
her
be
ever
so
ill
-
disposed
,
can
marry
two
objectionable
young
men
,
 
at
the
same
time

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
nothing
about
your
marrying
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
aunt
,
what
did
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
that
you
should
not
allow
yourself
to
be
talked
of
with
an
adventurer
,
a
young
man
without
a
shilling
,
a
person
who
has
come
from
nobody
knows
where
in
the
bogs
of
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
used
to
ask
him
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
 
as
long
as
he
knew
his
place
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
not
do
so
again
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
beg
you
to
be
circumspect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
aunt
,
we
may
as
well
understand
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
circumspect
,
as
you
call
it
.
<EOS>
And
if
Mr.
Finn
asked
me
to
marry
him
to
-
morrow
,
and
if
I
liked
him
well
enough
,
I
would
take
him
,
 
even
though
he
had
been
dug
right
out
of
a
bog
.
<EOS>
Not
only
because
I
liked
him
,
 
mind
!
<EOS>
If
I
were
unfortunate
enough
to
like
a
man
who
was
nothing
,
I
would
refuse
him
in
spite
of
my
liking
,
 
because
he
was
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
this
young
man
is
not
nothing
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
is
a
fine
fellow
,
and
if
there
were
no
other
reason
to
prevent
my
marrying
him
than
his
being
the
son
of
a
doctor
,
and
coming
out
of
the
bogs
,
that
would
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
Now
I
have
made
a
clean
breast
to
you
as
regards
Mr.
Finn
;
and
if
you
do
not
like
what
I
've
said

you
must
acknowledge
that
you
have
brought
it
on
yourself

<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
was
left
for
a
time
speechless
.
<EOS>
But
no
card
was
sent
to
Phineas
Finn
.
   
<EOS>
Promotion
 
Phineas
got
no
card
from
Lady
Baldock
,
but
one
morning
he
received
a
note
from
Lord
Brentford
which
was
of
more
importance
to
him
than
any
card
could
have
been
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
,
bit
by
bit
,
the
Reform
Bill
of
the
day
had
nearly
made
its
way
through
the
committee
,
but
had
been
so
mutilated
as
to
be
almost
impossible
of
recognition
by
its
progenitors
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
still
a
clause
or
two
as
to
the
rearrangement
of
seats
,
<EOS>
respecting
which
it
was
known
that
there
would
be
a
combat
,
 
probably
combats
,
 
carried
on
after
the
internecine
fashion
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
clipping
of
counties
to
be
done
,
<EOS>
as
to
which
it
was
said
that
Mr.
Daubeny
had
declared
that
he
would
not
yield
till
he
was
made
to
do
so
by
the
brute
force
of
majorities
;
 
and
there
was
another
clause
for
the
drafting
of
certain
superfluous
members
from
little
boroughs
,
and
bestowing
them
on
populous
towns
at
which
they
were
much
wanted
,
respecting
which
Mr.
Turnbull
had
proclaimed
that
the
clause
as
it
now
stood
was
a
fainéant
clause
,
capable
of
doing
,
and
intended
to
do
,
no
good
in
the
proper
direction
<EOS>
;
a
clause
put
into
the
bill
to
gull
ignorant
folk
who
had
not
eyes
enough
to
recognise
the
fact
that
it
was
fainéant
;
a
make
-
believe
clause
,
 
so
said
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
to
be
detested
on
that
account
by
every
true
reformer
worse
than
the
old
Philistine
bonds
and
Tory
figments
of
representation
,
as
to
which
there
was
at
least
no
hypocritical
pretence
of
popular
fitness
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
had
been
very
loud
and
very
angry
,
 
had
talked
much
of
demonstrations
among
the
people
,
and
had
almost
threatened
the
House
.
<EOS>
The
House
in
its
present
mood
did
not
fear
any
demonstrations
,
 
but
it
did
fear
that
Mr.
Turnbull
might
help
Mr.
Daubeny
,
and
that
Mr.
Daubeny
might
help
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
May
,
 
the
middle
of
May
,
 
and
ministers
,
who
had
been
at
work
on
their
Reform
Bill
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
session
,
were
becoming
weary
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
should
these
odious
clauses
escape
the
threatened
Turnbull
-
Daubeny
alliance
,
 
<EOS>
then
there
was
the
House
of
Lords
!

pass
our
bills
at
the
Treasury
,
and
have
done
with
them
!
"
said
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
"
replied
Mr.
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
For
myself
,
I
was
never
so
tired
of
a
session
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
go
through
it
again
to
be
made
,
 
no
,
not
to
be
made
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
's
note
to
Phineas
Finn
was
as
follows
:
    
House
of
Lords
,
<EOS>
16th
May
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MR
.
<EOS>
FINN
,
  
<EOS>
You
are
no
doubt
aware
that
Lord
Bosanquet
's
death
has
taken
Mr.
Mottram
into
the
Upper
House
,
and
that
as
he
was
Under
-
Secretary
for
the
Colonies
,
and
as
the
Under
-
Secretary
must
be
in
the
Lower
House
,
the
vacancy
must
be
filled
up
.
  
<EOS>
The
heart
of
Phineas
Finn
at
this
moment
was
almost
in
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
Not
only
to
be
selected
for
political
employment
,
but
to
be
selected
at
once
for
an
office
so
singularly
desirable
!
<EOS>
Under
-
Secretaries
,
he
fancied
,
were
paid
two
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
What
would
Mr.
Low
say
now
?
<EOS>
But
his
great
triumph
soon
received
a
check
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
has
spoken
to
me
on
the
subject
,
"
continued
the
letter
,
"
and
informs
me
that
he
has
offered
the
place
at
the
colonies
to
his
old
supporter
,
Mr.
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
"
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
!
  
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
he
could
not
have
done
better
,
as
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
has
shown
great
zeal
for
his
party
.
<EOS>
This
will
vacate
the
Irish
seat
at
the
Treasury
Board
,
and
I
am
commissioned
by
Mr.
Mildmay
to
offer
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
do
me
the
pleasure
of
calling
on
me
to
-
morrow
between
the
hours
of
eleven
and
twelve
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
very
sincerely
,
  
BRENTFORD
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
himself
surprised
to
find
that
his
first
feeling
on
reading
this
letter
was
one
of
dissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
Here
were
his
golden
hopes
about
to
be
realised
,
 
hopes
as
to
the
realisation
of
which
he
had
been
quite
despondent
twelve
months
ago
,
 
and
yet
he
was
uncomfortable
because
he
was
to
be
postponed
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
Had
the
new
Under
-
Secretary
been
a
man
whom
he
had
not
known
,
whom
he
had
not
learned
to
look
down
upon
as
inferior
to
himself
<EOS>
,
he
would
not
have
minded
it
,
 
would
have
been
full
of
joy
at
the
promotion
proposed
for
himself
.
<EOS>
But
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
was
such
a
poor
creature
,
that
the
idea
of
filling
a
place
from
which
Laurence
had
risen
was
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
be
all
a
matter
of
favour
and
convenience
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
without
any
reference
to
the
service
.
"
<EOS>
His
triumph
would
have
been
so
complete
<EOS>
had
Mr.
Mildmay
allowed
him
to
go
into
the
higher
place
at
one
leap
.
<EOS>
Other
men
who
had
made
themselves
useful
had
done
so
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
hour
after
receiving
Lord
Brentford
's
letter
,
the
idea
of
becoming
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
was
almost
displeasing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
an
idea
that
junior
lordships
of
the
Treasury
were
generally
bestowed
on
young
members
whom
it
was
convenient
to
secure
,
but
who
were
not
good
at
doing
anything
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
in
which
he
thought
that
he
would
refuse
to
be
made
a
junior
lord
.
  
<EOS>
But
during
the
night
cooler
reflections
told
him
that
he
had
been
very
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
up
politics
with
the
express
desire
of
getting
his
foot
upon
a
rung
of
the
ladder
of
promotion
,
and
now
,
in
his
third
session
,
he
was
about
to
be
successful
.
<EOS>
Even
as
a
junior
lord
he
would
have
a
thousand
a
year
;
and
how
long
might
he
have
sat
in
chambers
,
and
have
wandered
about
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
and
have
loitered
in
the
courts
striving
to
look
as
though
he
had
business
,
before
he
would
have
earned
a
thousand
a
year
!
<EOS>
Even
as
a
junior
lord
he
could
make
himself
useful
,
and
when
once
he
should
be
known
to
be
a
good
working
man
,
promotion
would
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
No
ladder
can
be
mounted
without
labour
;
but
this
ladder
was
now
open
above
his
head
,
and
he
already
had
his
foot
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
eleven
he
was
with
Lord
Brentford
,
who
received
him
with
the
blandest
smile
and
a
pressure
of
the
hand
which
was
quite
cordial
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Finn
,
"
he
said
,
"
this
gives
me
the
most
sincere
pleasure
,
 
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Our
connection
together
at
Loughton
of
course
makes
it
doubly
agreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
be
too
grateful
to
you
,
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
your
own
doing
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Mildmay
asked
me
whether
I
did
not
think
you
the
most
promising
of
the
young
members
on
our
side
in
your
House
,
I
certainly
did
say
that
I
quite
concurred
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
be
taking
too
much
on
myself
<EOS>
,
I
should
be
acting
dishonestly
,
if
I
were
to
allow
you
to
imagine
that
it
was
my
proposition
.
<EOS>
Had
he
asked
me
to
recommend
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
named
you
;
that
I
say
frankly
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
named
you
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
your
friend
Finn
would
join
us
at
the
Treasury
?
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
that
I
did
think
so
.
"
<EOS>
And
do
you
not
think
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
it
would
be
a
useful
appointment
?
<EOS>
"
Then
I
ventured
to
say
that
I
had
no
doubt
whatever
on
that
point
;
 
that
I
knew
you
well
enough
to
feel
confident
that
you
would
lend
a
strength
to
the
Liberal
Government
.
<EOS>
Then
there
were
a
few
words
said
about
your
seat
,
and
I
was
commissioned
to
write
to
you
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
grateful
,
but
not
too
grateful
,
and
bore
himself
very
well
in
the
interview
.
<EOS>
He
explained
to
Lord
Brentford
that
of
course
it
was
his
object
to
serve
the
country
,
 
and
to
be
paid
for
his
services
,
 
and
that
he
considered
himself
to
be
very
fortunate
to
be
selected
so
early
in
his
career
for
parliamentary
place
.
<EOS>
He
would
endeavour
to
do
his
duty
,
and
could
safely
say
of
himself
that
he
did
not
wish
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
.
<EOS>
As
he
made
this
assertion
,
he
thought
of
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
had
eaten
the
bread
of
idleness
,
and
yet
he
was
promoted
.
<EOS>
But
Phineas
said
nothing
to
Lord
Brentford
about
his
idle
friend
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
made
his
little
speech
he
asked
a
question
about
the
borough
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
ventured
to
write
a
letter
to
my
agent
at
Loughton
,
telling
him
that
you
have
accepted
office
,
and
that
you
will
be
shortly
there
again
.
<EOS>
He
will
see
Shortribs
and
arrange
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
were
you
I
should
write
to
Shortribs
and
to
Grating
,
 
after
I
had
seen
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
not
mention
my
name
,
"
<EOS>
And
the
Earl
looked
very
grave
as
he
uttered
this
caution
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
will
not
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
you
'll
find
any
difficulty
about
the
seat
,
"
said
the
peer
.
<EOS>
"
There
never
has
been
any
difficulty
at
Loughton
yet
.
<EOS>
I
must
say
that
for
them
.
<EOS>
And
if
we
can
scrape
through
with
Clause
72
we
shall
be
all
right
;
 
shall
we
not
?
"
<EOS>
This
was
the
clause
as
to
which
so
violent
an
opposition
was
expected
from
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
a
clause
as
to
which
Phineas
himself
had
felt
that
he
would
hardly
know
how
to
support
the
Government
,
in
the
event
of
the
committee
being
pressed
to
a
division
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Could
he
,
an
ardent
reformer
,
a
reformer
at
heart
,
 
could
he
say
that
such
a
borough
as
Loughton
should
be
spared
;
 
that
the
arrangement
by
which
Shortribs
and
Grating
had
sent
him
to
Parliament
,
in
obedience
to
Lord
Brentford
's
orders
,
was
in
due
accord
with
the
theory
of
a
representative
legislature
?
<EOS>
In
what
respect
had
Gatton
and
Old
Sarum
been
worse
than
Loughton
?
<EOS>
Was
he
not
himself
false
to
his
principle
in
sitting
for
such
a
borough
as
Loughton
?
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
to
Mr.
Monk
,
and
Mr.
Monk
had
told
him
that
Rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
,
 
and
had
told
him
also
that
good
things
were
most
valued
and
were
more
valuable
when
they
came
by
instalments
.
<EOS>
But
then
Mr.
Monk
himself
enjoyed
the
satisfaction
of
sitting
for
a
popular
Constituency
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
personally
pricked
in
the
conscience
by
his
own
parliamentary
position
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
  
now
that
Phineas
had
consented
to
join
the
Government
,
any
such
considerations
as
these
must
be
laid
aside
.
<EOS>
He
could
no
longer
be
a
free
agent
,
or
even
a
free
thinker
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
quite
aware
of
this
,
and
had
taught
himself
to
understand
that
members
of
Parliament
in
the
direct
service
of
the
Government
were
absolved
from
the
necessity
of
free
-
thinking
.
<EOS>
Individual
free
-
thinking
was
incompatible
with
the
position
of
a
member
of
the
Government
,
and
unless
such
abnegation
were
practised
,
no
government
would
be
possible
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
course
a
man
's
duty
to
bind
himself
together
with
no
other
men
but
those
with
whom
,
on
matters
of
general
policy
,
he
could
agree
heartily
;
 
but
having
found
that
he
could
so
agree
,
he
knew
that
it
would
be
his
duty
as
a
subaltern
to
vote
as
he
was
directed
.
<EOS>
It
would
trouble
his
conscience
less
to
sit
for
Loughton
and
vote
for
an
objectionable
clause
as
a
member
of
the
Government
,
than
it
would
have
done
to
give
such
a
vote
as
an
independent
member
.
<EOS>
In
so
resolving
,
he
thought
that
he
was
simply
acting
in
accordance
with
the
acknowledged
rules
of
parliamentary
government
.
<EOS>
And
therefore
,
when
Lord
Brentford
spoke
of
Clause
72
,
he
could
answer
pleasantly
,
"
I
think
we
shall
carry
it
;
and
,
you
see
,
in
getting
it
through
committee
,
if
we
can
carry
it
by
one
,
that
is
as
good
as
a
hundred
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
comfort
of
close
-
fighting
in
committee
.
<EOS>
In
the
open
House
we
are
almost
as
much
beaten
by
a
narrow
majority
as
by
a
vote
against
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
;
just
so
,
"
said
Lord
Brentford
,
delighted
to
see
that
his
young
pupil
,
 
as
he
regarded
him
,
 
understood
so
well
the
system
of
parliamentary
management
.
<EOS>
"
By
-
the
-
bye
,
Finn
,
have
you
seen
Chiltern
lately
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
quite
lately
,
"
said
Phineas
,
blushing
up
to
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
heard
from
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
nor
heard
from
him
.
<EOS>
When
last
I
heard
of
him
he
was
in
Brussels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
 
yes
;
he
is
somewhere
on
the
Rhine
now
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
as
you
were
so
intimate
,
perhaps
you
corresponded
with
him
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
that
we
have
arranged
about
Lady
Laura
's
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
has
told
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
would
return
,
"
said
Lord
Brentford
sadly
,
 
almost
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
that
great
difficulty
is
over
,
I
would
receive
him
willingly
,
and
make
my
house
pleasant
to
him
,
if
I
can
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
most
anxious
that
he
should
settle
,
and
marry
.
<EOS>
Could
you
not
write
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
not
daring
to
tell
Lord
Brentford
that
he
had
quarrelled
with
Lord
Chiltern
,
 
feeling
that
if
he
did
so
everything
would
go
wrong
,
 
said
that
he
would
write
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
went
away
he
felt
that
he
was
bound
to
get
an
answer
from
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
If
it
should
be
necessary
,
he
was
willing
to
break
with
Lord
Brentford
on
that
matter
,
 
even
though
such
breaking
should
lose
him
his
borough
and
his
place
;
 
but
not
on
any
other
matter
.
   
<EOS>
Phineas
and
His
Friends
 
<EOS>
Our
hero
's
friends
were
,
I
think
,
almost
more
elated
by
our
hero
's
promotion
than
was
our
hero
himself
.
<EOS>
He
never
told
himself
that
it
was
a
great
thing
to
be
a
junior
lord
of
the
Treasury
,
though
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
to
have
made
a
successful
beginning
was
a
very
great
thing
.
<EOS>
But
his
friends
were
loud
in
their
congratulations
,
 
or
condolements
as
the
case
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
his
interview
with
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
,
after
that
,
one
of
his
first
steps
was
to
inform
Mrs.
Bunce
that
he
must
change
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
Mrs.
Bunce
,
not
that
I
want
anything
better
;
but
that
a
better
position
will
be
advantageous
to
me
,
and
that
I
can
afford
to
pay
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
acknowledged
the
truth
of
the
argument
,
with
her
apron
up
to
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
to
be
so
fond
of
looking
after
you
,
Mr.
Finn
!
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
just
what
you
pays
like
,
because
another
party
will
pay
as
much
.
<EOS>
But
we
've
got
so
used
to
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
 
have
n't
we
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bunce
was
probably
not
aware
herself
that
the
comeliness
of
her
lodger
had
pleased
her
feminine
eye
,
and
touched
her
feminine
heart
.
<EOS>
Had
anybody
said
that
Mrs.
Bunce
was
in
love
with
Phineas
,
the
scandal
would
have
been
monstrous
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
was
so
,
 
after
a
fashion
.
<EOS>
And
Bunce
knew
it
,
 
after
his
fashion
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
such
an
old
fool
,
"
he
said
,
"
crying
after
him
because
he
's
six
foot
high
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
crying
after
him
because
he
's
six
foot
high
,
"
whined
the
poor
woman
;
 
"
but
one
does
like
old
faces
better
than
new
,
and
a
gentleman
about
one
's
place
is
pleasant
.
"
<EOS>
"
Gentleman
be
d
 
d
,
"
said
Bunce
.
<EOS>
But
his
anger
was
excited
,
not
by
his
wife
's
love
for
Phineas
,
but
by
the
use
of
an
objectionable
word
.
  
<EOS>
Bunce
himself
had
been
on
very
friendly
terms
with
Phineas
,
and
they
two
had
had
many
discussions
on
matters
of
politics
,
Bunce
taking
up
the
cudgels
always
for
Mr.
Turnbull
,
and
generally
slipping
away
gradually
into
some
account
of
his
own
martyrdom
.
<EOS>
For
he
had
been
a
martyr
,
having
failed
in
obtaining
any
redress
against
the
policeman
who
had
imprisoned
him
so
wrongfully
.
<EOS>
The
_
People
's
Banner
_
had
fought
for
him
manfully
,
and
therefore
there
was
a
little
disagreement
between
him
and
Phineas
on
the
subject
of
that
great
organ
of
public
opinion
.
<EOS>
And
as
Mr.
Bunce
thought
that
his
lodger
was
very
wrong
to
sit
for
Lord
Brentford
's
borough
,
subjects
were
sometimes
touched
which
were
a
little
galling
to
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
Touching
this
promotion
,
Bunce
had
nothing
but
condolement
to
offer
to
the
new
junior
lord
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
"
said
he
,
in
answer
to
an
argument
from
Phineas
,
"
I
suppose
there
must
be
lords
,
as
you
call
'em
;
though
for
the
matter
of
that
I
ca
n't
see
as
they
is
of
any
mortal
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
n't
you
have
the
Government
carried
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Government
!
<EOS>
Well
;
I
suppose
there
must
be
government
.
<EOS>
But
the
less
of
it
the
better
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
against
government
;
 
nor
yet
against
laws
,
Mr.
Finn
;
though
the
less
of
them
,
too
,
the
better
.
<EOS>
But
what
does
these
lords
do
in
the
Government
?
<EOS>
Lords
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
they
do
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
They
wotes
;
that
's
what
they
do
!
<EOS>
They
wotes
hard
;
black
or
white
,
white
or
black
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
that
true
?
<EOS>
When
you
're
a
"
lord
,
"
will
you
be
able
to
wote
against
Mr.
Mildmay
to
save
your
very
soul
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
comes
to
be
a
question
of
soul
-
saving
,
Mr.
Bunce
,
I
sha
n't
save
my
place
at
the
expense
of
my
conscience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
you
knows
it
,
you
mean
.
<EOS>
But
the
worst
of
it
is
that
a
man
gets
so
thick
into
the
mud
that
he
do
n't
know
whether
he
's
dirty
or
clean
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
wote
as
you
're
told
,
and
of
course
you
'll
think
it
's
right
enough
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
you
been
among
Parliament
gents
long
enough
to
know
that
that
's
the
way
it
goes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
no
honest
man
can
be
a
member
of
the
Government
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
that
,
but
I
think
honesty
's
a
deal
easier
away
from
'em
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
Mr.
Finn
,
it
's
all
wrong
with
us
yet
,
and
will
be
till
we
get
it
nigher
to
the
great
American
model
.
<EOS>
If
a
poor
man
gets
into
Parliament
,
 
<EOS>
you
'll
excuse
me
,
Mr.
Finn
,
but
I
calls
you
a
poor
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
 
as
a
member
of
Parliament
I
am
a
very
poor
man
.
"
  
"
Just
so
,
 
and
therefore
what
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
You
goes
and
lays
yourself
out
for
government
!
<EOS>
I
'm
not
saying
as
how
you
're
anyways
wrong
.
<EOS>
A
man
has
to
live
.
<EOS>
You
has
winning
ways
,
and
a
good
physiognomy
of
your
own
,
and
are
as
big
as
a
life
-
guardsman
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
as
he
heard
this
doubtful
praise
laughed
and
blushed
.
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
you
makes
your
way
with
the
big
wigs
,
lords
and
earls
and
them
like
,
and
you
gets
returned
for
a
rotten
borough
;
 
you
'll
excuse
me
,
but
that
's
about
it
,
ai
n't
it
?
 
<EOS>
and
then
you
goes
in
for
government
!
<EOS>
A
man
may
have
a
mission
to
govern
,
such
as
Washington
and
Cromwell
and
the
like
o
'
them
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
hears
of
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
a
-
governing
,
why
then
I
says
,
 
d
---
<EOS>
n
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
must
be
good
and
bad
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
've
got
to
change
a
deal
yet
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
we
'll
do
it
.
<EOS>
When
a
young
man
as
has
liberal
feelings
gets
into
Parliament
,
he
should
n't
be
snapped
up
and
brought
into
the
governing
business
just
because
he
's
poor
and
wants
a
salary
.
<EOS>
They
do
n't
do
it
that
way
in
the
States
;
and
they
wo
n't
do
it
that
way
here
long
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
system
as
I
hates
,
and
not
you
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Well
,
good
-
bye
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
'll
like
the
governing
business
,
and
find
it
suits
your
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
These
condolements
from
Mr.
Bunce
were
not
pleasant
,
but
they
set
him
thinking
.
<EOS>
He
felt
assured
that
Bunce
and
Quintus
Slide
and
Mr.
Turnbull
were
wrong
.
<EOS>
Bunce
was
ignorant
.
<EOS>
Quintus
Slide
was
dishonest
.
<EOS>
Turnbull
was
greedy
of
popularity
.
<EOS>
For
himself
,
he
thought
that
as
a
young
man
he
was
fairly
well
informed
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
meant
to
be
true
in
his
vocation
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
quite
sure
that
the
object
nearest
to
his
heart
in
politics
was
not
self
-
aggrandisement
,
but
the
welfare
of
the
people
in
general
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
could
not
but
agree
with
Bunce
that
there
was
something
wrong
.
<EOS>
When
such
men
as
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
were
called
upon
to
act
as
governors
,
was
it
not
to
be
expected
that
the
ignorant
but
still
intelligent
Bunces
of
the
population
should
 
"
d
 
n
it
all
"
?
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
that
day
he
went
up
to
Mrs.
Low
's
,
very
sure
that
he
should
receive
some
encouragement
from
her
and
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
angry
with
him
because
he
had
put
himself
into
a
position
in
which
money
must
be
spent
and
none
could
be
made
.
<EOS>
The
Lows
,
especially
Mrs.
Low
,
had
refused
to
believe
that
any
success
was
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
Now
that
he
had
succeeded
,
now
that
he
was
in
receipt
of
a
salary
on
which
he
could
live
and
save
money
,
he
would
be
sure
of
sympathy
from
his
old
friends
the
Lows
!
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Low
was
as
severe
upon
him
as
Mr.
Bunce
had
been
,
and
even
from
Mr.
Low
he
could
extract
no
real
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
I
congratulate
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
Mrs.
Low
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
think
you
have
begun
at
the
wrong
end
.
<EOS>
I
thought
so
before
,
and
I
think
so
still
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
ought
not
to
say
so
to
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
but
if
you
ask
me
,
what
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
the
truth
out
,
of
course
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
must
do
.
<EOS>
Well
,
the
truth
is
,
Mr.
Finn
,
that
I
do
not
think
it
is
a
very
good
opening
for
a
young
man
to
be
made
what
they
call
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
 
unless
he
has
got
a
private
fortune
,
you
know
,
to
support
that
kind
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Phineas
,
a
ministry
is
such
an
uncertain
thing
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
's
uncertain
;
 
but
as
I
did
go
into
the
House
,
it
's
something
to
have
succeeded
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
call
that
success
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
intend
to
go
on
with
your
profession
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
them
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
,
and
that
he
meant
to
marry
Violet
Effingham
,
who
would
much
prefer
a
parliamentary
life
for
her
husband
to
that
of
a
working
barrister
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
is
all
given
up
now
,
"
continued
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
for
the
present
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
and
for
ever
I
fear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
,
"
You
'll
never
go
back
to
real
work
after
frittering
away
your
time
as
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
work
must
it
be
when
just
anybody
can
do
it
that
it
suits
them
to
lay
hold
of
?
<EOS>
But
of
course
a
thousand
a
year
is
something
,
though
a
man
may
have
it
for
only
six
months
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
came
out
in
the
course
of
the
evening
that
Mr.
Low
was
going
to
stand
for
the
borough
vacated
by
Mr.
Mottram
,
at
which
it
was
considered
that
the
Conservatives
might
possibly
prevail
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
after
all
,
Phineas
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
,
"
that
I
am
following
your
steps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
you
are
going
into
the
House
in
the
course
of
your
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Just
so
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
are
taking
the
first
step
towards
being
a
Tory
Attorney
-
General
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
as
may
be
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
the
kind
of
thing
a
man
does
after
twenty
years
of
hard
work
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
really
do
n't
care
much
whether
I
succeed
or
fail
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
live
to
be
a
Vice
-
Chancellor
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
saying
as
much
as
that
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
not
at
all
sure
that
Parliament
is
the
best
way
to
the
Equity
Bench
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
it
is
a
grand
thing
to
get
into
Parliament
when
you
do
it
by
means
of
your
profession
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
that
Phineas
took
his
departure
from
the
house
,
feeling
sore
and
unhappy
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
next
morning
he
was
received
in
Grosvenor
Place
with
an
amount
of
triumph
which
went
far
to
compensate
him
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
written
to
him
to
call
there
,
and
on
his
arrival
he
found
both
Violet
Effingham
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
with
his
friend
.
<EOS>
When
Phineas
entered
the
room
his
first
feeling
was
one
of
intense
joy
at
seeing
that
Violet
Effingham
was
present
there
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
one
of
surprise
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
should
make
one
of
the
little
party
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
told
him
at
Mr.
Palliser
's
dinner
-
party
that
they
,
in
Portman
Square
,
had
not
as
yet
advanced
far
enough
to
receive
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
 
and
yet
here
was
the
lady
in
Mr.
Kennedy
's
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Now
Phineas
would
have
thought
it
more
likely
that
he
should
find
her
in
Portman
Square
than
in
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
The
truth
was
that
Madame
Goesler
had
been
brought
by
Miss
Effingham
,
 
with
the
consent
,
indeed
,
of
Lady
Laura
,
but
with
a
consent
given
with
much
of
hesitation
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
"
Violet
had
asked
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
of
nothing
,
"
Lady
Laura
had
answered
;
"
but
one
has
to
choose
one
's
acquaintance
in
accordance
with
rules
which
one
does
n't
lay
down
very
strictly
.
"
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
clever
woman
,
"
said
Violet
,
"
and
everybody
likes
her
;
but
if
you
think
Mr.
Kennedy
would
object
,
of
course
you
are
right
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Laura
had
consented
,
telling
herself
that
it
was
not
necessary
that
she
should
ask
her
husband
's
approval
as
to
every
new
acquaintance
she
might
form
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
Violet
had
been
told
that
Phineas
would
be
there
,
and
so
the
party
had
been
made
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
See
the
conquering
hero
comes
,
"
said
Violet
in
her
cheeriest
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
that
Mr.
Finn
has
been
made
a
lord
of
something
,
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
the
pleasure
of
a
long
political
discussion
with
him
the
other
night
,
and
I
quite
approve
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
so
much
gratified
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
says
that
it
is
the
best
appointment
they
could
have
made
,
and
papa
is
quite
proud
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
Lord
Brentford
's
member
;
are
you
not
?
"
asked
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
question
which
Phineas
did
not
quite
like
,
and
which
he
was
obliged
to
excuse
by
remembering
that
the
questioner
had
lived
so
long
out
of
England
as
to
be
probably
ignorant
of
the
myths
,
and
theories
,
and
system
,
and
working
of
the
British
Constitution
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
,
little
as
she
knew
of
politics
,
would
never
have
asked
a
question
so
imprudent
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
question
was
turned
off
,
and
Phineas
,
with
an
easy
grace
,
submitted
himself
to
be
petted
,
and
congratulated
,
and
purred
over
,
and
almost
caressed
by
the
three
ladies
,
Their
good
-
natured
enthusiasm
was
at
any
rate
better
than
the
satire
of
Bunce
,
or
the
wisdom
of
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
no
misgivings
as
to
Phineas
being
fit
for
governing
,
and
Violet
Effingham
said
nothing
as
to
the
short
-
lived
tenure
of
ministers
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
though
she
had
asked
an
indiscreet
question
,
thoroughly
appreciated
the
advantage
of
Government
pay
,
and
the
prestige
of
Government
power
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
lord
now
,
"
she
said
,
speaking
,
as
was
customary
with
her
,
with
the
slightest
possible
foreign
accent
,
"
and
you
will
be
a
president
soon
,
and
then
perhaps
a
secretary
.
<EOS>
The
order
of
promotion
seems
odd
,
but
I
am
told
it
is
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
pleasant
to
succeed
,
of
course
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
let
the
success
be
ever
so
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
knew
you
would
succeed
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
quite
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
Were
we
not
,
Violet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
always
said
so
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
For
myself
I
do
not
venture
to
have
an
opinion
on
such
matters
.
<EOS>
Will
you
always
have
to
go
to
that
big
building
in
the
corner
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
stay
there
from
ten
till
four
?
<EOS>
Wo
n't
that
be
a
bore
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
half
-
holiday
on
Saturday
,
you
know
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
the
Lords
of
the
Treasury
have
to
take
care
of
the
money
?
"
asked
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
their
own
;
and
they
generally
fail
in
doing
that
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
there
for
a
considerable
time
,
wondering
whether
Mr.
Kennedy
would
come
in
,
and
wondering
also
as
to
what
Mr.
Kennedy
would
say
to
Madame
Max
Goesler
when
he
did
come
in
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
it
was
useless
for
him
to
expect
any
opportunity
,
then
or
there
,
of
being
alone
for
a
moment
with
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
His
only
chance
in
that
direction
would
be
in
some
crowded
room
,
at
some
ball
at
which
he
might
ask
her
to
dance
with
him
;
but
it
seemed
that
fate
was
very
unkind
to
him
,
and
that
no
such
chance
came
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
did
not
appear
,
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
with
Violet
went
away
,
leaving
Phineas
still
sitting
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Each
of
them
said
a
kind
word
to
him
as
they
went
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
may
dare
to
expect
that
a
Lord
of
the
Treasury
will
come
and
see
me
?
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
made
a
second
promise
that
he
would
call
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
Violet
blushed
as
she
remembered
that
she
could
not
ask
him
to
call
at
Lady
Baldock
's
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Mr.
Finn
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
giving
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
so
very
glad
that
they
have
chosen
you
;
and
I
do
hope
that
,
as
Madame
Max
says
,
they
'll
make
you
a
secretary
and
a
president
,
and
everything
else
very
quickly
,
 
till
it
will
come
to
your
turn
to
be
making
other
people
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
nice
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
to
Violet
as
she
took
her
place
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
bears
being
petted
and
spoilt
without
being
either
awkward
or
conceited
.
"
<EOS>
"
On
the
whole
,
he
is
rather
nice
,
"
said
Violet
;
"
only
he
has
not
got
a
shilling
in
the
world
,
and
has
to
make
himself
before
he
will
be
anybody
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
must
marry
money
,
of
course
,
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
contented
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
rising
from
her
chair
and
coming
opposite
to
him
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
am
contented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
,
 
when
I
first
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
Why
did
they
promote
that
empty
-
headed
countryman
of
yours
to
a
place
for
which
he
was
quite
unfit
?
<EOS>
I
was
not
contented
.
<EOS>
But
then
I
am
more
ambitious
for
you
than
you
are
for
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
He
sat
without
answering
her
for
awhile
,
and
she
stood
waiting
for
his
reply
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
it
all
,
I
am
lost
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
You
tell
me
that
you
are
not
contented
;
 
that
you
are
ambitious
for
me
.
<EOS>
Why
is
it
that
you
should
feel
any
interest
in
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
reasonable
that
we
should
be
interested
for
our
friends
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
when
you
and
I
last
parted
here
in
this
room
you
were
hardly
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
I
not
?
<EOS>
You
wrong
me
there
;
 
very
deeply
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
what
was
my
ambition
,
and
you
resented
it
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
said
that
I
could
not
help
you
,
and
<EOS>
I
think
I
said
also
that
I
thought
you
would
fail
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
showed
much
resentment
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
I
told
her
that
you
were
here
,
that
she
might
come
and
meet
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
wished
my
brother
should
succeed
.
<EOS>
I
wished
it
before
I
ever
knew
you
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
expect
that
I
should
change
my
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
he
can
not
succeed
,
"
pleaded
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
say
that
?
<EOS>
Has
a
woman
never
been
won
by
devotion
and
perseverance
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
how
can
I
wish
to
see
you
go
on
with
a
suit
which
must
sever
you
from
my
father
,
and
injure
your
political
prospects
;
 
perhaps
fatally
injure
them
?
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
now
that
my
father
is
almost
the
only
man
in
London
who
has
not
heard
of
this
duel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
will
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
half
made
up
my
mind
to
tell
him
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
do
that
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
ask
you
to
come
here
to
-
day
to
talk
to
you
about
Oswald
or
Violet
.
<EOS>
I
have
given
you
my
advice
about
that
,
and
I
can
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Laura
,
I
can
not
take
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
out
of
my
power
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
The
matter
shall
be
what
you
members
of
Parliament
call
an
open
question
between
us
.
<EOS>
When
papa
asked
you
to
accept
this
place
at
the
Treasury
,
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
to
refuse
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
did
;
 
for
half
an
hour
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hoped
you
would
,
 
and
yet
I
knew
that
I
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
you
should
count
yourself
to
be
worth
more
than
that
,
and
that
you
should
,
as
it
were
,
assert
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
is
so
difficult
to
draw
the
line
between
proper
self
-
assertion
and
proper
self
-
denial
;
 
to
know
how
high
to
go
up
the
table
,
and
how
low
to
go
down
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
that
you
have
been
right
<EOS>
,
 
only
make
them
understand
that
you
are
not
as
other
junior
lords
;
 
that
you
have
been
willing
to
be
a
junior
lord
,
or
anything
else
for
a
purpose
;
but
that
the
purpose
is
something
higher
than
that
of
fetching
and
carrying
in
Parliament
for
Mr.
Mildmay
and
Mr.
Palliser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
in
time
to
get
beyond
fetching
and
carrying
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
will
;
and
knowing
that
,
I
am
glad
that
you
are
in
office
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
Loughton
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
,
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
has
already
gone
down
to
canvass
the
electors
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
!
<EOS>
To
canvass
the
electors
of
Loughton
!
"
<EOS>
and
Lady
Laura
drew
herself
up
and
spoke
of
this
unseemly
intrusion
on
her
father
's
borough
,
as
though
the
vulgar
man
who
had
been
named
had
forced
his
way
into
the
very
drawing
-
room
in
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
Mr.
Kennedy
came
in
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
what
Mr.
Finn
tells
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
heard
that
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
has
gone
down
to
Loughton
to
stand
against
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
will
no
doubt
lose
his
time
and
his
money
;
 
but
he
will
gain
the
prestige
of
having
stood
for
a
borough
,
which
will
be
something
for
him
on
the
staff
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
get
that
horrid
man
Vellum
to
propose
him
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
And
the
less
any
of
us
say
about
it
the
better
.
<EOS>
Finn
,
my
dear
fellow
,
I
congratulate
you
heartily
.
<EOS>
Nothing
for
a
long
time
has
given
me
greater
pleasure
than
hearing
of
your
appointment
.
<EOS>
It
is
equally
honourable
to
yourself
and
to
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
step
to
have
gained
so
early
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
thanked
his
friend
,
could
not
help
asking
himself
what
his
friend
had
done
to
be
made
a
Cabinet
Minister
.
<EOS>
Little
as
he
,
Phineas
,
himself
had
done
in
the
House
in
his
two
sessions
and
a
half
,
Mr.
Kennedy
had
hardly
done
more
in
his
fifteen
or
twenty
.
<EOS>
But
then
Mr.
Kennedy
was
possessed
of
almost
miraculous
wealth
,
and
owned
half
a
county
,
whereas
he
,
Phineas
,
owned
almost
nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
Of
course
no
Prime
Minister
would
offer
a
junior
lordship
at
the
Treasury
to
a
man
with
£
30,000
a
year
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
Phineas
took
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
will
do
well
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
will
do
well
,
"
replied
Lady
Laura
,
almost
scornfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
quite
such
a
black
swan
with
me
as
he
is
with
you
;
but
still
I
think
he
will
succeed
,
if
he
takes
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
how
that
absurd
story
of
his
duel
with
Chiltern
has
got
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
to
prevent
people
talking
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
was
some
quarrel
,
though
neither
of
them
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
They
say
it
was
about
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
I
should
hardly
think
that
Finn
could
have
any
hopes
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
he
not
have
hopes
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Because
he
has
neither
position
,
nor
money
,
nor
birth
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
gentleman
.
"
said
Lady
Laura
;
"
and
I
think
he
has
position
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
why
he
should
not
ask
any
girl
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
understanding
you
,
Laura
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
had
quite
other
hopes
about
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
have
;
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
You
spoke
of
Mr.
Finn
as
though
he
would
be
guilty
of
some
crime
<EOS>
were
he
to
ask
Violet
Effingham
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
In
that
I
disagree
with
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
is
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
will
make
me
sick
of
the
name
of
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
that
I
offend
you
by
my
gratitude
to
a
man
who
saved
your
life
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
argument
used
against
him
was
false
,
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
show
that
he
knew
that
it
was
false
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
had
better
not
mention
his
name
any
more
,
"
continued
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
quite
agree
with
you
that
it
is
nonsense
,
Robert
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
I
mean
to
say
is
,
that
if
you
go
on
as
you
do
,
you
will
turn
his
head
and
spoil
him
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
do
not
know
what
is
going
on
among
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
is
going
on
among
us
,
 
as
you
call
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
taking
this
young
man
up
and
putting
him
on
a
pedestal
and
worshipping
him
,
just
because
he
is
well
-
looking
,
and
rather
clever
and
decently
behaved
.
<EOS>
It
's
always
the
way
with
women
who
have
nothing
to
do
,
and
who
can
not
be
made
to
understand
that
they
should
have
duties
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
live
without
some
kind
of
idolatry

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
neglected
my
duty
to
you
,
Robert
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
you
know
you
have
;
 
in
going
to
those
receptions
at
your
father
's
house
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
that
to
do
with
Mr.
Finn
?
"
  
"
Psha
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
I
had
better
tell
Mr.
Finn
not
to
come
here
any
more
,
since
his
presence
is
disagreeable
to
you
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
knows
how
great
is
the
service
he
did
you
,
and
it
will
seem
to
be
very
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
People
will
say
all
manner
of
things
;
but
anything
will
be
better
than
that
you
should
go
on
as
you
have
done
,
 
accusing
your
wife
of
idolatry
towards
 
a
young
man
,
because
 
he
is
 
well
-
looking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
said
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
,
Robert
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
speak
more
of
you
than
of
a
lot
of
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
accused
me
personally
,
saying
that
because
of
my
idolatry
I
had
neglected
my
duty
;
but
really
you
made
such
a
jumble
of
it
all
,
with
papa
's
visitors
,
and
Sunday
afternoons
,
that
I
can
not
follow
what
was
in
your
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Kennedy
stood
for
awhile
,
collecting
his
thoughts
,
so
that
he
might
unravel
the
jumble
,
if
that
were
possible
to
him
;
but
finding
that
it
was
not
possible
,
he
left
the
room
,
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Laura
was
left
alone
to
consider
the
nature
of
the
accusation
which
her
husband
had
brought
against
her
;
or
the
nature
rather
of
the
accusation
which
she
had
chosen
to
assert
that
her
husband
had
implied
.
<EOS>
For
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
he
had
made
no
such
accusation
,
and
had
intended
to
make
none
such
.
<EOS>
The
idolatry
of
which
he
had
spoken
was
the
idolatry
which
a
woman
might
show
to
her
cat
,
her
dog
,
her
picture
,
her
china
,
her
furniture
,
her
carriage
and
horses
,
or
her
pet
maid
-
servant
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
idolatry
of
which
Mr.
Kennedy
had
spoken
;
 
but
was
there
no
other
worship
in
her
heart
,
worse
,
more
pernicious
than
that
,
in
reference
to
this
young
man
?
  
<EOS>
She
had
schooled
herself
about
him
very
severely
,
and
had
come
to
various
resolutions
.
<EOS>
She
had
found
out
and
confessed
to
herself
that
she
did
not
,
and
could
not
,
love
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
had
found
out
and
confessed
to
herself
that
she
did
love
,
and
could
not
help
loving
,
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
Then
she
had
resolved
to
banish
him
from
her
presence
,
and
had
gone
the
length
of
telling
him
so
.
<EOS>
After
that
she
had
perceived
that
she
had
been
wrong
,
and
had
determined
to
meet
him
as
she
met
other
men
,
 
and
to
conquer
her
love
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
this
could
not
be
done
,
when
something
almost
like
idolatry
grew
upon
her
,
she
determined
that
it
should
be
the
idolatry
of
friendship
,
that
she
would
not
sin
even
in
thought
,
that
there
should
be
nothing
in
her
heart
of
which
she
need
be
ashamed
;
 
but
that
the
one
great
object
and
purport
of
her
life
should
be
the
promotion
of
this
friend
's
welfare
.
<EOS>
She
had
just
begun
to
love
after
this
fashion
,
had
taught
herself
to
believe
that
she
might
combine
something
of
the
pleasure
of
idolatry
towards
her
friend
with
a
full
complement
of
duty
towards
her
husband
,
when
Phineas
came
to
her
with
his
tale
of
love
for
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
The
lesson
which
she
got
then
was
a
very
rough
one
,
 
so
hard
that
at
first
she
could
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
Her
anger
at
his
love
for
her
brother
's
wished
-
for
bride
was
lost
in
her
dismay
that
Phineas
should
love
any
one
after
having
once
loved
her
.
<EOS>
But
by
sheer
force
of
mind
she
had
conquered
that
dismay
,
that
feeling
of
desolation
at
her
heart
,
and
had
almost
taught
herself
to
hope
that
Phineas
might
succeed
with
Violet
.
<EOS>
He
wished
it
,
 
and
why
should
he
not
have
what
he
wished
,
 
he
,
whom
she
so
fondly
idolised
?
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
fault
that
he
and
she
were
not
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
She
had
chosen
to
arrange
it
otherwise
,
and
was
she
not
bound
to
assist
him
now
in
the
present
object
of
his
reasonable
wishes
?
<EOS>
She
had
got
over
in
her
heart
that
difficulty
about
her
brother
,
but
she
could
not
quite
conquer
the
other
difficulty
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
plead
his
cause
with
Violet
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
brought
herself
as
yet
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
she
was
accused
of
idolatry
for
Phineas
by
her
husband
,
 
<EOS>
she
with
"
a
lot
of
others
,
"
in
which
lot
Violet
was
of
course
included
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
better
that
they
two
should
be
brought
together
?
<EOS>
Would
not
her
friend
's
husband
still
be
her
friend
?
<EOS>
Would
she
not
then
forget
to
love
him
?
<EOS>
Would
she
not
then
be
safer
than
she
was
now
?
  
<EOS>
As
she
sat
alone
struggling
with
her
difficulties
,
she
had
not
as
yet
forgotten
to
love
him
,
 
nor
was
she
as
yet
safe
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
's
Four
Lovers
 
One
morning
early
in
June
Lady
Laura
called
at
Lady
Baldock
's
house
and
asked
for
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
The
servant
was
showing
her
into
the
large
drawing
-
room
,
when
she
again
asked
specially
for
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Miss
Effingham
is
there
,
"
said
the
man
,
opening
the
door
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
was
sitting
all
alone
,
and
Lady
Laura
perceived
that
she
had
been
caught
in
the
net
which
she
specially
wished
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
Now
Lady
Baldock
had
not
actually
or
openly
quarrelled
with
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
or
with
Lord
Brentford
,
but
she
had
conceived
a
strong
idea
that
her
niece
Violet
was
countenanced
in
all
improprieties
by
the
Standish
family
generally
,
and
that
therefore
the
Standish
family
was
to
be
regarded
as
a
family
of
enemies
.
<EOS>
There
was
doubtless
in
her
mind
considerable
confusion
on
the
subject
,
for
she
did
not
know
whether
Lord
Chiltern
or
Mr.
Finn
was
the
suitor
whom
she
most
feared
,
 
and
she
was
aware
,
after
a
sort
of
muddled
fashion
,
that
the
claims
of
these
two
wicked
young
men
were
antagonistic
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
both
regarded
by
her
as
emanations
from
the
same
source
of
iniquity
,
and
,
therefore
,
without
going
deeply
into
the
machinations
of
Lady
Laura
,
 
without
resolving
whether
Lady
Laura
was
injuring
her
by
pressing
her
brother
as
a
suitor
upon
Miss
Effingham
,
or
by
pressing
a
rival
of
her
brother
,
 
still
she
became
aware
that
it
was
her
duty
to
turn
a
cold
shoulder
on
those
two
houses
in
Portman
Square
and
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
But
her
difficulties
in
doing
this
were
very
great
,
and
it
may
be
said
that
Lady
Baldock
was
placed
in
an
unjust
and
cruel
position
.
<EOS>
Before
the
end
of
May
she
had
proposed
to
leave
London
,
and
to
take
her
daughter
and
Violet
down
to
Baddingham
,
 
or
to
Brighton
,
if
they
preferred
it
,
or
to
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
"
Brighton
in
June
!
"
<EOS>
Violet
had
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Would
not
a
month
among
the
glaciers
be
delightful
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Boreham
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
me
keep
you
in
town
,
aunt
,
"
Violet
replied
;
"
but
I
do
not
think
I
shall
go
till
other
people
go
.
<EOS>
I
can
have
a
room
at
Laura
Kennedy
's
house
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Baldock
,
whose
position
was
hard
and
cruel
,
resolved
that
she
would
stay
in
town
.
<EOS>
Here
she
had
in
her
hands
a
ward
over
whom
she
had
no
positive
power
,
and
yet
in
respect
to
whom
her
duty
was
imperative
!
<EOS>
Her
duty
was
imperative
,
and
Lady
Baldock
was
not
the
woman
to
neglect
her
duty
;
 
and
yet
she
knew
that
the
doing
of
her
duty
would
all
be
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Violet
would
marry
a
shoe
-
black
out
of
the
streets
if
she
were
so
minded
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
that
the
poor
lady
had
provided
herself
with
two
strings
,
two
most
excellent
strings
,
to
her
bow
,
 
two
strings
either
one
of
which
should
have
contented
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
There
was
Lord
Fawn
,
a
young
peer
,
not
very
rich
indeed
,
 
but
still
with
means
sufficient
for
a
wife
,
a
rising
man
,
and
in
every
way
respectable
,
although
a
Whig
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
Mr.
Appledom
,
one
of
the
richest
commoners
in
England
,
a
fine
Conservative
too
,
with
a
seat
in
the
House
,
and
everything
appropriate
.
<EOS>
He
was
fifty
,
but
looked
hardly
more
than
thirty
-
five
,
and
was
,
 
so
at
least
Lady
Baldock
frequently
asserted
,
 
violently
in
love
with
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Why
had
not
the
law
,
or
the
executors
,
or
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
or
some
power
levied
for
the
protection
of
the
proprieties
,
made
Violet
absolutely
subject
to
her
guardian
till
she
should
be
made
subject
to
a
husband
?
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
think
she
is
at
home
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
,
in
answer
to
Lady
Laura
's
inquiry
for
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
I
hardly
know
.
<EOS>
She
seldom
tells
me
what
she
means
to
do
,
 
and
sometimes
she
will
walk
out
quite
alone
!
"
<EOS>
A
most
imprudent
old
woman
was
Lady
Baldock
,
always
opening
her
hand
to
her
adversaries
,
unable
to
control
herself
in
the
scolding
of
people
,
either
before
their
faces
or
behind
their
backs
,
even
at
moments
in
which
such
scolding
was
most
injurious
to
her
own
cause
.
<EOS>
"
However
,
we
will
see
,
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
Then
the
bell
was
rung
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
Violet
was
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
more
they
were
up
-
stairs
together
in
Violet
's
own
room
,
in
spite
of
the
openly
-
displayed
wrath
of
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
"
I
almost
wish
she
had
never
been
born
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
to
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mamma
,
do
n't
say
that
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
do
wish
that
I
had
never
seen
her
.
"
<EOS>
"
Indeed
she
has
been
a
grievous
trouble
to
you
,
mamma
,
"
said
Miss
Boreham
,
sympathetically
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brighton
!
<EOS>
What
nonsense
!
<EOS>
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
's
nonsense
.
<EOS>
Fancy
going
to
Brighton
!
<EOS>
And
then
they
have
proposed
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
only
hear
Augusta
talking
in
rapture
of
a
month
among
the
glaciers
!
<EOS>
And
I
feel
so
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
I
believe
they
would
spend
three
months
with
me
at
any
horrible
place
that
I
could
suggest
,
 
at
Hong
Kong
if
I
were
to
ask
it
,
 
<EOS>
so
intent
are
they
on
taking
me
away
from
metropolitan
danger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
not
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
go
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
very
naughty
;
but
I
ca
n't
help
feeling
that
I
can
not
be
good
without
being
a
fool
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
I
must
either
fight
my
aunt
,
or
give
way
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
yield
,
what
a
life
I
should
have
;
 
and
I
should
despise
myself
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
the
special
danger
to
be
feared
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
;
 
<EOS>
you
,
<EOS>
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
if
she
went
,
I
should
go
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
would
make
her
stay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
come
to
me
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
think
of
it
really
,
 
not
for
any
length
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
should
be
in
Mr.
Kennedy
's
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
would
n't
be
in
his
way
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
only
be
down
punctually
for
morning
prayers
,
and
go
to
church
with
him
on
Sunday
afternoon
,
he
would
be
delighted
to
have
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
about
Madame
Max
coming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
quite
knew
who
she
was
then
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
he
has
inquired
since
,
by
something
he
said
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
that
matters

only
a
word

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whom
have

come
to
talk
about

"
<EOS>
asked
Violet
,
laughing
a
little
,
with
something
of
increased
colour
in
her
cheeks
,
though
she
could
not
be
said
to
blush
.
  
<EOS>
"
A

said
Lady

<EOS>
"
I

varies

prescription

She

<EOS>
"
And
who

her
favourite

"
  
<EOS>
"
Old
Mr.
Appledom

who
is
really
a
most
unexceptionable
old
party

whom
I
like
of
all
things

I
really
think
I
could
consent
to
be
Mrs.
Appledom

to
get
rid
of
my
troubles

if
he
did
not
dye
his
whiskers

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'd
give
up
those
little
things
if
you
asked
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
have
the
heart
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
this
is
n't
his
time
of
the
year
for
making
proposals
.
<EOS>
His
love
fever
,
which
is
of
a
very
low
kind
,
and
intermits
annually
,
never
comes
on
till
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
rural
malady
,
against
which
he
is
proof
while
among
his
clubs
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Violet
,
 
I
am
like
your
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Like
Lady
Baldock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
one
respect
.
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
will
vary
my
prescription
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
this
,
 
that
if
you
like
to
marry
Phineas
Finn
,
I
will
say
that
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
And
why
am
I
to
marry
Phineas
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
for
two
reasons
;
because
he
loves
you
,
and
because
 
"
  
"
No
,
 
I
deny
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
come
to
fancy
that
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
your
fancy
more
under
control
then
.
<EOS>
But
upon
my
word
I
ca
n't
understand
this
.
<EOS>
He
was
your
great
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
that
to
do
with
it
?
"
demanded
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
thrown
over
your
brother
,
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
thrown
him
over
.
<EOS>
Is
he
to
go
on
for
ever
asking
and
being
refused
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
why
he
should
not
,
"
said
Violet
,
"
seeing
how
very
little
trouble
it
gives
him
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
once
in
six
months
does
it
all
for
him
,
allowing
him
time
for
coming
and
going
in
a
cab
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Violet
,
I
do
not
understand
you
.
<EOS>
Have
you
refused
Oswald
so
often
because
he
does
not
pass
hours
on
his
knees
before
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
His
nature
would
be
altered
very
much
for
the
worse
before
he
could
do
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
throw
it
in
his
teeth
then
that
he
does
not
give
you
more
of
his
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
come
to
tell
me
to
marry
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
?
<EOS>
That
is
what
I
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
,
as
far
as
I
am
aware
,
has
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
,
 
except
a
month
's
salary
now
due
to
him
from
the
Government
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
I
believe
to
be
the
son
of
a
country
doctor
in
Ireland
,
 
with
about
seven
sisters
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
is
a
Roman
Catholic
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
is
,
 
or
was
a
short
time
ago
,
 
in
love
with
another
lady
;
and
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
is
not
so
much
in
love
at
this
moment
but
what
he
is
able
to
intrust
his
cause
to
an
ambassador
.
<EOS>
None
short
of
a
royal
suitor
should
ever
do
that
with
success
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
never
pleaded
his
cause
to
you
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
never
tell
gentlemen
's
secrets
.
<EOS>
It
seems
that
if
he
has
,
his
success
was
so
trifling
that
he
has
thought
he
had
better
trust
some
one
else
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
trusted
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
given
me
any
commission
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
have
you
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
 
I
hardly
know
how
to
tell
his
story
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
things
about
Oswald
which
made
it
almost
necessary
that
Mr.
Finn
should
explain
himself
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
all
;
 
about
their
fighting
.
<EOS>
Foolish
young
men
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
bit
obliged
to
either
of
them
,
 
not
a
bit
.
<EOS>
Only
fancy
,
if
my
aunt
knew
it
,
what
a
life
she
would
lead
me
!
<EOS>
Gustavus
knows
all
about
it
,
and
I
feel
that
I
am
living
at
his
mercy
.
<EOS>
Why
were
they
so
wrong
-
headed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
answer
that
,
 
though
I
know
them
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
Chiltern
was
the
one
in
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
odd
that
you
should
have
thrown
your
brother
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
thrown
my
brother
over
.
<EOS>
Will
you
accept
Oswald
if
he
asks
you
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
almost
shouted
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
hope
that
Mr.
Finn
may
succeed
.
<EOS>
I
want
him
to
succeed
in
everything
.
<EOS>
There
;
 
you
may
know
it
all
.
<EOS>
He
is
my
Phoebus
Apollo
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
flattering
to
me
,
 
looking
at
the
position
in
which
you
desire
to
place
your
Phoebus
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Violet
,
I
am
true
to
you
,
and
let
me
have
a
little
truth
from
you
.
<EOS>
This
man
loves
you
,
and
I
think
is
worthy
of
you
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
love
me
,
but
he
is
my
friend
.
<EOS>
As
his
friend
,
and
believing
in
his
worth
,
I
wish
for
his
success
beyond
almost
anything
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
in
those
reasons
which
you
gave
me
just
now
for
not
becoming
this
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
do
I.
"
  
"
I
know
you
do
not
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
have
less
of
real
heart
than
you
,
I
who
thought
that
I
could
trust
myself
to
satisfy
my
mind
and
my
ambition
without
caring
for
my
heart
,
I
have
married
for
what
you
call
position
.
<EOS>
My
husband
is
very
rich
,
and
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
and
will
probably
be
a
peer
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
willing
to
marry
me
at
a
time
when
I
had
not
a
shilling
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
very
generous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
asked
for
it
since
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
But
never
mind
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
come
to
talk
about
myself
;
 
otherwise
than
to
bid
you
not
do
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
All
that
you
have
said
about
this
man
's
want
of
money
and
of
family
is
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mere
words
,
 
fit
only
for
such
people
as
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
?
"
  
"
Well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
love
him
 
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
if
I
do
not
?
<EOS>
You
are
very
close
in
inquiring
into
my
secrets
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
Laura
;
 
was
not
this
young
Crichton
once
a
lover
of
your
own
?
"
  
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
And
do
you
think
I
can
not
keep
a
gentleman
's
secret
as
well
as
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
good
of
any
secret
,
Laura
,
when
we
have
been
already
so
open
?
<EOS>
He
tried
his
"
prentice
hand
on
you
;
and
then
he
came
to
me
.
<EOS>
Let
us
watch
him
,
and
see
who
'll
be
the
third
.
<EOS>
I
too
like
him
<EOS>
well
enough
to
hope
that
he
'll
land
himself
safely
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
The
Mousetrap
 
Phineas
had
certainly
no
desire
to
make
love
by
an
ambassador
,
 
at
second
-
hand
.
<EOS>
He
had
given
no
commission
to
Lady
Laura
,
and
was
,
as
the
reader
is
aware
,
quite
ignorant
of
what
was
being
done
and
said
on
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
He
had
asked
no
more
from
Lady
Laura
than
an
opportunity
of
speaking
for
himself
,
and
that
he
had
asked
almost
with
a
conviction
<EOS>
that
by
so
asking
he
would
turn
his
friend
into
an
enemy
.
<EOS>
He
had
read
but
little
of
the
workings
of
Lady
Laura
's
heart
towards
himself
,
and
had
no
idea
of
the
assistance
she
was
anxious
to
give
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
told
him
that
she
was
willing
to
sacrifice
her
brother
on
his
behalf
,
and
,
of
course
,
had
not
told
him
that
she
was
willing
also
to
sacrifice
herself
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
when
she
wrote
to
him
one
June
morning
and
told
him
that
Violet
would
be
found
in
Portman
Square
,
alone
,
that
afternoon
,
 
naming
an
hour
,
and
explaining
that
Miss
Effingham
would
be
there
to
meet
herself
and
her
father
,
but
that
at
such
an
hour
she
would
be
certainly
alone
,
 
<EOS>
did
he
even
then
know
how
much
she
was
prepared
to
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
short
note
was
signed
"
L.
,
"
and
then
there
came
a
long
postscript
.
<EOS>
"
Ask
for
me
,
"
she
said
in
a
postscript
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
there
later
,
and
I
have
told
them
to
bid
you
wait
.
<EOS>
I
can
give
you
no
hope
of
success
,
but
if
you
choose
to
try
,
 
you
can
do
so
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
come
,
I
shall
know
that
you
have
changed
your
mind
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
think
the
worse
of
you
,
and
your
secret
will
be
safe
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
that
which
you
have
asked
me
to
do
,
 
simply
because
you
have
asked
it
.
<EOS>
Burn
this
at
once
,
 
because
I
ask
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
destroyed
the
note
,
tearing
it
into
atoms
,
the
moment
that
he
had
read
it
and
re
-
read
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
would
go
to
Portman
Square
at
the
hour
named
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
would
take
his
chance
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
buoyed
up
by
much
of
hope
;
 
but
even
though
there
were
no
hope
,
he
would
take
his
chance
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lord
Brentford
had
first
told
Phineas
of
his
promotion
,
he
had
also
asked
the
new
Lord
of
the
Treasury
to
make
a
certain
communication
on
his
behalf
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
This
Phineas
had
found
himself
obliged
to
promise
to
do
;
 
and
he
had
done
it
.
<EOS>
The
letter
had
been
difficult
enough
to
write
,
 
but
he
had
written
it
.
<EOS>
After
having
made
the
promise
,
he
had
found
himself
bound
to
keep
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
he
had
commenced
,
"
I
will
not
think
that
there
was
anything
in
our
late
encounter
to
prevent
my
so
addressing
you
.
<EOS>
I
now
write
at
the
instance
of
your
father
,
who
has
heard
nothing
of
our
little
affair
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
explained
at
length
Lord
Brentford
's
wishes
as
he
understood
them
.
"
<EOS>
Pray
come
home
,
"
he
said
,
finishing
his
letter
.
"
<EOS>
Touching
V.
E.
,
I
feel
that
I
am
bound
to
tell
you
that
I
still
mean
to
try
my
fortune
,
but
that
I
have
no
ground
for
hoping
that
my
fortune
will
be
good
.
<EOS>
Since
the
day
on
the
sands
,
I
have
never
met
her
but
in
society
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
my
wound
was
nothing
;
and
I
think
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
I
have
got
my
foot
on
to
the
ladder
of
promotion
.
 
<EOS>
Yours
always
,
  
"
PHINEAS
FINN
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
he
had
to
try
his
fortune
,
 
that
fortune
of
which
he
had
told
Lord
Chiltern
that
he
had
no
reason
for
hoping
that
it
would
be
good
.
<EOS>
He
went
direct
from
his
office
at
the
Treasury
to
Portman
Square
,
resolving
that
he
would
take
no
trouble
as
to
his
dress
,
simply
washing
his
hands
and
brushing
his
hair
as
though
he
were
going
down
to
the
House
,
and
he
knocked
at
the
Earl
's
door
exactly
at
the
hour
named
by
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Effingham
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
so
glad
to
find
you
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
said
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
alone
,
 
a
poor
unprotected
female
.
<EOS>
But
I
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
strong
reason
for
believing
that
Lord
Brentford
is
somewhere
about
.
<EOS>
And
Pomfret
the
butler
,
who
has
known
me
since
I
was
a
baby
,
is
a
host
in
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
such
allies
you
can
have
nothing
to
fear
,
"
he
replied
,
attempting
to
carry
on
her
little
jest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
even
without
them
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
We
unprotected
females
in
these
days
are
so
self
-
reliant
that
our
natural
protectors
fall
off
from
us
,
finding
themselves
to
be
no
longer
wanted
.
<EOS>
Now
with
you
,
 
what
can
I
fear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
 
as
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
There
used
to
be
a
time
,
and
that
not
so
long
ago
either
,
when
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
were
thought
to
be
very
dangerous
to
each
other
if
they
were
left
alone
.
<EOS>
But
propriety
is
less
rampant
now
,
and
upon
the
whole
virtue
and
morals
,
with
discretion
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
,
have
been
the
gainers
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
the
same
,
but
I
do
n't
like
to
be
caught
in
a
trap
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
a
trap
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
in
a
trap
.
<EOS>
Is
there
no
trap
here
?
<EOS>
If
you
will
say
so
,
I
will
acknowledge
myself
to
be
a
dolt
,
and
will
beg
your
pardon

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
what
you
call
a
trap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
told
that
I
was
here

<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
before
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
was
told
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
call
that
a
trap

"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
blame
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
that
you
set
it
,
 
but
you
use
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Effingham
,
of
course
I
have
used
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
 
I
think
you
must
know
that
I
have
that
to
say
to
you
which
has
made
me
long
for
such
an
opportunity
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
you
have
called
in
the
assistance
of
your
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
such
matters
you
should
never
talk
to
any
one
,
Mr.
Finn

<EOS>
If
you
can
not
fight
your
own
battle

no
one
can
fight
it

<EOS>
"
Miss
Effingham
,
do
you
remember
our
ride
at
Saulsby
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
 
as
if
it
were
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
remember
that
I
asked
you
a
question
which
you
have
never
answered
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
answer
it
,
 
as
well
as
I
knew
<EOS>
how
,
so
that
I
might
tell
you
a
truth
without
hurting
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
necessary
,
 
is
necessary
that
I
should
be
hurt
sorely
,
or
made
perfectly
happy
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
,
I
have
come
to
you
to
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
;
 
to
tell
you
that
I
love
you
,
and
to
ask
for
your
love
in
return
.
<EOS>
Whatever
may
be
my
fate
,
the
question
must
be
asked
,
and
an
answer
must
be
given
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
hoped
that
you
should
tell
me
that
you
loved
me
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
what
then
have
you
hoped

"
  
"
For
not
much
,
indeed
;
 
but
if
for
anything
,
then
for
some
chance
that
you
might
tell
me
so
hereafter
.
"
  
"
If
I
loved
you
,
I
would
tell
you
so
now

I
give
you
my
word
of
that

<EOS>

Can
you

What
is
a

answer
to
such
a
question

<EOS>
No

I
believe
never

I
do
not

I
shall
ever

my

You
ask
me
to
be
plain

and
I
must
be
plain

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
because
 
?
"
<EOS>
He
paused
,
hardly
knowing
what
the
question
was
which
he
proposed
to
himself
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
for
no
because
,
 
for
no
cause

that
simple
one
which
should
make
any
girl
refuse
any
man
whom
she
did
not
love
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
I
could
say
pleasant
things
to
you
on
any
other
subject
than
this
,
 
because
I
like
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
have
nothing
to
justify
my
suit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
everything
to
justify
it
;
 
at
least
I
am
bound
to
presume
that
you
have
.
<EOS>
If
you
love
me
,
 
you
are
justified
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
that
it
should
ever
have
been
so
,
 
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
hope
that
I
have
not
been
in
fault

<EOS>
"
Will
you
try
to
love
me
?

<EOS>
"
No
;
 
why
should
I
try
?
<EOS>
If
any
trying
were
necessary
,
I
would
try
rather
not
to
love
you
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
try
to
do
that
which
would
displease
everybody
belonging
to
me
?
<EOS>
For
yourself
,
I
admit
your
right
to
address
me
,
 
and
tell
you
frankly
that
it
would
not
be
in
vain
,
if
I
loved
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
tell
you
as
frankly
that
such
a
marriage
would
not
please
those
whom
I
am
bound
to
try
to
please

"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
before
he
spoke
further
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
wait
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
come
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
say
to
that
?
<EOS>
Do
not
tease
me
,
so
that
I
be
driven
to
treat
you
with
lack
of
courtesy
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
is
so
much
attached
to
you
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
Lord
Brentford
,
 
<EOS>
and
indeed
I
may
say
,
<EOS>
I
myself
also
,
that
I
trust
there
may
be
nothing
to
mar
our
good
fellowship
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Mr.
Finn
,
 
say
that
you
will
take
an
answer
,
and
I
will
give
you
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
it
me
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
he
put
it
up
to
his
lips
and
pressed
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
wait
and
come
again
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
assuredly
come
again
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
from
her
and
went
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
At
the
corner
of
the
square
he
saw
Lady
Laura
's
carriage
,
but
did
not
stop
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
she
also
saw
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
have
had
a
visitor
here
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
to
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
have
been
caught
in
the
trap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
mouse
!
<EOS>
And
has
the
cat
made
a
meal
of
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
he
has
,
after
his
fashion
.
<EOS>
There
be
cats
that
eat
their
mice
without
playing
,
 
and
cats
that
play
with
their
mice
,
and
then
eat
them
;
and
cats
again
<EOS>
which
only
play
with
their
mice
,
and
do
n't
care
to
eat
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
is
a
cat
of
the
latter
kind
,
and
has
had
his
afternoon
's
diversion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wrong
him
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
would
not
have
liked
me
to
accept
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
I
can
see
inside
his
bosom
,
such
a
little
job
as
that
he
has
now
done
will
be
looked
back
upon
as
one
of
the
past
pleasures
of
his
life
;
 
not
as
a
pain
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
's
Bill
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
necessary
that
we
should
go
back
in
our
story
for
a
very
short
period
in
order
that
the
reader
may
be
told
that
Phineas
Finn
was
duly
re
-
elected
at
Loughton
after
his
appointment
at
the
Treasury
Board
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
little
trouble
at
Loughton
,
and
something
more
of
expense
than
he
had
before
encountered
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
absolutely
came
down
,
and
was
proposed
by
Mr.
Vellum
for
the
borough
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Vellum
being
a
gentleman
learned
in
the
law
,
and
hostile
to
the
interests
of
the
noble
owner
of
Saulsby
,
was
able
to
raise
a
little
trouble
against
our
hero
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Slide
was
proposed
by
Mr.
Vellum
,
and
seconded
by
Mr.
Vellum
's
clerk
,
 
though
,
as
it
afterwards
appeared
,
Mr.
Vellum
's
clerk
was
not
in
truth
an
elector
,
 
and
went
to
the
poll
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
received
three
votes
,
and
at
twelve
o'clock
withdrew
.
<EOS>
This
in
itself
could
hardly
have
afforded
compensation
for
the
expense
which
Mr.
Slide
or
his
backers
must
have
encountered
;
 
but
he
had
an
opportunity
of
making
a
speech
,
every
word
of
which
was
reported
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
;
and
if
the
speech
was
made
in
the
language
given
in
the
report
,
Mr.
Slide
was
really
possessed
of
some
oratorical
power
.
<EOS>
Most
of
those
who
read
the
speech
in
the
columns
of
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
were
probably
not
aware
how
favourable
an
opportunity
of
retouching
his
sentences
in
type
had
been
given
to
Mr.
Slide
by
the
fact
of
his
connection
with
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
The
speech
had
been
very
severe
upon
our
hero
;
and
though
the
speaker
had
been
so
hooted
and
pelted
at
Loughton
as
to
have
been
altogether
inaudible
,
 
so
maltreated
that
in
point
of
fact
he
had
not
been
able
to
speak
above
a
tenth
part
of
his
speech
at
all
,
 
<EOS>
nevertheless
the
speech
did
give
Phineas
a
certain
amount
of
pain
.
<EOS>
Why
Phineas
should
have
read
it
who
can
tell
?
<EOS>
But
who
is
there
that
abstains
from
reading
that
which
is
printed
in
abuse
of
himself
?
  
<EOS>
In
the
speech
as
it
was
printed
Mr.
Slide
declared
that
he
had
no
thought
of
being
returned
for
the
borough
.
<EOS>
He
knew
too
well
how
the
borough
was
managed
,
what
slaves
the
electors
were
;
 
how
they
groaned
under
a
tyranny
from
which
hitherto
they
had
been
unable
to
release
themselves
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
Earl
's
nominee
,
his
lacquey
,
as
the
honourable
gentleman
might
be
called
,
would
be
returned
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
could
order
them
to
return
whichever
of
his
lacqueys
he
pleased
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
something
peculiarly
pleasing
to
the
democratic
ear
in
the
word
lacquey
!
<EOS>
Any
one
serving
a
big
man
,
whatever
the
service
may
be
,
is
the
big
man
's
lacquey
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
 
<EOS>
The
speech
throughout
was
very
bitter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
,
who
had
previously
served
in
Parliament
as
the
lacquey
of
an
Irish
earl
,
and
had
been
turned
off
by
him
,
had
now
fallen
into
the
service
of
the
English
earl
,
and
was
the
lacquey
chosen
for
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
But
he
,
Quintus
Slide
,
who
boasted
himself
to
be
a
man
of
the
people
,
 
he
could
tell
them
that
the
days
of
their
thraldom
were
coming
to
an
end
,
and
that
their
enfranchisement
was
near
at
hand
.
<EOS>
That
friend
of
the
people
,
Mr.
Turnbull
,
had
a
clause
in
his
breeches
-
pocket
which
he
would
either
force
down
the
unwilling
throat
of
Mr.
Mildmay
,
or
else
drive
the
imbecile
Premier
from
office
by
carrying
it
in
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
Loughton
,
as
Loughton
,
must
be
destroyed
,
but
it
should
be
born
again
in
a
better
birth
as
a
part
of
a
real
electoral
district
,
sending
a
real
member
,
chosen
by
a
real
constituency
,
to
a
real
Parliament
.
<EOS>
In
those
days
,
 
and
they
would
come
soon
,
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
rather
thought
that
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
would
be
found
"
nowhere
,
"
and
he
rather
thought
also
that
when
he
showed
himself
again
,
as
he
certainly
should
do
,
in
the
midst
of
that
democratic
electoral
district
as
the
popular
candidate
for
the
honour
of
representing
it
in
Parliament
,
that
democratic
electoral
district
would
accord
to
him
a
reception
very
different
from
that
which
he
was
now
receiving
from
the
Earl
's
lacqueys
in
the
parliamentary
village
of
Loughton
.
<EOS>
A
prettier
bit
of
fiction
than
these
sentences
as
composing
a
part
of
any
speech
delivered
,
or
proposed
to
be
delivered
,
at
Loughton
,
Phineas
thought
he
had
never
seen
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
read
at
the
close
of
the
speech
that
though
the
Earl
's
hired
bullies
did
their
worst
,
the
remarks
of
Mr.
Slide
were
received
by
the
people
with
reiterated
cheering
,
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
at
the
Treasury
and
roared
.
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
had
been
three
minutes
on
his
legs
,
had
received
three
rotten
eggs
,
and
one
dead
dog
,
and
had
retired
.
<EOS>
But
not
the
half
of
the
speech
as
printed
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
has
been
quoted
.
<EOS>
The
sins
of
Phineas
,
who
in
spite
of
his
inability
to
open
his
mouth
in
public
had
been
made
a
Treasury
hack
by
the
aristocratic
influence
,
 
"
by
aristocratic
influence
not
confined
to
the
male
sex
,
"
 
were
described
at
great
length
,
and
in
such
language
that
Phineas
for
a
while
was
fool
enough
to
think
that
it
would
be
his
duty
to
belabour
Mr.
Slide
with
a
horsewhip
.
<EOS>
This
notion
,
however
,
did
not
endure
long
with
him
,
and
when
Mr.
Monk
told
him
that
things
of
that
kind
came
as
a
matter
of
course
,
he
was
comforted
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
found
it
much
more
difficult
to
obtain
comfort
when
he
weighed
the
arguments
brought
forward
against
the
abominations
of
such
a
borough
as
that
for
which
he
sat
,
and
reflected
that
if
Mr.
Turnbull
brought
forward
his
clause
,
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
would
be
bound
to
vote
against
the
clause
,
knowing
the
clause
to
be
right
,
because
he
was
a
servant
of
the
Government
.
<EOS>
The
arguments
,
even
though
they
appeared
in
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
were
true
arguments
;
and
he
had
on
one
occasion
admitted
their
truth
to
his
friend
Lady
Laura
,
 
in
the
presence
of
that
great
Cabinet
Minister
,
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
What
business
has
such
a
man
as
that
down
there
?
<EOS>
Is
there
a
single
creature
who
wants
him
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
anybody
does
want
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
,
"
Phineas
had
replied
;
"
but
I
am
disposed
to
think
the
electors
should
choose
the
man
they
do
want
,
and
that
at
present
they
have
no
choice
left
to
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
They
are
quite
satisfied
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
Lady
Laura
,
"
continued
Phineas
,
"
that
alone
should
be
sufficient
to
prove
that
their
privilege
of
returning
a
member
to
Parliament
is
too
much
for
them
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
defend
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
defended
by
tradition
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
And
by
its
great
utility
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
bowing
to
the
young
member
who
was
present
,
and
forgetting
that
very
useless
old
gentleman
,
her
cousin
,
who
had
sat
for
the
borough
for
many
years
.
<EOS>
"
In
this
country
it
does
n't
do
to
go
too
fast
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
"
And
then
the
mixture
of
vulgarity
,
falsehood
,
and
pretence
!
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
shuddering
as
her
mind
recurred
to
the
fact
that
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
had
contaminated
Loughton
by
his
presence
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
told
that
they
hardly
let
him
leave
the
place
alive
.
"
  
<EOS>
Whatever
Mr.
Kennedy
and
Lady
Laura
might
think
about
Loughton
and
the
general
question
of
small
boroughs
,
it
was
found
by
the
Government
,
to
their
great
cost
,
that
Mr.
Turnbull
's
clause
was
a
reality
.
<EOS>
After
two
months
of
hard
work
,
all
questions
of
franchise
had
been
settled
,
rating
and
renting
,
new
and
newfangled
,
fancy
franchises
and
those
which
no
one
fancied
,
franchises
for
boroughs
and
franchises
for
counties
,
franchises
single
,
dual
,
three
-
cornered
,
and
four
-
sided
,
 
by
various
clauses
to
which
the
Committee
of
the
whole
House
had
agreed
after
some
score
of
divisions
,
 
the
matter
of
the
franchise
had
been
settled
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
there
was
the
House
of
Lords
,
and
there
might
yet
be
shipwreck
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
Lords
would
hardly
look
at
the
bill
,
 
that
they
would
not
even
venture
on
an
amendment
.
<EOS>
The
Lords
would
only
be
too
happy
to
let
the
matter
be
settled
by
the
Commons
themselves
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
after
the
franchise
,
came
redistribution
.
<EOS>
How
sick
of
the
subject
were
all
members
of
the
Government
,
no
one
could
tell
who
did
not
see
their
weary
faces
.
<EOS>
The
whole
House
was
sick
,
having
been
whipped
into
various
lobbies
,
night
after
night
,
during
the
heat
of
the
summer
,
for
weeks
past
.
<EOS>
Redistribution
!
<EOS>
Why
should
there
be
any
redistribution
?
<EOS>
They
had
got
,
or
would
get
,
a
beautiful
franchise
.
<EOS>
Could
they
not
see
what
that
would
do
for
them
?
<EOS>
Why
redistribute
anything
?
<EOS>
But
,
alas
,
it
was
too
late
to
go
back
to
<EOS>
so
blessed
an
idea
as
that
!
<EOS>
Redistribution
they
must
have
.
<EOS>
But
there
should
be
as
little
redistribution
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Men
were
sick
of
it
all
,
and
would
not
be
exigeant
.
<EOS>
Something
should
be
done
for
overgrown
counties
;
 
something
for
new
towns
which
had
prospered
in
brick
and
mortar
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
easy
to
crush
up
a
peccant
borough
or
two
,
 
a
borough
that
had
been
discovered
in
its
sin
.
<EOS>
And
a
few
boroughs
now
blessed
with
two
members
might
consent
to
be
blessed
only
with
one
.
<EOS>
Fifteen
small
clauses
might
settle
the
redistribution
,
in
spite
of
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
if
only
Mr.
Daubeny
would
be
good
-
natured
.
  
<EOS>
Neither
the
weather
,
which
was
very
hot
,
nor
the
tedium
of
the
session
,
which
had
been
very
great
,
nor
the
anxiety
of
Ministers
,
which
was
very
pressing
,
had
any
effect
in
impairing
the
energy
of
Mr.
Turnbull
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
instant
,
as
oratorical
,
as
hostile
,
as
indignant
about
redistribution
as
he
had
been
about
the
franchise
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
sure
then
,
and
he
was
sure
now
,
that
Ministers
desired
to
burke
the
question
,
to
deceive
the
people
,
to
produce
a
bill
that
should
be
no
bill
.
<EOS>
He
brought
out
his
clause
,
 
and
made
Loughton
his
instance
.
"
<EOS>
Would
the
honourable
gentleman
who
sat
lowest
on
the
Treasury
bench
,
 
who
at
this
moment
was
in
sweet
confidential
intercourse
with
the
right
honourable
gentleman
now
President
of
the
Board
of
Trade
,
who
had
once
been
a
friend
of
the
people
,
 
would
the
young
Lord
of
the
Treasury
get
up
in
his
place
and
tell
them
that
no
peer
of
Parliament
had
at
present
a
voice
in
sending
a
member
to
their
House
of
Commons
,
 
that
no
peer
would
have
a
voice
if
this
bill
,
as
proposed
by
the
Government
,
were
passed
in
its
present
useless
,
ineffectual
,
conservative
,
and
most
dishonest
form
?
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
replied
to
this
,
and
who
told
Mr.
Turnbull
that
he
himself
could
not
answer
for
any
peers
,
 
but
that
he
thought
it
probable
that
most
peers
would
,
by
their
opinions
,
somewhat
influence
the
opinions
of
some
electors
,
 
was
thought
to
have
got
out
of
his
difficulty
very
well
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
the
clause
of
Mr.
Turnbull
to
be
dealt
with
,
 
a
clause
directly
disfranchising
seven
single
-
winged
boroughs
,
of
which
Loughton
was
of
course
one
,
 
a
clause
to
which
the
Government
must
either
submit
or
object
.
<EOS>
Submission
would
be
certain
defeat
in
one
way
,
and
objection
would
be
as
certain
defeat
in
another
,
 
if
the
gentlemen
on
the
other
side
were
not
disposed
to
assist
the
ministers
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
the
Cabinet
was
divided
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
and
Mr.
Monk
were
for
letting
the
seven
boroughs
go
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Mildmay
could
not
bring
himself
to
obey
Mr.
Turnbull
,
and
Mr.
Palliser
supported
him
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Mildmay
was
told
that
Mr.
Daubeny
would
certainly
go
into
the
same
lobby
with
Mr.
Turnbull
respecting
the
seven
boroughs
,
he
was
reported
to
have
said
that
in
that
case
Mr.
Daubeny
must
be
prepared
with
a
Government
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Daubeny
made
a
beautiful
speech
about
the
seven
boroughs
;
 
the
seven
sins
,
and
seven
stars
,
and
seven
churches
,
and
seven
lamps
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
no
party
question
of
this
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
who
usually
acted
with
him
would
vote
as
their
own
sense
of
right
or
wrong
directed
them
;
 
from
which
expression
of
a
special
sanction
it
was
considered
that
these
gentlemen
were
not
accustomed
to
exercise
the
privilege
now
accorded
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
in
regarding
the
question
as
one
of
right
and
wrong
,
and
in
looking
at
what
he
believed
to
be
both
the
wish
of
the
country
and
its
interests
,
he
,
Mr.
Daubeny
,
 
he
,
himself
,
being
simply
a
humble
member
of
that
House
,
 
must
support
the
clause
of
the
honourable
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Almost
all
those
to
whom
had
been
surrendered
the
privilege
of
using
their
own
judgment
for
that
occasion
only
,
used
it
discreetly
,
 
as
their
chief
had
used
it
himself
,
 
and
Mr.
Turnbull
carried
his
clause
by
a
majority
of
fifteen
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
3
a.m.
,
and
Mr.
Gresham
,
rising
after
the
division
,
said
that
his
right
honourable
friend
the
First
Lord
of
the
Treasury
was
too
tired
to
return
to
the
House
,
and
had
requested
him
to
state
that
the
Government
would
declare
their
purpose
at
6
p.m.
on
the
following
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
though
he
had
made
his
little
speech
in
answer
to
Mr.
Turnbull
with
good
-
humoured
flippancy
,
had
recorded
his
vote
in
favour
of
the
seven
boroughs
with
a
sore
heart
.
<EOS>
Much
as
he
disliked
Mr.
Turnbull
,
he
knew
that
Mr.
Turnbull
was
right
in
this
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
to
Mr.
Monk
on
the
subject
,
as
it
were
asking
Mr.
Monk
's
permission
to
throw
up
his
office
,
and
vote
against
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Monk
was
angry
with
him
,
telling
him
that
his
conscience
was
of
that
restless
,
uneasy
sort
which
is
neither
useful
nor
manly
.
<EOS>
"
We
all
know
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
"
and
none
better
than
Mr.
Mildmay
,
that
we
can
not
justify
such
a
borough
as
Loughton
by
the
theory
of
our
parliamentary
representation
,
 
any
more
than
we
can
justify
the
fact
that
Huntingdonshire
should
return
as
many
members
as
the
East
Riding
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
compromises
,
and
you
should
trust
to
others
who
have
studied
the
matter
more
thoroughly
than
you
,
to
say
how
far
the
compromise
should
go
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
influence
of
the
peer
,
not
the
paucity
of
the
electors
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
has
no
peer
any
influence
in
a
county
?
<EOS>
Would
you
disfranchise
Westmoreland
?
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
Finn
,
if
you
want
to
be
useful
,
you
must
submit
yourself
in
such
matters
to
those
with
whom
you
act
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
no
answer
to
make
,
but
he
was
not
happy
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
the
less
happy
,
perhaps
,
because
he
was
very
sure
that
Mr.
Mildmay
would
be
beaten
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
in
these
days
harassed
him
sorely
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
was
very
keen
against
such
boroughs
as
Loughton
,
declaring
that
Mr.
Daubeny
was
quite
right
to
join
his
standard
to
that
of
Mr.
Turnbull
on
such
an
issue
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
was
the
reformer
now
,
and
Phineas
found
himself
obliged
to
fight
a
losing
battle
on
behalf
of
an
acknowledged
abuse
.
<EOS>
He
never
went
near
Bunce
;
but
,
unfortunately
for
him
,
Bunce
caught
him
once
in
the
street
and
showed
him
no
mercy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Slide
was
a
little
'
eavy
on
you
in
the
_
Banner
_
the
other
day
,
 
eh
,
Mr.
Finn
?
 
<EOS>
too
'
eavy
,
as
I
told
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slide
can
be
just
as
heavy
as
he
pleases
,
Bunce
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
in
course
.
<EOS>
The
press
is
free
,
thank
God
,
 
as
yet
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
n't
any
good
rattling
away
at
the
Earl
's
little
borough
when
it
's
sure
to
go
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
'll
go
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
whole
seven
on
'em
.
<EOS>
The
'
ouse
could
n't
but
do
it
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
it
's
all
Mr.
Mildmay
's
own
work
,
sticking
out
for
keeping
on
'em
.
<EOS>
He
's
very
old
,
and
so
we
'll
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
must
go
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
know
all
about
that
soon
,
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
get
another
seat
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
suppose
we
shall
see
you
back
at
the
Inn
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
may
.
<EOS>
It
's
better
than
being
member
for
Loughton
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
you
may
be
sure
of
that
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
Mr.
Bunce
passed
on
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Turnbull
carried
his
clause
,
and
Loughton
was
doomed
.
<EOS>
Loughton
and
the
other
six
deadly
sins
were
anathematized
,
exorcised
,
and
finally
got
rid
of
out
of
the
world
by
the
voices
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
been
proclaiming
the
beauty
of
such
pleasant
vices
all
their
lives
,
and
who
in
their
hearts
hated
all
changes
that
tended
towards
popular
representation
.
<EOS>
But
not
the
less
was
Mr.
Mildmay
beaten
;
and
,
in
accordance
with
the
promise
made
by
his
first
lieutenant
immediately
after
the
vote
was
taken
,
the
Prime
Minister
came
forward
on
the
next
evening
and
made
his
statement
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
put
his
resignation
into
the
hands
of
Her
Majesty
,
and
Her
Majesty
had
graciously
accepted
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
old
,
and
felt
that
the
time
had
come
in
which
it
behoved
him
to
retire
into
that
leisure
which
he
thought
he
had
,
perhaps
,
earned
.
<EOS>
He
had
hoped
to
carry
this
bill
as
the
last
act
of
his
political
life
;
but
he
was
too
old
,
too
stiff
,
as
he
said
,
in
his
prejudices
,
to
bend
further
than
he
had
bent
already
,
and
he
must
leave
the
completion
of
the
matter
in
other
hands
.
<EOS>
Her
Majesty
had
sent
for
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
Mr.
Gresham
had
already
seen
Her
Majesty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
and
his
other
colleagues
,
though
they
dissented
from
the
clause
which
had
been
carried
by
the
united
efforts
of
gentlemen
opposite
to
him
,
and
of
gentlemen
below
him
on
his
own
side
of
the
House
,
were
younger
men
than
he
,
and
would
,
for
the
country
's
sake
,
 
and
for
the
sake
of
Her
Majesty
,
 
endeavour
to
carry
the
bill
through
.
<EOS>
There
would
then
,
of
course
,
be
a
dissolution
,
and
the
future
Government
would
,
no
doubt
,
depend
on
the
choice
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
From
all
which
it
was
understood
that
Mr.
Gresham
was
to
go
on
with
the
bill
to
a
conclusion
,
whatever
might
be
the
divisions
carried
against
him
,
and
that
a
new
Secretary
of
State
for
Foreign
Affairs
must
be
chosen
.
<EOS>
Phineas
understood
,
also
,
that
he
had
lost
his
seat
at
Loughton
.
<EOS>
For
the
borough
of
Loughton
there
would
never
again
be
an
election
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
been
Mr.
Mildmay
,
I
would
have
thrown
the
bill
up
altogether
,
"
Lord
Brentford
said
afterwards
;
"
but
of
course
it
was
not
for
me
to
interfere
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
session
was
protracted
for
two
months
after
that
,
 
beyond
the
time
at
which
grouse
should
have
been
shot
,
 
and
by
the
23rd
of
August
became
the
law
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
get
over
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Ratler
to
Mr.
Finn
,
seated
one
terribly
hot
evening
on
a
bench
behind
the
Cabinet
Ministers
,
 
"
<EOS>
never
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
suppose
such
a
session
for
work
was
ever
known
before
.
<EOS>
Think
what
it
is
to
have
to
keep
men
together
in
August
,
with
the
thermometer
at
81
°
,
and
the
river
stinking
like
,
 
like
the
very
mischief
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Ratler
,
however
,
did
not
die
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
last
day
of
the
session
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
resigned
.
<EOS>
Rumours
reached
the
ears
of
Phineas
as
to
the
cause
of
this
,
but
no
certain
cause
was
told
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
Lord
Cantrip
had
insisted
upon
it
,
Laurence
having
by
mischance
been
called
upon
for
some
official
statement
during
an
unfortunate
period
of
absence
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
a
mystery
about
it
;
 
but
the
mystery
was
not
half
so
wonderful
as
the
triumph
to
Phineas
,
when
Mr.
Gresham
offered
him
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
have
no
seat
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
none
of
us
have
seats
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
shall
be
at
a
loss
to
find
a
place
to
stand
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
election
will
not
come
on
till
November
,
and
you
must
look
about
you
.
<EOS>
Both
Mr.
Monk
and
Lord
Brentford
seem
to
think
you
will
be
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
so
the
bill
was
carried
,
and
the
session
was
ended
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
Duke
"
 
By
the
middle
of
September
there
was
assembled
a
large
party
at
Matching
Priory
,
a
country
mansion
belonging
to
Mr.
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
<EOS>
The
men
had
certainly
been
chosen
in
reference
to
their
political
feelings
and
position
,
 
for
there
was
not
a
guest
in
the
house
who
had
voted
for
Mr.
Turnbull
's
clause
,
or
the
wife
or
daughter
,
or
sister
of
any
one
who
had
so
voted
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
in
these
days
politics
ran
so
high
that
among
politicians
all
social
gatherings
were
brought
together
with
some
reference
to
the
state
of
parties
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
invited
,
and
when
he
arrived
at
Matching
he
found
that
half
the
Cabinet
was
there
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
was
not
there
,
nor
was
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
was
there
,
and
the
Duke
,
 
with
the
Duchess
,
and
Mr.
Gresham
,
and
Lord
Thrift
;
Mrs.
Max
Goesler
was
there
also
,
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
 
Mr.
Bonteen
being
detained
somewhere
out
of
the
way
;
and
Violet
Effingham
was
expected
in
two
days
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
at
the
end
of
the
week
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
took
an
opportunity
of
imparting
this
latter
information
to
Phineas
very
soon
after
his
arrival
;
and
Phineas
,
as
he
watched
her
eye
and
her
mouth
while
she
spoke
,
was
quite
sure
that
Lady
Glencora
knew
the
story
of
the
duel
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
to
see
him
again
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
right
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
There
were
also
there
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Grey
,
who
were
great
friends
of
the
Pallisers
,
 
and
on
the
very
day
on
which
Phineas
reached
Matching
,
at
half
an
hour
before
the
time
for
dressing
,
the
Duke
of
Omnium
arrived
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Palliser
was
the
Duke
's
nephew
and
heir
,
 
and
the
Duke
of
Omnium
was
a
very
great
person
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
why
it
should
have
been
so
,
but
the
Duke
of
Omnium
was
certainly
a
greater
man
in
public
estimation
than
the
other
duke
then
present
,
 
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
was
a
useful
man
,
and
had
been
so
all
his
life
,
sitting
in
Cabinets
and
serving
his
country
,
constant
as
any
peer
in
the
House
of
Lords
,
always
ready
to
take
on
his
own
shoulders
any
troublesome
work
required
of
him
,
than
whom
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
Mr.
Mildmay
's
predecessor
at
the
head
of
the
liberal
party
,
had
had
no
more
devoted
adherent
.
<EOS>
But
the
Duke
of
Omnium
had
never
yet
done
a
day
's
work
on
behalf
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
They
both
wore
the
Garter
,
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
having
earned
it
by
service
,
the
Duke
of
Omnium
having
been
decorated
with
the
blue
ribbon
,
 
because
he
was
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
The
one
was
a
moral
,
good
man
,
a
good
husband
,
a
good
father
,
and
a
good
friend
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
 
did
not
bear
quite
so
high
a
reputation
.
<EOS>
But
men
and
women
thought
but
little
of
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
while
the
other
duke
was
regarded
with
an
almost
reverential
awe
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
secret
lay
in
the
simple
fact
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
had
not
been
common
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
He
had
contrived
to
envelope
himself
in
something
of
the
ancient
mystery
of
wealth
and
rank
.
<EOS>
Within
three
minutes
of
the
Duke
's
arrival
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
with
an
air
of
great
importance
,
whispered
a
word
to
Phineas
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
come
.
<EOS>
He
arrived
exactly
at
seven
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
has
come
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Duke
of
Omnium
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
almost
reprimanding
him
by
her
tone
of
voice
for
his
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
a
great
doubt
whether
or
no
he
would
show
himself
at
last
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
told
me
that
he
never
will
pledge
himself
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
glad
he
has
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
saw
him
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
have
seen
him
,
 
a
magnificent
-
looking
man
!
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
so
very
nice
of
Lady
Glencora
getting
him
to
meet
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
rarely
that
he
will
join
in
a
great
party
,
but
they
say
Lady
Glencora
can
do
anything
with
him
since
the
heir
was
born
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
heard
all
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Phineas
;
"
I
have
heard
nothing
of
the
heir
,
but
I
know
that
there
are
three
or
four
babies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
heir
,
you
know
,
for
a
year
and
a
half
,
and
they
were
all
au
désespoir
;
and
the
Duke
was
very
nearly
quarrelling
with
his
nephew
;
and
Mr.
Palliser
 
;
you
know
it
had
very
nearly
come
to
a
separation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
anything
at
all
about
it
,
"
said
Phineas
,
who
was
not
very
fond
of
the
lady
who
was
giving
him
the
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
,
I
can
assure
you
;
but
since
the
boy
was
born
Lady
Glencora
can
do
anything
with
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
She
made
him
go
to
Ascot
last
spring
,
and
he
presented
her
with
the
favourite
for
one
of
the
races
on
the
very
morning
the
horse
ran
.
<EOS>
They
say
he
gave
three
thousand
pounds
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
Lady
Glencora
win
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
the
horse
lost
;
and
Mr.
Palliser
has
never
known
what
to
do
with
him
since
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
very
pretty
of
the
Duke
;
 
was
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
though
he
had
intended
to
show
to
Mrs.
Bonteen
<EOS>
how
little
he
thought
about
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
 
how
small
was
his
respect
for
a
great
peer
who
took
no
part
in
politics
,
 
could
not
protect
himself
from
a
certain
feeling
of
anxiety
as
to
the
aspect
and
gait
and
words
of
the
man
of
whom
people
thought
so
much
,
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
often
,
and
of
whom
he
had
seen
so
little
.
<EOS>
He
told
himself
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
should
be
no
more
to
him
than
any
other
man
,
but
yet
the
Duke
of
Omnium
was
more
to
him
than
other
men
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
down
into
the
drawing
-
room
he
was
angry
with
himself
,
and
stood
apart
;
 
and
was
then
angry
with
himself
again
because
he
stood
apart
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
make
a
difference
in
his
own
bearing
because
there
was
such
a
man
in
the
company
?
<EOS>
And
yet
he
could
not
avoid
it
.
<EOS>
When
he
entered
the
room
the
Duke
was
standing
in
a
large
bow
-
window
,
and
two
or
three
ladies
and
two
or
three
men
were
standing
round
him
.
<EOS>
Phineas
would
not
go
near
the
group
,
telling
himself
that
he
would
not
approach
a
man
<EOS>
so
grand
as
was
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
He
saw
Madame
Max
Goesler
among
the
party
,
and
after
a
while
he
saw
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
As
she
retreated
,
Phineas
knew
that
some
words
from
Madame
Max
Goesler
had
not
been
received
with
the
graciousness
which
she
had
expected
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
prettiest
smile
in
the
world
on
the
lady
's
face
,
and
she
took
a
corner
on
a
sofa
with
an
air
of
perfect
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
But
yet
Phineas
knew
that
she
had
received
a
wound
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
called
twice
on
you
in
London
,
"
said
Phineas
,
coming
up
close
to
her
,
"
but
was
not
fortunate
enough
to
find
you
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
but
you
came
so
late
in
the
season
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
there
should
be
any
arrangements
for
our
meeting
.
<EOS>
What
can
any
woman
do
when
a
gentleman
calls
on
her
in
August
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
in
July
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
did
;
on
the
31st
.
<EOS>
I
keep
the
most
accurate
record
of
all
such
things
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
hope
that
we
may
have
better
luck
next
year
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
we
can
only
enjoy
the
good
things
that
are
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Socially
,
or
politically
,
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
socially
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
mean
anything
else
when
the
Duke
of
Omnium
is
here
?
<EOS>
I
feel
so
much
taller
at
being
in
the
same
house
with
him
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
?
<EOS>
But
you
are
a
spoilt
child
of
fortune
,
and
perhaps
you
have
met
him
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
once
saw
the
back
of
a
hat
in
the
park
,
and
somebody
told
me
that
the
Duke
's
head
was
inside
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
never
seen
him
but
that
once
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Never
but
that
once
,
 
till
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
not
you
feel
elated
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
.
<EOS>
For
what
do
you
take
me
,
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
 
immensely
.
<EOS>
I
believe
him
to
be
a
fool
,
and
I
never
heard
of
his
doing
a
kind
act
to
anybody
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
when
he
gave
the
racehorse
to
Lady
Glencora
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
that
was
true
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
of
such
an
absurdity
?
<EOS>
As
I
was
saying
,
I
do
n't
think
he
ever
did
anything
for
anybody
;
 
but
then
,
you
know
,
to
be
Duke
of
Omnium
!
<EOS>
It
is
n't
necessary
,
 
is
it
,
 
that
a
Duke
of
Omnium
should
do
anything
except
be
Duke
of
Omnium
?
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Lady
Glencora
came
up
to
Phineas
,
and
took
him
across
to
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
had
expressed
a
desire
to
be
introduced
to
him
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
half
-
pleased
and
half
-
disgusted
,
had
no
alternative
,
and
followed
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
shook
hands
with
him
,
and
made
a
little
bow
,
and
said
something
about
the
garrotters
,
which
Phineas
,
in
his
confusion
,
did
not
quite
understand
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
reply
as
he
would
have
replied
to
anybody
else
,
but
the
weight
of
the
Duke
's
majesty
was
too
much
for
him
,
and
he
bungled
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
made
another
little
bow
,
and
in
a
moment
was
speaking
a
word
of
condescension
to
some
other
favoured
individual
.
<EOS>
Phineas
retreated
altogether
disgusted
,
 
hating
the
Duke
,
but
hating
himself
worse
;
but
he
would
not
retreat
in
the
direction
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
It
might
suit
that
lady
to
take
an
instant
little
revenge
for
her
discomfiture
,
but
it
did
not
suit
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
The
question
with
him
would
be
,
whether
in
some
future
part
of
his
career
it
might
not
be
his
duty
to
assist
in
putting
down
Dukes
of
Omnium
.
  
<EOS>
At
dinner
Phineas
sat
between
Mrs.
Bonteen
and
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
,
and
did
not
find
himself
very
happy
.
<EOS>
At
the
other
end
of
the
table
the
Duke
,
 
the
great
Duke
,
was
seated
at
Lady
Glencora
's
right
hand
,
and
on
his
other
side
Fortune
had
placed
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
interest
which
Phineas
had
during
the
dinner
was
in
watching
the
operations
,
 
the
triumphantly
successful
operations
of
that
lady
.
<EOS>
Before
dinner
she
had
been
wounded
by
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
had
not
condescended
to
accord
the
honour
of
his
little
bow
of
graciousness
to
some
little
flattering
morsel
of
wit
which
the
lady
had
uttered
on
his
behoof
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
a
sharp
word
or
two
in
her
momentary
anger
to
Phineas
;
but
when
Fortune
was
so
good
to
her
in
that
matter
of
her
place
at
dinner
,
she
was
not
fool
enough
to
throw
away
her
chance
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
soup
and
fish
she
was
very
quiet
.
<EOS>
She
said
a
word
or
two
after
her
first
glass
of
champagne
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
refused
two
dishes
,
one
after
another
,
and
then
she
glided
into
conversation
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
that
he
had
his
roast
mutton
before
him
she
was
in
full
play
,
and
as
she
eat
her
peach
,
the
Duke
was
bending
over
her
with
his
most
gracious
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
think
the
session
was
very
long
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
said
the
Duchess
to
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
long
indeed
,
Duchess
,
"
said
Phineas
,
with
his
attention
still
fixed
on
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Duke
found
it
very
troublesome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
he
did
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
That
duke
and
that
duchess
were
no
more
than
any
other
man
and
any
other
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
The
session
had
not
been
longer
to
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
than
to
all
the
public
servants
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
the
greatest
possible
respect
for
the
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
,
but
he
could
not
take
much
interest
in
the
wailings
of
the
Duchess
on
her
husband
's
behalf
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
things
do
seem
to
be
so
very
uncomfortable
now
,
"
said
the
Duchess
,
 
thinking
partly
of
the
resignation
of
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
partly
of
the
fact
that
her
own
old
peculiar
maid
who
had
lived
with
her
for
thirty
years
had
retired
into
private
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
very
bad
,
Duchess
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Phineas
,
observing
that
at
this
moment
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
eyes
were
brilliant
with
triumph
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
upon
him
a
sudden
ambition
,
 
that
he
would
like
to
"
cut
out
"
the
Duke
of
Omnium
in
the
estimation
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
The
brightness
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
eyes
had
not
been
thrown
away
upon
our
hero
.
  
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
came
at
the
appointed
time
,
and
,
to
the
surprise
of
Phineas
,
was
brought
to
Matching
by
Lord
Brentford
.
<EOS>
Phineas
at
first
thought
that
it
was
intended
that
the
Earl
and
his
son
should
meet
and
make
up
their
quarrel
at
Mr.
Palliser
's
house
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Brentford
stayed
only
one
night
,
and
Phineas
on
the
next
morning
heard
the
whole
history
of
his
coming
and
going
from
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
almost
been
on
my
knees
to
him
to
stay
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
did
go
on
my
knees
,
 
actually
on
my
knees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
put
his
arm
round
me
and
kissed
me
,
and
,
 
and
,
 
I
can
not
tell
you
all
that
he
said
.
<EOS>
But
it
ended
in
this
,
 
that
if
Chiltern
can
be
made
to
go
to
Saulsby
,
fatted
calves
without
stint
will
be
killed
.
<EOS>
I
shall
do
all
I
can
to
make
him
go
;
and
so
must
you
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Of
course
that
silly
affair
in
foreign
parts
is
not
to
make
any
difference
between
you
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
smiled
,
and
said
he
would
do
his
best
,
and
looked
up
into
her
face
,
and
was
just
able
to
talk
to
her
as
though
things
were
going
comfortably
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
heart
was
very
cold
.
<EOS>
As
Violet
had
spoken
to
him
about
Lord
Chiltern
there
had
come
upon
him
,
for
the
first
time
,
 
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
known
that
Lord
Chiltern
had
been
refused
,
 
an
idea
,
a
doubt
,
whether
even
yet
Violet
might
not
become
Lord
Chiltern
's
wife
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
very
sad
,
but
he
struggled
on
,
 
declaring
that
it
was
incumbent
on
them
both
to
bring
together
the
father
and
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
really
do
believe
that
you
can
do
more
towards
it
than
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
would
think
nothing
of
my
advice
,
 
would
hardly
speak
to
me
on
such
a
subject
.
<EOS>
But
he
respects
you
as
well
as
likes
you
,
and
not
the
less
because
of
what
has
occurred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
How
was
it
that
Violet
should
know
aught
of
the
respect
or
liking
<EOS>
felt
by
this
rejected
suitor
for
that
other
suitor
,
 
who
had
also
been
rejected
?
<EOS>
And
how
was
it
that
she
was
thus
able
to
talk
of
one
of
them
to
the
other
,
as
though
neither
of
them
had
ever
come
forward
with
such
a
suit
?
<EOS>
Phineas
felt
his
position
to
be
so
strange
as
to
be
almost
burdensome
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
Violet
,
when
she
had
refused
him
,
very
plainly
,
that
he
should
come
again
to
her
,
and
ask
once
more
for
the
great
gift
which
he
coveted
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
ask
again
now
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
there
was
that
in
her
manner
which
made
him
sure
that
were
he
to
do
so
,
he
would
ask
in
vain
;
and
then
he
felt
that
she
was
placing
a
special
confidence
in
him
,
against
which
he
would
commit
a
sin
were
he
to
use
her
present
intimacy
with
him
for
the
purposes
of
making
love
.
<EOS>
They
two
were
to
put
their
shoulders
together
to
help
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
while
doing
so
he
could
not
continue
a
suit
which
would
be
felt
by
both
of
them
to
be
hostile
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
There
might
be
opportunity
for
a
chance
word
,
and
if
so
the
chance
word
should
be
spoken
;
but
he
could
not
make
a
deliberate
attack
,
such
as
he
had
made
in
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
Violet
also
probably
understood
that
she
had
not
now
been
caught
in
a
mousetrap
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
to
spend
four
days
at
Matching
,
and
on
the
third
day
,
 
the
day
before
Lord
Chiltern
was
expected
,
 
he
was
to
be
seen
riding
with
Madame
Max
Goesler
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
was
known
as
a
perfect
horsewoman
,
 
one
indeed
who
was
rather
fond
of
going
a
little
fast
on
horseback
,
and
who
rode
well
to
hounds
.
<EOS>
But
the
Duke
seldom
moved
out
of
a
walk
,
and
on
this
occasion
Madame
Max
was
as
steady
in
her
seat
and
almost
as
slow
as
the
mounted
ghost
in
_
Don
Juan
_
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
said
by
some
there
,
especially
by
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
that
the
conversation
between
them
was
not
slow
.
<EOS>
And
on
the
next
morning
the
Duke
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
were
together
again
before
luncheon
,
standing
on
a
terrace
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
looking
down
on
a
party
who
were
playing
croquet
on
the
lawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
never
play
?
"
said
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
;
 
one
does
everything
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
would
play
well
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
not
play
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
shall
not
play
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see
you
with
your
mallet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
your
Grace
can
not
be
gratified
.
<EOS>
I
have
played
croquet
till
I
am
tired
of
it
,
and
have
come
to
think
it
is
only
fit
for
boys
and
girls
.
<EOS>
The
great
thing
is
to
give
them
opportunities
for
flirting
,
and
it
does
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
do
you
never
flirt
,
Madame
Goesler
?
"
  
"
Never
at
croquet
,
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
with
you
is
the
choicest
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
depends
on
so
many
things
,
 
and
so
much
on
the
chosen
person
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
recommend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
 
I
am
so
ignorant
.
<EOS>
I
can
recommend
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
to
a
mountain
-
top
at
dawn
on
a
summer
day
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
make
me
shiver
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
a
boat
on
a
lake
on
a
summer
evening
,
or
a
good
lead
after
hounds
with
nobody
else
within
three
fields
,
or
the
bottom
of
a
salt
-
mine
,
or
the
deck
of
an
ocean
steamer
,
or
a
military
hospital
in
time
of
war
,
or
a
railway
journey
from
Paris
to
Marseilles
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
you
have
the
most
uncomfortable
ideas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
your
Grace
has
tried
each
of
them
,
 
successfully
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
,
after
all
,
a
comfortable
chair
over
a
good
fire
,
in
a
pretty
room
,
beats
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
does
,
 
certainly
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
Then
he
whispered
something
at
which
Madame
Max
Goesler
blushed
and
smiled
,
and
immediately
after
that
she
followed
those
who
had
already
gone
in
to
lunch
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bonteen
had
been
hovering
round
the
spot
on
the
terrace
on
which
the
Duke
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
had
been
standing
,
looking
on
with
envious
eyes
,
meditating
some
attack
,
some
interruption
,
some
excuse
for
an
interpolation
,
but
her
courage
had
failed
her
<EOS>
and
she
had
not
dared
to
approach
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
had
known
nothing
of
the
hovering
propinquity
of
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
but
Madame
Goesler
had
seen
and
had
understood
it
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
"
she
said
afterwards
,
"
why
did
you
not
come
and
join
us
?
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
so
pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Two
is
company
,
and
three
is
none
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
who
in
her
anger
was
hardly
able
to
choose
her
words
quite
as
well
as
she
might
have
done
<EOS>
had
she
been
more
cool
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
Madame
Max
has
made
quite
a
new
conquest
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
to
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
pleased
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
with
apparently
unaffected
delight
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
such
a
great
thing
to
get
anybody
to
amuse
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
You
see
everybody
can
not
talk
to
him
,
and
he
will
not
talk
to
everybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
talked
enough
to
her
in
all
conscience
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
who
was
now
more
angry
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
The
Duellists
Meet
 
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
arrived
,
and
Phineas
was
a
little
nervous
as
to
their
meeting
.
<EOS>
He
came
back
from
shooting
on
the
day
in
question
,
and
was
told
by
the
servant
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Phineas
went
into
the
billiard
-
room
in
his
knickerbockers
,
thinking
probably
that
he
might
be
there
,
and
then
into
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
at
last
into
the
library
,
 
but
Lord
Chiltern
was
not
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
came
across
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
him
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
he
was
with
me
half
an
hour
since
,
walking
round
the
gardens
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
is
he
?
<EOS>
Come
;
 
tell
me
something
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
him
to
be
more
pleasant
.
<EOS>
He
would
give
no
promise
about
Saulsby
,
but
he
did
not
say
that
he
would
not
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
know
that
I
am
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
told
him
so
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
how
much
pleasure
I
should
have
in
seeing
you
two
together
,
 
as
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
laughed
,
and
said
you
were
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
You
see
I
am
obliged
to
be
explicit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
did
he
laugh
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
tell
me
,
but
I
suppose
it
was
because
he
was
thinking
of
a
little
trip
he
once
took
to
Belgium
,
and
he
perceived
that
I
knew
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
who
told
you
.
<EOS>
But
never
mind
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
mean
to
ask
any
questions
.
<EOS>
As
I
do
not
like
that
our
first
meeting
should
be
before
all
the
people
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
I
will
go
to
him
in
his
own
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
,
do
;
 
that
will
be
so
nice
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
sent
his
card
up
by
a
servant
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
lock
of
Lord
Chiltern
's
door
.
<EOS>
The
last
time
he
had
seen
this
man
,
they
had
met
with
pistols
in
their
hands
to
shoot
at
each
other
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
had
in
truth
done
his
very
best
to
shoot
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
The
cause
of
quarrel
was
the
same
between
them
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
not
given
up
Violet
,
and
had
no
intention
of
giving
her
up
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
received
no
intimation
whatever
from
his
rival
that
there
was
to
be
a
truce
between
them
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
indeed
written
in
friendship
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
but
he
had
received
no
answer
;
 
and
nothing
of
certainty
was
to
be
gathered
from
the
report
which
Violet
had
just
made
.
<EOS>
It
might
well
be
that
Lord
Chiltern
would
turn
upon
him
now
in
his
wrath
,
and
that
there
would
be
some
scene
which
in
a
strange
house
would
be
obviously
objectionable
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
had
resolved
that
even
that
would
be
better
than
a
chance
encounter
among
strangers
in
a
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
So
the
door
was
opened
and
the
two
men
met
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
old
fellow
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
Then
all
doubt
was
over
,
and
in
a
moment
Phineas
was
shaking
his
former
,
 
and
present
friend
,
warmly
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
So
we
've
come
to
be
<EOS>
an
Under
-
Secretary
have
we
?
 
<EOS>
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
to
get
into
harness
,
 
when
the
harness
offered
itself
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
deuce
of
a
bore
,
is
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
liked
work
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
liked
hunting
better
.
<EOS>
You
used
to
ride
as
if
you
did
.
<EOS>
There
's
Bonebreaker
back
again
in
the
stable
for
you
.
<EOS>
That
poor
fool
who
bought
him
could
do
nothing
with
him
,
and
I
let
him
have
his
money
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
have
done
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
was
the
biggest
fool
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
when
that
brute
got
me
down
under
the
bank
in
the
river
?
<EOS>
That
was
about
the
nearest
touch
I
ever
had
.
<EOS>
Lord
bless
me
;
 
how
he
did
squeeze
me
!
<EOS>
So
here
you
are
;
 
staying
with
the
Pallisers
,
 
one
of
a
Government
party
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
But
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
a
seat
,
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
talk
about
that
yet
,
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
sore
subject
,
 
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
I
think
they
have
been
quite
right
,
you
know
,
to
put
Loughton
into
the
melting
-
pot
,
 
though
I
'm
sorry
enough
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
you
voted
against
it
,
old
chap
?
<EOS>
But
,
come
;
I
'm
not
going
to
be
down
upon
you
.
<EOS>
So
my
father
has
been
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
he
was
here
for
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Violet
has
just
been
telling
me
.
<EOS>
You
and
he
are
as
good
friends
as
ever
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
we
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
heard
of
that
little
affair
?
"
<EOS>
And
Lord
Chiltern
nodded
his
head
,
intending
to
indicate
the
direction
of
Blankenberg
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
has
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
Violet
tells
me
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
know
that
she
has
heard
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
reason
to
suppose
as
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
does
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
her
myself
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
deuce
you
did
!
<EOS>
But
I
daresay
it
was
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
you
had
not
proclaimed
it
at
Charing
Cross
,
and
then
nobody
would
have
believed
a
word
about
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
my
father
will
hear
it
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
Saulsby
,
I
hope
,
Chiltern
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
question
is
easier
asked
than
answered
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
true
that
the
great
difficulty
has
been
got
over
.
<EOS>
Laura
has
had
her
money
.
<EOS>
And
if
my
father
will
only
acknowledge
that
he
has
wronged
me
throughout
,
from
beginning
to
end
,
I
will
go
to
Saulsby
to
-
morrow
;
 
and
would
cut
you
out
at
Loughton
the
next
day
,
only
that
Loughton
is
not
Loughton
any
longer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
expect
your
father
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
and
therefore
there
is
a
difficulty
.
<EOS>
So
you
've
had
that
awfully
ponderous
Duke
here
.
<EOS>
How
did
you
get
on
with
him
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Admirably
.
<EOS>
He
condescended
to
do
something
which
he
called
shaking
hands
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
greatest
old
dust
out
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
disrespectfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
he
take
any
notice
of
Violet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
observed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
ought
not
to
be
allowed
into
the
same
room
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
After
that
there
was
a
short
pause
,
and
Phineas
felt
some
hesitation
in
speaking
of
Miss
Effingham
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
And
how
do
you
get
on
with
her
?
"
asked
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
question
for
a
man
to
answer
.
<EOS>
The
question
was
so
hard
to
be
answered
,
that
Phineas
did
not
at
first
make
any
attempt
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
exactly
the
ground
that
I
stand
on
,
"
continued
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
refused
me
three
times
.
<EOS>
Have
you
been
more
fortunate
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
he
asked
his
question
,
looked
full
into
Finn
's
face
in
a
manner
that
was
irresistible
.
<EOS>
His
look
was
not
one
of
anger
nor
even
of
pride
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
indeed
,
without
a
strong
dash
of
fun
.
<EOS>
But
such
as
it
was
it
showed
Phineas
that
Lord
Chiltern
intended
to
have
an
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
he
at
last
,
"
I
have
not
been
more
fortunate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
have
changed
your
mind
,
"
said
his
host
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
have
not
changed
my
mind
,
"
said
Phineas
,
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
stands
it
then
?
<EOS>
Come
;
 
let
us
be
honest
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
down
at
Willingford
that
I
would
quarrel
with
any
man
who
attempted
to
cut
me
out
with
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
You
made
up
your
mind
that
you
would
do
so
,
and
therefore
I
quarrelled
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
we
ca
n't
always
be
fighting
duels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
may
not
have
to
fight
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
it
would
be
absurd
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
that
what
we
did
was
absurd
.
<EOS>
But
upon
my
life
I
did
not
see
any
other
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
that
is
over
.
<EOS>
How
is
it
to
be
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
say
in
answer
to
that
?
"
asked
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
the
truth
.
<EOS>
You
have
asked
her
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
I
have
asked
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
has
refused
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
she
has
refused
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
mean
to
ask
her
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
;
 
if
I
ever
think
that
there
is
a
chance
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Chiltern
,
I
believe
I
shall
whether
I
think
that
I
have
any
chance
or
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
start
fairly
,
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
certainly
shall
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
once
told
you
that
I
never
would
;
 
but
<EOS>
that
was
long
before
I
suspected
that
you
would
enter
for
the
same
plate
.
<EOS>
What
a
man
says
on
such
a
matter
when
he
is
down
in
the
mouth
goes
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Now
we
understand
each
other
,
and
you
had
better
go
and
dress
.
<EOS>
The
bell
rang
nearly
half
an
hour
ago
,
and
my
fellow
is
hanging
about
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
interview
had
in
one
respect
been
very
pleasant
to
Phineas
,
and
in
another
it
had
been
very
bitter
.
<EOS>
It
was
pleasant
to
him
to
know
that
he
and
Lord
Chiltern
were
again
friends
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
delight
to
him
to
feel
that
this
half
-
savage
but
high
-
spirited
young
nobleman
,
who
had
been
so
anxious
to
fight
with
him
and
to
shoot
him
,
was
nevertheless
ready
to
own
that
he
had
behaved
well
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
had
in
fact
acknowledged
that
though
he
had
been
anxious
to
blow
out
our
hero
's
brains
,
he
was
aware
all
the
time
that
our
hero
was
a
good
sort
of
fellow
.
<EOS>
Phineas
understood
this
,
and
felt
that
it
was
pleasant
.
<EOS>
But
with
this
understanding
,
and
accompanying
this
pleasure
,
there
was
a
conviction
in
his
heart
that
the
distance
between
Lord
Chiltern
and
Violet
would
daily
grow
to
be
less
and
still
less
,
 
and
that
Lord
Chiltern
could
afford
to
be
generous
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Effingham
could
teach
herself
to
be
fond
of
Lord
Chiltern
<EOS>
,
what
had
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
to
offer
in
opposition
to
the
claims
of
such
a
suitor
?
  
<EOS>
That
evening
Lord
Chiltern
took
Miss
Effingham
out
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Phineas
told
himself
that
this
was
of
course
so
arranged
by
Lady
Glencora
,
with
the
express
view
of
serving
the
Saulsby
interest
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
nothing
to
him
at
the
moment
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
was
intrusted
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
ambition
respecting
Madame
Max
Goesler
;
but
that
for
the
time
was
in
abeyance
.
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
keep
his
eyes
off
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
he
well
knew
,
his
observation
of
her
must
be
quite
useless
.
<EOS>
He
knew
beforehand
,
with
absolute
accuracy
,
the
manner
in
which
she
would
treat
her
lover
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
kind
,
genial
,
friendly
,
confidential
,
nay
,
affectionate
;
and
yet
her
manner
would
mean
nothing
,
would
give
no
clue
to
her
future
decision
either
for
or
against
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
as
Phineas
thought
,
a
peculiarity
with
Violet
Effingham
that
she
could
treat
her
rejected
lovers
as
dear
familiar
friends
immediately
after
her
rejection
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
"
your
eyes
and
ears
<EOS>
are
tell
-
tales
of
your
passion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
as
I
certainly
do
not
wish
that
any
one
should
guess
how
strong
is
my
regard
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
prettily
turned
,
 
very
prettily
turned
;
and
shows
more
readiness
of
wit
than
I
gave
you
credit
for
under
your
present
suffering
.
<EOS>
But
of
course
we
all
know
where
your
heart
is
.
<EOS>
Men
do
not
undertake
perilous
journeys
to
Belgium
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
unfortunate
journey
to
Belgium
!
<EOS>
But
,
dear
Madame
Max
,
really
nobody
knows
why
I
went
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
met
Lord
Chiltern
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
;
 
I
met
Lord
Chiltern
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
was
a
duel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
Max
,
 
you
must
not
ask
me
to
criminate
myself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
there
was
,
and
of
course
it
was
about
Miss
Effingham
,
and
of
course
the
lady
thinks
herself
bound
to
refuse
both
the
gentlemen
who
were
so
very
wicked
,
and
of
course
 
"
  
"
Well
,
 
what
follows
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
if
you
have
not
wit
enough
to
see
,
I
do
not
think
it
can
be
my
duty
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
wished
to
caution
you
as
a
friend
that
your
eyes
and
ears
should
be
more
under
your
command
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
go
to
Saulsby
?
"
<EOS>
Violet
said
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
possibly
tell
as
yet
,
"
said
he
,
frowning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
can
tell
you
that
you
ought
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
care
a
bit
for
your
frowns
.
<EOS>
What
does
the
fifth
commandment
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
no
better
arguments
than
the
commandments
,
Violet
 
"
  
"
There
can
be
none
better
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
commandments
are
nothing
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
say
that
I
sha
n't
go
to
Saulsby
because
I
am
told
in
the
twentieth
chapter
of
Exodus
to
honour
my
father
and
mother
,
 
and
that
I
should
n't
believe
anybody
who
told
me
that
he
did
anything
because
of
the
commandments
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lord
Chiltern
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
People
are
so
prejudiced
and
so
used
to
humbug
that
for
the
most
part
they
do
not
in
the
least
know
their
own
motives
for
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
to
Saulsby
to
-
morrow
,
 
for
a
reward
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
what
reward
?
"
said
Violet
,
blushing
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
only
one
in
the
world
that
could
tempt
me
to
do
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
go
for
the
sake
of
duty
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
even
care
to
see
you
go
,
much
as
I
long
for
it
,
if
that
feeling
did
not
take
you
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
arranged
that
Phineas
and
Lord
Chiltern
were
to
leave
Matching
together
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
to
remain
at
his
office
all
October
,
and
in
November
the
general
election
was
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
What
he
had
hitherto
heard
about
a
future
seat
<EOS>
was
most
vague
,
but
he
was
to
meet
Ratler
and
Barrington
Erle
in
London
,
and
it
had
been
understood
that
Barrington
Erle
,
who
was
now
at
Saulsby
,
was
to
make
some
inquiry
as
to
that
group
of
boroughs
of
which
Loughton
at
this
moment
formed
one
.
<EOS>
But
as
Loughton
was
the
smallest
of
four
boroughs
,
and
as
one
of
the
four
had
for
many
years
had
a
representative
of
its
own
,
Phineas
feared
that
no
success
would
be
found
there
.
<EOS>
In
his
present
agony
he
began
to
think
that
there
might
be
a
strong
plea
made
for
a
few
private
seats
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
that
the
propriety
of
throwing
Loughton
into
the
melting
-
pot
was
,
after
all
,
open
to
question
.
<EOS>
He
and
Lord
Chiltern
were
to
return
to
London
together
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
,
according
to
his
present
scheme
,
was
to
proceed
at
once
to
Willingford
to
look
after
the
cub
-
hunting
.
<EOS>
Nothing
that
either
Violet
or
Phineas
could
say
to
him
would
induce
him
to
promise
to
go
to
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
When
Phineas
pressed
it
,
he
was
told
by
Lord
Chiltern
that
he
was
a
fool
for
his
pains
,
 
by
which
Phineas
understood
perfectly
well
that
when
Lord
Chiltern
did
go
to
Saulsby
,
he
,
Phineas
,
was
to
take
that
as
strong
evidence
that
everything
was
over
for
him
as
regarded
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
When
Violet
expressed
her
eagerness
that
the
visit
should
be
made
,
she
was
stopped
with
an
assurance
that
she
could
have
it
done
at
once
if
she
pleased
.
<EOS>
Let
him
only
be
enabled
to
carry
with
him
the
tidings
of
his
betrothal
,
and
he
would
start
for
his
father
's
house
without
an
hour
's
delay
.
<EOS>
But
this
authority
Violet
would
not
give
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
answered
her
after
this
fashion
she
could
only
tell
him
that
he
was
ungenerous
.
"
<EOS>
At
any
rate
I
am
not
false
,
"
he
replied
on
one
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
say
is
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
very
tender
parting
between
Phineas
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
She
had
learned
from
him
pretty
nearly
all
his
history
,
and
certainly
knew
more
of
the
reality
of
his
affairs
than
any
of
those
in
London
who
had
been
his
most
staunch
friends
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'll
get
a
seat
,
"
she
said
as
he
took
his
leave
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
understand
it
at
all
,
they
never
throw
over
an
ally
so
useful
as
you
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
intention
is
that
in
this
matter
nobody
shall
any
longer
have
the
power
of
throwing
over
,
or
of
not
throwing
over
,
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
very
well
,
my
friend
;
but
cakes
will
still
be
hot
in
the
mouth
,
even
though
Mr.
Daubeny
turn
purist
,
with
Mr.
Turnbull
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
any
assistance
in
finding
a
seat
you
will
not
go
to
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
,
 
even
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
to
the
_
People
's
Banner
_
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
quite
understand
what
the
franchise
is
,
"
continued
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
Household
in
boroughs
,
"
said
Phineas
with
some
energy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
 
household
in
boroughs
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
that
is
very
fine
and
very
liberal
,
though
I
do
n't
comprehend
it
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
And
you
want
a
borough
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
go
to
the
households
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
you
will
;
 
not
at
first
,
that
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
shall
I
go
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
to
some
great
patron
of
a
borough
;
 
or
to
a
club
;
 
or
perhaps
to
some
great
firm
.
<EOS>
The
households
will
know
nothing
about
it
till
they
are
told
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
Madame
Max
,
I
do
not
know
where
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
I
am
like
a
child
lost
in
a
wood
.
<EOS>
And
you
may
understand
this
;
 
if
you
do
not
see
me
in
Park
Lane
before
the
end
of
January
,
I
shall
have
perished
in
the
wood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
come
and
find
you
,
 
with
a
troop
of
householders
.
<EOS>
You
will
come
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
there
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
in
death
coming
without
signs
.
<EOS>
You
are
full
of
life
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
she
had
hold
of
his
hand
,
and
there
was
nobody
near
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
a
little
book
-
room
inside
the
library
at
Matching
,
and
the
door
,
though
not
latched
,
was
nearly
closed
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
flattered
himself
that
Madame
Goesler
had
retreated
there
in
order
that
this
farewell
might
be
spoken
without
interruption
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
I
wonder
whether
I
may
say
one
thing
,
"
she
continued
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
anything
to
me
,
"
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
 
not
in
this
country
,
in
this
England
.
<EOS>
There
are
things
one
may
not
say
here
,
 
that
are
tabooed
by
a
sort
of
consent
,
 
and
that
without
any
reason
.
"
<EOS>
She
paused
again
,
and
Phineas
was
at
a
loss
to
think
what
was
the
subject
on
which
she
was
about
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Could
she
mean
 
?
<EOS>
No
;
she
could
not
mean
to
give
him
any
outward
plain
-
spoken
sign
that
she
was
attached
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
peculiar
merit
of
this
man
that
he
was
not
vain
,
though
much
was
done
to
him
to
fill
him
with
vanity
;
and
as
the
idea
crossed
his
brain
,
he
hated
himself
because
it
had
been
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
me
you
may
say
anything
,
Madame
Goesler
,
"
he
said
,
 
"
here
in
England
,
as
plainly
as
though
we
were
in
Vienna
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
not
say
it
in
English
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
Then
in
French
,
blushing
and
laughing
as
she
spoke
,
 
almost
stammering
in
spite
of
her
usual
self
-
confidence
,
 
she
told
him
that
accident
had
made
her
rich
,
full
of
money
.
<EOS>
Money
was
a
drug
with
her
.
<EOS>
Money
she
knew
was
wanted
,
even
for
householders
.
<EOS>
Would
he
not
understand
her
,
and
come
to
her
,
and
learn
from
her
how
faithful
a
woman
could
be
?
  
<EOS>
He
still
was
holding
her
by
the
hand
,
and
he
now
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
offer
from
you
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
as
high
-
minded
,
as
generous
,
and
as
honourable
as
its
acceptance
by
me
<EOS>
would
be
mean
-
spirited
,
vile
,
and
ignoble
.
<EOS>
But
whether
I
fail
or
whether
I
succeed
,
you
shall
see
me
before
the
winter
is
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
Successful
 
Phineas
also
said
a
word
of
farewell
to
Violet
before
he
left
Matching
,
but
there
was
nothing
peculiar
in
her
little
speech
to
him
,
or
in
his
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
we
shall
see
each
other
in
London
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
talk
of
not
being
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
be
in
the
House
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
had
shaken
his
head
and
smiled
.
<EOS>
Where
was
he
to
find
a
requisite
number
of
householders
prepared
to
return
him
?
<EOS>
But
as
he
went
up
to
London
he
told
himself
that
the
air
of
the
House
of
Commons
was
now
the
very
breath
of
his
nostrils
.
<EOS>
Life
to
him
without
it
would
be
no
life
.
<EOS>
To
have
come
within
the
reach
of
the
good
things
of
political
life
,
to
have
made
his
mark
so
as
to
have
almost
insured
future
success
,
to
have
been
the
petted
young
official
aspirant
of
the
day
,
 
and
then
to
sink
down
into
the
miserable
platitudes
of
private
life
,
to
undergo
daily
attendance
in
law
-
courts
without
a
brief
,
to
listen
to
men
who
had
come
to
be
much
below
him
in
estimation
and
social
intercourse
,
to
sit
in
a
wretched
chamber
up
three
pairs
of
stairs
at
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
whereas
he
was
now
at
this
moment
provided
with
a
gorgeous
apartment
looking
out
into
the
Park
from
the
Colonial
Office
in
Downing
Street
,
to
be
attended
by
a
mongrel
between
a
clerk
and
an
errand
boy
at
17s
.
<EOS>
6d
.
<EOS>
a
week
instead
of
by
a
private
secretary
who
was
the
son
of
an
earl
's
sister
,
and
was
petted
by
countesses
'
daughters
innumerable
,
 
all
this
would
surely
break
his
heart
.
<EOS>
He
could
have
done
it
,
so
he
told
himself
,
and
could
have
taken
glory
in
doing
it
,
had
not
these
other
things
come
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
But
the
other
things
had
come
.
<EOS>
He
had
run
the
risk
,
and
had
thrown
the
dice
.
<EOS>
And
now
when
the
game
was
so
nearly
won
,
must
it
be
that
everything
should
be
lost
at
last
?
  
<EOS>
He
knew
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
melancholy
looks
at
his
club
,
or
by
show
of
wretchedness
at
his
office
.
<EOS>
London
was
very
empty
;
but
the
approaching
elections
still
kept
some
there
who
otherwise
would
have
been
looking
after
the
first
flush
of
pheasants
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
was
there
,
and
was
not
long
in
asking
Phineas
what
were
his
views
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
that
is
so
hard
to
say
.
<EOS>
Ratler
told
me
that
he
would
be
looking
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ratler
is
very
well
in
the
House
,
"
said
Barrington
,
"
but
he
is
of
no
use
for
anything
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
were
not
brought
up
at
the
London
University
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
"
said
Phineas
,
remembering
the
glories
of
Trinity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
there
would
have
been
an
opening
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
Stratford
,
 
the
new
Essex
borough
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Broadbury
the
brewer
is
there
already
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
and
ready
to
spend
any
money
you
like
to
name
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
Loughton
is
grouped
with
Smotherem
,
and
Walker
is
a
deal
too
strong
at
Smotherem
to
hear
of
any
other
claim
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
we
could
dare
to
propose
it
.
<EOS>
There
are
the
Chelsea
hamlets
,
but
it
will
take
a
wack
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
got
a
wack
of
money
,
"
said
Phineas
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
devil
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
if
I
were
you
,
I
should
hark
back
upon
some
place
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
you
get
Laurence
to
give
you
up
his
seat
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Fitzgibbon
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
getting
into
office
again
.
<EOS>
Nothing
on
earth
would
induce
him
to
look
at
a
paper
during
all
those
weeks
he
was
at
the
Colonial
Office
;
and
when
Cantrip
spoke
to
him
,
all
he
said
was
,
"
Ah
,
bother
!
"
<EOS>
Cantrip
did
not
like
it
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
that
would
n't
make
him
give
up
his
seat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'd
have
to
arrange
it
.
"
<EOS>
By
which
Phineas
understood
Barrington
Erle
to
mean
that
he
,
Phineas
,
was
in
some
way
to
give
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
some
adequate
compensation
for
the
surrender
of
his
position
as
a
county
member
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
that
's
out
of
the
question
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
were
to
go
,
I
should
not
get
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
have
a
chance
at
Loughshane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
of
trying
it
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
know
that
Morris
is
very
ill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
Mr.
Morris
was
the
brother
of
Lord
Tulla
,
and
was
the
sitting
member
of
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
think
I
should
try
that
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
where
we
're
to
put
our
hands
on
a
seat
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
listened
to
this
,
could
not
help
thinking
that
Barrington
Erle
,
though
he
had
certainly
expressed
a
great
deal
of
solicitude
,
was
not
as
true
a
friend
as
he
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
,
Phineas
,
had
risen
too
fast
,
and
Barrington
Erle
was
beginning
to
think
that
he
might
as
well
be
out
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
He
wrote
to
his
father
,
asking
after
the
borough
,
and
asking
after
the
health
of
Mr.
Morris
.
<EOS>
And
in
his
letter
he
told
his
own
story
very
plainly
,
 
almost
pathetically
.
<EOS>
He
perhaps
had
been
wrong
to
make
the
attempt
which
he
had
made
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
believe
that
he
had
been
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
at
any
rate
he
had
made
it
so
far
successfully
,
and
failure
now
would
be
doubly
bitter
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
the
party
to
which
he
belonged
must
now
remain
in
office
.
<EOS>
It
would
hardly
be
possible
that
a
new
election
would
produce
a
House
of
Commons
favourable
to
a
conservative
ministry
.
<EOS>
And
with
a
liberal
ministry
he
,
Phineas
,
would
be
sure
of
his
place
,
and
sure
of
an
official
income
,
 
if
only
he
could
find
a
seat
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
true
,
and
was
almost
pathetic
.
<EOS>
The
old
doctor
,
who
was
inclined
to
be
proud
of
his
son
,
was
not
unwilling
to
make
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
declared
before
her
daughters
that
if
there
was
a
seat
in
all
Ireland
,
Phineas
ought
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
And
Mary
Flood
Jones
stood
by
listening
,
and
wondering
what
Phineas
would
do
if
he
lost
his
seat
.
<EOS>
Would
he
come
back
and
live
in
County
Clare
,
and
be
like
any
other
girl
's
lover
?
<EOS>
Poor
Mary
had
come
to
lose
her
ambition
,
and
to
think
that
girls
whose
lovers
stayed
at
home
were
the
happiest
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
she
would
have
walked
all
the
way
to
Lord
Tulla
's
house
and
back
again
,
might
that
have
availed
to
get
the
seat
for
Phineas
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
an
express
over
from
Castlemorris
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
wanted
at
once
to
see
Mr.
Morris
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Morris
was
very
bad
with
gout
in
his
stomach
.
<EOS>
According
to
the
messenger
it
was
supposed
that
Mr.
Morris
was
dying
.
<EOS>
Before
Dr.
Finn
had
had
an
opportunity
of
answering
his
son
's
letter
,
Mr.
Morris
,
the
late
member
for
Loughshane
,
had
been
gathered
to
his
fathers
.
  
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
understood
enough
of
elections
for
Parliament
,
and
of
the
nature
of
boroughs
,
to
be
aware
that
a
candidate
's
chance
of
success
is
very
much
improved
by
being
early
in
the
field
;
and
he
was
aware
,
also
,
that
the
death
of
Mr.
Morris
would
probably
create
various
aspirants
for
the
honour
of
representing
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
hardly
address
the
Earl
on
the
subject
while
the
dead
body
of
the
late
member
was
lying
in
the
house
at
Castlemorris
.
<EOS>
The
bill
which
had
passed
in
the
late
session
for
reforming
the
constitution
of
the
House
of
Commons
had
not
touched
Ireland
,
a
future
measure
having
been
promised
to
the
Irish
for
their
comfort
;
and
Loughshane
therefore
was
,
as
to
Lord
Tulla
's
influence
,
the
same
as
it
had
ever
been
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
there
the
plenary
power
which
the
other
lord
had
held
in
his
hands
in
regard
to
Loughton
;
 
but
still
the
Castlemorris
interest
would
go
a
long
way
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
possible
to
stand
against
it
,
but
it
would
be
much
more
desirable
that
the
candidate
should
have
it
at
his
back
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
was
fully
alive
to
this
as
he
sat
opposite
to
the
old
lord
,
saying
now
a
word
about
the
old
lord
's
gout
in
his
legs
and
arms
,
and
then
about
the
gout
in
the
stomach
,
which
had
carried
away
to
another
world
the
lamented
late
member
for
the
borough
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Jack
!
"
said
Lord
Tulla
,
piteously
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
'd
known
it
,
I
need
n't
have
paid
over
two
thousand
pounds
for
him
last
year
;
 
need
I
,
doctor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
said
Dr.
Finn
,
feeling
that
his
patient
might
perhaps
approach
the
subject
of
the
borough
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
would
live
by
any
rule
,
you
know
,
"
said
the
desolate
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
hard
to
guide
;
 
was
he
not
,
my
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
devil
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
see
,
I
do
do
what
I
'm
told
pretty
well
,
 
<EOS>
do
n't
I
,
doctor
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sometimes
.
"
  
"
By
George
,
I
do
nearly
always
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
sometimes
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
drinking
brandy
-
and
-
water
till
I
'm
sick
of
it
,
to
oblige
you
,
and
you
tell
me
about
 
sometimes
.
<EOS>
You
doctors
expect
a
man
to
be
a
slave
.
<EOS>
Have
n't
I
kept
it
out
of
my
stomach
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
God
,
yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
well
thanking
God
,
but
I
should
have
gone
as
poor
<EOS>
Jack
has
gone
,
if
I
had
n't
been
the
most
careful
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
was
drinking
champagne
ten
days
ago
;
 
would
do
it
,
you
know
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Tulla
could
talk
about
himself
and
his
own
ailments
by
the
hour
together
,
and
Dr.
Finn
,
who
had
thought
that
his
noble
patient
was
approaching
the
subject
of
the
borough
,
was
beginning
again
to
feel
that
the
double
interest
of
the
gout
that
was
present
,
and
the
gout
that
had
passed
away
,
would
be
too
absorbing
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
could
say
but
little
to
direct
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Morris
,
you
see
,
lived
more
in
London
than
you
do
,
and
was
subject
to
temptation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
call
temptation
.
<EOS>
Have
n't
I
the
temptation
of
a
bottle
of
wine
under
my
nose
every
day
of
my
life
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
n't
drink
it
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
ever
take
above
a
glass
or
two
of
brown
sherry
.
<EOS>
By
George
!
<EOS>
when
I
think
of
it
,
I
wonder
at
my
own
courage
.
<EOS>
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
a
man
in
London
,
my
lord
 
"
  
"
Why
the
deuce
would
he
go
to
London
?
<EOS>
By
-
the

bye
<EOS>
,
what
am
I
to
do
about
the
borough
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
my
son
stand
for
it
,
if
you
will
,
my
lord

<EOS>
"
They
've
clean
swept
away
Brentford
's
seat
at
Loughton
,
have
n't
they
?
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
What
a
nice
game
for
him
,
 
to
have
been
forced
to
help
to
do
it
himself
!
<EOS>
There
's
nobody
on
earth
<EOS>
I
pity
so
much
as
a
radical
peer
who
is
obliged
to
work
like
a
nigger
with
a
spade
to
shovel
away
the
ground
from
under
his
own
feet
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
do
n't
care
who
sits
for
Loughshane
.
<EOS>
I
did
care
for
poor
Jack
while
he
was
alive
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
interfere
any
longer
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
it
lasted
Jack
's
time
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Tulla
had
probably
already
forgotten
that
he
himself
had
thrown
Jack
over
for
the
last
session
but
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
my
lord
,
"
began
the
father
,
"
is
now
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
've
no
doubt
he
's
a
very
fine
fellow
;
 
but
you
see
,
he
's
an
out

and
-
out
Radical
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lord

"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
how
can
he
serve
with
such
men
as
Mr.
Gresham
and
Mr.
Monk
?
<EOS>
They
've
turned
out
poor
old
Mildmay
among
them
,
because
he
's
not
fast
enough
for
them
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
anxiety
,
of
course
,
is
for
my
boy
's
prospects
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
have
done
so
well
in
Parliament
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
he
stand
for
Marylebone
or
Finsbury
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
money
,
you
know
,
my
lord
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
interfere
here
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
If
he
comes
,
and
the
people
then
choose
to
return
him
,
I
shall
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
may
do
just
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
Lambert
St.
George
,
of
Mockrath
,
is
going
to
stand
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
,
it
's
the
d---
piece
of
impudence
I
ever
heard
of
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
tenant
of
my
own
,
though
he
has
a
lease
for
ever
;
and
his
father
never
owned
an
acre
of
land
in
the
county
till
his
uncle
died
.
<EOS>
"
Then
the
doctor
knew
that
,
with
a
little
management
,
the
lord
's
interest
might
be
secured
for
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
came
over
and
stood
for
the
borough
against
Mr.
Lambert
St.
George
,
and
the
contest
was
sharp
enough
.
<EOS>
The
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
could
not
understand
why
such
a
man
as
Lord
Tulla
should
admit
a
liberal
candidate
to
succeed
his
brother
.
<EOS>
No
one
canvassed
for
the
young
Under
-
Secretary
with
more
persistent
zeal
than
did
his
father
,
who
,
when
Phineas
first
spoke
of
going
into
Parliament
,
had
produced
so
many
good
arguments
against
that
perilous
step
.
<EOS>
Lord
Tulla
's
agent
stood
aloof
,
 
desolate
with
grief
at
the
death
of
the
late
member
.
<EOS>
At
such
a
moment
of
family
affliction
,
Lord
Tulla
,
he
declared
,
could
not
think
of
such
a
matter
as
the
borough
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
known
that
Lord
Tulla
was
dreadfully
jealous
of
Mr.
Lambert
St.
George
,
whose
property
in
that
part
of
the
county
was
now
nearly
equal
to
his
own
,
and
who
saw
much
more
company
at
Mockrath
than
was
ever
entertained
at
Castlemorris
.
<EOS>
A
word
from
Lord
Tulla
,
 
so
said
the
Conservatives
of
the
county
,
 
would
have
put
Mr.
St.
George
into
the
seat
;
but
that
word
was
not
spoken
,
and
the
Conservatives
of
the
neighbourhood
swore
that
Lord
Tulla
was
a
renegade
.
<EOS>
The
contest
was
very
sharp
,
but
our
hero
was
returned
by
a
majority
of
seventeen
votes
.
  
<EOS>
Again
successful
!
<EOS>
As
he
thought
of
it
he
remembered
stories
of
great
generals
who
were
said
to
have
chained
Fortune
to
the
wheels
of
their
chariots
,
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
goddess
had
never
served
any
general
with
such
staunch
obedience
as
she
had
displayed
in
his
cause
.
<EOS>
Had
not
everything
gone
well
with
him
;
 
so
well
,
as
almost
to
justify
him
in
expecting
that
even
yet
Violet
Effingham
would
become
his
wife
?
<EOS>
Dear
,
dearest
Violet
!
<EOS>
If
he
could
only
achieve
that
,
no
general
,
who
ever
led
an
army
across
the
Alps
,
would
be
his
equal
either
in
success
or
in
the
reward
of
success
.
<EOS>
Then
he
questioned
himself
as
to
what
he
would
say
to
Miss
Flood
Jones
on
that
very
night
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
meet
dear
little
Mary
Flood
Jones
that
evening
at
a
neighbour
's
house
.
<EOS>
His
sister
Barbara
had
so
told
him
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
he
quite
understood
to
imply
a
caution
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
so
glad
to
see
her
,
"
Phineas
had
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
ever
was
an
angel
on
earth
,
it
is
Mary
,
"
said
Barbara
Finn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
she
is
as
good
as
gold
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gold
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Barbara
,
 
"
gold
indeed
!
<EOS>
She
is
more
precious
than
refined
gold
.
<EOS>
But
,
Phineas
,
perhaps
you
had
better
not
single
her
out
for
any
special
attention
.
<EOS>
She
has
thought
it
wisest
to
meet
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
,
Phineas
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
Men
of
course
are
different
from
girls
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
Barbara
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
laugh
at
me
,
Phineas
,
when
I
am
thinking
of
nothing
but
of
you
and
your
interests
,
and
when
I
am
making
all
manner
of
excuses
for
you
because
I
know
what
must
be
the
distractions
of
the
world
in
which
you
live
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Barbara
made
more
than
one
attempt
to
renew
the
conversation
before
the
evening
came
,
but
Phineas
thought
that
he
had
had
enough
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
like
being
told
that
excuses
were
made
for
him
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
what
had
he
done
?
<EOS>
He
had
once
kissed
Mary
Flood
Jones
behind
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
,
Mary
,
"
he
said
,
coming
and
taking
a
chair
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
specially
warned
not
to
single
Mary
out
for
his
attention
,
and
yet
there
was
the
chair
left
vacant
as
though
it
were
expected
that
he
would
fall
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
We
did
not
happen
to
meet
last
year
,
did
we
,
 
Mr.
Finn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
call
me
Mr.
Finn
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
such
a
great
man
now
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
at
all
a
great
man
.
<EOS>
If
you
only
knew
what
little
men
we
understrappers
are
in
London
you
would
hardly
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
something
 
of
State
now
;
 
are
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
yes
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
name
they
give
me
.
<EOS>
It
simply
means
that
if
any
member
wants
to
badger
some
one
in
the
House
about
the
Colonies
,
I
am
the
man
to
be
badgered
.
<EOS>
But
if
there
is
any
credit
to
be
had
,
I
am
not
the
man
who
is
to
have
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
a
great
thing
to
be
in
Parliament
and
in
the
Government
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
great
thing
for
me
,
Mary
,
to
have
a
salary
,
though
it
may
only
be
for
a
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
not
deny
that
it
is
pleasant
to
have
been
successful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
very
pleasant
to
us
,
Phineas
.
<EOS>
Mamma
has
been
so
much
rejoiced
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
sorry
not
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
at
Floodborough
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
 
she
is
at
home
.
<EOS>
She
does
not
like
coming
out
at
night
in
winter
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
staying
here
you
know
for
two
days
,
but
I
go
home
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
ride
over
and
call
on
your
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
a
pause
in
the
conversation
for
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
Does
it
not
seem
odd
,
Mary
,
that
we
should
see
so
little
of
each
other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
so
much
away
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
that
is
the
reason
.
<EOS>
But
still
it
seems
almost
unnatural
.
<EOS>
I
often
wonder
when
the
time
will
come
that
I
shall
be
quietly
at
home
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
to
be
back
in
my
office
in
London
this
day
week
,
and
yet
I
have
not
had
a
single
hour
to
myself
since
I
have
been
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
certainly
ride
over
and
see
your
mother
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
at
home
on
Wednesday
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
I
shall
be
at
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
that
he
got
up
and
went
away
,
but
again
in
the
evening
he
found
himself
near
her
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
is
no
position
more
perilous
to
a
man
's
honesty
than
that
in
which
Phineas
now
found
himself
;
 
that
,
namely
,
of
knowing
himself
to
be
quite
loved
by
a
girl
whom
he
almost
loves
himself
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
loved
Violet
Effingham
;
and
they
who
talk
best
of
love
protest
that
no
man
or
woman
can
be
in
love
with
two
persons
at
once
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
not
in
love
with
Mary
Flood
Jones
;
but
he
would
have
liked
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
;
 
he
would
have
liked
to
gratify
her
by
swearing
that
she
was
dearer
to
him
than
all
the
world
;
he
would
have
liked
to
have
an
episode
,
 
and
did
,
at
the
moment
,
think
that
it
might
be
possible
to
have
one
life
in
London
and
another
life
altogether
different
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Mary
,
"
he
said
as
he
pressed
her
hand
that
night
,
"
things
will
get
themselves
settled
at
last
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
He
was
behaving
very
ill
to
her
,
but
he
did
not
mean
to
behave
ill
.
  
<EOS>
He
rode
over
to
Floodborough
,
and
saw
Mrs.

Mrs.
Flood
Jones
,
however
,
received
him
very
coldly
;
and
Mary
did
not
appear
.
<EOS>
Mary
had
communicated
to
her
mother
her
resolutions
as
to
her
future
life

<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
mamma
,
I
love
him

I
can
not

it

If
he
ever
chooses

come
for

here
I

I
will
bear
it

it

Troubles
at
Loughlinter
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
dull
house
at
Loughlinter
during
the
greater
part
of
this
autumn
.
<EOS>
A
few
men
went
down
for
the
grouse
shooting
late
in
the
season
;
but
they
stayed
but
a
short
time
,
and
when
they
went
Lady
Laura
was
left
alone
with
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
had
explained
to
his
wife
,
more
than
once
,
that
though
he
understood
the
duties
of
hospitality
and
enjoyed
the
performance
of
them
,
he
had
not
married
with
the
intention
of
living
in
a
whirlwind
.
<EOS>
He
was
disposed
to
think
that
the
whirlwind
had
hitherto
been
too
predominant
,
and
had
said
so
very
plainly
with
a
good
deal
of
marital
authority
.
<EOS>
This
autumn
and
winter
were
to
be
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
proper
relations
between
him
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
Does
that
mean
Darby
and
Joan
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
his
wife
had
asked
him
,
when
the
proposition
was
made
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
It
means
mutual
regard
and
esteem
,
"
replied
Mr.
Kennedy
in
his
most
solemn
tone
,
"
and
I
trust
that
such
mutual
regard
and
esteem
between
us
may
yet
be
possible
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
Lady
Laura
showed
him
a
letter
from
her
brother
,
received
some
weeks
after
this
conversation
,
in
which
Lord
Chiltern
expressed
his
intention
of
coming
to
Loughlinter
for
Christmas
,
he
returned
the
note
to
his
wife
without
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
suspected
that
she
had
made
the
arrangement
without
asking
him
,
and
was
angry
;
but
he
would
not
tell
her
that
her
brother
would
not
be
welcome
at
his
house
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
my
doing
,
"
she
said
,
when
she
saw
the
frown
on
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
nothing
about
anybody
's
doing
,
"
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
Oswald
and
bid
him
not
come
,
if
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
can
understand
why
he
is
coming
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
to
see
me
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
me
,
"
replied
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
coming
because
my
friend
Violet
Effingham
will
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Effingham
!
<EOS>
Why
was
I
not
told
of
this
?
<EOS>
I
knew
nothing
of
Miss
Effingham
's
coming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Robert
,
it
was
settled
in
your
own
presence
last
July
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
deny
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Laura
rose
up
,
very
haughty
in
her
gait
and
with
something
of
fire
in
her
eye
,
and
silently
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
,
when
he
found
himself
alone
,
was
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Looking
back
in
his
mind
to
the
summer
weeks
in
London
,
he
remembered
that
his
wife
had
told
Violet
that
she
was
to
spend
her
Christmas
at
Loughlinter
,
that
he
himself
had
given
a
muttered
assent
and
that
Violet
,
 
as
far
as
he
could
remember
,
 
had
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
one
of
those
things
which
are
so
often
mentioned
,
but
not
settled
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
had
been
strictly
right
in
denying
that
it
had
been
"
settled
"
in
his
presence
;
 
but
yet
he
felt
that
he
had
been
wrong
in
contradicting
his
wife
so
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
just
man
,
and
he
would
apologise
for
his
fault
;
but
he
was
an
austere
man
,
and
would
take
back
the
value
of
his
apology
in
additional
austerity
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
see
his
wife
for
some
hours
after
the
conversation
which
has
been
narrated
,
but
when
he
did
meet
her
his
mind
was
still
full
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
Laura
"
,
he
said
,
"
I
am
sorry
that
I
contradicted
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
used
to
it
,
Robert
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
you
are
not
used
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
She
smiled
and
bowed
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
wrong
me
by
saying
that
you
are
used
to
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
paused
a
moment
,
but
she
said
not
a
word
,
 
only
smiled
and
bowed
her
head
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
,
"
he
continued
,
"
that
something
was
said
in
my
presence
to
Miss
Effingham
about
her
coming
here
at
Christmas
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
slight
,
however
,
that
it
had
passed
out
of
my
memory
till
recalled
by
an
effort
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
is
unnecessary
,
Robert
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
wish
that
I
should
put
her
off
,
 
or
put
Oswald
off
,
 
or
both
?
<EOS>
My
brother
never
yet
has
seen
me
in
your
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
whose
fault
has
that
been
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
nothing
about
anybody
's
fault
,
Robert
.
<EOS>
I
merely
mentioned
a
fact
.
<EOS>
Will
you
let
me
know
whether
I
shall
bid
him
stay
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
welcome
to
come
,
 
only
I
do
not
like
assignations
for
love
-
making
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Assignations
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Clandestine
meetings
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
would
not
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Baldock
!
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
Violet
would
exercise
any
secrecy
in
the
matter
,
 
or
that
she
will
not
tell
Lady
Baldock
that
Oswald
will
be
here
,
 
as
soon
as
she
knows
it
herself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
Robert
,
it
must
have
much
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
And
why
should
not
these
two
young
people
meet
?
<EOS>
The
acknowledged
wish
of
all
the
family
is
that
they
should
marry
each
other
.
<EOS>
And
in
this
matter
,
at
any
rate
,
my
brother
has
behaved
extremely
well
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
said
nothing
further
at
the
time
,
and
it
became
an
understanding
that
Violet
Effingham
was
to
be
a
month
at
Loughlinter
,
staying
from
the
20th
of
December
to
the
20th
of
January
,
and
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
to
come
there
for
Christmas
,
 
which
with
him
would
probably
mean
three
days
.
  
<EOS>
Before
Christmas
came
,
however
,
there
were
various
other
sources
of
uneasiness
at
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
great
anxiety
as
to
the
elections
.
<EOS>
With
Lady
Laura
this
anxiety
had
been
very
strong
,
and
even
Mr.
Kennedy
had
been
warmed
with
some
amount
of
fire
as
the
announcements
reached
him
of
the
successes
and
of
the
failures
.
<EOS>
The
English
returns
came
first
,
 
and
then
the
Scotch
,
which
were
quite
as
interesting
to
Mr.
Kennedy
as
the
English
.
<EOS>
His
own
seat
was
quite
safe
,
 
was
not
contested
;
but
some
neighbouring
seats
were
sources
of
great
solicitude
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
this
was
over
,
there
were
the
tidings
from
Ireland
to
be
received
;
and
respecting
one
special
borough
in
Ireland
,
Lady
Laura
evinced
more
solicitude
than
her
husband
approved
.
<EOS>
There
was
much
danger
for
the
domestic
bliss
of
the
house
of
Loughlinter
,
when
things
came
to
such
a
pass
,
and
such
words
were
spoken
,
as
the
election
at
Loughshane
produced
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
in
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
opening
a
telegram
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
in
?
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
with
that
frown
on
his
brow
to
which
his
wife
was
now
well
accustomed
.
<EOS>
Though
he
asked
the
question
,
he
knew
very
well
who
was
the
hero
to
whom
the
telegram
referred
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friend
Phineas
Finn
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
speaking
still
with
an
excited
voice
,
 
with
a
voice
that
was
intended
to
display
excitement
.
<EOS>
If
there
was
to
be
a
battle
on
this
matter
,
there
should
be
a
battle
.
<EOS>
She
would
display
all
her
anxiety
for
her
young
friend
,
and
fling
it
in
her
husband
's
face
if
he
chose
to
take
it
as
an
injury
.
<EOS>
What
,
 
should
she
endure
reproach
from
her
husband
because
she
regarded
the
interests
of
the
man
who
had
saved
his
life
,
of
the
man
respecting
whom
she
had
suffered
so
many
heart
-
struggles
,
and
as
to
whom
she
had
at
last
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
should
ever
be
regarded
as
a
second
brother
,
loved
equally
with
the
elder
brother
?
<EOS>
She
had
done
her
duty
by
her
husband
,
 
so
at
least
she
had
assured
herself
;
 
and
should
he
dare
to
reproach
her
on
this
subject
,
she
would
be
ready
for
the
battle
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
battle
came
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
this
,
"
she
said
,
with
all
the
eagerness
she
could
throw
into
her
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
indeed
,
 
and
so
ought
you
to
be
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
husband
's
brow
grew
blacker
and
blacker
,
but
still
he
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
had
long
been
too
proud
to
be
jealous
,
and
was
now
too
proud
to
express
his
jealousy
,
 
if
only
he
could
keep
the
expression
back
.
<EOS>
But
his
wife
would
not
leave
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
thankful
for
this
,
"
she
said
,
pressing
the
telegram
between
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
so
afraid
he
would
fail
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
over
-
do
your
anxiety
on
such
a
subject
,
"
at
last
he
said
,
speaking
very
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Robert
?
<EOS>
How
can
I
be
over
-
anxious
?
<EOS>
If
it
concerned
any
other
dear
friend
that
I
have
in
the
world
,
it
would
not
be
an
affair
of
life
and
death
.
<EOS>
To
him
it
is
almost
so
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
walked
from
here
to
London
to
get
him
his
election
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
she
spoke
she
held
up
the
clenched
fist
of
her
left
hand
,
and
shook
it
,
while
she
still
held
the
telegram
in
her
right
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
I
must
tell
you
that
it
is
improper
that
you
should
speak
of
any
man
in
those
terms
;
 
of
any
man
that
is
a
stranger
to
your
blood
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
stranger
to
my
blood
!
<EOS>
What
has
that
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
This
man
is
my
friend
,
is
your
friend
;
 
saved
your
life
,
has
been
my
brother
's
best
friend
,
is
loved
by
my
father
,
 
and
is
loved
by
me
,
very
dearly
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
what
you
mean
by
improper
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
you
love
any
man
,
 
very
dearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Robert
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
that
I
will
have
no
such
expressions
from
you
.
<EOS>
They
are
unseemly
,
and
are
used
only
to
provoke
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
understand
that
I
am
insulted
by
an
accusation
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
let
me
beg
at
once
that
I
may
be
allowed
to
go
to
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
accept
your
apology
and
retractation
there
than
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
go
to
Saulsby
,
and
there
has
been
no
accusation
,
and
there
will
be
no
apology
.
<EOS>
If
you
please
there
will
be
no
more
mention
of
Mr.
Finn
's
name
between
us
,
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
cease
to
think
of
him
extravagantly
;
 
and
I
must
desire
you
to
hold
no
further
direct
communication
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
held
no
communication
with
him
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
advancing
a
step
towards
him
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Kennedy
simply
pointed
to
the
telegram
in
her
hand
,
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Now
in
respect
to
this
telegram
there
had
been
an
unfortunate
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
prepared
to
say
that
there
was
any
reason
why
Phineas
himself
should
not
have
sent
the
news
of
his
success
to
Lady
Laura
;
but
he
had
not
done
so
.
<EOS>
The
piece
of
paper
which
she
still
held
crushed
in
her
hand
was
in
itself
very
innocent
.
"
<EOS>
Hurrah
for
the
Loughshanes
.
<EOS>
Finny
has
done
the
trick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
were
the
words
written
on
the
slip
,
and
they
had
been
sent
to
Lady
Laura
by
her
young
cousin
,
the
clerk
in
the
office
who
acted
as
private
secretary
to
the
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
resolved
that
her
husband
should
never
see
those
innocent
but
rather
undignified
words
.
<EOS>
The
occasion
had
become
one
of
importance
,
and
such
words
were
unworthy
of
it
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
would
not
condescend
to
defend
herself
by
bringing
forward
a
telegram
as
evidence
in
her
favour
.
<EOS>
So
she
burned
the
morsel
of
paper
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
and
Mr.
Kennedy
did
not
meet
again
till
late
that
evening
.
<EOS>
She
was
ill
,
she
said
,
and
would
not
come
down
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
After
dinner
she
wrote
him
a
note
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Robert
,
I
think
you
must
regret
what
you
said
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
pray
let
me
have
a
line
from
you
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
Yours
affectionately
,
L.
"
When
the
servant
handed
it
to
him
,
and
<EOS>
he
had
read
it
,
he
smiled
and
thanked
the
girl
who
had
brought
it
,
and
said
he
would
see
her
mistress
just
now
.
<EOS>
Anything
would
be
better
than
that
the
servants
should
know
that
there
was
a
quarrel
.
<EOS>
But
every
servant
in
the
house
had
known
all
about
it
for
the
last
three
hours
.
<EOS>
When
the
door
was
closed
and
he
was
alone
,
he
sat
fingering
the
note
,
thinking
deeply
how
he
should
answer
it
,
or
whether
he
would
answer
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
No
;
he
would
not
answer
it
;
 
not
in
writing
.
<EOS>
He
would
give
his
wife
no
written
record
of
his
humiliation
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
acted
wrongly
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
nothing
more
than
now
,
upon
mature
consideration
,
he
thought
that
the
circumstances
demanded
.
<EOS>
But
yet
he
felt
that
he
must
in
some
sort
withdraw
the
accusation
which
he
had
made
.
<EOS>
If
he
did
not
withdraw
it
,
there
was
no
knowing
what
his
wife
might
do
.
<EOS>
About
ten
in
the
evening
he
went
up
to
her
and
made
his
little
speech
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
have
come
to
answer
your
note
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
have
written
to
me
a
line
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
instead
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
you
will
listen
to
me
for
one
moment
,
I
think
everything
will
be
made
smooth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
will
listen
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
knowing
very
well
that
her
husband
's
moment
would
be
rather
tedious
,
and
resolving
that
she
also
would
have
her
moment
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
will
acknowledge
that
if
there
be
a
difference
of
opinion
between
you
and
me
as
to
any
question
of
social
intercourse
,
it
will
be
better
that
you
should
consent
to
adopt
my
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
law
on
your
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
speaking
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
go
on
,
Robert
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
interrupt
you
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
speaking
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
am
speaking
simply
of
convenience
,
and
of
that
which
you
must
feel
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
If
I
wish
that
your
intercourse
with
any
person
should
be
of
such
or
such
a
nature
it
must
be
best
that
you
should
comply
with
my
wishes
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
for
her
assent
,
but
she
neither
assented
nor
dissented
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
can
understand
the
position
of
a
man
and
wife
in
this
country
,
there
is
no
other
way
in
which
life
can
be
made
harmonious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Life
will
not
run
in
harmonies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
expect
that
ours
shall
be
made
to
do
so
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
I
need
hardly
say
to
you
that
I
intend
to
accuse
you
of
no
impropriety
of
feeling
in
reference
to
this
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Robert
;
you
need
hardly
say
that
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
to
speak
my
own
mind
,
I
think
that
you
need
hardly
have
alluded
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
might
go
further
,
and
say
that
such
an
allusion
is
in
itself
an
insult
,
 
an
insult
now
repeated
after
hours
of
deliberation
,
 
an
insult
which
I
will
not
endure
to
have
repeated
again
.
<EOS>
If
you
say
another
word
in
any
way
suggesting
the
possibility
of
improper
relations
between
me
and
Mr.
Finn
,
either
as
to
deeds
or
thoughts
,
as
God
is
above
me
,
I
will
write
to
both
my
father
and
my
brother
,
and
desire
them
to
take
me
from
your
house
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
me
to
remain
here
,
you
had
better
be
careful
!
"
<EOS>
As
she
was
making
this
speech
,
her
temper
seemed
to
rise
,
and
to
become
hot
,
and
then
hotter
,
till
it
glowed
with
a
red
heat
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
cool
till
the
word
insult
,
used
by
herself
,
had
conveyed
back
to
her
a
strong
impression
of
her
own
wrong
,
 
or
<EOS>
perhaps
I
should
rather
say
a
strong
feeling
of
the
necessity
of
becoming
indignant
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
as
she
spoke
,
and
the
fire
flashed
from
her
eyes
,
and
he
quailed
before
her
.
<EOS>
The
threat
which
she
had
held
out
to
him
was
very
dreadful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
terribly
in
fear
of
the
world
's
good
opinion
,
who
lacked
the
courage
to
go
through
a
great
and
harassing
trial
in
order
that
something
better
might
come
afterwards
.
<EOS>
His
married
life
had
been
unhappy
.
<EOS>
His
wife
had
not
submitted
either
to
his
will
or
to
his
ways
.
<EOS>
He
had
that
great
desire
to
enjoy
his
full
rights
,
so
strong
in
the
minds
of
weak
,
ambitious
men
,
and
he
had
told
himself
that
a
wife
's
obedience
was
one
of
those
rights
which
he
could
not
abandon
without
injury
to
his
self
-
esteem
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
about
the
matter
,
slowly
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
,
and
had
resolved
that
he
would
assert
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
asserted
himself
,
and
his
wife
told
him
to
his
face
that
she
would
go
away
and
leave
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
detain
her
legally
,
but
he
could
not
do
even
that
without
the
fact
of
such
forcible
detention
being
known
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
answer
her
now
at
this
moment
,
so
that
she
might
not
write
to
her
father
,
and
so
that
his
self
-
assertion
might
still
be
maintained
?
  
<EOS>
"
Passion
,
Laura
,
can
never
be
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
you
have
a
woman
submit
to
insult
without
passion
?
<EOS>
I
at
any
rate
am
not
such
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
a
pause
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
nothing
else
to
say
to
me
,
you
had
better
leave
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
far
from
well
,
and
my
head
is
throbbing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
came
up
and
took
her
hand
,
but
she
snatched
it
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
"
he
said
,
"
do
not
let
us
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
shall
quarrel
if
such
insinuations
are
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
made
no
insinuation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
repeat
them
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
cowed
and
left
her
,
having
first
attempted
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
of
his
position
by
making
much
of
her
alleged
illness
,
and
by
offering
to
send
for
Dr.
Macnuthrie
.
<EOS>
She
positively
refused
to
see
Dr.
Macnuthrie
,
and
at
last
succeeded
in
inducing
him
to
quit
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
This
had
occurred
about
the
end
of
November
,
and
on
the
20th
of
December
Violet
Effingham
reached
Loughlinter
.
<EOS>
Life
in
Mr.
Kennedy
's
house
had
gone
quietly
during
the
intervening
three
weeks
,
but
not
very
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
Phineas
Finn
had
not
been
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
triumphed
;
but
she
had
no
desire
to
acerbate
her
husband
by
any
unpalatable
allusion
to
her
victory
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
quite
willing
to
let
the
subject
die
away
,
if
only
it
would
die
.
<EOS>
On
some
other
matters
he
continued
to
assert
himself
,
taking
his
wife
to
church
twice
every
Sunday
,
using
longer
family
prayers
than
she
approved
,
reading
an
additional
sermon
himself
every
Sunday
evening
,
calling
upon
her
for
weekly
attention
to
elaborate
household
accounts
,
asking
for
her
personal
assistance
in
much
local
visiting
,
initiating
her
into
his
favourite
methods
of
family
life
in
the
country
,
till
sometimes
she
almost
longed
to
talk
again
about
Phineas
Finn
,
so
that
there
might
be
a
rupture
,
and
she
might
escape
.
<EOS>
But
her
husband
asserted
himself
within
bounds
,
and
she
submitted
,
longing
for
the
coming
of
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
write
to
her
father
and
beg
to
be
taken
away
,
because
her
husband
would
read
a
sermon
to
her
on
Sunday
evening
.
  
<EOS>
To
Violet
,
very
shortly
after
her
arrival
,
she
told
her
whole
story
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
terrible
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
makes
me
feel
that
I
never
will
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
what
can
a
woman
become
if
she
remain
single
?
<EOS>
The
curse
is
to
be
a
woman
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
felt
so
proud
of
the
privileges
of
my
sex
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
have
found
them
,
"
said
the
other
;
"
never
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
make
the
best
of
its
weaknesses
,
and
this
is
what
I
have
come
to
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
ought
to
have
loved
some
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
you
never
love
any
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
never
did
,
 
not
as
people
mean
when
they
speak
of
love
.
<EOS>
I
have
felt
that
I
would
consent
to
be
cut
in
little
pieces
for
my
brother
,
 
because
of
my
regard
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
that
is
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
felt
something
of
the
same
thing
for
another
,
 
a
longing
for
his
welfare
,
a
delight
to
hear
him
praised
,
a
charm
in
his
presence
,
 
so
strong
a
feeling
for
his
interest
<EOS>
,
that
were
he
to
go
to
wrack
and
ruin
,
<EOS>
I
too
,
should
,
after
a
fashion
,
be
wracked
and
ruined
.
<EOS>
But
it
has
not
been
love
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
know
whom
you
mean
?
<EOS>
May
I
name
him
?
<EOS>
It
is
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
he
ever
ask
you
,
 
to
love
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feared
he
would
do
so
,
and
therefore
accepted
Mr.
Kennedy
's
offer
almost
at
the
first
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
quite
understand
your
reasoning
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
refused
him
nothing
in
my
power
to
give
him
,
but
I
did
not
wish
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
never
asked
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
paused
a
moment
,
thinking
what
reply
she
should
make
;
 
and
then
she
told
a
fib
.
"
<EOS>
No
;
he
never
asked
me
.
"
<EOS>
But
Violet
did
not
believe
the
fib
.
<EOS>
Violet
was
quite
sure
that
Phineas
had
asked
Lady
Laura
Standish
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
can
see
,
"
said
Violet
,
"
Madame
Max
Goesler
is
his
present
passion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
believe
it
in
the
least
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
firing
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
much
matter
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
matter
very
much
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
you
,
 
you
;
you
know
whom
he
loves
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
believe
that
sooner
or
later
you
will
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
.
"
  
"
Yes
,
you
will
.
<EOS>
Had
you
not
loved
him
you
would
never
have
condescended
to
accuse
him
about
that
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
accused
him
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
not
marry
Madame
Max
Goesler
?
<EOS>
It
would
be
just
the
thing
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
you
are
the
most
capricious
of
women
.
<EOS>
You
have
two
dear
friends
,
and
you
insist
that
I
shall
marry
them
both
.
<EOS>
Which
shall
I
take
first
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
will
be
here
in
a
day
or
two
,
and
you
can
take
him
if
you
like
it
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
he
will
ask
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
think
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
do
not
think
I
shall
.
<EOS>
I
shall
knock
under
to
Mr.
Mill
,
and
go
in
for
women
's
rights
,
and
look
forward
to
stand
for
some
female
borough
.
<EOS>
Matrimony
never
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
charming
,
and
upon
my
word
it
does
not
become
more
alluring
by
what
I
find
at
Loughlinter
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
thus
that
Violet
and
Lady
Laura
discussed
these
matters
together
,
but
Violet
had
never
showed
to
her
friend
the
cards
in
her
hand
,
as
Lady
Laura
had
shown
those
which
she
held
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
in
fact
told
almost
everything
that
there
was
to
tell
,
 
had
spoken
either
plainly
with
true
words
,
or
equally
plainly
with
words
that
were
not
true
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
had
almost
come
to
love
Phineas
Finn
;
 
<EOS>
but
she
never
told
her
friend
that
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
she
had
almost
made
up
her
mind
to
give
herself
and
all
her
wealth
to
this
adventurer
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
better
man
,
she
thought
,
than
Lord
Chiltern
;
and
she
had
come
to
persuade
herself
that
it
was
almost
imperative
on
her
to
take
the
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
Though
she
could
talk
about
remaining
unmarried
,
she
knew
that
that
was
practically
impossible
.
<EOS>
All
those
around
her
,
 
those
of
the
Baldock
as
well
as
those
of
the
Brentford
faction
,
 
would
make
such
a
life
impossible
to
her
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
in
such
a
case
what
could
she
do
?
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
to
talk
of
disregarding
the
world
and
of
setting
up
a
house
for
herself
;
 
but
she
was
quite
aware
that
that
project
could
not
be
used
further
than
for
the
purpose
of
scaring
her
amiable
aunt
.
<EOS>
And
if
not
that
,
 
then
could
she
content
herself
to
look
forward
to
a
joint
life
with
Lady
Baldock
and
Augusta
Boreham
?
<EOS>
She
might
,
of
course
,
oblige
her
aunt
by
taking
Lord
Fawn
,
or
oblige
her
aunt
equally
by
taking
Mr.
Appledom
;
but
she
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
either
Lord
Chiltern
or
Phineas
would
be
preferable
to
these
.
<EOS>
Thinking
over
it
always
she
had
come
to
feel
that
it
must
be
either
Lord
Chiltern
or
Phineas
;
but
she
had
never
whispered
her
thought
to
man
or
woman
.
<EOS>
On
her
journey
to
Loughlinter
,
where
she
then
knew
that
she
was
to
meet
Lord
Chiltern
,
she
endeavoured
to
persuade
herself
that
it
should
be
Phineas
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Laura
had
marred
it
all
by
that
ill
-
told
fib
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
moment
before
in
which
Violet
had
felt
that
Phineas
had
sacrificed
something
of
that
truth
of
love
for
which
she
gave
him
credit
to
the
glances
of
Madame
Goesler
's
eyes
;
but
she
had
rebuked
herself
for
the
idea
,
accusing
herself
not
only
of
a
little
jealousy
,
but
of
foolish
vanity
.
<EOS>
Was
he
,
whom
she
had
rejected
,
not
to
speak
to
another
woman
?
<EOS>
Then
came
the
blow
from
Lady
Laura
,
and
Violet
knew
that
it
was
a
blow
.
<EOS>
This
gallant
lover
,
this
young
Crichton
,
this
unassuming
but
ardent
lover
,
had
simply
taken
up
with
her
as
soon
as
he
had
failed
with
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
had
been
most
enthusiastic
in
her
expressions
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
Such
platonic
regards
might
be
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
It
was
for
Mr.
Kennedy
to
look
to
that
.
<EOS>
But
,
for
herself
,
she
felt
that
such
expressions
were
hardly
compatible
with
her
ideas
of
having
her
lover
all
to
herself
.
<EOS>
And
then
she
again
remembered
Madame
Goesler
's
bright
blue
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
came
on
Christmas
eve
,
and
was
received
with
open
arms
by
his
sister
,
and
with
that
painful
,
irritating
affection
which
such
a
girl
as
Violet
can
show
to
such
a
man
as
Lord
Chiltern
,
when
she
will
not
give
him
that
other
affection
for
which
his
heart
is
panting
.
<EOS>
The
two
men
were
civil
to
each
other
,
 
but
very
cold
.
<EOS>
They
called
each
other
Kennedy
and
Chiltern
,
but
even
that
was
not
done
without
an
effort
.
<EOS>
On
the
Christmas
morning
Mr.
Kennedy
asked
his
brother
-
in
-
law
to
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
kind
of
thing
I
never
do
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
gave
a
little
start
,
and
looked
a
look
of
horror
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
showed
that
she
was
unhappy
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
turned
away
her
face
,
and
smiled
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
walked
across
the
park
Violet
took
Lord
Chiltern
's
part
.
"
<EOS>
He
only
means
that
he
does
not
go
to
church
on
Christmas
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
he
means
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
need
not
speak
of
it
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
to
church
with
him
on
Sundays
myself
,
"
said
Violet
,
perhaps
not
reflecting
that
the
practices
of
early
years
had
little
to
do
with
the
young
man
's
life
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
Christmas
day
and
the
next
day
passed
without
any
sign
from
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
on
the
day
after
that
he
was
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
to
leave
till
one
or
two
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
had
been
said
between
the
two
women
,
since
he
had
been
in
the
house
,
on
the
subject
of
which
both
of
them
were
thinking
.
<EOS>
Very
much
had
been
said
of
the
expediency
of
his
going
to
Saulsby
,
but
on
this
matter
he
had
declined
to
make
any
promise
.
<EOS>
Sitting
in
Lady
Laura
's
room
,
in
the
presence
of
both
of
them
,
he
had
refused
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
bad
to
drive
,
"
he
said
,
turning
to
Violet
,
"
and
you
had
better
not
try
to
drive
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
not
you
be
driven
as
well
as
another
?
"
<EOS>
she
answered
,
laughing
.
   
<EOS>
The
First
Blow
 
Lord
Chiltern
,
though
he
had
passed
two
entire
days
in
the
house
with
Violet
without
renewing
his
suit
,
had
come
to
Loughlinter
for
the
express
purpose
of
doing
so
,
and
had
his
plans
perfectly
fixed
in
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
After
breakfast
on
that
last
morning
he
was
up
-
stairs
with
his
sister
in
her
own
room
,
and
immediately
made
his
request
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Laura
,
"
he
said
,
"
go
down
like
a
good
girl
,
and
make
Violet
come
up
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
stood
a
moment
looking
at
him
and
smiled
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
mind
,
"
he
continued
,
"
you
are
not
to
come
back
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
Violet
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
Violet
will
not
come
?
<EOS>
Young
ladies
do
not
generally
wait
upon
young
men
on
such
occasions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
but
I
rank
her
so
high
among
young
women
,
that
I
think
she
will
have
common
sense
enough
to
teach
her
that
,
after
what
has
passed
between
us
,
I
have
a
right
to
ask
for
an
interview
,
and
that
it
may
be
more
conveniently
had
here
than
in
the
wilderness
of
the
house
below
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Whatever
may
have
been
the
arguments
used
by
her
friend
,
Violet
did
come
.
<EOS>
She
reached
the
door
all
alone
,
and
opened
it
bravely
.
<EOS>
She
had
promised
herself
,
as
she
came
along
the
passages
,
that
she
would
not
pause
with
her
hand
on
the
lock
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
She
had
first
gone
to
her
own
room
,
and
as
she
left
it
<EOS>
she
had
looked
into
the
glass
with
a
hurried
glance
,
and
had
then
rested
for
a
moment
,
 
thinking
that
something
should
be
done
,
that
her
hair
might
be
smoothed
,
or
a
ribbon
set
straight
,
or
the
chain
arranged
under
her
brooch
.
<EOS>
A
girl
would
wish
to
look
well
before
her
lover
,
even
when
she
means
to
refuse
him
.
<EOS>
But
her
pause
was
but
for
an
instant
,
and
then
she
went
on
,
having
touched
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
and
pressed
her
hands
together
,
and
went
on
quick
and
opened
the
door
,
 
almost
with
a
little
start
.
<EOS>
"
Violet
,
this
is
very
good
of
you
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
and
not
moving
from
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
has
told
me
that
you
thought
I
would
do
as
much
as
this
for
you
,
and
therefore
I
have
done
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thanks
,
dearest
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
old
story
,
Violet
,
and
I
am
so
bad
at
words
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
been
bad
at
words
too
,
as
I
have
not
been
able
to
make
you
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
understood
.
<EOS>
You
are
always
clear
-
spoken
,
and
I
,
though
I
can
not
talk
,
am
not
muddle
-
pated
.
<EOS>
I
have
understood
.
<EOS>
But
while
you
are
single
there
must
be
yet
hope
;
 
unless
,
indeed
,
you
will
tell
me
that
you
have
already
given
yourself
to
another
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
done
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
how
can
I
not
hope
?
<EOS>
Violet
,
I
would
if
I
could
tell
you
all
my
feelings
plainly
.
<EOS>
Once
,
twice
,
thrice
,
I
have
said
to
myself
that
I
would
think
of
you
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
I
am
better
single
than
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
the
only
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
me
you
are
,
 
absolutely
,
as
though
there
were
none
other
on
the
face
of
God
's
earth
.
<EOS>
I
live
much
alone
;
but
you
are
always
with
me
.
<EOS>
Should
you
marry
any
other
man
,
it
will
be
the
same
with
me
still
.
<EOS>
If
you
refuse
me
now
I
shall
go
away
,
 
and
live
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
will
go
to
some
distant
part
of
the
world
,
where
I
may
be
killed
or
live
a
life
of
adventure
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
do
so
simply
in
despair
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
that
I
do
not
know
how
much
better
and
greater
should
be
the
life
at
home
of
a
man
in
my
position
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
do
not
talk
of
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
stay
.
<EOS>
You
will
acknowledge
,
Violet
,
that
I
have
never
lied
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
of
you
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
The
more
indifferent
you
show
yourself
to
me
,
the
more
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
Violet
,
try
to
love
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
came
up
to
her
,
and
took
her
by
both
her
hands
,
and
tears
were
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
Say
you
will
try
to
love
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
that
,
"
said
Violet
,
looking
away
,
but
still
leaving
her
hands
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
what
,
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
you
call
,
 
trying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
that
you
do
not
wish
to
try
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
,
you
are
so
violent
,
so
headstrong
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
of
you
,
 
as
is
everybody
.
<EOS>
Why
have
you
not
written
to
your
father
,
as
we
have
asked
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
to
him
instantly
,
now
,
before
I
leave
the
room
,
and
you
shall
dictate
the
letter
to
him
.
<EOS>
By
heavens
,
you
shall
!
"
<EOS>
He
had
dropped
her
hands
when
she
called
him
violent
;
but
now
he
took
them
again
,
and
still
she
permitted
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
postponed
it
only
till
I
had
spoken
to
you
once
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Lord
Chiltern
,
I
will
not
dictate
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
will
you
love
me
?
"
<EOS>
She
paused
and
looked
down
,
having
even
now
not
withdrawn
her
hands
from
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
think
he
knew
how
much
he
had
gained
.
<EOS>
"
You
used
to
love
me
,
 
a
little
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
 
indeed
,
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
now
?
<EOS>
Is
it
all
changed
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
she
said
,
retreating
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
,
then
?
<EOS>
Violet
,
speak
to
me
honestly
.
<EOS>
Will
you
be
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
answer
him
,
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
her
.
<EOS>
Then
he
rushed
at
her
,
and
,
seizing
her
in
his
arms
,
kissed
her
all
over
,
 
her
forehead
,
her
lips
,
her
cheeks
,
then
both
her
hands
,
and
then
her
lips
again
.
"
<EOS>
By
G
 
,
she
is
my
own
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
Then
he
went
back
to
the
rug
before
the
fire
,
and
stood
there
with
his
back
turned
to
her
.
<EOS>
Violet
,
when
she
found
herself
thus
deserted
,
retreated
to
a
sofa
,
and
sat
herself
down
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
negative
to
produce
now
in
answer
to
the
violent
assertion
which
he
had
pronounced
as
to
his
own
success
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
.
<EOS>
She
had
doubted
,
and
doubted
,
 
and
still
doubted
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
must
doubt
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Of
one
thing
she
was
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
She
could
love
him
.
<EOS>
As
things
had
now
gone
,
she
would
make
him
quite
happy
with
assurances
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
As
to
that
other
question
,
 
that
fearful
question
,
whether
or
not
she
could
trust
him
,
 
on
that
matter
she
had
better
at
present
say
nothing
,
and
think
as
little
,
perhaps
,
as
might
be
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
the
jump
,
and
therefore
why
should
she
not
be
gracious
to
him
?
<EOS>
But
how
was
she
to
be
gracious
to
a
lover
who
stood
there
with
his
back
turned
to
her
?
  
<EOS>
After
the
interval
of
a
minute
or
two
he
remembered
himself
,
and
turned
round
.
<EOS>
Seeing
her
seated
,
he
approached
her
,
and
went
down
on
both
knees
close
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
her
hands
again
,
for
the
third
time
,
and
looked
up
into
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
,
you
on
your
knees
!
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
bend
to
a
princess
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
ask
for
half
her
throne
;
but
I
will
kneel
here
all
day
,
if
you
will
let
me
,
in
thanks
for
the
gift
of
your
love
.
<EOS>
I
never
kneeled
to
beg
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
man
who
can
not
make
speeches
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
talk
now
by
the
hour
,
with
you
for
a
listener
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
I
must
talk
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
say
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
while
you
are
kneeling
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
natural
that
you
should
kneel
.
<EOS>
You
are
like
Samson
with
his
locks
shorn
,
or
Hercules
with
a
distaff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
better
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
he
got
up
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
earnest
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
earnest
.
<EOS>
I
hardly
thought
that
that
would
be
doubted
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
believe
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
you
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
be
good
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
 
I
do
not
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
,
and
I
will
love
you
so
dearly
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
do
love
you
dearly
.
<EOS>
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
it
fifty
times
,
 
till
your
ears
are
weary
with
it
"
;
 
and
she
did
say
it
to
him
,
after
her
own
fashion
,
fifty
times
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
great
change
,
"
he
said
,
getting
up
after
a
while
and
walking
about
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
a
change
for
the
better
;
 
is
it
not
,
Oswald
?
"
  
"
So
much
for
the
better
that
I
hardly
know
myself
in
my
new
joy
.
<EOS>
But
,
Violet
,
we
'll
have
no
delay
,
 
will
we
?
<EOS>
No
shilly
-
shallying
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
use
of
waiting
now
that
it
's
settled
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
in
the
least
,
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Let
us
say
,
 
this
day
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
laughing
at
me
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Remember
,
sir
,
that
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do
is
to
write
to
your
father
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
instantly
went
to
the
writing
-
table
and
took
up
paper
and
pen
.
<EOS>
"
Come
along
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
dictate
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
this
she
refused
to
do
,
telling
him
that
he
must
write
his
letter
to
his
father
out
of
his
own
head
,
and
out
of
his
own
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
write
it
,
"
he
said
,
throwing
down
the
pen
.
<EOS>
"
My
blood
is
in
such
a
tumult
that
I
can
not
steady
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
be
so
tumultuous
,
Oswald
,
or
I
shall
have
to
live
in
a
whirlwind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
shall
shake
down
.
<EOS>
I
shall
become
as
steady
as
an
old
stager
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
as
quiet
in
harness
by
-
and
-
by
as
though
I
had
been
broken
to
it
a
four
-
year
-
old
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Laura
could
not
write
this
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
should
write
it
yourself
,
Oswald
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
bid
me
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bid
you
indeed
!
<EOS>
As
if
it
was
for
me
to
bid
you
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
know
that
in
these
new
troubles
you
are
undertaking
you
will
have
to
bid
me
in
everything
,
and
that
I
shall
be
bound
to
do
your
bidding
?
<EOS>
Does
it
not
seem
to
be
dreadful
?
<EOS>
My
wonder
is
that
any
girl
can
ever
accept
any
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
accepted
me
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
.
"
  
"
And
you
repent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
and
I
will
try
to
do
your
biddings
;
 
but
you
must
not
be
rough
to
me
,
and
outrageous
,
and
fierce
,
 
will
you
,
Oswald
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
at
any
rate
be
like
Kennedy
is
with
poor
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
that
is
not
your
nature
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
my
best
,
dearest
.
<EOS>
And
you
may
at
any
rate
be
sure
of
this
,
that
I
will
love
you
always
.
<EOS>
So
much
good
of
myself
,
if
it
be
good
,
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
good
,
"
she
answered
;
"
the
best
of
all
good
words
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
must
go
.
<EOS>
And
as
you
are
leaving
Loughlinter
I
will
say
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
When
am
I
to
have
the
honour
and
felicity
of
beholding
your
lordship
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
a
nice
word
to
me
before
I
am
off
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
 
love
,
 
you
,
 
better
,
 
than
all
the
world
beside
;
and
I
mean
,
 
to
be
your
wife
,
 
some
day
.
<EOS>
Are
not
those
twenty
nice
words
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
prolong
his
stay
at
Loughlinter
,
though
he
was
asked
to
do
so
both
by
Violet
and
his
sister
,
and
though
,
as
he
confessed
himself
,
he
had
no
special
business
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
use
mincing
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
Kennedy
,
and
I
do
n't
like
being
in
his
house
,
"
he
said
to
Violet
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
promised
that
there
should
be
a
party
got
up
at
Saulsby
before
the
winter
was
over
.
<EOS>
His
plan
was
to
stop
that
night
at
Carlisle
,
and
write
to
his
father
from
thence
.
"
<EOS>
Your
blood
,
perhaps
,
wo
n't
be
so
tumultuous
at
Carlisle
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
and
went
on
with
his
plans
.
<EOS>
He
would
then
go
on
to
London
and
down
to
Willingford
,
and
there
wait
for
his
father
's
answer
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
reason
why
I
should
lose
more
of
the
hunting
than
necessary
.
"
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
lose
a
day
for
me
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
heard
from
his
father
,
he
would
do
his
father
's
bidding
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
go
to
Saulsby
,
"
said
Violet
;
"
you
can
hunt
at
Saulsby
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
Jericho
if
he
asks
me
,
only
you
will
have
to
go
with
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
thought
we
were
to
go
to
,
 
Belgium
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
that
is
settled
at
last
,
"
said
Violet
to
Laura
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
not
regret
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
as
happy
as
the
moments
are
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
fine
girl
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
happy
because
I
love
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
loved
him
.
<EOS>
You
have
known
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
,
after
my
fashion
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
tumultuous
,
as
he
calls
himself
.
<EOS>
Since
he
began
to
make
eyes
at
me
when
he
was
nineteen
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Fancy
Oswald
making
eyes
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
did
,
and
mouths
too
.
<EOS>
But
from
the
beginning
,
when
I
was
a
child
,
I
have
known
that
he
was
dangerous
,
and
I
have
thought
that
he
would
pass
on
and
forget
me
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
And
I
could
have
lived
without
him
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
there
have
been
moments
when
I
thought
I
could
learn
to
love
some
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Phineas
,
for
instance
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
mention
no
names
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Appledom
,
perhaps
,
more
likely
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
my
most
constant
lover
,
and
then
he
would
be
so
safe
!
<EOS>
Your
brother
,
Laura
,
is
dangerous
.
<EOS>
He
is
like
the
bad
ice
in
the
parks
where
they
stick
up
the
poles
.
<EOS>
He
has
had
a
pole
stuck
upon
him
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
give
a
dog
a
bad
name
and
hang
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
that
I
do
not
love
him
a
bit
the
less
on
that
account
;
 
perhaps
the
better
.
<EOS>
A
sense
of
danger
does
not
make
me
unhappy
,
though
the
threatened
evil
may
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
I
have
entered
myself
for
my
forlorn
hope
,
and
I
mean
to
stick
to
it
.
<EOS>
Now
I
must
go
and
write
to
his
worship
.
<EOS>
Only
think
,
 
I
never
wrote
a
love
-
letter
yet
!
"
  
<EOS>
Nothing
more
shall
be
said
about
Miss
Effingham
's
first
love
-
letter
,
which
was
,
no
doubt
,
creditable
to
her
head
and
heart
;
but
there
were
two
other
letters
sent
by
the
same
post
from
Loughlinter
which
shall
be
submitted
to
the
reader
,
as
they
will
assist
the
telling
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
One
was
from
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
to
her
friend
Phineas
Finn
,
and
the
other
from
Violet
to
her
aunt
,
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
No
letter
was
written
to
Lord
Brentford
,
as
it
was
thought
desirable
that
he
should
receive
the
first
intimation
of
what
had
been
done
from
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
Respecting
the
letter
to
Phineas
,
which
shall
be
first
given
,
Lady
Laura
thought
it
right
to
say
a
word
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
of
course
told
of
the
engagement
,
and
had
replied
that
he
could
have
wished
that
the
arrangement
could
have
been
made
elsewhere
than
at
his
house
,
knowing
as
he
did
that
Lady
Baldock
would
not
approve
of
it
.
<EOS>
To
this
Lady
Laura
had
made
no
reply
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
had
condescended
to
congratulate
the
bride
-
elect
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Laura
's
letter
to
Phineas
was
completed
she
took
care
to
put
it
into
the
letter
-
box
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
written
to
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
said
,
"
to
tell
him
of
this
marriage
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
was
it
necessary
that
he
should
be
told
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
was
due
to
him
,
 
from
certain
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
there
was
any
truth
in
what
everybody
was
saying
about
their
fighting
a
duel
?
"
asked
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
His
wife
made
no
answer
,
and
then
he
continued
 
<EOS>
"
You
told
me
of
your
own
knowledge
that
it
was
untrue
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
of
my
own
knowledge
,
Robert
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
of
your
own
knowledge
.
<EOS>
"
Then
Mr.
Kennedy
walked
away
,
and
was
certain
that
his
wife
had
deceived
him
about
the
duel
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
duel
,
and
she
had
known
it
;
and
yet
she
had
told
him
that
the
report
was
a
ridiculous
fabrication
.
<EOS>
He
never
forgot
anything
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
at
this
moment
the
words
of
the
falsehood
,
and
the
look
of
her
face
as
she
told
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
believed
her
implicitly
,
but
he
would
never
believe
her
again
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
men
who
,
in
spite
of
their
experience
of
the
world
,
of
their
experience
of
their
own
lives
,
imagine
that
lips
that
have
once
lied
can
never
tell
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
's
letter
to
Phineas
was
as
follows
:
  
Loughlinter
,
December
28th
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
FRIEND
,
  
Violet
Effingham
is
here
,
and
Oswald
has
just
left
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
possible
that
you
may
see
him
as
he
passes
through
London
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
any
rate
,
I
think
it
best
to
let
you
know
immediately
that
she
has
accepted
him
,
 
at
last
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
any
pang
in
this
to
you
,
be
sure
that
I
will
grieve
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
wish
me
to
say
that
I
regret
that
which
was
the
dearest
wish
of
my
heart
before
I
knew
you
.
<EOS>
Lately
,
indeed
,
I
have
been
torn
in
two
ways
.
<EOS>
You
will
understand
what
I
mean
,
and
I
believe
I
need
say
nothing
more
;
 
except
this
,
that
it
shall
be
among
my
prayers
that
you
may
obtain
all
things
that
may
tend
to
make
you
happy
,
honourable
,
and
of
high
esteem
.
  
<EOS>
Your
most
sincere
friend
  
LAURA
KENNEDY
.
  
<EOS>
Even
though
her
husband
should
read
the
letter
,
there
was
nothing
in
that
of
which
she
need
be
ashamed
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
simply
speculated
as
to
its
contents
,
and
inquired
within
himself
whether
it
would
not
be
for
the
welfare
of
the
world
in
general
,
and
for
the
welfare
of
himself
in
particular
,
that
husbands
should
demand
to
read
their
wives
'
letters
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
was
Violet
's
letter
to
her
aunt
:
    
MY
DEAR
AUNT
,
  
<EOS>
The
thing
has
come
at
last
,
and
all
your
troubles
will
be
soon
over
;
 
for
I
do
believe
that
all
your
troubles
have
come
from
your
unfortunate
niece
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
am
going
to
be
married
,
and
thus
take
myself
off
your
hands
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
has
just
been
here
,
and
I
have
accepted
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
you
hardly
think
so
well
of
Lord
Chiltern
as
I
do
;
but
then
,
perhaps
,
you
have
not
known
him
so
long
.
<EOS>
You
do
know
,
however
,
that
there
has
been
some
difference
between
him
and
his
father
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
may
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
now
,
upon
his
engagement
,
this
will
be
settled
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
inexpressible
pleasure
of
feeling
sure
that
Lord
Brentford
will
welcome
me
as
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
Tell
the
news
to
Augusta
with
my
best
love
.
<EOS>
I
will
write
to
her
in
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
I
hope
my
cousin
Gustavus
will
condescend
to
give
me
away
.
<EOS>
Of
course
there
is
nothing
fixed
about
time
;
 
but
I
should
say
,
perhaps
,
in
nine
years
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
niece
,
  
VIOLET

<EOS>
"
What
does
she
mean
about
nine
years
?
"
said
Lady
Baldock
in
her
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
joking
,
"
said
the
mild
Augusta
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
would
 
joke
,
if
I
were
going
to
be
buried
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
.
   
<EOS>
Showing
How
Phineas
Bore
the
Blow
 
<EOS>
When
Phineas
received
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
's
letter
,
he
was
sitting
in
his
gorgeous
apartment
in
the
Colonial
Office
.
<EOS>
It
was
gorgeous
in
comparison
with
the
very
dingy
room
at
Mr.
Low
's
to
which
he
had
been
accustomed
in
his
early
days
,
 
and
somewhat
gorgeous
also
as
compared
with
the
lodgings
he
had
so
long
inhabited
in
Mr.
Bunce
's
house
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
large
and
square
,
and
looked
out
from
three
windows
on
to
St.
James
's
Park
.
<EOS>
There
were
in
it
two
very
comfortable
arm
-
chairs
and
a
comfortable
sofa
.
<EOS>
And
the
office
table
at
which
he
sat
was
of
old
mahogany
,
shining
brightly
,
and
seemed
to
be
fitted
up
with
every
possible
appliance
for
official
comfort
.
<EOS>
This
stood
near
one
of
the
windows
,
so
that
he
could
sit
and
look
down
upon
the
park
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
large
round
table
covered
with
books
and
newspapers
.
<EOS>
And
the
walls
of
the
room
were
bright
with
maps
of
all
the
colonies
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
one
very
interesting
map
,
 
but
not
very
bright
,
 
showing
the
American
colonies
,
as
they
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
little
inner
closet
in
which
he
could
brush
his
hair
and
wash
his
hands
;
and
in
the
room
adjoining
there
sat
,
 
or
ought
to
have
sat
,
for
he
was
often
absent
,
vexing
the
mind
of
Phineas
,
 
the
Earl
's
nephew
,
his
private
secretary
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
all
very
gorgeous
.
<EOS>
Often
as
he
looked
round
upon
it
,
thinking
of
his
old
bedroom
at
Killaloe
,
of
his
little
garrets
at
Trinity
,
of
the
dingy
chambers
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
he
would
tell
himself
that
it
was
very
gorgeous
.
<EOS>
He
would
wonder
that
anything
so
grand
had
fallen
to
his
lot
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
from
Scotland
was
brought
to
him
in
the
afternoon
,
having
reached
London
by
some
day
-
mail
from
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
He
was
sitting
at
his
desk
with
a
heap
of
papers
before
him
referring
to
a
contemplated
railway
from
Halifax
,
in
Nova
Scotia
,
to
the
foot
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
.
<EOS>
It
had
become
his
business
to
get
up
the
subject
,
and
then
discuss
with
his
principal
,
Lord
Cantrip
,
the
expediency
of
advising
the
Government
to
lend
a
company
five
million
of
money
,
in
order
that
this
railway
might
be
made
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
big
subject
,
and
the
contemplation
of
it
gratified
him
.
<EOS>
It
required
that
he
should
look
forward
to
great
events
,
and
exercise
the
wisdom
of
a
statesman
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
chance
of
these
colonies
being
swallowed
up
by
those
other
regions
,
 
once
colonies
,
 
of
which
the
map
that
hung
in
the
corner
told
so
eloquent
a
tale
?
<EOS>
And
if
so
,
would
the
five
million
ever
be
repaid
?
<EOS>
And
if
not
swallowed
up
,
were
the
colonies
worth
so
great
an
adventure
of
national
money
?
<EOS>
Could
they
repay
it
?
<EOS>
Would
they
do
so
?
<EOS>
Should
they
be
made
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
,
who
was
now
a
Q.C.
and
in
Parliament
,
would
not
have
greater
subjects
than
this
before
him
,
even
if
he
should
come
to
be
Solicitor
General
.
<EOS>
Lord
Cantrip
had
specially
asked
him
to
get
up
this
matter
,
 
and
he
was
getting
it
up
sedulously
.
<EOS>
Once
in
nine
years
the
harbour
of
Halifax
was
blocked
up
by
ice
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
jotted
down
the
fact
,
which
was
material
,
when
Lady
Laura
's
letter
was
brought
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
read
it
,
and
putting
it
down
by
his
side
very
gently
,
went
back
to
his
maps
as
though
the
thing
would
not
so
trouble
his
mind
as
to
disturb
his
work
.
<EOS>
He
absolutely
wrote
,
automatically
,
certain
words
of
a
note
about
the
harbour
,
after
he
had
received
the
information
.
<EOS>
A
horse
will
gallop
for
some
scores
of
yards
,
after
his
back
has
been
broken
,
before
he
knows
of
his
great
ruin
;
 
and
so
it
was
with
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
His
back
was
broken
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
he
galloped
,
for
a
yard
or
two
.
"
<EOS>
Closed
in
1860
-
61
for
thirteen
days
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
began
to
be
aware
that
his
back
was
broken
,
and
that
the
writing
of
any
more
notes
about
the
ice
in
Halifax
harbour
was
for
the
present
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
best
to
let
you
know
immediately
that
she
has
accepted
him
.
<EOS>
"
These
were
the
words
which
he
read
the
oftenest
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
all
over
!
<EOS>
The
game
was
played
out
,
and
all
his
victories
were
as
nothing
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
sat
for
an
hour
in
his
gorgeous
room
thinking
of
it
,
and
various
were
the
answers
which
he
gave
during
the
time
to
various
messages
;
 
but
he
would
see
nobody
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
colonies
,
he
did
not
care
if
they
revolted
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
parted
with
every
colony
belonging
to
Great
Britain
to
have
gotten
the
hand
of
Violet
Effingham
for
himself
.
<EOS>
Now
,
 
now
at
this
moment
,
he
told
himself
with
oaths
that
he
had
never
loved
any
one
but
Violet
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
so
much
to
make
such
a
marriage
desirable
!
<EOS>
I
should
wrong
my
hero
<EOS>
deeply
were
I
to
say
that
the
weight
of
his
sorrow
was
occasioned
by
the
fact
that
he
had
lost
an
heiress
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
have
thought
of
looking
for
Violet
Effingham
<EOS>
had
he
not
first
learned
to
love
her
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
idea
opened
itself
out
to
him
,
everything
had
seemed
to
be
so
suitable
.
<EOS>
Had
Miss
Effingham
become
his
wife
,
the
mouths
of
the
Lows
and
of
the
Bunces
would
have
been
stopped
altogether
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
would
have
come
to
his
house
as
his
familiar
guest
,
and
he
would
have
been
connected
with
half
a
score
of
peers
.
<EOS>
A
seat
in
Parliament
would
be
simply
his
proper
place
,
and
even
Under
-
Secretaryships
of
State
might
soon
come
to
be
below
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
playing
a
great
game
,
but
hitherto
he
had
played
it
with
so
much
success
,
 
with
such
wonderful
luck
!
<EOS>
that
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
all
things
were
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
had
been
wanting
to
him
than
Violet
's
hand
for
his
own
comfort
,
and
Violet
's
fortune
to
support
his
position
;
and
these
,
too
,
had
almost
seemed
to
be
within
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
His
goddess
had
indeed
refused
him
,
 
but
not
with
disdain
.
<EOS>
Even
Lady
Laura
had
talked
of
his
marriage
as
not
improbable
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
,
almost
,
had
heard
of
the
duel
;
and
all
the
world
had
smiled
,
and
seemed
to
think
that
in
the
real
fight
Phineas
Finn
would
be
the
victor
,
 
that
the
lucky
pistol
was
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
It
had
never
occurred
to
any
one
to
suppose
,
 
as
far
as
he
could
see
,
 
that
he
was
presuming
at
all
,
or
pushing
himself
out
of
his
own
sphere
,
in
asking
Violet
Effingham
to
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
No
;
 
he
would
trust
his
luck
,
would
persevere
,
and
would
succeed
.
<EOS>
Such
had
been
his
resolution
on
that
very
morning
,
 
and
now
there
had
come
this
letter
to
dash
him
to
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
moments
in
which
he
declared
to
himself
that
he
would
not
believe
the
letter
,
 
not
that
there
was
any
moment
in
which
there
was
in
his
mind
the
slightest
spark
of
real
hope
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
tell
himself
that
he
would
still
persevere
.
<EOS>
Violet
might
have
been
driven
to
accept
that
violent
man
by
violent
influence
,
 
or
it
might
be
that
she
had
not
in
truth
accepted
him
,
that
Chiltern
had
simply
so
asserted
.
<EOS>
Or
,
even
if
it
were
so
,
did
women
never
change
their
minds
?
<EOS>
The
manly
thing
would
be
to
persevere
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
before
been
successful
,
when
success
seemed
to
be
as
far
from
him
?
<EOS>
But
he
could
buoy
himself
up
with
no
real
hope
.
<EOS>
Even
when
these
ideas
were
present
to
his
mind
,
he
knew
,
 
he
knew
well
,
 
at
those
very
moments
,
that
his
back
was
broken
.
  
<EOS>
Some
one
had
come
in
and
lighted
the
candles
and
drawn
down
the
blinds
while
he
was
sitting
there
,
and
now
,
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
,
he
found
that
it
was
past
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
He
was
engaged
to
dine
with
Madame
Max
Goesler
at
eight
,
and
in
his
agony
he
half
-
resolved
that
he
would
send
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
would
be
full
of
wrath
,
as
she
was
very
particular
about
her
little
dinner
-
parties
;
 
but
,
what
did
he
care
now
about
the
wrath
of
Madame
Max
Goesler
?
<EOS>
And
yet
only
this
morning
he
had
been
congratulating
himself
,
among
his
other
successes
,
upon
her
favour
,
and
had
laughed
inwardly
at
his
own
falseness
,
 
his
falseness
to
Violet
Effingham
,
 
as
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
something
to
himself
jocosely
about
lovers
'
perjuries
,
the
remembrance
of
which
was
now
very
bitter
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
took
up
a
sheet
of
note
-
paper
and
scrawled
an
excuse
to
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
News
from
the
country
,
he
said
,
made
it
impossible
that
he
should
go
out
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
send
the
note
.
<EOS>
At
about
half
-
past
five
he
opened
the
door
of
his
private
secretary
's
room
and
found
the
young
man
fast
asleep
,
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
Halloa
,
Charles
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
!
"
<EOS>
Charles
Standish
was
a
first
cousin
of
Lady
Laura
's
,
and
,
having
been
in
the
office
before
Phineas
had
joined
it
,
and
being
a
great
favourite
with
his
cousin
,
had
of
course
become
the
Under
-
Secretary
's
private
secretary
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
all
here
,
"
said
Charles
Standish
,
getting
up
and
shaking
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
.
<EOS>
Just
tie
up
those
papers
,
 
exactly
as
they
are
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
here
early
to
-
morrow
,
but
I
sha
n't
want
you
before
twelve
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ta
,
ta
,
"
said
his
private
secretary
,
who
was
very
fond
of
his
master
,
but
not
very
respectful
,
 
unless
upon
express
occasions
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
went
out
and
walked
across
the
park
;
but
as
he
went
he
became
quite
aware
that
his
back
was
broken
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
less
broken
because
he
sang
to
himself
little
songs
to
prove
to
himself
that
it
was
whole
and
sound
.
<EOS>
It
was
broken
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
he
never
could
become
an
Atlas
again
,
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
world
upon
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
What
did
anything
signify
?
<EOS>
All
that
he
had
done
had
been
part
of
a
game
which
he
had
been
playing
throughout
,
and
now
he
had
been
beaten
in
his
game
.
<EOS>
He
absolutely
ignored
his
old
passion
for
Lady
Laura
as
though
it
had
never
been
,
and
regarded
himself
as
a
model
of
constancy
,
 
as
a
man
who
had
loved
,
not
wisely
perhaps
,
but
much
too
well
,
 
and
who
must
now
therefore
suffer
a
living
death
.
<EOS>
He
hated
Parliament
.
<EOS>
He
hated
the
Colonial
Office
.
<EOS>
He
hated
his
friend
Mr.
Monk
;
and
he
especially
hated
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
As
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
 
he
believed
that
Lord
Chiltern
had
obtained
his
object
by
violence
.
<EOS>
He
would
see
to
that
!
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
,
he
would
see
to
that
!
  
<EOS>
He
went
up
by
the
Duke
of
York
's
column
,
and
as
he
passed
the
Athenæum
he
saw
his
chief
,
Lord
Cantrip
,
standing
under
the
portico
talking
to
a
bishop
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
gone
on
unnoticed
,
had
it
been
possible
;
but
Lord
Cantrip
came
down
to
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
put
your
name
down
here
,
"
said
his
lordship
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
?
"
said
Phineas
,
who
was
profoundly
indifferent
at
this
moment
to
all
the
clubs
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
ca
n't
do
any
harm
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
'll
come
up
in
time
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
should
get
into
the
ministry
,
they
'll
let
you
in
at
once
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ministry
!
"
ejaculated
Phineas
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Cantrip
took
the
tone
of
voice
as
simply
suggestive
of
humility
,
and
suspected
nothing
of
that
profound
indifference
to
all
ministers
and
ministerial
honours
which
Phineas
had
intended
to
express
.
<EOS>
"
By
-
the
-
bye
,
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
,
putting
his
arm
through
that
of
the
Under
-
Secretary
,
"
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
the
guarantees
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
in
the
devil
's
own
mess
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
the
Secretary
of
State
went
on
about
the
Rocky
Mountain
Railroad
,
and
Phineas
strove
hard
to
bear
his
burden
with
his
broken
back
.
<EOS>
He
was
obliged
to
say
something
about
the
guarantees
,
and
the
railway
,
and
the
frozen
harbour
,
 
and
something
especially
about
the
difficulties
which
would
be
found
,
not
in
the
measures
themselves
,
but
in
the
natural
pugnacity
of
the
Opposition
.
<EOS>
In
the
fabrication
of
garments
for
the
national
wear
,
the
great
thing
is
to
produce
garments
that
shall
,
as
far
as
possible
,
defy
hole
-
picking
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
,
and
sometimes
is
,
the
case
,
that
garments
so
fabricated
will
be
good
also
for
wear
.
<EOS>
Lord
Cantrip
,
at
the
present
moment
,
was
very
anxious
and
very
ingenious
in
the
stopping
of
holes
;
and
he
thought
that
perhaps
his
Under
-
Secretary
was
too
much
prone
to
the
indulgence
of
large
philanthropical
views
without
sufficient
thought
of
the
hole
-
pickers
.
<EOS>
But
on
this
occasion
,
by
the
time
that
he
reached
Brooks
's
,
he
had
been
enabled
to
convince
his
Under
-
Secretary
,
and
though
he
had
always
thought
well
of
his
Under
-
Secretary
,
he
thought
better
of
him
now
than
ever
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
Phineas
during
the
whole
time
had
been
meditating
what
he
could
do
to
Lord
Chiltern
when
they
two
should
meet
.
<EOS>
Could
he
take
him
by
the
throat
and
smite
him
?
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
know
that
Broderick
is
working
as
hard
at
the
matter
as
we
are
,
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
,
stopping
opposite
to
the
club
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
moved
for
papers
,
you
know
,
at
the
end
of
last
session
.
"
<EOS>
Now
Mr.
Broderick
was
a
gentleman
in
the
House
looking
for
promotion
in
a
Conservative
Government
,
and
of
course
would
oppose
any
measure
that
could
be
brought
forward
by
the
Cantrip
-
Finn
Colonial
Administration
.
<EOS>
Then
Lord
Cantrip
slipped
into
the
club
,
and
Phineas
went
on
alone
.
  
<EOS>
A
spark
of
his
old
ambition
with
reference
to
Brooks
's
was
the
first
thing
to
make
him
forget
his
misery
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
had
asked
Lord
Brentford
to
put
his
name
down
,
and
was
not
sure
whether
it
had
been
done
.
<EOS>
The
threat
of
Mr.
Broderick
's
opposition
had
been
of
no
use
towards
the
strengthening
of
his
broken
back
,
but
the
sight
of
Lord
Cantrip
hurrying
in
at
the
coveted
door
did
do
something
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
man
ca
n't
cut
his
throat
or
blow
his
brains
out
,
"
he
said
to
himself
;
"
after
all
,
he
must
go
on
and
do
his
work
.
<EOS>
For
hearts
will
break
,
yet
brokenly
live
on
.
<EOS>
"
Thereupon
he
went
home
,
and
after
sitting
for
an
hour
over
his
own
fire
,
and
looking
wistfully
at
a
little
treasure
which
he
had
,
 
a
treasure
obtained
by
some
slight
fraud
at
Saulsby
,
and
which
he
now
chucked
into
the
fire
,
and
then
instantly
again
pulled
out
of
it
,
soiled
but
unscorched
,
 
<EOS>
he
dressed
himself
for
dinner
,
and
went
out
to
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
he
was
glad
that
he
had
not
sent
the
note
of
excuse
.
<EOS>
A
man
must
live
,
even
though
his
heart
be
broken
,
and
living
he
must
dine
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
was
fond
of
giving
little
dinners
at
this
period
of
the
year
,
before
London
was
crowded
,
and
when
her
guests
might
probably
not
be
called
away
by
subsequent
social
arrangements
.
<EOS>
Her
number
seldom
exceeded
six
or
eight
,
and
she
always
spoke
of
these
entertainments
as
being
of
the
humblest
kind
.
<EOS>
She
sent
out
no
big
cards
.
<EOS>
She
preferred
to
catch
her
people
as
though
by
chance
,
when
that
was
possible
.
"
<EOS>
Dear
Mr.
Jones
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Smith
is
coming
to
tell
me
about
some
sherry
on
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
and
tell
me
too
?
<EOS>
I
daresay
you
know
as
much
about
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
there
was
a
studious
absence
of
parade
.
<EOS>
The
dishes
were
not
very
numerous
.
<EOS>
The
bill
of
fare
was
simply
written
out
once
,
for
the
mistress
,
and
so
circulated
round
the
table
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
about
the
things
to
be
eaten
or
the
things
to
be
drunk
was
ever
spoken
at
the
table
,
 
or
at
least
no
such
word
was
ever
spoken
by
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
they
who
knew
anything
about
dinners
were
aware
that
Madame
Goesler
gave
very
good
dinners
indeed
.
<EOS>
Phineas
Finn
was
beginning
to
flatter
himself
that
he
knew
something
about
dinners
,
and
had
been
heard
to
assert
that
the
soups
at
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
were
not
to
be
beaten
in
London
.
<EOS>
But
he
cared
for
no
soup
to
-
day
,
as
he
slowly
made
his
way
up
Madame
Goesler
's
staircase
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
one
difficulty
in
the
way
of
Madame
Goesler
's
dinner
-
parties
which
had
required
some
patience
and
great
ingenuity
in
its
management
.
<EOS>
She
must
either
have
ladies
,
or
she
must
not
have
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
allurement
in
the
latter
alternative
;
but
she
knew
well
that
if
she
gave
way
to
it
,
all
prospect
of
general
society
would
for
her
be
closed
,
 
and
for
ever
.
<EOS>
This
had
been
in
the
early
days
of
her
widowhood
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
She
cared
but
little
for
women
's
society
;
but
she
knew
well
that
the
society
of
gentlemen
without
women
would
not
be
that
which
she
desired
.
<EOS>
She
knew
also
that
she
might
as
effectually
crush
herself
and
all
her
aspirations
by
bringing
to
her
house
indifferent
women
,
 
women
lacking
something
either
in
character
,
or
in
position
,
or
in
talent
,
 
as
by
having
none
at
all
.
<EOS>
Thus
there
had
been
a
great
difficulty
,
and
sometimes
she
had
thought
that
the
thing
could
not
be
done
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
English
are
so
stiff
,
so
hard
,
so
heavy
!
"
<EOS>
And
yet
she
would
not
have
cared
to
succeed
elsewhere
than
among
the
English
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
however
,
the
thing
was
done
.
<EOS>
Her
prudence
equalled
her
wit
,
and
even
suspicious
people
had
come
to
acknowledge
that
they
could
not
put
their
fingers
on
anything
wrong
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
had
once
dined
at
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
,
Madame
Max
Goesler
had
told
herself
that
henceforth
she
did
not
care
what
the
suspicious
people
said
.
<EOS>
Since
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
had
almost
promised
that
he
would
come
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
entertain
the
Duke
of
Omnium
she
would
have
done
everything
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
Duke
of
Omnium
there
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
Duke
of
Omnium
was
,
of
course
,
not
in
London
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Fawn
was
there
;
and
our
old
friend
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
who
had
 
resigned
his
place
at
the
Colonial
Office
;
and
there
were
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
They
,
with
our
hero
,
made
up
the
party
.
<EOS>
No
one
doubted
for
a
moment
to
what
source
Mr.
Bonteen
owed
his
dinner
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bonteen
was
good
-
looking
,
could
talk
,
was
sufficiently
proper
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
,
 
and
did
as
well
as
any
other
woman
at
this
time
of
year
to
keep
Madame
Max
Goesler
in
countenance
.
<EOS>
There
was
never
any
sitting
after
dinner
at
the
cottage
;
or
,
I
should
rather
say
,
there
was
never
any
sitting
after
Madame
Goesler
went
;
so
that
the
two
ladies
could
not
weary
each
other
by
being
alone
together
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bonteen
understood
quite
well
that
she
was
not
required
there
to
talk
to
her
hostess
,
and
was
as
willing
as
any
woman
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
the
gentlemen
she
might
meet
at
Madame
Goesler
's
table
.
<EOS>
And
thus
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
not
unfrequently
dined
in
Park
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
we
have
only
to
wait
for
that
horrible
man
,
Mr.
Fitzgibbon
,
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
as
she
welcomed
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
always
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
blow
for
me
!
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
 
you
are
always
in
good
time
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
limit
beyond
which
good
time
ends
,
and
being
shamefully
late
at
once
begins
.
<EOS>
But
here
he
is
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
entered
the
room
,
Madame
Goesler
rang
the
bell
for
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
found
himself
placed
between
his
hostess
and
Mr.
Bonteen
,
and
Lord
Fawn
was
on
the
other
side
of
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
They
were
hardly
seated
at
the
table
before
some
one
stated
it
as
a
fact
that
Lord
Brentford
and
his
son
were
reconciled
.
<EOS>
Now
Phineas
knew
,
or
thought
that
he
knew
,
that
this
could
not
as
yet
be
the
case
;
and
indeed
such
was
not
the
case
,
though
the
father
had
already
received
the
son
's
letter
.
<EOS>
But
Phineas
did
not
choose
to
say
anything
at
present
about
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
odd
it
is
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
;
"
how
often
you
English
fathers
quarrel
with
your
sons
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
often
we
English
sons
quarrel
with
our
fathers
rather
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
who
was
known
for
the
respect
he
had
always
paid
to
the
fifth
commandment
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
all
comes
from
entail
and
primogeniture
,
and
old
-
fashioned
English
prejudices
of
that
kind
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
is
a
friend
of
yours
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
both
friends
of
mine
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
yes
;
but
you
,
 
you
,
 
you
and
Lord
Chiltern
once
did
something
odd
together
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
mystery
,
was
there
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
little
of
a
mystery
now
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
about
a
lady
;
 
was
it
not
?
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
affecting
to
whisper
to
her
neighbour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
liberty
to
say
anything
on
the
subject
,
"
said
Fitzgibbon
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
Phineas
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
this
about
Lord
Brentford
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
I
happen
to
know
that
Chiltern
was
down
at
Loughlinter
three
days
ago
,
and
that
he
passed
through
London
yesterday
on
his
way
to
the
place
where
he
hunts
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
is
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
gone
to
Saulsby
if
it
were
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
all
depends
upon
whether
Miss
Effingham
will
accept
him
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
looking
over
at
Phineas
as
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
As
there
were
two
of
Violet
Effingham
's
suitors
at
table
,
the
subject
was
becoming
disagreeably
personal
;
and
the
more
so
,
as
every
one
of
the
party
knew
or
surmised
something
of
the
facts
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
cause
of
the
duel
at
Blankenberg
had
become
almost
as
public
as
the
duel
,
and
Lord
Fawn
's
courtship
had
not
been
altogether
hidden
from
the
public
eye
.
<EOS>
He
on
the
present
occasion
might
probably
be
able
to
carry
himself
better
than
Phineas
,
even
presuming
him
to
be
equally
eager
in
his
love
,
 
for
he
knew
nothing
of
the
fatal
truth
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
unable
to
hear
Mrs.
Bonteen
's
statement
with
indifference
,
and
showed
his
concern
in
the
matter
by
his
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Any
lady
will
be
much
to
be
pitied
,
"
he
said
,
"
who
does
that
.
<EOS>
Chiltern
is
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
whom
I
would
wish
to
trust
the
happiness
of
a
woman
for
whom
I
cared
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Chiltern
is
a
very
good
fellow
,
"
said
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
a
little
wild
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
never
had
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
in
his
life
,
"
said
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
regard
him
as
simply
a
madman
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
wish
I
knew
him
,
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
fond
of
madmen
,
and
men
who
have
n't
shillings
,
and
who
are
a
little
wild
,
Could
you
not
bring
him
here
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
or
how
to
open
his
mouth
without
showing
his
deep
concern
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
happy
to
ask
him
if
you
wish
it
,
"
he
replied
,
as
though
the
question
had
been
put
to
him
in
earnest
;
"
but
I
do
not
see
so
much
of
Lord
Chiltern
as
I
used
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
believe
that
Violet
Effingham
will
accept
him
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
before
he
spoke
,
and
then
made
his
answer
in
a
deep
solemn
voice
,
 
with
a
seriousness
which
he
was
unable
to
repress
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
accepted
him
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
you
know
it
?
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
mean
that
I
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Had
anybody
told
him
beforehand
that
he
would
openly
make
this
declaration
at
Madame
Goesler
's
table
,
he
would
have
said
that
of
all
things
it
was
the
most
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
declared
that
nothing
would
have
induced
him
to
speak
of
Violet
Effingham
in
his
existing
frame
of
mind
,
and
that
he
would
have
had
his
tongue
cut
out
before
he
spoke
of
her
as
the
promised
bride
of
his
rival
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
had
declared
the
whole
truth
of
his
own
wretchedness
and
discomfiture
.
<EOS>
He
was
well
aware
that
all
of
them
there
knew
why
he
had
fought
the
duel
at
Blankenberg
;
 
<EOS>
all
,
that
is
,
except
perhaps
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
And
he
felt
as
he
made
the
statement
as
to
Lord
Chiltern
that
he
blushed
up
to
his
forehead
,
and
that
his
voice
was
strange
,
and
that
he
was
telling
the
tale
of
his
own
disgrace
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
direct
question
had
been
asked
him
he
had
been
unable
to
refrain
from
answering
it
directly
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
of
turning
it
off
with
some
jest
or
affectation
of
drollery
,
but
had
failed
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
he
had
been
unable
not
to
speak
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
 
who
also
forgot
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
believe
it
,
if
Mr.
Finn
says
so
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
who
rather
liked
the
confusion
she
had
caused
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
who
could
have
told
you
,
Finn
?
"
asked
Mr.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
sister
,
Lady
Laura
,
told
me
so
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
must
be
true
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
impossible
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
may
say
that
I
know
that
it
is
impossible
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
so
,
it
would
be
a
most
shameful
arrangement
.
<EOS>
Every
shilling
she
has
in
the
world
would
be
swallowed
up
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Lord
Fawn
in
making
his
proposals
had
been
magnanimous
in
his
offers
as
to
settlements
and
pecuniary
provisions
generally
.
  
<EOS>
For
some
minutes
after
that
Phineas
did
not
speak
another
word
,
and
the
conversation
generally
was
not
so
brisk
and
bright
as
it
was
expected
to
be
at
Madame
Goesler
's
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
herself
thoroughly
understood
our
hero
's
position
,
and
felt
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
encouraged
no
questionings
about
Violet
Effingham
<EOS>
had
she
thought
that
they
would
have
led
to
such
a
result
,
and
now
she
exerted
herself
to
turn
the
minds
of
her
guests
to
other
subjects
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
succeeded
;
and
after
a
while
,
too
,
Phineas
himself
was
able
to
talk
.
<EOS>
He
drank
two
or
three
glasses
of
wine
,
and
dashed
away
into
politics
,
taking
the
earliest
opportunity
in
his
power
of
contradicting
Lord
Fawn
very
plainly
on
one
or
two
matters
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
was
of
course
of
opinion
that
the
ministry
could
not
stay
in
long
.
<EOS>
Since
he
had
left
the
Government
the
ministers
had
made
wonderful
mistakes
,
and
he
spoke
of
them
quite
as
an
enemy
might
speak
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
Fitz
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
,
"
you
used
to
be
so
staunch
a
supporter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
the
error
of
my
way
,
I
can
assure
you
,
"
said
Laurence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
observe
,
"
said
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
"
that
when
any
of
you
gentlemen
resign
,
 
which
you
usually
do
on
some
very
trivial
matter
,
 
the
resigning
gentleman
becomes
of
all
foes
the
bitterest
.
<EOS>
Somebody
goes
on
very
well
with
his
friends
,
agreeing
most
cordially
about
everything
,
till
he
finds
that
his
public
virtue
can
not
swallow
some
little
detail
,
and
then
he
resigns
.
<EOS>
Or
some
one
,
perhaps
,
on
the
other
side
has
attacked
him
,
and
in
the
mêlée
he
is
hurt
,
and
so
he
resigns
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
has
resigned
,
and
made
his
parting
speech
full
of
love
and
gratitude
,
I
know
well
after
that
where
to
look
for
the
bitterest
hostility
to
his
late
friends
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
am
beginning
to
understand
the
way
in
which
politics
are
done
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
rather
severe
upon
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
;
but
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
,
and
bore
it
better
than
Phineas
had
borne
his
defeat
.
  
<EOS>
The
dinner
,
taken
altogether
,
was
not
a
success
,
and
so
Madame
Goesler
understood
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
,
after
he
had
been
contradicted
by
Phineas
,
hardly
opened
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
Phineas
himself
talked
rather
too
much
and
rather
too
loudly
;
and
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
who
was
well
enough
inclined
to
flatter
Lord
Fawn
,
contradicted
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
made
a
mistake
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
afterwards
,
"
in
having
four
members
of
Parliament
who
all
of
them
were
or
had
been
in
office
.
<EOS>
I
never
will
have
two
men
in
office
together
again
.
<EOS>
"
This
she
said
to
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Madame
Max
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
"
your
resolution
ought
to
be
that
you
will
never
again
have
two
claimants
for
the
same
young
lady
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
drawing
-
room
up
-
stairs
Madame
Goesler
managed
to
be
alone
for
three
minutes
with
Phineas
Finn
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
is
as
you
say
,
my
friend
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
was
plaintive
and
soft
,
and
there
was
a
look
of
real
sympathy
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
Phineas
almost
felt
that
if
they
two
had
been
quite
alone
he
could
have
told
her
everything
,
and
have
wept
at
her
feet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
,
"
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
doubted
it
when
you
had
declared
it
.
<EOS>
May
I
venture
to
say
that
I
wish
it
had
been
otherwise
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
now
,
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
course
is
a
fool
to
show
that
he
has
any
feelings
in
such
a
matter
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
heard
it
just
before
I
came
here
,
and
had
made
up
my
mind
to
send
you
an
excuse
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
say
that
,
Mr.
Finn
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
such
an
ass
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
my
estimation
you
have
done
yourself
honour
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
may
venture
to
give
you
counsel
,
do
not
speak
of
this
affair
again
as
though
you
had
been
personally
concerned
in
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
world
now
-
a
-
days
the
only
thing
disgraceful
is
to
admit
a
failure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
failed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
need
not
admit
it
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
ought
not
to
say
as
much
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
rather
,
am
deeply
indebted
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
now
,
Madame
Goesler
,
as
I
do
not
wish
to
leave
the
house
with
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
come
and
see
me
soon
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
promised
that
he
would
come
soon
;
and
felt
as
he
made
the
promise
that
he
would
have
an
opportunity
of
talking
over
his
love
with
his
new
friend
at
any
rate
without
fresh
shame
as
to
his
failure
.
  
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
went
away
with
Phineas
,
and
Mr.
Bonteen
,
having
sent
his
wife
away
by
herself
,
walked
off
towards
the
clubs
with
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
anxious
to
have
a
few
words
with
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
Lord
Fawn
had
evidently
been
annoyed
by
Phineas
,
and
Mr.
Bonteen
did
not
at
all
love
the
young
Under
-
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
That
fellow
has
become
the
most
consummate
puppy
I
ever
met
,
"
said
he
,
as
he
linked
himself
on
to
the
lord
,
"
Monk
,
and
one
or
two
others
among
them
,
have
contrived
to
spoil
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
what
he
said
about
Lord
Chiltern
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
his
marriage
with
Miss
Effingham
?
"
  
"
It
would
be
such
an
abominable
shame
to
sacrifice
the
girl
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
Everything
is
gone
.
<EOS>
The
man
is
a
drunkard
,
and
I
do
n't
believe
he
is
any
more
reconciled
to
his
father
than
you
are
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
must
have
had
some
object
in
saying
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perhaps
an
invention
of
Finn
's
altogether
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
Those
Irish
fellows
are
just
the
men
for
that
kind
of
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
,
you
know
,
so
violent
that
nobody
can
hold
him
,
"
said
Lord
Fawn
,
thinking
of
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
so
absurdly
conceited
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
,
thinking
of
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
who
has
never
done
anything
,
with
all
his
advantages
in
the
world
,
 
and
never
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
hold
his
place
long
,
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whom
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
was
talking
of
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Finn
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
a
fellow
,
and
he
is
undoubtedly
clever
.
<EOS>
They
say
Cantrip
likes
him
amazingly
.
<EOS>
He
'll
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
this
about
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Bonteen
felt
himself
to
be
snubbed
,
and
soon
afterwards
left
Lord
Fawn
alone
.
   
<EOS>
Consolation
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
following
Madame
Goesler
's
dinner
party
,
Phineas
,
though
he
was
early
at
his
office
,
was
not
able
to
do
much
work
,
still
feeling
that
as
regarded
the
realities
of
the
world
,
his
back
was
broken
.
<EOS>
He
might
no
doubt
go
on
learning
,
and
,
after
a
time
,
might
be
able
to
exert
himself
in
a
perhaps
useful
,
but
altogether
uninteresting
kind
of
way
,
doing
his
work
simply
because
it
was
there
to
be
done
,
 
as
the
carter
or
the
tailor
does
his
;
 
and
from
the
same
cause
,
knowing
that
a
man
must
have
bread
to
live
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
ambition
,
and
the
idea
of
doing
good
,
and
the
love
of
work
for
work
's
sake
,
 
as
for
the
elastic
springs
of
delicious
and
beneficent
labour
,
 
all
that
was
over
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
worked
from
day
till
night
,
and
from
night
till
day
,
and
from
month
till
month
throughout
the
year
to
have
secured
for
Violet
Effingham
the
assurance
that
her
husband
's
position
was
worthy
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
had
no
motive
for
such
work
as
this
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
he
took
the
public
pay
,
he
would
earn
it
;
and
that
was
all
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
things
were
a
little
better
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
received
a
note
in
the
morning
from
Lord
Cantrip
saying
that
they
two
were
to
see
the
Prime
Minister
that
evening
,
in
order
that
the
whole
question
of
the
railway
to
the
Rocky
Mountains
might
be
understood
,
and
Phineas
was
driven
to
his
work
.
<EOS>
Before
the
time
of
the
meeting
came
he
had
once
more
lost
his
own
identity
in
great
ideas
of
colonial
welfare
,
and
had
planned
and
peopled
a
mighty
region
on
the
Red
River
,
which
should
have
no
sympathy
with
American
democracy
.
<EOS>
When
he
waited
upon
Mr.
Gresham
in
the
afternoon
he
said
nothing
about
the
mighty
region
;
indeed
,
he
left
it
to
Lord
Cantrip
to
explain
most
of
the
proposed
arrangements
,
 
speaking
only
a
word
or
two
here
<EOS>
and
there
as
occasion
required
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
aware
that
he
had
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
save
himself
from
losing
ground
during
the
interview
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
about
the
first
Irishman
we
've
had
that
has
been
worth
his
salt
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
to
his
colleague
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
other
Irishman
was
a
terrible
fellow
,
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
,
shaking
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
day
after
his
sorrow
had
befallen
him
,
Phineas
went
again
to
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
And
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
balked
in
his
search
for
sympathy
he
wrote
a
line
to
Madame
Goesler
to
ask
if
she
would
be
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
at
home
from
five
to
six
,
 
and
alone
.
 
<EOS>
M.
M.
G.
"
<EOS>
That
was
the
answer
from
Marie
Max
Goesler
,
and
Phineas
was
of
course
at
the
cottage
a
few
minutes
after
five
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
,
I
think
,
surprising
that
a
man
when
he
wants
sympathy
in
such
a
calamity
as
that
which
had
now
befallen
Phineas
Finn
,
should
seek
it
from
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Women
sympathise
most
effectually
with
men
,
as
men
do
with
women
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
,
perhaps
,
a
little
odd
that
a
man
when
he
wants
consolation
because
his
heart
has
been
broken
,
always
likes
to
receive
it
from
a
pretty
woman
.
<EOS>
One
would
be
disposed
to
think
that
at
such
a
moment
he
would
be
profoundly
indifferent
to
such
a
matter
,
that
no
delight
could
come
to
him
from
female
beauty
,
and
that
all
he
would
want
would
be
the
softness
of
a
simply
sympathetic
soul
.
<EOS>
But
he
generally
wants
a
soft
hand
as
well
,
and
an
eye
that
can
be
bright
behind
the
mutual
tear
,
and
lips
that
shall
be
young
and
fresh
as
they
express
their
concern
for
his
sorrow
.
<EOS>
All
these
things
were
added
to
Phineas
when
he
went
to
Madame
Goesler
in
his
grief
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
,
"
said
Madame
Max
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
-
natured
to
let
me
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
but
<EOS>
it
is
so
good
of
you
to
trust
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
sure
you
would
come
after
what
took
place
the
other
night
.
<EOS>
I
saw
that
you
were
pained
,
and
I
was
so
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
made
such
a
fool
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
And
I
thought
that
you
were
right
to
tell
them
when
the
question
had
been
asked
.
<EOS>
If
the
thing
was
not
to
be
kept
a
secret
,
it
was
better
to
speak
it
out
.
<EOS>
You
will
get
over
it
quicker
in
that
way
than
in
any
other
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
seen
the
young
lord
,
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
there
is
nothing
amiss
about
him
.
<EOS>
As
to
what
Lord
Fawn
said
,
the
half
of
it
is
simply
exaggeration
,
and
the
other
half
is
misunderstood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
country
it
is
so
much
to
be
a
lord
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
thought
a
moment
of
that
matter
before
he
replied
.
<EOS>
All
the
Standish
family
had
been
very
good
to
him
,
and
Violet
Effingham
had
been
very
good
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
fault
of
any
of
them
that
he
was
now
wretched
and
back
-
broken
.
<EOS>
He
had
meditated
much
on
this
,
and
had
resolved
that
he
would
not
even
think
evil
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
in
my
heart
believe
that
that
has
had
anything
to
do
with
it
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
has
,
my
friend
,
 
always
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
your
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
 
I
do
not
know
this
Violet
that
is
not
yours
.
<EOS>
I
have
met
her
,
and
did
not
specially
admire
her
.
<EOS>
But
then
the
tastes
of
men
and
women
about
beauty
are
never
the
same
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
she
is
one
that
always
lives
with
lords
and
countesses
.
<EOS>
A
girl
who
always
lived
with
countesses
feels
it
to
be
hard
to
settle
down
as
a
plain
Mistress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
had
plenty
of
choice
among
all
sorts
of
men
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
title
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
accepted
Chiltern
unless
she
had
 
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
the
use
of
talking
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
had
known
each
other
long
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
,
 
as
children
.
<EOS>
And
the
Earl
desired
it
of
all
things
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
then
he
arranged
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
exactly
.
<EOS>
Nobody
could
arrange
anything
for
Chiltern
,
 
nor
,
as
far
as
that
goes
,
for
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
They
arranged
it
themselves
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
asked
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
twice
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
refused
him
more
than
twice
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
for
which
to
blame
her
;
but
yet
I
had
thought
,
 
I
had
thought
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
is
a
jilt
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
will
not
let
you
say
that
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
is
no
jilt
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
she
has
been
strangely
ignorant
of
her
own
mind
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
use
of
talking
of
it
,
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
;
 
<EOS>
only
sometimes
it
is
better
to
speak
a
word
,
than
to
keep
one
's
sorrow
to
oneself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
;
 
and
there
is
not
one
in
the
world
to
whom
I
can
speak
such
a
word
,
except
yourself
.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
odd
?
<EOS>
I
have
sisters
,
but
they
have
never
heard
of
Miss
Effingham
,
and
would
be
quite
indifferent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
they
have
some
other
favourites
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
well
.
<EOS>
That
does
not
matter
,
And
my
best
friend
here
in
London
is
Lord
Chiltern
's
own
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
knew
of
your
attachment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
"
  
"
And
she
told
you
of
Miss
Effingham
's
engagement
.
<EOS>
Was
she
glad
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
always
desired
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
think
she
would
have
been
satisfied
had
it
been
otherwise
.
<EOS>
But
of
course
her
heart
must
be
with
her
brother
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
have
troubled
myself
to
go
to
Blankenberg
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
for
the
best
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Everybody
says
you
behaved
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
but
go
,
as
things
were
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
if
you
had
 
shot
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
would
have
been
an
end
of
everything
.
<EOS>
She
would
never
have
seen
me
after
that
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
should
have
shot
myself
next
,
feeling
that
there
was
nothing
else
left
for
me
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
you
English
are
so
peculiar
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
it
is
best
not
to
shoot
a
man
.
<EOS>
And
,
Mr.
Finn
,
there
are
other
ladies
in
the
world
prettier
than
Miss
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
No
;
 
of
course
you
will
not
admit
that
now
.
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
,
and
for
a
month
or
two
,
she
is
peerless
,
and
you
will
feel
yourself
to
be
of
all
men
the
most
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
the
ball
at
your
feet
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
one
so
young
who
has
got
the
ball
at
his
feet
so
well
.
<EOS>
I
call
it
nothing
to
have
the
ball
at
your
feet
if
you
are
born
with
it
there
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
easy
to
be
a
lord
if
your
father
is
one
before
you
,
 
and
so
easy
to
marry
a
pretty
girl
if
you
can
make
her
a
countess
.
<EOS>
But
to
make
yourself
a
lord
,
or
to
be
as
good
as
a
lord
,
when
nothing
has
been
born
to
you
,
 
that
I
call
very
much
.
<EOS>
And
there
are
women
,
and
pretty
women
too
,
Mr.
Finn
,
who
have
spirit
enough
to
understand
this
,
and
to
think
that
the
man
,
after
all
,
is
more
important
than
the
lord
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
sang
the
old
well
-
worn
verse
of
the
Scotch
song
with
wonderful
spirit
,
and
with
a
clearness
of
voice
and
knowledge
of
music
for
which
he
had
hitherto
never
given
her
credit
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
prince
can
mak
'
a
belted
knight
,
A
marquis
,
duke
,
and
a
'
that
;
But
an
honest
man
's
aboon
his
might
,
Guid
faith
<EOS>
he
mauna
fa
'
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
that
you
sung
,
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
now
and
then
when
something
specially
requires
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
very
fond
of
Scotch
songs
.
<EOS>
I
will
sing
to
you
now
if
you
like
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
sang
the
whole
song
,
 
"
A
man
's
a
man
for
a
'
that
,
"
she
said
as
she
finished
.
<EOS>
"
Even
though
he
can
not
get
the
special
bit
of
painted
Eve
's
flesh
for
which
his
heart
has
had
a
craving
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
sang
again
:
    
"
There
are
maidens
in
Scotland
more
lovely
by
far
,
Who
would
gladly
be
bride
to
the
young
Lochinvar
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
young
Lochinvar
got
his
bride
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
the
spirit
of
the
lines
,
Mr.
Finn
,
which
is
true
;
and
not
the
tale
as
it
is
told
,
which
is
probably
false
.
<EOS>
I
often
think
that
Jock
of
Hazledean
,
and
young
Lochinvar
too
,
probably
lived
to
repent
their
bargains
.
<EOS>
We
will
hope
that
Lord
Chiltern
may
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
never
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
right
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
you
,
do
you
for
a
while
think
of
your
politics
,
and
your
speeches
,
and
your
colonies
,
rather
than
of
your
love
.
<EOS>
You
are
at
home
there
,
and
no
Lord
Chiltern
can
rob
you
of
your
success
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
are
down
in
the
mouth
,
come
to
me
,
and
I
will
sing
you
a
Scotch
song
.
<EOS>
And
,
look
you
,
the
next
time
I
ask
you
to
dinner
I
will
promise
you
that
Mrs.
Bonteen
shall
not
be
here
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
"
<EOS>
She
gave
him
her
hand
,
which
was
very
soft
,
and
left
it
for
a
moment
in
his
,
and
he
was
consoled
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
,
when
she
was
alone
,
threw
herself
on
to
her
chair
and
began
to
think
of
things
.
<EOS>
In
these
days
she
would
often
ask
herself
what
in
truth
was
the
object
of
her
ambition
,
and
the
aim
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Now
at
this
moment
she
had
in
her
hand
a
note
from
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
had
allowed
himself
to
say
something
about
a
photograph
,
which
had
justified
her
in
writing
to
him
,
 
or
which
she
had
taken
for
such
justification
.
<EOS>
And
the
Duke
had
replied
.
<EOS>
"
He
would
not
,
"
he
said
,
"
lose
the
opportunity
of
waiting
upon
her
in
person
which
the
presentation
of
the
little
gift
might
afford
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
great
success
to
have
the
Duke
of
Omnium
at
her
house
,
 
but
to
what
would
the
success
reach
?
<EOS>
What
was
her
definite
object
,
 
or
had
she
any
?
<EOS>
In
what
way
could
she
make
herself
happy
?
<EOS>
She
could
not
say
that
she
was
happy
yet
.
<EOS>
The
hours
with
her
were
too
long
and
the
days
too
many
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Omnium
should
come
,
 
if
he
would
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
quite
resolved
as
to
this
,
 
that
if
the
Duke
did
come
she
would
not
be
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
Heavens
and
earth
!
<EOS>
What
would
be
the
feelings
of
such
a
woman
as
her
,
were
the
world
to
greet
her
some
fine
morning
as
Duchess
of
Omnium
!
<EOS>
Then
she
made
up
her
mind
very
resolutely
on
one
subject
.
<EOS>
Should
the
Duke
give
her
any
opportunity
she
would
take
a
very
short
time
in
letting
him
know
what
was
the
extent
of
her
ambition
.
   
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
at
Saulsby
 
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
did
exactly
as
he
said
he
would
do
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
to
his
father
as
he
passed
through
Carlisle
,
and
at
once
went
on
to
his
hunting
at
Willingford
.
<EOS>
But
his
letter
was
very
stiff
and
ungainly
,
and
it
may
be
doubted
whether
Miss
Effingham
was
not
wrong
in
refusing
the
offer
which
he
had
made
to
her
as
to
the
dictation
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
began
his
letter
,
"
My
Lord
,
"
and
did
not
much
improve
the
style
as
he
went
on
with
it
.
<EOS>
The
reader
may
as
well
see
the
whole
letter
;
    
Railway
Hotel
,
Carlisle
,
December
27
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
MY
LORD
,
  
<EOS>
I
am
now
on
my
way
from
Loughlinter
to
London
,
and
write
this
letter
to
you
in
compliance
with
a
promise
made
by
me
to
my
sister
and
to
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
I
have
asked
Violet
to
be
my
wife
,
and
she
has
accepted
me
,
and
they
think
that
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
this
has
been
done
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
,
of
course
,
obliged
,
if
you
will
instruct
Mr.
Edwards
to
let
me
know
what
you
would
propose
to
do
in
regard
to
settlements
.
<EOS>
Laura
thinks
that
you
will
wish
to
see
both
Violet
and
myself
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
can
only
say
that
,
should
you
desire
me
to
come
,
I
will
do
so
on
receiving
your
assurance
that
I
shall
be
treated
neither
with
fatted
calves
nor
with
reproaches
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
aware
that
I
have
deserved
either
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
,
my
lord
,
yours
affect
.
<EOS>
,
  
CHILTERN
.
  
<EOS>
P.S.
 
<EOS>
My
address
will
be
"
The
Bull
,
Willingford
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
last
word
,
in
which
he
half
-
declared
himself
to
be
joined
in
affectionate
relations
to
his
father
,
caused
him
a
world
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
find
no
term
for
expressing
,
without
a
circumlocution
which
was
disagreeable
to
him
,
exactly
that
position
of
feeling
towards
his
father
which
really
belonged
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
written
"
yours
with
affection
,
"
or
"
yours
with
deadly
enmity
,
"
or
"
yours
with
respect
,
"
or
"
yours
with
most
profound
indifference
,
"
exactly
in
accordance
with
the
state
of
his
father
's
mind
,
if
he
had
only
known
what
was
that
state
.
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
of
going
beyond
his
father
in
any
offer
of
reconciliation
,
and
was
firmly
fixed
in
his
resolution
that
he
would
never
be
either
repentant
or
submissive
in
regard
to
the
past
.
<EOS>
If
his
father
had
wishes
for
the
future
,
he
would
comply
with
them
if
he
could
do
so
without
unreasonable
inconvenience
,
but
he
would
not
give
way
a
single
point
as
to
things
done
and
gone
.
<EOS>
If
his
father
should
choose
to
make
any
reference
to
them
,
his
father
must
prepare
for
battle
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
was
of
course
disgusted
by
the
pertinacious
obstinacy
of
his
son
's
letter
,
and
for
an
hour
or
two
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
not
answer
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
natural
that
the
father
should
yearn
for
the
son
,
while
the
son
's
feeling
for
the
father
is
of
a
very
much
weaker
nature
.
<EOS>
Here
,
at
any
rate
,
was
that
engagement
made
which
he
had
ever
desired
.
<EOS>
And
his
son
had
made
a
step
,
though
it
was
so
very
unsatisfactory
a
step
,
towards
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
When
the
old
man
read
the
letter
a
second
time
,
he
skipped
that
reference
to
fatted
calves
which
had
been
so
peculiarly
distasteful
to
him
,
and
before
the
evening
had
passed
he
had
answered
his
son
as
follows
;
    
Saulsby
,
December
29
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
CHILTERN
,
  
I
have
received
your
letter
,
and
am
truly
delighted
to
hear
that
dear
Violet
has
accepted
you
as
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Her
fortune
will
be
very
material
to
you
,
but
she
herself
is
better
than
any
fortune
.
<EOS>
You
have
long
known
my
opinion
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
proud
to
welcome
her
as
a
daughter
to
my
house
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
of
course
write
to
her
immediately
,
and
will
endeavour
to
settle
some
early
day
for
her
coming
here
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
done
so
,
I
will
write
to
you
again
,
and
can
only
say
that
I
will
endeavour
to
make
Saulsby
comfortable
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
father
,
  
BRENTFORD
.
  
<EOS>
Richards
,
the
groom
,
is
still
here
.
<EOS>
You
had
perhaps
better
write
to
him
direct
about
your
horses
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
middle
of
February
arrangements
had
all
been
made
,
and
Violet
met
her
lover
at
his
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
She
in
the
meantime
had
been
with
her
aunt
,
and
had
undergone
a
good
deal
of
mild
unceasing
persecution
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Violet
,
"
said
her
aunt
to
her
on
her
arrival
at
Baddingham
,
speaking
with
a
solemnity
that
ought
to
have
been
terrible
to
the
young
lady
,
"
I
do
not
know
what
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
"
how
d'you
do
?
"
aunt
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
about
this
engagement
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
,
with
an
increase
of
awe
-
inspiring
severity
in
her
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
nothing
about
it
at
all
,
if
you
do
n't
like
it
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
say
nothing
about
it
?
<EOS>
How
can
I
be
silent
?
<EOS>
Or
how
am
I
to
congratulate
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
least
said
,
perhaps
,
the
soonest
mended
,
"
and
Violet
smiled
as
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
very
well
,
and
if
I
had
no
duty
to
perform
,
I
would
be
silent
.
<EOS>
But
,
Violet
,
you
have
been
left
in
my
charge
.
<EOS>
If
I
see
you
shipwrecked
in
life
,
I
shall
ever
tell
myself
that
the
fault
has
been
partly
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
aunt
,
that
will
be
quite
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
I
will
always
admit
that
you
did
everything
in
your
power
to
 
to
 
to
 
<EOS>
make
me
run
straight
,
as
the
sporting
men
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sporting
men
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
know
,
aunt
<EOS>
,
I
still
hope
that
I
shall
be
found
to
have
kept
on
the
right
side
of
the
posts
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
that
poor
Lord
Chiltern
is
not
so
black
as
he
is
painted
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
take
anybody
that
is
black
at
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
a
little
shade
in
the
picture
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
looked
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
young
nobleman
beginning
a
career
of
useful
official
life
<EOS>
,
that
will
end
in
 
;
there
is
no
knowing
what
it
may
end
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
not
;
 
but
it
never
could
have
begun
or
ended
in
my
being
Lady
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Appledom
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Mr.
Appledom
.
<EOS>
I
do
like
Mr.
Appledom
.
<EOS>
But
,
you
see
,
aunt
<EOS>
,
I
like
Lord
Chiltern
so
much
better
.
<EOS>
A
young
woman
will
go
by
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
refused
him
a
dozen
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
counted
the
times
,
aunt
;
but
not
quite
so
many
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
same
thing
was
repeated
over
and
over
again
during
the
month
that
Miss
Effingham
remained
at
Baddingham
,
but
Lady
Baldock
had
no
power
of
interfering
,
and
Violet
bore
her
persecution
bravely
.
<EOS>
Her
future
husband
was
generally
spoken
of
as
"
that
violent
young
man
,
"
and
hints
were
thrown
out
as
to
the
personal
injuries
to
which
his
wife
might
be
possibly
subjected
.
<EOS>
But
the
threatened
bride
only
laughed
,
and
spoke
of
these
coming
dangers
as
part
of
the
general
lot
of
married
women
.
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
,
if
the
truth
were
known
,
my
uncle
Baldock
did
not
always
keep
his
temper
,
"
she
once
said
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
truth
was
,
as
Violet
well
knew
,
that
"
my
uncle
Baldock
"
had
been
dumb
as
a
sheep
before
the
shearers
in
the
hands
of
his
wife
,
and
had
never
been
known
to
do
anything
improper
by
those
who
had
been
most
intimate
with
him
even
in
his
earlier
days
.
"
<EOS>
Your
uncle
Baldock
,
miss
,
"
said
the
outraged
aunt
,
"
was
a
nobleman
as
different
in
his
manner
of
life
from
Lord
Chiltern
as
chalk
from
cheese
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
then
comes
the
question
,
which
is
the
cheese
?
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
would
not
argue
the
question
any
further
,
but
stalked
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
met
them
at
Saulsby
,
having
had
something
of
a
battle
with
her
husband
before
she
left
her
home
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
When
she
told
him
of
her
desire
to
assist
at
this
reconciliation
between
her
father
and
brother
,
he
replied
by
pointing
out
that
her
first
duty
was
at
Loughlinter
,
and
before
the
interview
was
ended
had
come
to
express
an
opinion
that
that
duty
was
very
much
neglected
.
<EOS>
She
in
the
meantime
had
declared
that
she
would
go
to
Saulsby
,
or
that
she
would
explain
to
her
father
that
she
was
forbidden
by
her
husband
to
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
also
forbid
any
such
communication
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
which
,
Lady
Laura
told
him
that
there
were
some
marital
commands
which
she
should
not
consider
it
to
be
her
duty
to
obey
.
<EOS>
When
matters
had
come
to
this
pass
,
it
may
be
conceived
that
both
Mr.
Kennedy
and
his
wife
were
very
unhappy
.
<EOS>
She
had
almost
resolved
that
she
would
take
steps
to
enable
her
to
live
apart
from
her
husband
;
and
he
had
begun
to
consider
what
course
he
would
pursue
if
such
steps
were
taken
.
<EOS>
The
wife
was
subject
to
her
husband
by
the
laws
both
of
God
and
man
;
and
Mr.
Kennedy
was
one
who
thought
much
of
such
laws
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Lady
Laura
carried
her
point
and
went
to
Saulsby
,
leaving
her
husband
to
go
up
to
London
and
begin
the
session
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
and
Violet
were
both
at
Saulsby
before
Lord
Chiltern
arrived
,
and
many
were
the
consultations
which
were
held
between
them
as
to
the
best
mode
in
which
things
might
be
arranged
.
<EOS>
Violet
was
of
opinion
that
there
had
better
be
no
arrangement
,
that
Lord
Chiltern
should
be
allowed
to
come
in
and
take
his
father
's
hand
,
and
sit
down
to
dinner
,
 
and
that
so
things
should
fall
into
their
places
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
was
rather
in
favour
of
some
scene
.
<EOS>
But
the
interview
had
taken
place
before
either
of
them
were
able
to
say
a
word
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
on
his
arrival
,
had
gone
immediately
to
his
father
,
taking
the
Earl
very
much
by
surprise
,
and
had
come
off
best
in
the
encounter
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
he
,
walking
up
to
his
father
with
his
hand
out
,
"
I
am
very
glad
to
come
back
to
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
written
to
his
sister
to
say
that
he
would
be
at
Saulsby
on
that
day
,
but
had
named
no
hour
.
<EOS>
He
now
appeared
between
ten
and
eleven
in
the
morning
,
and
his
father
had
as
yet
made
no
preparation
for
him
,
 
had
arranged
no
appropriate
words
.
<EOS>
He
had
walked
in
at
the
front
door
,
and
had
asked
for
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
was
in
his
own
morning
-
room
,
 
a
gloomy
room
,
full
of
dark
books
and
darker
furniture
,
and
thither
Lord
Chiltern
had
at
once
gone
.
<EOS>
The
two
women
still
were
sitting
together
over
the
fire
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
and
knew
nothing
of
his
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
!
"
said
his
father
,
"
I
hardly
expected
you
so
early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
early
.
<EOS>
I
came
across
country
,
and
slept
at
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Violet
is
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
she
is
here
,
 
and
Laura
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
So
am
I.
"
<EOS>
And
the
father
took
the
son
's
hand
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
,
looking
his
father
full
in
the
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
very
much
pleased
by
this
engagement
,
"
continued
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
I
must
be
,
then
?
"
said
the
son
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
at
it
,
you
know
,
off
and
on
,
ever
so
many
years
;
and
have
sometimes
thought
I
was
quite
a
fool
not
to
get
it
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
n't
get
it
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
talks
as
though
it
were
she
who
had
been
in
love
with
me
all
the
time
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
she
was
,
"
said
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
She
may
be
a
little
so
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
mean
that
she
always
shall
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
be
the
worst
husband
in
the
world
,
I
hope
;
and
I
am
quite
sure
I
sha
n't
be
the
best
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
see
her
now
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
shall
find
her
somewhere
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
best
to
see
you
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
half
a
moment
,
Oswald
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
And
then
Lord
Brentford
did
make
something
of
a
shambling
speech
,
in
which
he
expressed
a
hope
that
they
two
might
for
the
future
live
together
on
friendly
terms
,
forgetting
the
past
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
been
prepared
for
the
occasion
,
and
the
speech
was
poor
and
shambling
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
that
it
was
more
useful
than
it
might
have
been
,
had
it
been
uttered
roundly
and
with
that
paternal
and
almost
majestic
effect
which
he
would
have
achieved
had
he
been
thoroughly
prepared
.
<EOS>
But
the
roundness
and
the
majesty
would
have
gone
against
the
grain
with
his
son
,
and
there
would
have
been
a
danger
of
some
outbreak
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
Lord
Chiltern
smiled
,
and
muttered
some
word
about
things
being
"
all
right
,
"
and
then
made
his
way
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
great
deal
better
than
I
had
hoped
,
"
he
said
to
himself
;
"
and
it
has
all
come
from
my
going
in
without
being
announced
.
"
<EOS>
But
there
was
still
a
fear
upon
him
that
his
father
even
yet
might
prepare
a
speech
,
and
speak
it
,
to
the
great
peril
of
their
mutual
comfort
.
  
<EOS>
His
meeting
with
Violet
was
of
course
pleasant
enough
.
<EOS>
Now
that
she
had
succumbed
,
and
had
told
herself
and
had
told
him
that
she
loved
him
,
she
did
not
scruple
to
be
as
generous
as
a
maiden
should
be
who
has
acknowledged
herself
to
be
conquered
,
and
has
rendered
herself
to
the
conqueror
.
<EOS>
She
would
walk
with
him
and
ride
with
him
,
and
take
a
lively
interest
in
the
performances
of
all
his
horses
,
and
listen
to
hunting
stories
as
long
as
he
chose
to
tell
them
.
<EOS>
In
all
this
,
she
was
so
good
and
so
loving
that
Lady
Laura
was
more
than
once
tempted
to
throw
in
her
teeth
her
old
,
often
-
repeated
assertions
,
that
she
was
not
prone
to
be
in
love
,
 
that
it
was
not
her
nature
to
feel
any
ardent
affection
for
a
man
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
she
would
probably
remain
unmarried
.
<EOS>
"
You
begrudge
me
my
little
bits
of
pleasure
,
"
Violet
said
,
in
answer
to
one
such
attack
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
so
odd
to
see
you
,
of
all
women
,
become
so
love
-
lorn
,
<EOS>
"
"
I
am
not
love
-
lorn
,
"
said
Violet
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
like
the
freedom
of
telling
him
everything
and
of
hearing
everything
from
him
,
and
of
having
him
for
my
own
best
friend
.
<EOS>
He
might
go
away
for
twelve
months
,
and
I
should
not
be
unhappy
,
believing
,
as
I
do
,
that
he
would
be
true
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
All
of
which
set
Lady
Laura
thinking
whether
her
friend
had
not
been
wiser
than
she
had
been
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
known
anything
of
that
sort
of
friendship
with
her
husband
which
already
seemed
to
be
quite
established
between
these
two
.
  
<EOS>
In
her
misery
one
day
Lady
Laura
told
the
whole
story
of
her
own
unhappiness
to
her
brother
,
saying
nothing
of
Phineas
Finn
,
 
thinking
nothing
of
him
as
she
told
her
story
,
but
speaking
more
strongly
perhaps
than
she
should
have
done
,
of
the
terrible
dreariness
of
her
life
at
Loughlinter
,
and
of
her
inability
to
induce
her
husband
to
alter
it
for
her
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
he
,
 
ill
-
treats
you
?
"
said
the
brother
,
with
a
scowl
on
his
face
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
would
like
no
task
better
than
that
of
resenting
such
ill
-
treatment
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
not
beat
me
,
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
cruel
to
you
?
<EOS>
Does
he
use
harsh
language
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
said
a
word
in
his
life
either
to
me
or
,
as
I
believe
,
to
any
other
human
being
,
that
he
would
think
himself
bound
to
regret
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
simply
chooses
to
have
his
own
way
,
and
his
way
can
not
be
my
way
.
<EOS>
He
is
hard
,
and
dry
,
and
just
,
and
dispassionate
,
and
he
wishes
me
to
be
the
same
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
fairly
,
Laura
,
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
I
never
could
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
antipathetic
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
then
I
am
not
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
;
 
and
I
suppose
I
must
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
spoken
to
my
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
"
Or
to
Violet
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
she
say
?
<EOS>
She
has
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
Nor
have
you
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
if
I
am
driven
to
leave
him
,
can
I
make
the
world
understand
why
I
do
so
.
<EOS>
To
be
simply
miserable
,
as
I
am
,
is
nothing
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
never
understand
why
you
married
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
be
cruel
to
me
,
Oswald
.
"
  
"
Cruel
!
<EOS>
I
will
stick
by
you
in
any
way
that
you
wish
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
well
of
it
,
I
will
go
off
to
Loughlinter
to
-
morrow
,
and
tell
him
that
you
will
never
return
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
are
not
safe
from
him
here
at
Saulsby
,
you
shall
go
abroad
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Violet
would
not
object
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
cruel
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
in
truth
neither
of
Lady
Laura
's
councillors
was
able
to
give
her
advice
that
could
serve
her
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
could
not
leave
her
husband
without
other
cause
than
now
existed
,
although
she
felt
,
also
,
that
to
go
back
to
him
was
to
go
back
to
utter
wretchedness
.
<EOS>
And
when
she
saw
Violet
and
her
brother
together
there
came
to
her
dreams
of
what
might
have
been
her
own
happiness
<EOS>
had
she
kept
herself
free
from
those
terrible
bonds
in
which
she
was
now
held
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
get
out
of
her
heart
the
remembrance
of
that
young
man
who
would
have
been
her
lover
,
if
she
would
have
let
him
,
 
of
whose
love
for
herself
she
had
been
aware
before
she
had
handed
herself
over
as
a
bale
of
goods
to
her
unloved
,
unloving
husband
.
<EOS>
She
had
married
Mr.
Kennedy
because
she
was
afraid
that
otherwise
she
might
find
herself
forced
to
own
that
she
loved
that
other
man
who
was
then
a
nobody
;
 
almost
nobody
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
Mr.
Kennedy
's
money
that
had
bought
her
.
<EOS>
This
woman
in
regard
to
money
had
shown
herself
to
be
as
generous
as
the
sun
.
<EOS>
But
in
marrying
Mr.
Kennedy
she
had
maintained
herself
in
her
high
position
,
among
the
first
of
her
own
people
,
 
among
the
first
socially
and
among
the
first
politically
.
<EOS>
But
had
she
married
Phineas
,
 
had
she
become
Lady
Laura
Finn
<EOS>
,
 
there
would
have
been
a
great
descent
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
entertained
the
leading
men
of
her
party
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
been
on
a
level
with
the
wives
and
daughters
of
Cabinet
Ministers
.
<EOS>
She
might
,
indeed
,
have
remained
unmarried
!
<EOS>
But
she
knew
that
had
she
done
so
,
 
had
she
so
resolved
,
 
that
which
she
called
her
fancy
would
have
been
too
strong
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
remained
unmarried
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
it
was
her
fate
to
be
either
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
or
Lady
Laura
Finn
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
chosen
to
be
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
To
neither
Violet
Effingham
nor
to
her
brother
<EOS>
could
she
tell
one
half
of
the
sorrow
which
afflicted
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
back
to
Loughlinter
,
"
she
said
to
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
,
unless
you
wish
it
,
"
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
do
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
is
in
London
now
,
and
has
been
there
since
Parliament
met
,
but
he
will
be
in
Scotland
again
in
March
,
and
I
will
go
and
meet
him
there
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
would
do
so
when
I
left
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
go
up
to
London
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
I
must
do
as
he
tells
me
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
What
I
mean
is
,
I
will
try
it
for
another
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
does
not
succeed
,
come
to
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
what
I
will
do
.
<EOS>
I
would
die
if
I
knew
how
.
<EOS>
Never
be
a
tyrant
,
Oswald
;
or
at
any
rate
,
not
a
cold
tyrant
.
<EOS>
And
remember
this
,
there
is
no
tyranny
to
a
woman
like
telling
her
of
her
duty
.
<EOS>
Talk
of
beating
a
woman
!
<EOS>
Beating
might
often
be
a
mercy
.

<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
remained
ten
days
at
Saulsby
,
and
at
last
did
not
get
away
without
a
few
unpleasant
words
with
his
father
,
 
or
without
a
few
words
that
were
almost
unpleasant
with
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
On
his
first
arrival
he
had
told
his
sister
that
he
should
go
on
a
certain
day
,
and
some
intimation
to
this
effect
had
probably
been
conveyed
to
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
But
when
his
son
told
him
one
evening
that
the
post
-
chaise
had
been
ordered
for
seven
o'clock
the
next
morning
,
he
felt
that
his
son
was
ungracious
and
abrupt
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
things
still
to
be
said
,
and
indeed
there
had
been
no
speech
of
any
account
made
at
all
as
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
very
sudden
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
Laura
had
told
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
not
told
me
a
word
lately
.
<EOS>
She
may
have
said
something
before
you
came
here
.
<EOS>
What
is
there
to
hurry
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
ten
days
would
be
as
long
as
you
would
care
to
have
me
here
,
and
as
I
said
that
I
would
be
back
by
the
first
,
I
would
rather
not
change
my
plans
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
going
to
hunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
shall
hunt
till
the
end
of
March
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
might
have
hunted
here
,
Oswald
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
son
made
no
sign
of
changing
his
plans
;
and
the
father
,
seeing
that
he
would
not
change
them
,
became
solemn
and
severe
.
<EOS>
There
were
a
few
words
which
he
must
say
to
his
son
,
 
something
of
a
speech
that
he
must
make
;
 
so
he
led
the
way
into
the
room
with
the
dark
books
and
the
dark
furniture
,
and
pointed
to
a
great
deep
arm
-
chair
for
his
son
's
accommodation
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
did
not
sit
down
himself
,
neither
did
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
understood
very
well
how
great
is
the
advantage
of
a
standing
orator
over
a
sitting
recipient
of
his
oratory
,
and
that
advantage
he
would
not
give
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
hoped
to
have
an
opportunity
of
saying
a
few
words
to
you
about
the
future
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
we
shall
be
married
in
July
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
have
heard
;
 
but
after
that
.
<EOS>
Now
I
do
not
want
to
interfere
,
Oswald
,
and
of
course
the
less
so
,
because
Violet
's
money
will
to
a
great
degree
restore
the
inroads
which
have
been
made
upon
the
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
more
than
restore
them
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
if
her
estate
be
settled
on
a
second
son
,
Oswald
,
and
I
hear
from
Lady
Baldock
that
that
is
the
wish
of
her
relations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
shall
have
her
own
way
,
 
as
she
ought
.
<EOS>
What
that
way
is
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
even
asked
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
asked
me
,
and
I
told
her
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
should
wish
it
to
go
with
the
family
property
.
<EOS>
Of
course
that
would
be
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
shall
have
her
own
way
,
 
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
not
about
that
,
Oswald
,
that
I
would
speak
.
<EOS>
What
are
your
plans
of
life
when
you
are
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Plans
of
life
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
plans
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
some
plans
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
mean
to
apply
yourself
to
some
useful
occupation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
really
,
sir
,
that
I
am
of
much
use
for
any
purpose
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
laughed
as
he
said
this
,
but
did
not
laugh
pleasantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
be
a
drone
in
the
hive
always
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
can
see
,
sir
,
we
who
call
ourselves
lords
generally
are
drones
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
deny
it
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
becoming
quite
energetic
as
he
defended
his
order
.
<EOS>
"
I
deny
it
utterly
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
class
of
men
who
do
work
more
useful
or
more
honest
.
<EOS>
Am
I
a
drone
?
<EOS>
Have
I
been
so
from
my
youth
upwards
?
<EOS>
I
have
always
worked
,
either
in
the
one
House
or
in
the
other
,
and
those
of
my
fellows
with
whom
I
have
been
most
intimate
have
worked
also
.
<EOS>
The
same
career
is
open
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
politics
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
mean
politics
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
politics
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
difference
in
parties
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
should
care
for
politics
,
and
you
should
see
a
difference
in
parties
.
<EOS>
It
is
your
duty
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
My
wish
is
that
you
should
go
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
do
that
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
sir
,
you
have
not
got
a
seat
to
offer
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
managed
matters
among
you
in
such
a
way
that
poor
little
Loughton
has
been
swallowed
up
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
canvass
the
electors
of
Smotherem
,
I
do
n't
think
that
many
would
look
very
sweet
on
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
county
,
Oswald
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
whom
am
I
to
turn
out
?
<EOS>
I
should
spend
four
or
five
thousand
pounds
,
and
have
nothing
but
vexation
in
return
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
rather
not
begin
that
game
,
and
indeed
I
am
too
old
for
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
take
it
up
early
enough
to
believe
in
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
made
the
Earl
very
angry
,
and
from
these
things
they
went
on
to
worse
things
.
<EOS>
When
questioned
again
as
to
the
future
,
Lord
Chiltern
scowled
,
and
at
last
declared
that
it
was
his
idea
to
live
abroad
in
the
summer
for
his
wife
's
recreation
,
and
somewhere
down
in
the
shires
during
the
winter
for
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
would
admit
of
no
purpose
higher
than
recreation
,
and
when
his
father
again
talked
to
him
of
a
nobleman
's
duty
,
he
said
that
he
knew
of
no
other
special
duty
than
that
of
not
exceeding
his
income
.
<EOS>
Then
his
father
made
a
longer
speech
than
before
,
and
at
the
end
of
it
Lord
Chiltern
simply
wished
him
good
night
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
getting
late
,
and
I
've
promised
to
see
Violet
before
I
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
was
off
,
and
Lord
Brentford
was
left
there
,
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
Lord
Chiltern
had
a
discussion
with
Violet
,
which
lasted
nearly
half
the
night
;
and
during
the
discussion
she
told
him
more
than
once
that
he
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
as
I
am
you
must
take
me
,
or
leave
me
,
"
he
said
,
in
anger
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
;
there
is
no
choice
now
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
taken
you
,
and
I
will
stick
by
you
,
 
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
think
you
wrong
,
I
shall
say
so
.
"
<EOS>
He
swore
to
her
as
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
that
she
was
the
finest
,
grandest
,
sweetest
woman
that
ever
the
world
had
produced
.
<EOS>
But
still
there
was
present
on
his
palate
,
when
he
left
her
,
the
bitter
taste
of
her
reprimand
.
   
<EOS>
What
the
People
in
Marylebone
Thought
 
Phineas
Finn
,
when
the
session
began
,
was
still
hard
at
work
upon
his
Canada
bill
,
and
in
his
work
found
some
relief
for
his
broken
back
.
<EOS>
He
went
into
the
matter
with
all
his
energy
,
and
before
the
debate
came
on
,
knew
much
more
about
the
seven
thousand
inhabitants
of
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
square
miles
at
the
back
of
Canada
,
than
he
did
of
the
people
of
London
or
of
County
Clare
.
<EOS>
And
he
found
some
consolation
also
in
the
good
-
nature
of
Madame
Goesler
,
whose
drawing
-
room
was
always
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
talk
freely
now
to
Madame
Goesler
about
Violet
,
and
had
even
ventured
to
tell
her
that
once
,
in
old
days
,
he
had
thought
of
loving
Lady
Laura
Standish
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
those
days
as
being
very
old
;
and
then
he
perhaps
said
some
word
to
her
about
dear
little
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
there
was
not
much
in
his
career
of
which
he
did
not
say
something
to
Madame
Goesler
,
and
that
he
received
from
her
a
good
deal
of
excellent
advice
and
encouragement
in
the
direction
of
his
political
ambition
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
should
work
,
"
she
said
,
 
"
and
you
do
work
.
<EOS>
A
woman
can
only
look
on
,
and
admire
and
long
.
<EOS>
What
is
there
that
I
can
do
?
<EOS>
I
can
learn
to
care
for
these
Canadians
,
just
because
you
care
for
them
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
the
beavers
that
you
told
me
of
,
I
should
have
to
care
for
the
beavers
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
of
course
told
her
that
such
sympathy
from
her
was
all
and
all
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
reader
must
not
on
this
account
suppose
that
he
was
untrue
in
his
love
to
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
His
back
was
altogether
broken
by
his
fall
,
and
he
was
quite
aware
that
such
was
the
fact
.
<EOS>
Not
as
yet
,
at
least
,
had
come
to
him
any
remotest
idea
that
a
cure
was
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Early
in
March
he
heard
that
Lady
Laura
was
up
in
town
,
and
of
course
he
was
bound
to
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
information
was
given
to
him
by
Mr.
Kennedy
himself
,
who
told
him
that
he
had
been
to
Scotland
to
fetch
her
.
<EOS>
In
these
days
there
was
an
acknowledged
friendship
between
these
two
,
but
there
was
no
intimacy
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mr.
Kennedy
was
a
man
who
was
hardly
intimate
with
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
With
Phineas
<EOS>
he
now
and
then
exchanged
a
few
words
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
,
and
when
they
chanced
to
meet
each
other
,
they
met
as
friends
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
had
no
strong
wish
to
see
again
in
his
house
the
man
respecting
whom
he
had
ventured
to
caution
his
wife
;
but
he
was
thoughtful
;
and
thinking
over
it
all
,
he
found
it
better
to
ask
him
there
.
<EOS>
No
one
must
know
that
there
was
any
reason
why
Phineas
should
not
come
to
his
house
;
especially
as
all
the
world
knew
that
Phineas
had
protected
him
from
the
garrotters
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
is
in
town
now
,
"
he
said
;
"
you
must
go
and
see
her
before
long
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
of
course
promised
that
he
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
In
these
days
Phineas
was
beginning
to
be
aware
that
he
had
enemies
,
 
though
he
could
not
understand
why
anybody
should
be
his
enemy
now
that
Violet
Effingham
had
decided
against
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
poor
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
indeed
,
whom
he
had
superseded
at
the
Colonial
Office
,
but
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
to
give
merit
where
merit
was
due
,
felt
no
animosity
against
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
welcome
,
me
boy
;
you
're
welcome
,
 
as
far
as
yourself
goes
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
the
party
,
bedad
,
it
's
rotten
to
the
core
,
and
wo
n't
stand
another
session
.
<EOS>
Mind
,
it
's
I
who
tell
you
so
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
poor
idle
Irishman
,
in
so
speaking
,
spoke
the
truth
as
well
as
he
knew
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
Ratlers
and
the
Bonteens
were
Finn
's
bitter
foes
,
and
did
not
scruple
to
let
him
know
that
such
was
the
case
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
had
scruples
on
the
subject
,
and
in
a
certain
mildly
apologetic
way
still
spoke
well
of
the
young
man
,
whom
he
had
himself
first
introduced
into
political
life
only
four
years
since
;
 
but
there
was
no
earnestness
or
cordiality
in
Barrington
Erle
's
manner
,
and
Phineas
knew
that
his
first
staunch
friend
could
no
longer
be
regarded
as
a
pillar
of
support
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
set
of
men
,
quite
as
influential
,
 
<EOS>
so
Phineas
thought
,
 
as
the
busy
politicians
of
the
club
,
who
were
very
friendly
to
him
.
<EOS>
These
were
men
,
generally
of
high
position
,
of
steady
character
,
 
hard
workers
,
 
who
thought
quite
as
much
of
what
a
man
did
in
his
office
as
what
he
said
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
Lords
Cantrip
,
Thrift
,
and
Fawn
were
of
this
class
,
 
and
they
were
all
very
courteous
to
Phineas
.
<EOS>
Envious
men
began
to
say
of
him
that
he
cared
little
now
for
any
one
of
the
party
who
had
not
a
handle
to
his
name
,
and
that
he
preferred
to
live
with
lords
and
lordlings
.
<EOS>
This
was
hard
upon
him
,
as
the
great
political
ambition
of
his
life
was
to
call
Mr.
Monk
his
friend
;
and
he
would
sooner
have
acted
with
Mr.
Monk
than
with
any
other
man
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
But
though
Mr.
Monk
had
not
deserted
him
,
there
had
come
to
be
little
of
late
in
common
between
the
two
.
<EOS>
His
life
was
becoming
that
of
a
parliamentary
official
rather
than
that
of
a
politician
;
 
<EOS>
whereas
,
though
Mr.
Monk
was
in
office
,
his
public
life
was
purely
political
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
had
great
ideas
of
his
own
which
he
intended
to
hold
,
whether
by
holding
them
he
might
remain
in
office
or
be
forced
out
of
office
;
and
he
was
indifferent
as
to
the
direction
which
things
in
this
respect
might
take
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
Phineas
,
who
had
achieved
his
declared
object
in
getting
into
place
,
felt
that
he
was
almost
constrained
to
adopt
the
views
of
others
,
let
them
be
what
they
might
.
<EOS>
Men
spoke
to
him
,
as
though
his
parliamentary
career
were
wholly
at
the
disposal
of
the
Government
,
 
as
though
he
were
like
a
proxy
in
Mr.
Gresham
's
pocket
,
 
with
this
difference
,
<EOS>
that
when
directed
to
get
up
and
speak
on
a
subject
he
was
bound
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
This
annoyed
him
,
and
he
complained
to
Mr.
Monk
;
but
Mr.
Monk
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
told
him
that
he
must
make
his
choice
.
<EOS>
He
soon
discovered
Mr.
Monk
's
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
choose
to
make
Parliament
a
profession
,
 
as
you
have
chosen
,
 
you
can
have
no
right
even
to
think
of
independence
.
<EOS>
If
the
country
finds
you
out
when
you
are
in
Parliament
,
and
then
invites
you
to
office
,
of
course
the
thing
is
different
.
<EOS>
But
the
latter
is
a
slow
career
,
and
probably
would
not
have
suited
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
was
the
meaning
of
what
Mr.
Monk
said
to
him
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
these
official
and
parliamentary
honours
were
greater
when
seen
at
a
distance
than
he
found
them
to
be
now
that
he
possessed
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
worked
ten
hours
a
day
,
and
could
rarely
call
a
day
his
own
;
but
,
after
all
,
with
all
this
work
,
Mr.
Low
was
less
of
a
slave
,
and
more
independent
,
than
was
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
,
the
friend
of
Cabinet
Ministers
,
and
Member
of
Parliament
since
his
twenty
-
fifth
year
!
<EOS>
He
began
to
dislike
the
House
,
and
to
think
it
a
bore
to
sit
on
the
Treasury
bench
;
 
he
,
who
a
few
years
since
had
regarded
Parliament
as
the
British
heaven
on
earth
,
and
who
,
since
he
had
been
in
Parliament
,
had
looked
at
that
bench
with
longing
envious
eyes
.
<EOS>
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
who
seemed
to
have
as
much
to
eat
and
drink
as
ever
,
and
a
bed
also
to
lie
on
,
could
come
and
go
in
the
House
as
he
pleased
,
since
his
 
resignation
.
  
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
new
trouble
coming
.
<EOS>
The
Reform
Bill
for
England
had
passed
;
but
now
there
was
to
be
another
Reform
Bill
for
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Let
them
pass
what
bill
they
might
,
this
would
not
render
necessary
a
new
Irish
election
till
the
entire
House
should
be
dissolved
.
<EOS>
But
he
feared
that
he
would
be
called
upon
to
vote
for
the
abolition
of
his
own
borough
,
 
and
for
other
points
almost
equally
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
would
not
be
consulted
,
 
but
would
be
called
upon
to
vote
,
and
perhaps
to
speak
;
and
was
certain
that
if
he
did
so
,
there
would
be
war
between
him
and
his
constituents
.
<EOS>
Lord
Tulla
had
already
communicated
to
him
his
ideas
that
,
for
certain
excellent
reasons
,
Loughshane
ought
to
be
spared
.
<EOS>
But
this
evil
was
,
he
hoped
,
a
distant
one
.
<EOS>
It
was
generally
thought
that
,
as
the
English
Reform
Bill
had
been
passed
last
year
,
and
as
the
Irish
bill
,
if
carried
,
could
not
be
immediately
operative
,
the
doing
of
the
thing
might
probably
be
postponed
to
the
next
session
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
first
saw
Lady
Laura
he
was
struck
by
the
great
change
in
her
look
and
manner
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
him
to
be
old
and
worn
,
and
he
judged
her
to
be
wretched
,
 
as
she
was
.
<EOS>
She
had
written
to
him
to
say
that
she
would
be
at
her
father
's
house
on
such
and
such
a
morning
,
and
he
had
gone
to
her
there
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
of
no
use
your
coming
to
Grosvenor
Place
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
nobody
there
,
and
the
house
is
like
a
prison
.
"
<EOS>
Later
in
the
interview
she
told
him
not
to
come
and
dine
there
,
even
though
Mr.
Kennedy
should
ask
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
"
he
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
everything
would
be
stiff
,
and
cold
,
and
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
do
not
wish
to
make
your
way
into
a
lady
's
house
if
she
asks
you
not
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
sort
of
smile
on
her
face
as
she
said
this
,
but
he
could
perceive
that
it
was
a
very
bitter
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
easily
excuse
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
can
excuse
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
do
so
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
particularly
anxious
to
dine
with
Mr.
Kennedy
,
you
can
easily
do
so
at
your
club
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
and
the
words
she
used
,
she
hardly
attempted
to
conceal
her
dislike
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
tell
me
about
Miss
Effingham
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
for
me
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
there
is
;
 
much
to
tell
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
spare
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
deny
to
you
that
I
have
been
hit
hard
,
 
so
hard
,
that
I
have
been
nearly
knocked
down
;
but
it
will
not
hurt
me
now
to
hear
of
it
all
.
<EOS>
Did
she
always
love
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
did
after
her
own
fashion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
think
women
would
be
less
cruel
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
they
knew
how
great
is
the
anguish
they
can
cause
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
she
been
cruel
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
complain
of
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
loved
Chiltern
,
why
did
she
not
tell
him
so
at
once
?
<EOS>
And
why
 
"
  
"
This
is
complaining
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
complain
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
even
think
of
it
,
if
I
could
help
it
.
<EOS>
Are
they
to
be
married
soon
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
July
;
 
so
they
now
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
where
will
they
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
no
one
can
tell
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
they
agree
as
yet
as
to
that
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
has
a
strong
wish
Oswald
will
yield
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
generous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
even
have
had
a
wish
,
 
except
to
have
her
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
pause
for
a
moment
,
and
then
Lady
Laura
answered
him
with
a
touch
of
scorn
in
her
voice
,
 
and
with
some
scorn
,
too
,
in
her
eye
:
 
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
very
well
,
Mr.
Finn
;
but
the
season
will
not
be
over
before
there
is
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
wrong
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
tell
me
that
you
are
already
at
Madame
Goesler
's
feet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
Goesler
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
matters
who
it
is
as
long
as
she
is
young
and
pretty
,
and
has
the
interest
attached
to
her
of
something
more
than
ordinary
position
?
<EOS>
When
men
tell
me
of
the
cruelty
of
women
,
I
think
that
no
woman
can
be
really
cruel
because
no
man
is
capable
of
suffering
.
<EOS>
A
woman
,
if
she
is
thrown
aside
,
does
suffer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
then
,
that
I
am
indifferent
to
Miss
Effingham
?
<EOS>
"
When
he
thus
spoke
,
I
wonder
whether
he
had
forgotten
that
he
had
ever
declared
to
this
very
woman
to
whom
he
was
speaking
,
a
passion
for
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
suits
you
,
Lady
Laura
,
to
be
harsh
to
me
,
but
you
are
not
speaking
your
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
she
lost
all
control
of
herself
,
and
poured
out
to
him
the
real
truth
that
was
in
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
whose
thoughts
did
you
speak
when
you
and
I
were
on
the
braes
of
Loughlinter
?
<EOS>
Am
I
wrong
in
saying
that
change
is
easy
to
you
,
or
have
I
grown
to
be
so
old
that
you
can
talk
to
me
as
though
those
far
-
away
follies
ought
to
be
forgotten
?
<EOS>
Was
it
so
long
ago
?
<EOS>
Talk
of
love
!
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
sir
,
that
your
heart
is
one
in
which
love
can
have
no
durable
hold
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
!
<EOS>
There
may
be
a
dozen
Violets
after
her
,
and
you
will
be
none
the
worse
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
walked
away
from
him
to
the
window
,
and
he
stood
still
,
dumb
,
on
the
spot
that
he
had
occupied
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
now
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
forget
what
has
passed
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
are
a
gentleman
,
and
that
you
will
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
The
strong
idea
of
his
mind
when
he
heard
all
this
was
the
injustice
of
her
attack
,
 
of
the
attack
as
coming
from
her
,
who
had
all
but
openly
acknowledged
that
she
had
married
a
man
whom
she
had
not
loved
because
it
suited
her
to
escape
from
a
man
whom
she
did
love
.
<EOS>
She
was
reproaching
him
now
for
his
fickleness
in
having
ventured
to
set
his
heart
upon
another
woman
,
when
she
herself
had
been
so
much
worse
than
fickle
,
 
so
profoundly
false
!
<EOS>
And
yet
he
could
not
defend
himself
by
accusing
her
.
<EOS>
What
would
she
have
had
of
him
?
<EOS>
What
would
she
have
proposed
to
him
,
had
he
questioned
her
as
to
his
future
,
when
they
were
together
on
the
braes
of
Loughlinter
?
<EOS>
Would
she
not
have
bid
him
to
find
some
one
else
whom
he
could
love
?
<EOS>
Would
she
then
have
suggested
to
him
the
propriety
of
nursing
his
love
for
herself
,
 
for
her
who
was
about
to
become
another
man
's
wife
,
 
for
her
after
she
should
have
become
another
man
's
wife
?
<EOS>
And
yet
because
he
had
not
done
so
,
and
because
she
had
made
herself
wretched
by
marrying
a
man
whom
she
did
not
love
,
she
reproached
him
!
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
tell
her
of
all
this
,
so
he
fell
back
for
his
defence
on
words
which
had
passed
between
them
since
the
day
when
they
had
met
on
the
braes
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
,
"
he
said
,
"
it
is
only
a
month
or
two
since
you
spoke
to
me
as
though
you
wished
that
Violet
Effingham
might
be
my
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
wished
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
said
that
I
wished
it
.
<EOS>
There
are
moments
in
which
we
try
to
give
a
child
any
brick
on
the
chimney
top
for
which
it
may
whimper
.
"
<EOS>
Then
there
was
another
silence
which
she
was
the
first
to
break
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
go
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
have
committed
myself
,
and
of
course
I
would
rather
be
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
would
you
wish
that
I
should
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
you
do
can
be
nothing
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Must
we
be
strangers
,
you
and
I
,
because
there
was
a
time
in
which
we
were
almost
more
than
friends
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
spoken
nothing
about
myself
,
sir
,
 
only
as
I
have
been
drawn
to
do
so
by
your
pretence
of
being
love
-
sick
.
<EOS>
You
can
do
nothing
for
me
,
 
nothing
,
 
nothing
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
possible
that
you
should
do
for
me
?
<EOS>
You
are
not
my
father
,
or
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
she
wanted
him
to
fall
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
supposed
that
had
he
done
so
her
reproaches
would
have
been
hot
and
heavy
on
him
;
but
yet
it
almost
seemed
to
him
as
though
he
had
no
other
alternative
.
<EOS>
No
!
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
her
father
or
her
brother
;
 
nor
could
he
be
her
husband
.
<EOS>
And
at
this
very
moment
,
as
she
knew
,
his
heart
was
sore
with
love
for
another
woman
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
hardly
knew
how
not
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
,
and
swear
,
that
he
would
return
now
and
for
ever
to
his
old
passion
,
hopeless
,
sinful
,
degraded
as
it
would
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
were
possible
for
me
to
do
something
,
"
he
said
,
drawing
near
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
to
be
done
,
"
she
said
,
clasping
her
hands
together
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
me
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
before
me
no
escape
,
no
hope
,
<EOS>
no
prospect
of
relief
,
no
place
of
consolation
.
<EOS>
You
have
everything
before
you
.
<EOS>
You
complain
of
a
wound
!
<EOS>
You
have
at
least
shown
that
such
wounds
with
you
are
capable
of
cure
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
but
feel
that
when
I
hear
your
wailings
,
I
must
be
impatient
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
leave
me
now
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
are
we
to
be
no
longer
friends
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
friendship
can
go
without
intercourse
,
I
shall
always
be
your
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
went
,
and
as
he
walked
down
to
his
office
,
<EOS>
so
intent
was
he
on
that
which
had
just
passed
that
he
hardly
saw
the
people
as
he
met
them
,
or
was
aware
of
the
streets
through
which
his
way
led
him
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
something
in
the
later
words
which
Lady
Laura
had
spoken
that
had
made
him
feel
almost
unconsciously
that
the
injustice
of
her
reproaches
was
not
so
great
as
he
had
at
first
felt
it
to
be
,
and
that
she
had
some
cause
for
her
scorn
.
<EOS>
If
her
case
was
such
as
she
had
so
plainly
described
it
,
what
was
his
plight
as
compared
with
hers
?
<EOS>
He
had
lost
his
Violet
,
and
was
in
pain
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
much
of
suffering
before
him
.
<EOS>
But
though
Violet
were
lost
,
the
world
was
not
all
blank
before
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
told
himself
,
even
in
his
dreariest
moments
,
that
there
was
before
him
"
no
escape
,
no
hope
,
no
prospect
of
relief
,
no
place
of
consolation
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
he
began
to
think
whether
this
must
in
truth
be
the
case
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
What
if
Mr.
Kennedy
were
to
die
?
<EOS>
What
in
such
case
as
that
would
he
do
?
<EOS>
In
ten
or
perhaps
in
five
years
time
might
it
not
be
possible
for
him
to
go
through
the
ceremony
of
falling
upon
his
knees
,
with
stiffened
joints
indeed
,
but
still
with
something
left
of
the
ardour
of
his
old
love
,
of
his
oldest
love
of
all
?
  
<EOS>
As
he
was
thinking
of
this
he
was
brought
up
short
in
his
walk
as
he
was
entering
the
Green
Park
beneath
the
Duke
's
figure
,
by
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
not
be
in
your
office
at
such
an
hour
as
this
,
Finn
,
me
boy
,
 
or
,
at
least
,
not
in
the
House
,
 
or
serving
your
masters
after
some
fashion
?
"
said
the
late
Under
-
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
on
a
message
to
Marylebone
,
to
find
what
the
people
there
think
about
the
Canadas
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
they
think
about
the
Canadas
in
Marylebone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
one
man
in
a
thousand
cares
whether
the
Canadians
prosper
or
fail
to
prosper
.
<EOS>
They
care
that
Canada
should
not
go
to
the
States
,
because
,
 
though
they
do
n't
love
the
Canadians
,
they
do
hate
the
Americans
.
<EOS>
That
's
about
the
feeling
in
Marylebone
,
 
<EOS>
and
it
's
astonishing
how
like
the
Maryleboners
are
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
what
a
fellow
you
are
for
an
Under
-
Secretary
!
<EOS>
You
've
heard
the
news
about
little
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
news
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
has
quarrelled
with
Chiltern
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
says
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
mind
who
says
so
,
but
they
tell
me
it
's
true
.
<EOS>
Take
an
old
friend
's
advice
,
and
strike
while
the
iron
's
hot
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
believe
what
he
had
heard
,
but
though
he
did
not
believe
it
,
still
the
tidings
set
his
heart
beating
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
believed
it
less
perhaps
had
he
known
that
Laurence
had
just
received
the
news
from
Mrs.
Bonteen
.
   
<EOS>
The
Top
Brick
of
the
Chimney
 
Madame
Max
Goesler
was
a
lady
who
knew
that
in
fighting
the
battles
which
fell
to
her
lot
,
in
arranging
the
social
difficulties
which
she
found
in
her
way
,
in
doing
the
work
of
the
world
which
came
to
her
share
,
very
much
more
care
was
necessary
,
 
and
care
too
about
things
apparently
trifling
,
 
than
was
demanded
by
the
affairs
of
people
in
general
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
not
the
case
so
much
on
account
of
any
special
disadvantage
under
which
she
laboured
,
as
because
she
was
ambitious
of
doing
the
very
uttermost
with
those
advantages
which
she
possessed
.
<EOS>
Her
own
birth
had
not
been
high
,
and
that
of
her
husband
,
we
may
perhaps
say
,
had
been
very
low
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
old
when
she
had
married
him
,
and
she
had
had
little
power
of
making
any
progress
till
he
had
left
her
a
widow
.
<EOS>
Then
she
found
herself
possessed
of
money
,
certainly
;
of
wit
,
 
as
she
believed
;
and
of
a
something
in
her
personal
appearance
which
,
as
she
plainly
told
herself
,
she
might
perhaps
palm
off
upon
the
world
as
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
woman
who
did
not
flatter
herself
,
who
did
not
strongly
believe
in
herself
,
who
could
even
bring
herself
to
wonder
that
men
and
women
in
high
position
should
condescend
to
notice
such
a
one
as
her
.
<EOS>
With
all
her
ambition
,
there
was
a
something
of
genuine
humility
about
her
;
and
with
all
the
hardness
she
had
learned
there
was
a
touch
of
womanly
softness
which
would
sometimes
obtrude
itself
upon
her
heart
.
<EOS>
When
she
found
a
woman
really
kind
to
her
,
she
would
be
very
kind
in
return
.
<EOS>
And
though
she
prized
wealth
,
and
knew
that
her
money
was
her
only
rock
of
strength
,
she
could
be
lavish
with
it
,
as
though
it
were
dirt
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
highly
ambitious
,
and
she
played
her
game
with
great
skill
and
great
caution
.
<EOS>
Her
doors
were
not
open
to
all
callers
;
 
were
shut
even
to
some
who
find
but
few
doors
closed
against
them
;
 
were
shut
occasionally
to
those
whom
she
most
specially
wished
to
see
within
them
.
<EOS>
She
knew
how
to
allure
by
denying
,
and
to
make
the
gift
rich
by
delaying
it
.
<EOS>
We
are
told
by
the
Latin
proverb
that
he
who
gives
quickly
gives
twice
;
but
I
say
that
she
who
gives
quickly
seldom
gives
more
than
half
.
<EOS>
When
in
the
early
spring
the
Duke
of
Omnium
first
knocked
at
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
door
,
he
was
informed
that
she
was
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
felt
very
cross
as
he
handed
his
card
out
from
his
dark
green
brougham
,
 
on
the
panel
of
which
there
was
no
blazon
to
tell
the
owner
's
rank
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
cross
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
him
that
she
was
always
at
home
between
four
and
six
on
a
Thursday
.
<EOS>
He
had
condescended
to
remember
the
information
,
and
had
acted
upon
it
,
 
and
now
she
was
not
at
home
!
<EOS>
She
was
not
at
home
,
though
he
had
come
on
a
Thursday
at
the
very
hour
she
had
named
to
him
.
<EOS>
Any
duke
would
have
been
cross
,
but
the
Duke
of
Omnium
was
particularly
cross
.
<EOS>
No
;
 
he
certainly
would
give
himself
no
further
trouble
by
going
to
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
And
yet
Madame
Max
Goesler
had
been
in
her
own
drawing
-
room
,
while
the
Duke
was
handing
out
his
card
from
the
brougham
below
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
there
came
to
him
a
note
from
the
cottage
,
 
such
a
pretty
note
!
 
<EOS>
so
penitent
,
so
full
of
remorse
,
 
and
,
which
was
better
still
,
so
laden
with
disappointment
,
that
he
forgave
her
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
DUKE
,
  
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
how
to
apologise
to
you
,
after
having
told
you
that
I
am
always
at
home
on
Thursdays
;
and
I
was
at
home
yesterday
when
you
called
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
unwell
,
and
I
had
told
the
servant
to
deny
me
,
not
thinking
how
much
I
might
be
losing
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
indeed
,
I
would
not
have
given
way
to
a
silly
headache
,
<EOS>
had
I
thought
that
your
Grace
would
have
been
here
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
that
now
I
must
not
even
hope
for
the
photograph
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
penitently
,
  
MARIE
M.
G.
  
<EOS>
The
note
-
paper
was
very
pretty
note
-
paper
,
hardly
scented
,
and
yet
conveying
a
sense
of
something
sweet
,
and
the
monogram
was
small
and
new
,
and
fantastic
without
being
grotesque
,
and
the
writing
was
of
that
sort
which
the
Duke
,
having
much
experience
,
had
learned
to
like
,
 
and
there
was
something
in
the
signature
which
pleased
him
.
<EOS>
So
he
wrote
a
reply
,
    
DEAR
MADAME
MAX
GOESLER
,
  
I
will
call
again
next
Thursday
,
or
,
<EOS>
if
prevented
,
will
let
you
know
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
faithfully
,
  
O.
  
<EOS>
When
the
green
brougham
drew
up
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
on
the
next
Thursday
,
Madame
Goesler
was
at
home
,
and
had
no
headache
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
not
at
all
penitent
now
.
<EOS>
She
had
probably
studied
the
subject
,
and
had
resolved
that
penitence
was
more
alluring
in
a
letter
than
when
acted
in
person
.
<EOS>
She
received
her
guest
with
perfect
ease
,
and
apologised
for
the
injury
done
to
him
in
the
preceding
week
,
with
much
self
-
complacency
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
so
sorry
when
I
got
your
card
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
yet
I
am
so
glad
now
that
you
were
refused
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
ill
,
"
said
the
Duke
,
"
it
was
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
horribly
ill
,
to
tell
the
truth
;
 
as
pale
as
a
death
's
head
,
and
without
a
word
to
say
for
myself
.
<EOS>
I
was
fit
to
see
no
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
of
course
you
were
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
flashed
upon
me
immediately
that
I
had
named
a
day
,
and
that
you
had
been
kind
enough
to
remember
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
think
you
came
to
London
till
the
March
winds
were
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
March
winds
blow
everywhere
in
this
wretched
island
,
Madame
Goesler
,
and
there
is
no
escaping
them
.
<EOS>
Youth
may
prevail
against
them
;
but
on
me
they
are
so
potent
that
I
think
they
will
succeed
in
driving
me
out
of
my
country
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
an
old
man
should
ever
live
in
England
if
he
can
help

The
Duke
certainly
was
an
old
man
,
if
a
man
turned
of
seventy
be
old
;
 
and
he
was
a
man
too
who
did
not
bear
his
years
with
hearty
strength
.
<EOS>
He
moved
slowly
,
and
turned
his
limbs
,
when
he
did
turn
them
,
as
though
the
joints
were
stiff
in
their
sockets
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
nevertheless
about
him
a
dignity
of
demeanour
,
a
majesty
of
person
,
and
an
upright
carriage
which
did
not
leave
an
idea
of
old
age
as
the
first
impress
on
the
minds
of
those
who
encountered
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
He
was
tall
and
moved
without
a
stoop
;
and
though
he
moved
slowly
,
he
had
learned
to
seem
so
to
do
because
it
was
the
proper
kind
of
movement
for
one
so
high
up
in
the
world
as
himself
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
his
tailor
did
something
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
long
under
Madame
Max
Goesler
's
eyes
before
she
perceived
that
his
tailor
had
done
a
good
deal
for
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
alluded
to
his
own
age
and
to
her
youth
,
she
said
some
pleasant
little
word
as
to
the
difference
between
oak
-
trees
and
currant
-
bushes
;
and
by
that
time
she
was
seated
comfortably
on
her
sofa
,
and
the
Duke
was
on
a
chair
before
her
,
 
just
as
might
have
been
any
man
who
was
not
a
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
little
time
the
photograph
was
brought
forth
from
his
Grace
's
pocket
.
<EOS>
That
bringing
out
and
giving
of
photographs
,
with
the
demand
for
counter
photographs
,
is
the
most
absurd
practice
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
look
very
nice
,
do
I
?
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
 
very
nice
,
but
a
little
too
old
;
and
certainly
you
have
n't
got
those
spots
all
over
your
forehead
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
remarks
which
on
such
occasions
are
the
most
common
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
said
that
to
give
a
photograph
or
to
take
a
photograph
without
the
utterance
of
some
words
which
would
be
felt
by
a
bystander
to
be
absurd
,
is
almost
an
impossibility
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
there
was
no
bystander
,
and
therefore
the
Duke
and
the
lady
had
no
need
for
caution
.
<EOS>
Words
were
spoken
that
were
very
absurd
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
protested
that
the
Duke
's
photograph
was
more
to
her
than
the
photographs
of
all
the
world
beside
;
and
the
Duke
declared
that
he
would
carry
the
lady
's
picture
next
to
his
heart
,
 
I
am
afraid
he
said
for
ever
and
ever
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
,
and
was
conscious
that
for
a
man
over
seventy
years
of
age
he
did
that
kind
of
thing
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
and
dine
with
me
,
Duke
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
when
he
began
to
talk
of
going
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
dine
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
the
reason
you
should
dine
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
shall
meet
nobody
you
do
not
wish
to
meet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
so
much
rather
see
you
in
this
way
,
 
I
would
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
do
dine
out
occasionally
,
but
it
is
at
big
formal
parties
,
which
I
can
not
escape
without
giving
offence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
can
not
escape
my
little
not
formal
party
,
 
without
giving
offence
.
<EOS>
"
She
looked
into
his
face
as
she
spoke
,
and
he
knew
that
she
meant
it
.
<EOS>
And
he
looked
into
hers
,
and
thought
that
her
eyes
were
brighter
than
any
he
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
in
these
latter
days
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Name
your
own
day
,
Duke
.
<EOS>
Will
a
Sunday
suit
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
must
come
 
"
  
"
You
must
come
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
spoke
her
eyes
sparkled
more
and
more
,
and
her
colour
went
and
came
,
and
she
shook
her
curls
till
they
emitted
through
the
air
the
same
soft
feeling
of
a
perfume
that
her
note
had
produced
.
<EOS>
Then
her
foot
peeped
out
from
beneath
the
black
and
yellow
drapery
of
her
dress
,
and
the
Duke
saw
that
it
was
perfect
.
<EOS>
And
she
put
out
her
finger
and
touched
his
arm
as
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
was
very
fair
,
and
her
fingers
were
bright
with
rich
gems
.
<EOS>
To
men
such
as
the
Duke
,
a
hand
,
to
be
quite
fair
,
should
be
bright
with
rich
gems
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
come
,
"
she
said
,
 
not
imploring
him
now
but
commanding
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
come
,
"
he
answered
,
and
a
certain
Sunday
was
fixed
.
  
<EOS>
The
arranging
of
the
guests
was
a
little
difficulty
,
till
Madame
Goesler
begged
the
Duke
to
bring
with
him
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
,
his
nephew
's
wife
.
<EOS>
This
at
last
he
agreed
to
do
.
<EOS>
As
the
wife
of
his
nephew
and
heir
,
Lady
Glencora
was
to
the
Duke
all
that
a
woman
could
be
.
<EOS>
She
was
everything
that
was
proper
as
to
her
own
conduct
,
and
not
obtrusive
as
to
his
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
bore
him
,
and
yet
she
was
attentive
.
<EOS>
Although
in
her
husband
's
house
she
was
a
fierce
politician
,
in
his
house
she
was
simply
an
attractive
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
;
she
is
very
clever
,
"
the
Duke
once
said
,
"
she
adapts
herself
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
to
go
from
any
one
place
to
any
other
,
she
would
be
at
home
in
both
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
movement
of
his
Grace
's
hand
as
he
spoke
seemed
to
indicate
the
widest
possible
sphere
for
travelling
and
the
widest
possible
scope
for
adaptation
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
was
arranged
,
and
went
off
very
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
's
eyes
were
not
quite
so
bright
as
they
were
during
that
morning
visit
,
nor
did
she
touch
her
guest
's
arm
in
a
manner
so
alluring
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
quiet
,
allowing
her
guests
to
do
most
of
the
talking
.
<EOS>
But
the
dinner
and
the
flowers
and
the
wine
were
excellent
,
and
the
whole
thing
was
so
quiet
that
the
Duke
liked
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
you
must
come
and
dine
with
me
,
"
the
Duke
said
as
he
took
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"
A
command
to
that
effect
will
be
one
which
I
certainly
shall
not
disobey
,
"
whispered
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
he
is
going
to
get
fond
of
that
woman
.
<EOS>
"
These
words
were
spoken
early
on
the
following
morning
by
Lady
Glencora
to
her
husband
,
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
always
getting
fond
of
some
woman
,
and
he
will
to
the
end
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
this
Madame
Max
Goesler
is
very
clever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
they
tell
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
generally
thought
that
my
uncle
likes
talking
to
a
fool
the
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Every
man
likes
a
clever
woman
the
best
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
if
the
clever
woman
only
knows
how
to
use
her
cleverness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
hope
he
'll
be
amused
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
innocently
.
<EOS>
"
A
little
amusement
is
all
that
he
cares
for
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
you
were
told
some
day
that
he
was
going
 
to
be
married
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
married
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
he
as
well
as
another
?
"
  
"
And
to
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
be
ever
married
it
will
be
to
some
such
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
a
man
in
all
England
who
thinks
more
of
his
own
position
than
my
uncle
,
"
said
Mr.
Palliser
somewhat
proudly
,
 
almost
with
a
touch
of
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
all
very
well
,
Plantagenet
,
and
true
enough
in
a
kind
of
way
.
<EOS>
But
a
child
will
sacrifice
all
that
it
has
for
the
top
brick
of
the
chimney
,
and
old
men
sometimes
become
children
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
like
to
be
told
some
morning
that
there
was
a
little
Lord
Silverbridge
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
Now
the
eldest
son
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
when
the
Duke
of
Omnium
had
a
son
,
was
called
the
Earl
of
Silverbridge
;
and
Mr.
Palliser
,
when
this
question
was
asked
him
,
became
very
pale
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
knew
well
how
thoroughly
the
cunning
of
the
serpent
was
joined
to
the
purity
of
the
dove
in
the
person
of
his
wife
,
and
he
was
sure
that
there
was
cause
for
fear
when
she
hinted
at
danger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
had
better
keep
your
eye
upon
him
,
"
he
said
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
upon
her
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
When
Madame
Goesler
dined
at
the
Duke
's
house
in
St.
James
's
Square
there
was
a
large
party
,
and
Lady
Glencora
knew
that
there
was
no
need
for
apprehension
then
.
<EOS>
Indeed
Madame
Goesler
was
no
more
than
any
other
guest
,
and
the
Duke
hardly
spoke
to
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
Duchess
there
,
 
the
Duchess
of
St.
Bungay
,
and
old
Lady
Hartletop
,
who
was
a
dowager
marchioness
,
 
an
old
lady
who
pestered
the
Duke
very
sorely
,
 
and
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
received
her
reward
,
and
knew
that
she
was
receiving
it
,
in
being
asked
to
meet
these
people
.
<EOS>
Would
not
all
these
names
,
including
her
own
,
be
blazoned
to
the
world
in
the
columns
of
the
next
day
's
_
Morning
Post
_
?
<EOS>
There
was
no
absolute
danger
here
,
as
Lady
Glencora
knew
;
and
Lady
Glencora
,
who
was
tolerant
and
begrudged
nothing
to
Madame
Max
except
the
one
thing
,
was
quite
willing
to
meet
the
lady
at
such
a
grand
affair
as
this
.
<EOS>
But
the
Duke
,
even
should
he
become
ever
so
childish
a
child
in
his
old
age
,
still
would
have
that
plain
green
brougham
at
his
command
,
and
could
go
anywhere
in
that
at
any
hour
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
And
then
Madame
Goesler
was
so
manifestly
a
clever
woman
.
<EOS>
A
Duchess
of
Omnium
might
be
said
to
fill
,
 
in
the
estimation
,
at
any
rate
,
of
English
people
,
 
the
highest
position
in
the
world
short
of
royalty
.
<EOS>
And
the
reader
will
remember
that
Lady
Glencora
intended
to
be
a
Duchess
of
Omnium
herself
,
 
unless
some
very
unexpected
event
should
intrude
itself
.
<EOS>
She
intended
also
that
her
little
boy
,
her
fair
-
haired
,
curly
-
pated
,
bold
-
faced
little
boy
,
should
be
Earl
of
Silverbridge
when
the
sand
of
the
old
man
should
have
run
itself
out
.
<EOS>
Heavens
,
what
a
blow
would
it
be
,
should
some
little
wizen
-
cheeked
half
-
monkey
baby
,
with
black
brows
,
and
yellow
skin
,
be
brought
forward
and
shown
to
her
some
day
as
the
heir
!
<EOS>
What
a
blow
to
herself
;
 
and
what
a
blow
to
all
England
!
<EOS>
"
We
ca
n't
prevent
it
if
he
chooses
to
do
it
,
"
said
her
husband
,
who
had
his
budget
to
bring
forward
that
very
night
,
and
who
in
truth
cared
more
for
his
budget
than
he
did
for
his
heirship
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
prevent
it
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
stick
to
him
by
the
tail
of
his
coat
,
I
'll
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
the
time
when
she
thus
spoke
,
the
dark
green
brougham
had
been
twice
again
brought
up
at
the
door
in
Park
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
And
the
brougham
was
standing
there
a
third
time
.
<EOS>
It
was
May
now
,
the
latter
end
of
May
,
and
the
park
opposite
was
beautiful
with
green
things
,
and
the
air
was
soft
and
balmy
,
as
it
will
be
sometimes
even
in
May
,
and
the
flowers
in
the
balcony
were
full
of
perfume
,
and
the
charm
of
London
,
 
what
London
can
be
to
the
rich
,
 
was
at
its
height
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
sitting
in
Madame
Goesler
's
drawing
-
room
,
at
some
distance
from
her
,
for
she
had
retreated
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
had
a
habit
of
taking
her
hand
,
which
she
never
would
permit
for
above
a
few
seconds
.
<EOS>
At
such
times
she
would
show
no
anger
,
but
would
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Marie
,
"
said
the
Duke
,
"
you
will
go
abroad
when
the
summer
is
over
.
"
<EOS>
As
an
old
man
he
had
taken
the
privilege
of
calling
her
Marie
,
and
she
had
not
forbidden
it
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
probably
;
to
Vienna
.
<EOS>
I
have
property
in
Vienna
you
know
,
which
must
be
looked
after
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
mind
Vienna
this
year
.
<EOS>
Come
to
Italy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
What
;
in
summer
,
Duke
?
"
  
"
The
lakes
are
charming
in
August
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
villa
on
Como
which
is
empty
now
,
and
I
think
I
shall
go
there
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
know
the
Italian
lakes
,
I
shall
be
so
happy
to
show
them
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
them
well
,
my
lord

<EOS>
When
I
was
young
<EOS>
I
was
on
the
Maggiore
almost
alone
.
<EOS>
Some
day
I
will
tell
you
a
history
of
what
I
was
in
those
days

You

No

not

I
have
no
villa

Will
you
not

the
loan

It
shall
be
all
your

My

No

Why
not

<EOS>
Am
I
to
be
put
to
the
blush
by
being
made
to
answer
such
a
question
as
that
?
<EOS>
Because
the
world
would
say
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
had
a
new
mistress
,
and
that
Madame
Goesler
was
the
woman
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
I
would
be
any
man
's
mistress
;
 
even
yours
?
<EOS>
Or
do
you
believe
that
for
the
sake
of
the
softness
of
a
summer
evening
on
an
Italian
lake
,
I
would
give
cause
to
the
tongues
of
the
women
here
to
say
that
I
was
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
You
would
have
me
lose
all
that
I
have
gained
by
steady
years
of
sober
work
for
the
sake
of
a
week
or
two
of
dalliance
such
as
that
!
<EOS>
No

Duke

not
for
your
dukedom

How
his
Grace
might
have
got
through
his

they
been
left
alone

not

For
at
this

It
has
often
seemed
to
me
that

Mr.

not

so

then

are
very
apt

one
another

most
probably
you

There

Thou

for
instance
.
<EOS>
That
has
necessarily
been
current
as
a
law
through
all
nations
.
<EOS>
But
the
first
man
you
meet
in
the
street
will
have
ideas
about
theft
so
different
from
yours
,
that
,
if
you
knew
them
as
you
know
your
own
,
you
would
say
that
this
law
and
yours
were
not
even
founded
on
the
same
principle

<EOS>
It
is
compatible
with
this
man
's
honesty
to
cheat
you
in
a
matter
of
horseflesh

man
's
in

stands
high

who
implores
his
God
every
Sunday
to
write
that
law

his
heart

spends
every
hour
of
his
daily
toil
in

regarded
as
a
pattern
of

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
and
Phineas
were
dining
together
at
Mr.
Monk
's
house
,
and
the
elder
politician
of
the
two
in
this
little
speech
had
recurred
to
certain
matters
which
had
already
been
discussed
between
them
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
was
becoming
somewhat
sick
of
his
place
in
the
Cabinet
,
though
he
had
not
as
yet
whispered
a
word
of
his
sickness
to
any
living
ears
;
and
he
had
begun
to
pine
for
the
lost
freedom
of
a
seat
below
the
gangway
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
discussing
political
honesty
with
Phineas
,
and
hence
had
come
the
sermon
of
which
I
have
ventured
to
reproduce
the
concluding
denunciations
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
fond
of
such
discussions
and
fond
of
holding
them
with
Mr.
Monk
,
 
in
this
matter
fluttering
like
a
moth
<EOS>
round
a
candle
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
perceive
that
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
a
servant
of
the
public
in
Parliament
,
he
must
abandon
all
idea
of
independent
action
;
and
unless
he
did
so
he
could
be
neither
successful
as
regarded
himself
,
or
useful
to
the
public
whom
he
served
.
<EOS>
Could
a
man
be
honest
in
Parliament
,
and
yet
abandon
all
idea
of
independence
?
<EOS>
When
he
put
such
questions
to
Mr.
Monk
he
did
not
get
a
direct
answer
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
the
question
was
never
put
directly
.
<EOS>
But
the
teaching
which
he
received
was
ever
of
a
nature
to
make
him
uneasy
.
<EOS>
It
was
always
to
this
effect
:
"
You
have
taken
up
the
trade
now
,
and
seem
to
be
fit
for
success
in
it
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
give
up
thinking
about
its
special
honesty
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
Mr.
Monk
would
on
an
occasion
preach
to
him
such
a
sermon
as
that
which
he
had
just
uttered
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
is
no
question
more
difficult
to
a
man
's
mind
than
that
of
the
expediency
or
inexpediency
of
scruples
in
political
life
.
<EOS>
Whether
would
a
candidate
for
office
be
more
liable
to
rejection
from
a
leader
because
he
was
known
to
be
scrupulous
,
or
because
he
was
known
to
be
the
reverse
?
  
<EOS>
"
But
putting
aside
the
fourth
commandment
and
all
the
theories
,
you
will
come
to
Ireland
?
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
live
in
a
castle
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
everybody
did
live
in
a
castle
in
Ireland
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
They
seemed
to
do
when
I
was
there
twenty
years
ago
.
<EOS>
But
for
myself
,
I
prefer
a
cottage
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
trip
to
Ireland
had
been
proposed
in
consequence
of
certain
ideas
respecting
tenant
-
right
which
Mr.
Monk
was
beginning
to
adopt
,
and
as
to
which
the
minds
of
politicians
were
becoming
moved
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
all
very
well
to
put
down
Fenianism
,
and
Ribandmen
,
and
Repeal
,
 
and
everything
that
had
been
put
down
in
Ireland
in
the
way
of
rebellion
for
the
last
seventy
-
five
years
.
<EOS>
England
and
Ireland
had
been
apparently
joined
together
by
laws
of
nature
so
fixed
,
that
even
politicians
liberal
as
was
Mr.
Monk
,
 
liberal
as
was
Mr.
Turnbull
,
 
could
not
trust
themselves
to
think
that
disunion
could
be
for
the
good
of
the
Irish
.
<EOS>
They
had
taught
themselves
that
it
certainly
could
not
be
good
for
the
English
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
was
incumbent
on
England
to
force
upon
Ireland
the
maintenance
of
the
Union
for
her
own
sake
,
and
for
England
's
sake
,
because
England
could
not
afford
independence
established
so
close
against
her
own
ribs
,
 
it
was
at
any
rate
necessary
to
England
's
character
that
the
bride
thus
bound
in
a
compulsory
wedlock
should
be
endowed
with
all
the
best
privileges
that
a
wife
can
enjoy
.
<EOS>
Let
her
at
least
not
be
a
kept
mistress
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
bone
of
my
bone
and
flesh
of
my
flesh
,
if
we
are
to
live
together
in
the
married
state
.
<EOS>
Between
husband
and
wife
a
warm
word
now
and
then
matters
but
little
,
if
there
be
a
thoroughly
good
understanding
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
But
let
there
be
that
good
understanding
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
What
about
this
Protestant
Church
;
and
what
about
this
tenant
<EOS>
-
right
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
had
been
asking
himself
these
questions
for
some
time
past
.
<EOS>
In
regard
to
the
Church
,
he
had
long
made
up
his
mind
that
the
Establishment
in
Ireland
was
a
crying
sin
.
<EOS>
A
man
had
married
a
woman
whom
he
knew
to
be
of
a
religion
different
from
his
own
,
and
then
insisted
that
his
wife
should
say
that
she
believed
those
things
which
he
knew
very
well
that
she
did
not
believe
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
Mr.
Monk
well
knew
,
the
subject
of
the
Protestant
Endowments
in
Ireland
was
so
difficult
that
it
would
require
almost
more
than
human
wisdom
to
adjust
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
matters
which
almost
seemed
to
require
the
interposition
of
some
higher
power
,
 
the
coming
of
some
apparently
chance
event
,
 
to
clear
away
the
evil
;
as
a
fire
comes
,
and
pestilential
alleys
are
removed
;
as
a
famine
comes
,
and
men
are
driven
from
want
and
ignorance
and
dirt
to
seek
new
homes
and
new
thoughts
across
the
broad
waters
;
as
a
war
comes
,
and
slavery
is
banished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
But
in
regard
to
tenant
-
right
,
to
some
arrangement
by
which
a
tenant
in
Ireland
might
be
at
least
encouraged
to
lay
out
what
little
capital
he
might
have
in
labour
or
money
without
being
at
once
called
upon
to
pay
rent
for
that
outlay
which
was
his
own
,
as
well
as
for
the
land
which
was
not
his
own
,
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
thought
that
it
was
possible
that
if
a
man
would
look
hard
enough
he
might
perhaps
be
able
to
see
his
way
as
to
that
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
to
two
of
his
colleagues
on
the
subject
,
the
two
men
in
the
Cabinet
whom
he
believed
to
be
the
most
thoroughly
honest
in
their
ideas
as
public
servants
,
the
Duke
and
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
There
was
so
much
to
be
done
;
 
and
then
so
little
was
known
upon
the
subject
!
<EOS>
"
I
will
endeavour
to
study
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
can
see
your
way
,
do
;
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
,
 
"
<EOS>
but
of
course
we
can
not
bind
ourselves
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
glad
to
see
it
named
in
the
Queen
's
speech
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
session
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
long
way
off
as
yet
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
Who
will
be
in
then
,
and
who
will
be
out
?
"
<EOS>
So
the
matter
was
disposed
of
at
the
time
,
but
Mr.
Monk
did
not
abandon
his
idea
.
<EOS>
He
rather
felt
himself
the
more
bound
to
cling
to
it
because
he
received
so
little
encouragement
.
<EOS>
What
was
a
seat
in
the
Cabinet
to
him
that
he
should
on
that
account
omit
a
duty
?
<EOS>
He
had
not
taken
up
politics
as
a
trade
.
<EOS>
He
had
sat
far
behind
the
Treasury
bench
or
below
the
gangway
for
many
a
year
,
without
owing
any
man
a
shilling
,
 
and
could
afford
to
do
so
again
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
different
with
Phineas
Finn
,
as
Mr.
Monk
himself
understood
;
 
and
,
understanding
this
<EOS>
,
he
felt
himself
bound
to
caution
his
young
friend
.
<EOS>
But
it
may
be
a
question
whether
his
cautions
did
not
do
more
harm
than
good
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
delighted
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
go
over
with
you
in
August
,
but
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
if
I
were
you
,
I
would
take
up
this
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
want
to
fight
the
battle
singlehanded
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
desire
no
such
glory
,
and
would
wish
to
have
no
better
lieutenant
than
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
a
subject
of
which
you
are
really
fond
,
which
you
are
beginning
to
understand
,
and
in
regard
to
which
you
can
make
yourself
useful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
this
Canada
business
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
and
that
will
grow
to
other
matters
as
regards
the
colonies
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
so
important
to
a
public
man
as
that
he
should
have
his
own
subject
;
 
the
thing
which
he
understands
,
and
in
respect
of
which
he
can
make
himself
really
useful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
there
comes
a
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
and
the
man
who
has
half
learned
how
to
have
a
ship
built
without
waste
is
sent
into
opposition
,
and
is
then
brought
back
to
look
after
regiments
,
or
perhaps
has
to
take
up
that
beautiful
subject
,
a
study
of
the
career
of
India
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
if
you
have
a
subject
,
stick
to
it
at
any
rate
as
long
as
it
will
stick
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
if
a
man
takes
up
his
own
subject
,
independent
of
the
Government
,
no
man
can
drive
him
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
often
does
he
do
anything
?
<EOS>
Look
at
the
annual
motions
which
come
forward
in
the
hands
of
private
men
,
 
Maynooth
and
the
ballot
for
instance
.
<EOS>
It
is
becoming
more
and
more
apparent
every
day
that
all
legislation
must
be
carried
by
the
Government
,
and
must
be
carried
in
obedience
to
the
expressed
wish
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
The
truest
democracy
that
ever
had
a
chance
of
living
is
that
which
we
are
now
establishing
in
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
leave
tenant
-
right
to
the
people
and
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
take
it
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
paused
a
moment
or
two
before
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
choose
to
run
a
-
muck
,
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
follow
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
old
and
you
are
young
.
<EOS>
I
want
nothing
from
politics
as
a
profession
,
and
you
do
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
you
have
a
congenial
subject
where
you
are
,
and
need
not
disturb
yourself
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
tell
you
,
in
confidence
,
that
I
can
not
speak
so
comfortably
of
my
own
position
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
go
and
see
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
"
we
will
go
and
see
.
<EOS>
"
And
thus
,
in
the
month
of
May
,
it
was
settled
between
them
that
,
as
soon
as
the
session
should
be
over
,
and
the
incidental
work
of
his
office
should
allow
Phineas
to
pack
up
and
be
off
,
they
two
should
start
together
for
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Phineas
felt
rather
proud
as
he
wrote
to
his
father
and
asked
permission
to
bring
home
with
him
a
Cabinet
Minister
as
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
reputation
of
Phineas
at
Killaloe
,
as
well
in
the
minds
of
the
Killaloeians
generally
as
in
those
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
paternal
house
,
stood
very
high
indeed
.
<EOS>
How
could
a
father
think
that
a
son
had
done
badly
when
before
he
was
thirty
years
of
age
he
was
earning
£
2,000
a
year
?
<EOS>
And
how
could
a
father
not
think
well
of
a
son
who
had
absolutely
paid
back
certain
moneys
into
the
paternal
coffers
?
<EOS>
The
moneys
so
repaid
had
not
been
much
;
but
the
repayment
of
any
such
money
at
Killaloe
had
been
regarded
as
little
short
of
miraculous
.
<EOS>
The
news
of
Mr.
Monk
's
coming
flew
about
the
town
,
about
the
county
,
about
the
diocese
,
and
all
people
began
to
say
all
good
things
about
the
old
doctor
's
only
son
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
had
long
since
been
quite
sure
that
a
real
black
swan
had
been
sent
forth
out
of
her
nest
.
<EOS>
And
the
sisters
Finn
,
for
some
time
past
,
had
felt
in
all
social
gatherings
they
stood
quite
on
a
different
footing
than
formerly
because
of
their
brother
.
<EOS>
They
were
asked
about
in
the
county
,
and
two
of
them
had
been
staying
only
last
Easter
with
the
Molonys
,
 
the
Molonys
of
Poldoodie
!
<EOS>
How
should
a
father
and
a
mother
and
sisters
not
be
grateful
to
such
a
son
,
to
such
a
brother
,
to
such
a
veritable
black
swan
out
of
the
nest
!
<EOS>
And
as
for
dear
little
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
her
eyes
became
suffused
with
tears
as
in
her
solitude
<EOS>
she
thought
how
much
out
of
her
reach
this
swan
was
flying
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
took
joy
in
his
swanhood
,
and
swore
that
she
would
love
him
still
;
 
that
she
would
love
him
always
.
<EOS>
Might
he
bring
home
with
him
to
Killaloe
,
Mr.
Monk
,
the
Cabinet
Minister
!
<EOS>
Of
course
he
might
.
<EOS>
When
Mrs.
Finn
first
heard
of
this
august
arrival
,
she
felt
as
though
she
would
like
to
expend
herself
in
entertaining
,
though
but
an
hour
,
the
whole
cabinet
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
during
the
spring
,
had
,
of
course
,
met
Mr.
Kennedy
frequently
in
and
about
the
House
,
and
had
become
aware
that
Lady
Laura
's
husband
,
from
time
to
time
,
made
little
overtures
of
civility
to
him
,
 
taking
him
now
and
again
by
the
button
-
hole
,
walking
home
with
him
as
far
as
their
joint
paths
allowed
,
and
asking
him
once
or
twice
to
come
and
dine
in
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
These
little
advances
towards
a
repetition
of
the
old
friendship
Phineas
would
have
avoided
altogether
,
had
it
been
possible
.
<EOS>
The
invitation
to
Mr.
Kennedy
's
house
he
did
refuse
,
feeling
himself
positively
bound
to
do
so
by
Lady
Laura
's
command
,
let
the
consequences
be
what
they
might
.
<EOS>
When
he
did
refuse
,
Mr.
Kennedy
would
assume
a
look
of
displeasure
and
leave
him
,
and
Phineas
would
hope
that
the
work
was
done
.
<EOS>
Then
there
would
come
another
encounter
,
and
the
invitation
would
be
repeated
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
about
the
middle
of
May
,
there
came
another
note
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
Finn
,
will
you
dine
with
us
on
Wednesday
,
the
28th
?
<EOS>
I
give
you
a
long
notice
,
because
you
seem
to
have
so
many
appointments
.
<EOS>
Yours
always
,
Robert
Kennedy
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
He
must
refuse
,
even
though
double
the
notice
had
been
given
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
think
that
Mr.
Kennedy
was
a
very
obtuse
man
and
one
who
would
not
take
a
hint
,
and
hope
that
he
might
succeed
at
last
.
<EOS>
So
he
wrote
an
answer
,
not
intended
to
be
conciliatory
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Kennedy
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
I
am
engaged
on
the
28th
.
<EOS>
Yours
always
,
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
At
this
period
he
did
his
best
to
keep
out
of
Mr.
Kennedy
's
way
,
and
would
be
very
cunning
in
his
manoeuvres
that
they
should
not
be
alone
together
.
<EOS>
It
was
difficult
,
as
they
sat
on
the
same
bench
in
the
House
,
and
consequently
saw
each
other
almost
every
day
of
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
thought
that
with
a
little
cunning
he
might
prevail
,
especially
as
he
was
not
unwilling
to
give
so
much
of
offence
as
might
assist
his
own
object
.
<EOS>
But
when
Mr.
Kennedy
called
upon
him
at
his
office
the
day
after
he
had
written
the
above
note
,
he
had
no
means
of
escape
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
you
can
not
come
to
us
on
the
28th
,
"
Mr.
Kennedy
said
,
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
taken
so
much
by
surprise
that
all
his
cunning
failed
him
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
yes
,
"
said
he
;
"
I
was
very
sorry
;
 
very
sorry
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
,
Finn
,
that
you
have
had
some
reason
for
avoiding
me
of
late
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
have
done
anything
to
offend
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
on
earth
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
wrong
,
then
,
in
supposing
that
anything
beyond
mere
chance
has
prevented
you
from
coming
to
my
house
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
felt
that
he
was
in
a
terrible
difficulty
,
and
he
felt
also
that
he
was
being
rather
ill
-
used
in
being
thus
cross
-
examined
as
to
his
reasons
for
not
going
to
a
gentleman
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
a
man
ought
to
be
allowed
to
choose
where
he
would
go
and
where
he
would
not
go
,
and
that
questions
such
as
these
were
very
uncommon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
,
looking
more
grave
and
more
sour
than
usual
;
 
and
now
his
own
countenance
also
became
a
little
solemn
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
that
he
should
use
Lady
Laura
's
name
,
and
yet
he
must
,
in
some
way
,
let
his
persecuting
friend
know
that
no
further
invitation
would
be
of
any
use
;
 
that
there
was
something
beyond
mere
chance
in
his
not
going
to
Grosvenor
Place
.
<EOS>
But
how
was
he
to
do
this
?
<EOS>
The
difficulty
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
see
his
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
So
he
sat
silent
with
a
solemn
face
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
then
asked
him
another
question
,
which
made
the
difficulty
ten
times
greater
.
"
<EOS>
Has
my
wife
asked
you
not
to
come
to
our
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
now
that
he
should
make
a
rush
and
get
out
of
his
trouble
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
"
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
Kennedy
,
I
do
n't
think
she
wants
to
see
me
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
does
not
answer
my
question
.
<EOS>
Has
she
asked
you
not
to
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
said
that
which
left
on
my
mind
an
impression
that
she
would
sooner
that
I
did
not
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
she
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
answer
such
a
question
as
that
,
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
Is
it
fair
to
ask
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
fair
,
 
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
quite
unfair
,
and
I
must
decline
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
what
you
expect
to
gain
by
cross
-
questioning
me
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
Of
course
no
man
likes
to
go
to
a
house
if
he
does
not
believe
that
everybody
there
will
make
him
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
and
Lady
Laura
used
to
be
great
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
are
not
enemies
now
.
<EOS>
But
things
will
occur
that
cause
friendships
to
grow
cool
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
quarrelled
with
her
father
?
"
  
"
With
Lord
Brentford
?
 
no
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Or
with
her
brother
,
 
since
the
duel
I
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
and
honour
I
can
not
stand
this
,
and
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
as
yet
quarrelled
with
anybody
;
but
I
must
quarrel
with
you
,
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
unusual
that
a
man
should
be
put
through
his
facings
after
such
a
fashion
,
and
I
must
beg
that
there
may
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
must
ask
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
say
what
you
like
to
your
own
wife
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
hinder
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
that
Mr.
Kennedy
formally
shook
hands
with
him
,
in
token
that
there
was
no
positive
breach
between
them
,
 
as
two
nations
may
still
maintain
their
alliance
,
though
they
have
made
up
their
minds
to
hate
each
other
,
and
thwart
each
other
at
every
turn
,
 
and
took
his
leave
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
sat
at
his
window
,
looking
out
into
the
park
,
and
thinking
of
what
had
passed
,
could
not
but
reflect
that
,
disagreeable
as
Mr.
Kennedy
had
been
to
him
,
he
would
probably
make
himself
much
more
disagreeable
to
his
wife
.
<EOS>
And
,
for
himself
,
he
thought
that
he
had
got
out
of
the
scrape
very
well
by
the
exhibition
of
a
little
mock
anger
.
   
<EOS>
The
Earl
's
Wrath
 
<EOS>
The
reader
may
remember
that
a
rumour
had
been
conveyed
to
Phineas
,
 
a
rumour
indeed
which
reached
him
from
a
source
which
he
regarded
as
very
untrustworthy
,
 
that
Violet
Effingham
had
quarrelled
with
her
lover
.
<EOS>
He
would
probably
have
paid
no
attention
to
the
rumour
,
beyond
that
which
necessarily
attached
itself
to
any
tidings
as
to
a
matter
so
full
of
interest
to
him
,
had
it
not
been
repeated
to
him
in
another
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
A
bird
has
told
me
that
your
Violet
Effingham
has
broken
with
her
lover
,
"
Madame
Goesler
said
to
him
one
day
.
"
<EOS>
What
bird
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
that
I
can
not
tell
you
.
<EOS>
But
this
I
will
confess
to
you
,
that
these
birds
which
tell
us
news
are
seldom
very
credible
,
 
and
are
often
not
very
creditable
,
You
must
take
a
bird
's
word
for
what
it
may
be
worth
.
<EOS>
It
is
said
that
they
have
quarrelled
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
,
if
the
truth
were
known
,
they
are
billing
and
cooing
in
each
other
's
arms
at
this
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
like
to
be
told
of
their
billing
and
cooing
,
 
did
not
like
to
be
told
even
of
their
quarrelling
.
<EOS>
Though
they
were
to
quarrel
,
it
would
do
him
no
good
.
<EOS>
He
would
rather
that
nobody
should
mention
their
names
to
him
;
 
so
that
his
back
,
which
had
been
so
utterly
broken
,
might
in
process
of
time
get
itself
cured
.
<EOS>
From
what
he
knew
of
Violet
he
thought
it
very
improbable
that
,
even
were
she
to
quarrel
with
one
lover
,
she
would
at
once
throw
herself
into
the
arms
of
another
.
<EOS>
And
he
did
feel
,
too
,
that
there
would
be
some
meanness
in
taking
her
,
were
she
willing
to
be
so
taken
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
these
rumours
,
coming
to
him
in
this
way
from
different
sources
,
almost
made
it
incumbent
on
him
to
find
out
the
truth
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
think
that
his
broken
back
was
not
cured
;
 
that
perhaps
,
after
all
,
it
was
not
in
the
way
of
being
cured
,
And
was
it
not
possible
that
there
might
be
explanations
?
<EOS>
Then
he
went
to
work
and
built
castles
in
the
air
,
so
constructed
as
to
admit
of
the
possibility
of
Violet
Effingham
becoming
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
This
had
been
in
April
,
and
at
that
time
all
that
he
knew
of
Violet
was
,
that
she
was
not
yet
in
London
.
<EOS>
And
he
thought
that
he
knew
the
same
as
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
had
told
him
that
Chiltern
was
not
in
town
,
nor
expected
in
town
as
yet
;
and
in
saying
so
had
seemed
to
express
displeasure
against
his
son
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
met
Lady
Baldock
at
some
house
which
he
frequented
,
and
had
been
quite
surprised
to
find
himself
graciously
received
by
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
She
had
said
not
a
word
of
Violet
,
but
had
spoken
of
Lord
Chiltern
,
 
mentioning
his
name
in
bitter
wrath
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
,
"
said
Phineas
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
friend
indeed
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
sort
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
that
you
are
his
friend
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
he
is
not
worthy
of
having
any
friend
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
did
not
quite
understand
from
this
that
Lady
Baldock
was
signifying
to
him
that
,
badly
as
she
had
thought
of
him
as
a
suitor
for
her
niece
,
she
would
have
preferred
him
,
 
especially
now
when
people
were
beginning
to
speak
well
of
him
,
 
to
that
terrible
young
man
,
who
,
from
his
youth
upwards
,
had
been
to
her
a
cause
of
fear
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
was
desirable
that
Violet
should
marry
an
elder
son
,
and
a
peer
's
heir
.
<EOS>
All
that
kind
of
thing
,
in
Lady
Baldock
's
eyes
,
was
most
desirable
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
anything
was
better
than
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
If
Violet
would
not
take
Mr.
Appledom
or
Lord
Fawn
,
in
heaven
's
name
let
her
take
this
young
man
,
who
was
kind
,
worthy
,
and
steady
,
who
was
civilised
in
his
manners
,
and
would
no
doubt
be
amenable
in
regard
to
settlements
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
had
so
far
fallen
in
the
world
that
she
would
have
consented
to
make
a
bargain
with
her
niece
,
 
almost
any
bargain
,
so
long
as
Lord
Chiltern
was
excluded
.
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
quite
understand
all
this
;
but
when
Lady
Baldock
asked
him
to
come
to
Berkeley
Square
,
he
perceived
that
help
was
being
proffered
to
him
where
he
certainly
had
not
looked
for
help
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
frequently
with
Lord
Brentford
,
who
talked
to
him
constantly
on
matters
connected
with
his
parliamentary
life
.
<EOS>
After
having
been
the
intimate
friend
of
the
daughter
and
of
the
son
,
it
now
seemed
to
be
his
lot
to
be
the
intimate
friend
of
the
father
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
had
constantly
discussed
with
him
his
arrangements
with
his
son
,
and
had
lately
expressed
himself
as
only
half
satisfied
with
such
reconciliation
as
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
And
Phineas
could
perceive
that
from
day
to
day
the
Earl
was
less
and
less
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
would
complain
bitterly
of
his
son
,
 
complain
of
his
silence
,
complain
of
his
not
coming
to
London
,
complain
of
his
conduct
to
Violet
,
complain
of
his
idle
indifference
to
anything
like
proper
occupation
;
but
he
had
never
as
yet
said
a
word
to
show
that
there
had
been
any
quarrel
between
Violet
and
her
lover
,
and
Phineas
had
felt
that
he
could
not
ask
the
question
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
the
Earl
to
him
one
morning
,
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
,
"
I
have
just
heard
a
story
which
has
almost
seemed
to
me
to
be
incredible
.
<EOS>
"
The
nobleman
's
manner
was
very
stern
,
and
the
fact
that
he
called
his
young
friend
"
Mr.
Finn
"
,
showed
at
once
that
something
was
wrong
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
you
have
heard
,
my
lord
?
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
you
and
Chiltern
went
over
,
 
last
year
to
,
 
Belgium
,
and
fought
,
 
a
duel
there
!
"
  
<EOS>
Now
it
must
have
been
the
case
that
,
in
the
set
among
which
they
all
lived
,
 
Lord
Brentford
and
his
son
and
daughter
and
Phineas
Finn
,
 
the
old
lord
was
the
only
man
who
had
not
heard
of
the
duel
before
this
.
<EOS>
It
had
even
penetrated
to
the
dull
ears
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
reminding
him
,
as
it
did
so
,
that
his
wife
had
,
 
told
him
a
lie
!
<EOS>
But
it
was
the
fact
that
no
rumour
of
the
duel
had
reached
the
Earl
till
this
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
been
so
much
shocked
in
my
life
;
 
never
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
idea
that
you
had
any
thought
of
aspiring
to
the
hand
of
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
lord
's
voice
as
he
said
this
was
very
stern
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
aspired
in
vain
,
and
as
Chiltern
has
been
successful
,
that
need
not
now
be
made
a
reproach
against
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
to
think
of
it
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
much
surprised
that
I
hardly
know
what
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
must
declare
my
opinion
at
once
,
that
you
behaved
,
 
very
badly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
much
you
know
,
my
lord
,
and
how
much
you
do
not
know
;
and
the
circumstances
of
the
little
affair
do
not
permit
me
to
be
explicit
about
them
;
but
,
as
you
have
expressed
your
opinion
<EOS>
so
openly
you
must
allow
me
to
express
mine
,
and
to
say
that
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
of
my
own
actions
,
I
did
not
behave
badly
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
intend
to
defend
duelling
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
If
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
a
duel
is
of
itself
sinful
,
I
have
nothing
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
is
.
<EOS>
My
defence
of
myself
merely
goes
to
the
manner
in
which
this
duel
was
fought
,
and
the
fact
that
I
fought
it
with
your
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
how
you
can
have
come
to
my
house
as
my
guest
,
and
stood
upon
my
interest
for
my
borough
,
when
you
at
the
time
were
doing
your
very
best
to
interpose
yourself
between
Chiltern
and
the
lady
whom
you
so
well
knew
I
wished
to
become
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
was
aware
that
the
Earl
must
have
been
very
much
moved
indeed
when
he
thus
permitted
himself
to
speak
of
"
his
"
borough
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
now
,
however
,
though
the
Earl
paused
;
 
and
then
the
angry
lord
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
that
there
was
something
,
 
something
almost
approaching
to
duplicity
in
such
conduct
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
to
defend
myself
by
evidence
,
Lord
Brentford
,
I
should
have
to
go
back
to
exact
dates
,
 
and
dates
not
of
facts
which
I
could
verify
,
but
dates
as
to
my
feelings
which
could
not
be
verified
,
 
and
that
would
be
useless
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
that
I
believe
I
know
what
the
honour
and
truth
of
a
gentleman
demand
,
 
even
to
the
verge
of
self
-
sacrifice
,
and
that
I
have
done
nothing
that
ought
to
place
my
character
as
a
gentleman
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
ask
your
son
,
I
think
he
will
tell
you
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
asked
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
told
me
of
the
duel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
he
tell
you
,
my
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Just
now
;
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thus
Phineas
learned
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
at
this
moment
in
the
house
,
 
or
at
least
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
he
complain
of
my
conduct
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
complain
of
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
complain
of
it
very
bitterly
.
<EOS>
I
placed
the
greatest
confidence
in
you
,
especially
in
regard
to
my
son
's
affairs
,
and
you
deceived
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Earl
was
very
angry
,
and
was
more
angry
from
the
fact
that
this
young
man
who
had
offended
him
,
to
whom
he
had
given
such
vital
assistance
when
assistance
was
needed
,
had
used
that
assistance
to
its
utmost
before
his
sin
was
found
out
.
<EOS>
Had
Phineas
still
been
sitting
for
Loughton
,
so
that
the
Earl
could
have
said
to
him
,
"
You
are
now
bound
to
retreat
from
this
borough
because
you
have
offended
me
,
your
patron
,
"
I
think
that
he
would
have
forgiven
the
offender
and
allowed
him
to
remain
in
his
seat
.
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
a
scene
,
and
the
Earl
would
have
been
pacified
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
offender
was
beyond
his
reach
altogether
,
having
used
the
borough
as
a
most
convenient
stepping
-
stone
over
his
difficulties
,
and
having
so
used
it
just
at
the
time
when
he
was
committing
this
sin
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
good
fortune
about
Phineas
which
added
greatly
to
the
lord
's
wrath
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
had
not
that
rich
consolation
for
which
Phineas
gave
him
credit
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
had
told
him
that
morning
that
the
engagement
between
him
and
Violet
was
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
so
preached
to
her
,
my
lord
,
about
my
duties
,
"
the
son
had
said
to
his
father
,
"
that
she
finds
herself
obliged
to
give
me
your
sermons
at
second
hand
,
till
I
can
bear
them
no
longer
.
"
<EOS>
But
of
this
Phineas
knew
nothing
as
yet
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
however
,
was
so
imprudent
in
his
anger
that
before
this
interview
was
over
he
had
told
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
<EOS>
you
deceived
me
,
"
he
continued
;
"
and
I
can
never
trust
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
for
me
,
my
lord
,
to
tell
you
of
that
which
would
have
increased
your
anger
against
your
own
son
?
<EOS>
When
he
wanted
me
to
fight
was
I
to
come
,
like
a
sneak
at
school
,
and
tell
you
the
story
?
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
would
have
thought
of
me
had
I
done
so
.
<EOS>
And
when
it
was
over
was
I
to
come
and
tell
you
then
?
<EOS>
Think
what
you
yourself
would
have
done
when
you
were
young
,
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
I
did
the
same
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
gained
?
<EOS>
He
has
got
all
that
he
wanted
;
and
you
have
also
got
all
that
you
wanted
;
 
and
I
have
helped
you
both
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
,
I
can
put
my
hand
on
my
heart
and
say
that
I
have
been
honest
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
nothing
that
I
wanted
,
"
said
the
Earl
in
his
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Chiltern
and
Miss
Effingham
will
be
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
they
will
not
.
<EOS>
He
has
quarrelled
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
obstinate
that
she
will
not
bear
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
it
was
all
true
,
even
though
the
rumours
had
reached
him
through
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
my
lord
,
that
has
not
been
my
fault
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
,
angry
with
himself
at
his
own
mistake
in
having
told
the
story
,
and
not
knowing
what
further
to
say
to
his
visitor
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
in
the
habit
of
talking
so
freely
to
Phineas
about
his
son
that
he
could
hardly
resist
the
temptation
of
doing
so
still
;
and
yet
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
swallow
his
anger
and
continue
in
the
same
strain
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
Phineas
,
after
a
while
,
"
I
can
assure
you
that
I
grieve
that
you
should
be
grieved
.
<EOS>
I
have
received
so
much
undeserved
favour
from
your
family
,
that
I
owe
you
a
debt
which
I
can
never
pay
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
that
you
should
be
angry
with
me
now
;
but
I
hope
that
a
time
may
come
when
you
will
think
less
severely
of
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
leave
the
room
when
the
Earl
stopped
him
.
"
<EOS>
Will
you
give
me
your
word
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
"
that
you
will
think
no
more
of
Miss
Effingham
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
stood
silent
,
considering
how
he
might
answer
this
proposal
,
resolving
that
nothing
should
bring
him
to
such
a
pledge
as
that
suggested
while
there
was
yet
a
ledge
for
hope
to
stand
on
.
"
<EOS>
Say
that
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
I
will
forgive
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
acknowledge
that
I
have
done
anything
to
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
that
,
"
repeated
the
Earl
,
"
and
everything
shall
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
need
be
no
cause
for
alarm
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
sure
that
Miss
Effingham
will
not
think
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
me
your
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lord
;
 
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
right
to
ask
it
,
and
the
pursuit
is
open
to
me
as
to
any
other
man
who
may
choose
to
follow
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
a
vestige
of
a
hope
of
success
.
<EOS>
It
is
barely
possible
that
I
should
succeed
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
be
true
that
Miss
Effingham
be
disengaged
,
I
shall
endeavour
to
find
an
opportunity
of
urging
my
suit
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
up
everything
that
I
have
,
my
seat
in
Parliament
,
all
the
ambition
of
my
life
,
for
the
barest
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
accepted
your
son
,
I
desisted
,
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
heard
,
from
more
sources
than
one
,
that
she
or
he
or
both
of
them
have
changed
their
minds
.
<EOS>
If
this
be
so
,
I
am
free
to
try
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Earl
stood
opposite
to
him
,
scowling
at
him
,
but
said
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
Good
morning
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
it
must
be
good
-
bye
,
for
some
long
days
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
,
sir
,
"
And
the
Earl
as
he
spoke
rang
the
bell
.
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
took
up
his
hat
and
departed
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
walked
away
his
mind
filled
itself
gradually
with
various
ideas
,
all
springing
from
the
words
which
Lord
Brentford
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
What
account
had
Lord
Chiltern
given
to
his
father
of
the
duel
?
<EOS>
Our
hero
was
a
man
very
sensitive
as
to
the
good
opinion
of
others
,
and
in
spite
of
his
bold
assertion
of
his
own
knowledge
of
what
became
a
gentleman
,
was
beyond
measure
solicitous
that
others
should
acknowledge
his
claim
at
any
rate
to
that
title
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
had
been
generous
to
Lord
Chiltern
;
and
as
he
went
back
in
his
memory
over
almost
every
word
that
had
been
spoken
in
the
interview
that
had
just
passed
,
he
fancied
that
he
was
able
to
collect
evidence
that
his
antagonist
at
Blankenberg
had
not
spoken
ill
of
him
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
charge
of
deceit
which
the
Earl
had
made
against
him
,
he
told
himself
that
the
Earl
had
made
it
in
anger
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
even
think
hardly
of
the
Earl
who
had
been
so
good
<EOS>
a
friend
to
him
,
<EOS>
but
he
believed
in
his
heart
that
the
Earl
had
made
the
accusation
out
of
his
wrath
and
not
out
of
his
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
can
not
think
that
I
have
been
false
to
him
,
"
Phineas
said
to
himself
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
very
sad
to
him
that
he
should
have
to
quarrel
with
all
the
family
of
the
Standishes
,
as
he
could
not
but
feel
that
it
was
they
who
had
put
him
on
his
feet
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
he
were
never
to
see
Lady
Laura
again
except
when
they
chanced
to
meet
in
company
,
 
on
which
occasions
he
simply
bowed
to
her
.
<EOS>
Now
the
Earl
had
almost
turned
him
out
of
his
house
.
<EOS>
And
though
there
had
been
to
a
certain
extent
a
reconciliation
between
him
and
Lord
Chiltern
,
he
in
these
days
never
saw
the
friend
who
had
once
put
him
upon
Bonebreaker
;
and
now
,
 
now
that
Violet
Effingham
was
again
free
,
 
how
was
it
possible
to
avoid
some
renewal
of
enmity
between
them
?
<EOS>
He
would
,
however
,
endeavour
to
see
Lord
Chiltern
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
he
thought
of
Violet
,
 
of
Violet
again
free
,
of
Violet
as
again
a
possible
wife
for
himself
,
of
Violet
to
whom
he
might
address
himself
at
any
rate
without
any
scruple
as
to
his
own
unworthiness
.
<EOS>
Everybody
concerned
,
and
many
who
were
not
concerned
at
all
,
were
aware
that
he
had
been
among
her
lovers
,
and
he
thought
that
he
could
perceive
that
those
who
interested
themselves
on
the
subject
,
had
regarded
him
as
the
only
horse
in
the
race
likely
to
run
with
success
against
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
She
herself
had
received
his
offers
without
scorn
,
and
had
always
treated
him
as
though
he
were
a
favoured
friend
,
though
not
favoured
as
a
lover
.
<EOS>
And
now
even
Lady
Baldock
was
smiling
upon
him
,
and
asking
him
to
her
house
as
though
the
red
-
faced
porter
in
the
hall
in
Berkeley
Square
had
never
been
ordered
to
refuse
him
a
moment
's
admission
inside
the
doors
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
very
humble
in
speaking
of
his
own
hopes
to
the
Earl
,
but
surely
there
might
be
a
chance
.
<EOS>
What
if
after
all
the
little
strain
which
he
had
had
in
his
back
was
to
be
cured
after
such
a
fashion
as
this
!
<EOS>
When
he
got
to
his
lodgings
,
he
found
a
card
from
Lady
Baldock
,
informing
him
that
Lady
Baldock
would
be
at
home
on
a
certain
night
,
and
that
there
would
be
music
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
go
to
Lady
Baldock
's
on
the
night
named
,
as
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
be
in
the
House
;
 
nor
did
he
much
care
to
go
there
,
as
Violet
Effingham
was
not
in
town
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
call
and
explain
,
and
endeavour
to
curry
favour
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
He
at
once
wrote
a
note
to
Lord
Chiltern
,
which
he
addressed
to
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
"
As
you
are
in
town
,
can
we
not
meet
?
<EOS>
Come
and
dine
with
me
at
the
 
Club
on
Saturday
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
note
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
days
he
received
the
following
answer
,
dated
from
the
Bull
at
Willingford
.
<EOS>
Why
on
earth
should
Chiltern
be
staying
at
the
Bull
at
Willingford
in
May
?
  
<EOS>
The
old
Shop
at
W
 
,
Friday
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
PHINEAS
,
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
dine
with
you
,
because
I
am
down
here
,
looking
after
the
cripples
,
and
writing
a
sporting
novel
.
<EOS>
They
tell
me
I
ought
to
do
something
,
so
I
am
going
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
n't
think
I
turned
informer
against
you
in
telling
the
Earl
of
our
pleasant
little
meeting
on
the
sands
.
<EOS>
It
had
become
necessary
,
and
you
are
too
much
of
a
man
to
care
much
for
any
truth
being
told
.
<EOS>
He
was
terribly
angry
both
with
me
and
with
you
;
but
the
fact
is
,
he
is
so
blindly
unreasonable
that
one
can
not
regard
his
anger
.
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
tell
the
story
truly
,
and
,
so
told
,
it
certainly
should
not
have
injured
you
in
his
estimation
.
<EOS>
But
it
did
.
<EOS>
Very
sorry
,
old
fellow
,
and
I
hope
you
'll
get
over
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
good
deal
more
important
to
me
than
to
you
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
,
  
C.
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
word
about
Violet
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
there
should
be
words
about
Violet
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
likely
that
a
man
should
write
to
his
rival
of
his
own
failure
.
<EOS>
But
yet
there
was
a
flavour
of
Violet
in
the
letter
which
would
not
have
been
there
,
so
Phineas
thought
,
if
the
writer
had
been
despondent
.
<EOS>
The
pleasant
little
meeting
on
the
sands
had
been
convened
altogether
in
respect
of
Violet
.
<EOS>
And
the
telling
of
the
story
to
the
Earl
must
have
arisen
from
discussions
about
Violet
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
must
have
told
his
father
that
Phineas
was
his
rival
.
<EOS>
Could
the
rejected
suitor
have
written
on
such
a
subject
in
such
a
strain
to
such
a
correspondent
if
he
had
believed
his
own
rejection
to
be
certain
?
<EOS>
But
then
Lord
Chiltern
was
not
like
anybody
else
in
the
world
,
and
it
was
impossible
to
judge
of
him
by
one
's
experience
of
the
motives
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
Phineas
did
call
in
Berkeley
Square
,
and
was
shown
up
at
once
into
Lady
Baldock
's
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
whole
aspect
of
the
porter
's
countenance
was
changed
towards
him
,
and
from
this
,
too
,
he
gathered
good
auguries
<EOS>
This
had
surprised
him
;
but
his
surprise
was
far
greater
,
when
,
on
entering
the
room
,
he
found
Violet
Effingham
there
alone
.
<EOS>
A
little
fresh
colour
came
to
her
face
as
she
greeted
him
,
though
it
can
not
be
said
that
she
blushed
.
<EOS>
She
behaved
herself
admirably
,
not
endeavouring
to
conceal
some
little
emotion
at
thus
meeting
him
,
but
betraying
none
that
was
injurious
to
her
composure
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
has
just
left
me
,
and
will
be
back
directly
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
by
no
means
her
equal
in
his
management
of
himself
on
the
occasion
;
but
perhaps
it
may
be
acknowledged
that
his
position
was
the
more
difficult
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
seen
her
since
her
engagement
had
been
proclaimed
to
the
world
,
and
now
he
had
heard
from
a
source
which
was
not
to
be
doubted
,
that
it
had
been
broken
off
.
<EOS>
Of
course
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
on
that
matter
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
congratulated
her
in
the
one
case
,
nor
could
he
either
congratulate
her
or
condole
with
her
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
did
not
know
how
to
speak
to
her
as
though
no
such
events
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
know
that
you
were
in
town
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
came
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
,
you
know
,
at
Rome
with
the
Effinghams
;
and
since
that
I
have
been
 
;
but
,
indeed
,
I
have
been
such
a
vagrant
that
I
can
not
tell
you
of
all
my
comings
and
goings
.
<EOS>
And
you
,
 
you
are
hard
at
work
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
 
always
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
right
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
be
something
,
if
it
were
only
a
stick
in
waiting
,
or
a
door
-
keeper
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
good
to
be
something
.
"
<EOS>
Was
it
some
such
teaching
as
this
that
had
jarred
against
Lord
Chiltern
's
susceptibilities
,
and
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
repetition
of
his
father
's
sermons
?
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
should
try
to
be
something
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
a
woman
must
be
content
to
be
nothing
,
 
unless
Mr.
Mill
can
pull
us
through
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
tell
me
,
 
have
you
seen
Lady
Laura
?
"
  
"
Not
lately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
Mr.
Kennedy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sometimes
see
him
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
The
visit
to
the
Colonial
Office
of
which
the
reader
has
been
made
aware
had
not
at
that
time
as
yet
been
made
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
all
that
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
Phineas
smiled
and
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
that
there
should
be
a
quarrel
between
you
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
think
that
you
and
he
might
do
so
much
for
each
other
,
 
that
is
,
of
course
,
if
you
could
make
a
friend
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
man
of
whom
it
is
very
hard
to
make
a
friend
,
"
said
Phineas
,
feeling
that
he
was
dishonest
to
Mr.
Kennedy
in
saying
so
,
but
thinking
that
such
dishonesty
was
justified
by
what
he
owed
to
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
he
is
hard
,
and
what
I
call
ungenial
.
<EOS>
We
wo
n't
say
anything
about
him
,
 
will
we
?
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
much
of
the
Earl
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
she
asked
as
though
such
a
question
had
no
reference
whatever
to
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
 
alas
,
alas
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
quarrelled
with
him
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
quarrelled
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
heard
,
Miss
Effingham
,
of
what
happened
last
year
,
and
he
thinks
that
I
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
were
wrong
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
.
<EOS>
To
him
I
chose
to
defend
myself
,
but
I
certainly
shall
not
do
so
to
you
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
you
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
quarrel
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
have
done
so
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
why
my
aunt
does
not
come
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
rang
the
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
have
told
you
all
about
myself
,
"
said
he
;
"
you
should
tell
me
something
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
me
?
<EOS>
I
am
like
the
knife
-
grinder
,
who
had
no
story
to
tell
,
 
<EOS>
none
at
least
to
be
told
.
<EOS>
We
have
all
,
no
doubt
,
got
our
little
stories
,
interesting
enough
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
your
story
,
Miss
Effingham
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
of
such
intense
interest
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
At
that
moment
,
luckily
,
Lady
Baldock
came
into
the
room
,
and
Phineas
was
saved
from
the
necessity
of
making
a
declaration
at
a
moment
which
would
have
been
most
inopportune
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
was
exceedingly
gracious
to
him
,
bidding
Violet
use
her
influence
to
persuade
him
to
come
to
the
gathering
.
"
<EOS>
Persuade
him
to
desert
his
work
to
come
and
hear
some
fiddlers
!
"
said
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
I
shall
not
,
aunt
.
<EOS>
Who
can
tell
but
what
the
colonies
might
suffer
from
it
through
centuries
,
and
that
such
a
lapse
of
duty
might
drive
a
province
or
two
into
the
arms
of
our
mortal
enemies
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Herr
Moll
is
coming
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
,
"
and
so
is
Signor
Scrubi
,
and
Pjinskt
,
who
,
they
say
,
is
the
greatest
man
living
on
the
flageolet
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
heard
Pjinskt
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
Phineas
never
had
heard
Pjinskt
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
for
Herr
Moll
,
there
is
nothing
equal
to
him
,
this
year
,
at
least
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
had
taken
up
music
this
season
,
but
all
her
enthusiasm
was
unable
to
shake
the
conscientious
zeal
of
the
young
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
At
such
a
gathering
he
would
have
been
unable
to
say
a
word
in
private
to
Violet
Effingham
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
's
Politics
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
remembered
that
when
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
was
shown
into
Madame
Goesler
's
room
,
Madame
Goesler
had
just
explained
somewhat
forcibly
to
the
Duke
of
Omnium
her
reasons
for
refusing
the
loan
of
his
Grace
's
villa
at
Como
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
the
Duke
in
so
many
words
that
she
did
not
mean
to
give
the
world
an
opportunity
of
maligning
her
,
and
it
would
then
have
been
left
to
the
Duke
to
decide
whether
any
other
arrangements
might
have
been
made
for
taking
Madame
Goesler
to
Como
,
had
he
not
been
interrupted
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
very
anxious
to
take
her
<EOS>
was
certain
.
<EOS>
The
green
brougham
had
already
been
often
enough
at
the
door
in
Park
Lane
to
make
his
Grace
feel
that
Madame
Goesler
's
company
was
very
desirable
,
 
was
,
perhaps
,
of
all
things
left
for
his
enjoyment
,
the
one
thing
the
most
desirable
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
spoken
to
her
husband
of
children
crying
for
the
top
brick
of
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
Now
it
had
come
to
this
,
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
Marie
Max
Goesler
was
the
top
brick
of
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
She
had
more
wit
for
him
than
other
women
,
 
more
of
that
sort
of
wit
which
he
was
capable
of
enjoying
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
beauty
which
he
had
learned
to
think
more
alluring
than
other
beauty
.
<EOS>
He
was
sick
of
fair
faces
,
and
fat
arms
,
and
free
necks
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
's
eyes
sparkled
as
other
eyes
did
not
sparkle
,
and
there
was
something
of
the
vagueness
of
mystery
in
the
very
blackness
and
gloss
and
abundance
of
her
hair
,
 
as
though
her
beauty
was
the
beauty
of
some
world
which
he
had
not
yet
known
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
quickness
and
yet
a
grace
of
motion
about
her
which
was
quite
new
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
upon
whom
the
Duke
had
of
late
most
often
smiled
had
been
somewhat
slow
,
 
perhaps
almost
heavy
,
 
though
,
no
doubt
,
graceful
withal
.
<EOS>
In
his
early
youth
he
remembered
to
have
seen
,
somewhere
in
Greece
,
such
a
houri
as
was
this
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
The
houri
in
that
case
had
run
off
with
the
captain
of
a
Russian
vessel
engaged
in
the
tallow
trade
;
but
not
the
less
was
there
left
on
his
Grace
's
mind
some
dreamy
memory
of
charms
which
had
impressed
him
very
strongly
when
he
was
simply
a
young
Mr.
Palliser
,
and
had
had
at
his
command
not
so
convenient
a
mode
of
sudden
abduction
as
the
Russian
captain
's
tallow
ship
.
<EOS>
Pressed
hard
by
such
circumstances
as
these
,
there
is
no
knowing
how
the
Duke
might
have
got
out
of
his
difficulties
<EOS>
had
not
Lady
Glencora
appeared
upon
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
Since
the
future
little
Lord
Silverbridge
had
been
born
,
the
Duke
had
been
very
constant
in
his
worship
of
Lady
Glencora
,
and
as
,
from
year
to
year
,
a
little
brother
was
added
,
thus
making
the
family
very
strong
and
stable
,
his
acts
of
worship
had
increased
;
but
with
his
worship
there
had
come
of
late
something
almost
of
dread
,
 
something
almost
of
obedience
,
which
had
made
those
who
were
immediately
about
the
Duke
declare
that
his
Grace
was
a
good
deal
changed
.
<EOS>
For
,
hitherto
,
whatever
may
have
been
the
Duke
's
weaknesses
,
he
certainly
had
known
no
master
.
<EOS>
His
heir
,
Plantagenet
Palliser
,
had
been
always
subject
to
him
.
<EOS>
His
other
relations
had
been
kept
at
such
a
distance
as
hardly
to
be
more
than
recognised
;
and
though
his
Grace
no
doubt
had
had
his
intimacies
,
they
who
had
been
intimate
with
him
had
either
never
tried
to
obtain
ascendancy
,
or
had
failed
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
whether
with
or
without
a
struggle
,
had
succeeded
,
and
people
about
the
Duke
said
that
the
Duke
was
much
changed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fothergill
,
 
who
was
his
Grace
's
man
of
business
,
and
who
was
not
a
favourite
with
Lady
Glencora
,
 
said
that
he
was
very
much
changed
indeed
.
<EOS>
Finding
his
Grace
so
much
changed
,
Mr.
Fothergill
had
made
a
little
attempt
at
dictation
himself
,
but
had
receded
with
fingers
very
much
scorched
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
possible
that
the
Duke
was
becoming
in
the
slightest
degree
weary
of
Lady
Glencora
's
thraldom
,
and
that
he
thought
that
Madame
Max
Goesler
might
be
more
tender
with
him
.
<EOS>
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
however
,
intended
to
be
tender
only
on
one
condition
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lady
Glencora
entered
the
room
,
Madame
Goesler
received
her
beautifully
.
<EOS>
"
How
lucky
that
you
should
have
come
just
when
his
Grace
is
here
!
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
saw
my
uncle
's
carriage
,
and
of
course
I
knew
it
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
the
favour
is
to
him
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
;
I
was
coming
.
<EOS>
If
my
word
is
to
be
doubted
in
that
point
,
I
must
insist
on
having
the
servant
up
;
I
must
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
to
drive
to
this
door
,
as
far
back
as
Grosvenor
Street
.
<EOS>
Did
I
not
,
Planty
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Planty
was
the
little
Lord
Silverbridge
as
was
to
be
,
if
nothing
unfortunate
intervened
,
who
was
now
sitting
on
his
granduncle
's
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dou
said
to
the
little
house
in
Park
Lane
,
"
said
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
because
I
forgot
the
number
.
"
  
"
And
it
is
the
smallest
house
in
Park
Lane
,
so
the
evidence
is
complete
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
not
cared
much
for
evidence
to
convince
Madame
Goesler
,
but
she
had
not
wished
her
uncle
to
think
that
he
was
watched
and
hunted
down
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
necessary
that
he
should
know
that
he
was
watched
,
but
things
had
not
come
to
that
as
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
Plantagenet
?
"
asked
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
for
papa
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
her
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Papa
is
very
well
,
but
he
almost
never
comes
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
working
for
his
country
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
"
Your
papa
is
a
busy
,
useful
man
,
and
ca
n't
afford
time
to
play
with
a
little
boy
as
I
can
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
papa
is
not
a
duke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
some
day
,
and
that
probably
before
long
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
a
duke
quite
as
soon
as
he
wants
to
be
a
duke
.
<EOS>
He
likes
the
House
of
Commons
better
than
the
strawberry
leaves
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
man
in
England
less
in
a
hurry
than
he
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
nice
that
is
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
ai
n't
in
a
hurry
either
,
 
am
I
,
mamma
?
"
said
the
little
future
Lord
Silverbridge
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
wicked
little
monkey
,
"
said
his
grand
-
uncle
,
kissing
him
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Lady
Glencora
was
,
no
doubt
,
thinking
how
necessary
it
was
that
she
should
be
careful
to
see
that
things
did
turn
out
in
the
manner
proposed
,
 
so
that
people
who
had
waited
should
not
be
disappointed
;
and
the
Duke
was
perhaps
thinking
that
he
was
not
absolutely
bound
to
his
nephew
by
any
law
of
God
or
man
;
and
Madame
Max
Goesler
,
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
her
thoughts
were
injurious
to
the
prospects
of
that
handsome
bold
-
faced
little
boy
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
rose
to
take
her
leave
first
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
for
her
to
show
any
anxiety
to
force
the
Duke
out
of
the
lady
's
presence
.
<EOS>
If
the
Duke
were
resolved
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
,
nothing
that
she
could
do
would
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
But
she
thought
that
this
little
inspection
might
possibly
be
of
service
,
and
that
her
uncle
's
ardour
would
be
cooled
by
the
interruption
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
.
<EOS>
So
she
went
,
and
immediately
afterwards
the
Duke
followed
her
.
<EOS>
The
interruption
had
,
at
any
rate
,
saved
him
on
that
occasion
from
making
the
highest
bid
for
the
pleasure
of
Madame
Goesler
's
company
at
Como
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
went
down
with
the
little
boy
in
his
hand
,
so
that
there
was
not
an
opportunity
for
a
single
word
of
interest
between
the
gentleman
and
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
,
when
she
was
alone
,
seated
herself
on
her
sofa
,
tucking
her
feet
up
under
her
as
though
she
were
seated
somewhere
in
the
East
,
pushed
her
ringlets
back
roughly
from
her
face
,
and
then
placed
her
two
hands
to
her
sides
so
that
her
thumbs
rested
lightly
on
her
girdle
.
<EOS>
When
alone
with
something
weighty
on
her
mind
she
would
sit
in
this
form
for
the
hour
together
,
resolving
,
or
trying
to
resolve
<EOS>
,
what
should
be
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
did
few
things
without
much
thinking
,
and
though
she
walked
very
boldly
,
she
walked
warily
.
<EOS>
She
often
told
herself
that
such
success
as
she
had
achieved
could
not
have
been
achieved
without
much
caution
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
was
ever
discontented
with
herself
,
telling
herself
that
all
that
she
had
done
was
nothing
,
or
worse
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
all
,
to
have
a
duke
and
to
have
lords
dining
with
her
,
to
dine
with
lords
or
with
a
duke
itself
,
if
life
were
dull
with
her
,
and
the
hours
hung
heavy
!
<EOS>
Life
with
her
was
dull
,
and
the
hours
did
hang
heavy
.
<EOS>
And
what
if
she
caught
this
old
man
,
and
became
herself
a
duchess
,
 
caught
him
by
means
of
his
weakness
,
to
the
inexpressible
dismay
of
all
those
who
were
bound
to
him
by
ties
of
blood
,
 
would
that
make
her
life
happier
,
or
her
hours
less
tedious
?
<EOS>
That
prospect
of
a
life
on
the
Italian
lakes
with
an
old
man
tied
to
her
side
was
not
so
charming
in
her
eyes
as
it
was
in
those
of
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
Were
she
to
succeed
,
and
to
be
blazoned
forth
to
the
world
as
Duchess
of
Omnium
,
what
would
she
have
gained
?
  
<EOS>
She
perfectly
understood
the
motive
of
Lady
Glencora
's
visit
,
and
thought
that
she
would
at
any
rate
gain
something
in
the
very
triumph
of
baffling
the
manoeuvres
of
so
clever
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Let
Lady
Glencora
throw
her
ægis
before
the
Duke
,
and
it
would
be
something
to
carry
off
his
Grace
from
beneath
the
protection
of
so
thick
a
shield
.
<EOS>
The
very
flavour
of
the
contest
was
pleasing
to
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
victory
gained
,
what
then
would
remain
to
her
?
<EOS>
Money
she
had
already
<EOS>
;
position
,
too
,
she
had
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
was
free
as
air
,
and
should
it
suit
her
at
any
time
to
go
off
to
some
lake
of
Como
in
society
that
would
personally
be
more
agreeable
to
her
than
that
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
her
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
And
then
came
a
smile
over
her
face
,
 
but
the
saddest
smile
,
 
as
she
thought
of
one
with
whom
it
might
be
pleasant
to
look
at
the
colour
of
Italian
skies
and
feel
the
softness
of
Italian
breezes
.
<EOS>
In
feigning
to
like
to
do
this
with
an
old
man
,
in
acting
the
raptures
of
love
on
behalf
of
a
worn
-
out
duke
who
at
the
best
would
scarce
believe
in
her
acting
,
there
would
not
be
much
delight
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
yet
known
what
it
was
to
have
anything
of
the
pleasure
of
love
.
<EOS>
She
had
grown
,
as
she
often
told
herself
,
to
be
a
hard
,
cautious
,
selfish
,
successful
woman
,
without
any
interference
or
assistance
from
such
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Might
there
not
be
yet
time
left
for
her
to
try
it
without
selfishness
,
 
with
an
absolute
devotion
of
self
,
 
if
only
she
could
find
the
right
companion
?
<EOS>
There
was
one
who
might
be
such
a
companion
,
but
the
Duke
of
Omnium
certainly
could
not
be
such
a
one
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
be
Duchess
of
Omnium
!
<EOS>
After
all
,
success
in
this
world
is
everything
;
 
is
at
any
rate
the
only
thing
the
pleasure
of
which
will
endure
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
name
of
many
a
woman
written
in
a
black
list
within
Madame
Goesler
's
breast
,
 
written
there
because
of
scorn
,
because
of
rejected
overtures
,
because
of
deep
social
injury
;
and
Madame
Goesler
told
herself
often
that
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
her
to
use
the
list
,
and
to
be
revenged
on
those
who
had
ill
-
used
and
scornfully
treated
her
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
readily
forgive
those
who
had
injured
her
.
<EOS>
As
Duchess
of
Omnium
she
thought
that
probably
she
might
use
that
list
with
efficacy
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
treated
her
well
,
and
she
had
no
such
feeling
against
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
As
Duchess
of
Omnium
she
would
accept
Lady
Glencora
as
her
dearest
friend
,
if
Lady
Glencora
would
admit
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
it
should
be
necessary
that
there
should
be
a
little
duel
between
them
,
as
to
which
of
them
should
take
the
Duke
in
hand
,
the
duel
must
of
course
be
fought
.
<EOS>
In
a
matter
so
important
,
one
woman
would
of
course
expect
no
false
sentiment
from
another
.
<EOS>
She
and
Lady
Glencora
would
understand
each
other
;
 
and
no
doubt
,
respect
each
other
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
she
would
sit
there
resolving
,
or
trying
to
resolve
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
difficult
as
that
task
of
making
up
one
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Who
is
there
that
has
not
longed
that
the
power
and
privilege
of
selection
among
alternatives
should
be
taken
away
from
him
in
some
important
crisis
of
his
life
,
and
that
his
conduct
should
be
arranged
for
him
,
either
this
way
or
that
,
by
some
divine
power
if
it
were
possible
,
 
by
some
patriarchal
power
in
the
absence
of
divinity
,
 
or
by
chance
even
,
if
nothing
better
than
chance
could
be
found
to
do
it
?
<EOS>
But
no
one
dares
to
cast
the
die
,
and
to
go
honestly
by
the
hazard
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
the
actual
necessity
of
obeying
the
die
,
before
even
the
die
can
be
of
any
use
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
when
Madame
Goesler
had
sat
there
for
an
hour
,
till
her
legs
were
tired
beneath
her
,
she
had
not
resolved
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
as
her
impulse
should
direct
her
when
the
important
moment
came
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
soul
on
earth
to
whom
she
could
go
for
counsel
,
and
when
she
asked
herself
for
counsel
,
the
counsel
would
not
come
.
  
<EOS>
Two
days
afterwards
the
Duke
called
again
.
<EOS>
He
would
come
generally
on
a
Thursday
,
 
early
,
so
that
he
might
be
there
before
other
visitors
;
and
he
had
already
quite
learned
that
when
he
was
there
other
visitors
would
probably
be
refused
admittance
.
<EOS>
How
Lady
Glencora
had
made
her
way
in
,
telling
the
servant
that
her
uncle
was
there
,
he
had
not
understood
.
<EOS>
That
visit
had
been
made
on
the
Thursday
,
but
now
he
came
on
the
Saturday
,
 
having
,
I
regret
to
say
,
sent
down
some
early
fruit
from
his
own
hot
-
houses
,
 
or
from
Covent
Garden
,
 
with
a
little
note
on
the
previous
day
.
<EOS>
The
grapes
might
have
been
pretty
well
,
but
the
note
was
injudicious
.
<EOS>
There
were
three
lines
about
the
grapes
,
as
to
which
there
was
some
special
history
,
the
vine
having
been
brought
from
the
garden
of
some
villa
in
which
some
ill
-
used
queen
had
lived
and
died
;
and
then
there
was
a
postscript
in
one
line
to
say
that
the
Duke
would
call
on
the
following
morning
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
he
had
meant
to
add
this
when
he
began
his
note
;
but
then
children
,
who
want
the
top
brick
,
want
it
so
badly
,
and
cry
for
it
so
perversely
!
  
<EOS>
Of
course
Madame
Goesler
was
at
home
.
<EOS>
But
even
then
she
had
not
made
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
up
her
mind
only
to
this
,
 
that
he
should
be
made
to
speak
plainly
,
and
that
she
would
take
time
for
her
reply
.
<EOS>
Not
even
with
such
a
gem
as
the
Duke
's
coronet
before
her
eyes
,
would
she
jump
at
it
.
<EOS>
Where
there
was
so
much
doubt
,
there
need
at
least
be
no
impatience
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ran
away
the
other
day
,
Duke
,
because
you
could
not
resist
the
charm
of
that
little
boy
,
"
she
said
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
dear
little
boy
,
 
<EOS>
but
it
was
not
that
,
"
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
was
it
?
<EOS>
Your
niece
carried
you
off
in
a
whirl
-
wind
.
<EOS>
She
was
come
and
gone
,
taking
you
with
her
,
in
half
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
disturbed
me
when
I
was
thinking
of
something
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Things
should
n't
be
thought
of
,
 
not
so
deeply
as
that
.
"
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
was
playing
with
a
bunch
of
his
grapes
now
,
eating
one
or
two
from
a
small
china
plate
which
had
stood
upon
the
table
,
and
he
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
a
woman
so
graceful
and
yet
so
natural
.
"
<EOS>
Will
you
not
eat
your
own
grapes
with
me
?
<EOS>
They
are
delicious
;
 
flavoured
with
the
poor
queen
's
sorrows
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
,
knowing
that
it
did
not
suit
his
gastric
juices
to
have
to
deal
with
fruit
eaten
at
odd
times
.
"
<EOS>
Never
think
,
Duke
.
<EOS>
I
am
convinced
that
it
does
no
good
.
<EOS>
It
simply
means
doubting
,
and
doubt
always
leads
to
error
.
<EOS>
The
safest
way
in
the
world
is
to
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
,
"
said
the
Duke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Much
the
safest
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
have
not
sufficient
command
over
yourself
to
enable
you
to
sit
in
repose
,
always
quiet
,
never
committing
yourself
to
the
chance
of
any
danger
,
 
then
take
a
leap
in
the
dark
;
or
rather
many
leaps
.
<EOS>
A
stumbling
horse
regains
his
footing
by
persevering
in
his
onward
course
.
<EOS>
As
for
moving
cautiously
,
that
I
detest
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
yet
one
must
think
;
 
for
instance
,
whether
one
will
succeed
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
that
for
granted
always
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
I
do
not
recommend
motion
at
all
.
<EOS>
Repose
is
my
idea
of
life
;
 
repose
and
grapes
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
sat
for
a
while
silent
,
taking
his
repose
as
far
as
the
outer
man
was
concerned
,
looking
at
his
top
brick
of
the
chimney
,
as
from
time
to
time
she
ate
one
of
his
grapes
.
<EOS>
Probably
she
did
not
eat
above
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
them
altogether
,
but
he
thought
that
the
grapes
must
have
been
made
for
the
woman
,
she
was
so
pretty
in
the
eating
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
speak
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
been
thinking
of
coming
to
Como
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
that
I
never
think
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
want
an
answer
to
my
proposition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
had
answered
your
Grace
on
that
question
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
put
down
the
grapes
,
and
moved
herself
on
her
chair
,
so
that
she
sat
with
her
face
turned
away
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
a
request
to
a
lady
may
be
made
twice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
grateful
,
knowing
how
far
it
is
from
your
intention
to
do
me
any
harm
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
somewhat
ashamed
of
my
warmth
on
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
But
still
there
can
be
but
one
answer
.
<EOS>
There
are
delights
which
a
woman
must
deny
herself
,
let
them
be
ever
so
delightful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
thought
,
 
"
the
Duke
began
,
and
then
he
stopped
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
Grace
was
saying
that
you
thought
,
 
"
  
"
Marie
,
a
man
at
my
age
does
not
like
to
be
denied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
man
likes
to
be
denied
anything
by
a
woman
at
any
age
?
<EOS>
A
woman
who
denies
anything
is
called
cruel
at
once
,
 
even
though
it
be
her
very
soul
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
turned
round
upon
him
now
,
and
was
leaning
forward
towards
him
from
her
chair
,
so
that
he
could
touch
her
if
he
put
out
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Marie
,
"
he
said
,
"
will
you
deny
me
if
I
ask
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
my
lord
;
how
shall
I
say
?
<EOS>
There
is
many
a
trifle
I
would
deny
you
.
<EOS>
There
is
many
a
great
gift
I
would
give
you
willingly
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
the
greatest
gift
of
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
if
you
have
anything
to
say
,
you
must
say
it
plainly
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
a
woman
worse
than
I
am
at
the
reading
of
riddles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
endure
to
live
in
the
quietude
of
an
Italian
lake
with
an
old
man
?
"
Now
he
touched
her
again
,
and
had
taken
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lord
;
 
nor
with
a
young
one
,
 
for
all
my
days
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
know
that
age
would
guide
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
the
Duke
rose
and
made
his
proposition
in
form
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Marie
,
you
know
that
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
Why
it
is
that
I
at
my
age
should
feel
so
sore
a
love
,
I
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
sore
a
love
!
"
  
"
So
sore
,
if
it
be
not
gratified
.
<EOS>
Marie
,
I
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Duke
of
Omnium
,
this
from
you
!
"
  
"
Yes
,
from
me
.
<EOS>
My
coronet
is
at
your
feet
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
allow
me
to
raise
it
,
I
will
place
it
on
your
brow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
she
went
away
from
him
,
and
seated
herself
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
or
two
he
followed
her
,
and
stood
with
his
arm
upon
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
give
me
an
answer
,
Marie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
have
thought
of
this
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
;
I
have
thought
of
it
much
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
your
friends
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
may
venture
to
please
myself
in
this
,
 
as
in
everything
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
answer
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
Think
how
high
is
the
position
you
offer
me
,
and
how
immense
is
the
change
you
propose
to
me
.
<EOS>
Allow
me
two
days
,
and
I
will
answer
you
by
letter
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
fluttered
now
that
I
must
leave
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
came
to
her
,
took
her
hand
,
kissed
her
brow
,
and
opened
the
door
for
her
.
   
<EOS>
Another
Duel
 
<EOS>
It
happened
that
there
were
at
this
time
certain
matters
of
business
to
be
settled
between
the
Duke
of
Omnium
and
his
nephew
Mr.
Palliser
,
respecting
which
the
latter
called
upon
his
uncle
on
the
morning
after
the
Duke
had
committed
himself
by
his
offer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Palliser
had
come
by
appointment
made
with
Mr.
Fothergill
,
the
Duke
's
man
of
business
,
and
had
expected
to
meet
Mr.
Fothergill
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fothergill
,
however
,
was
not
with
the
Duke
,
and
the
uncle
told
the
nephew
that
the
business
had
been
postponed
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Palliser
asked
some
question
as
to
the
reason
of
such
postponement
,
not
meaning
much
by
his
question
,
 
and
the
Duke
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
answered
him
,
meaning
very
much
by
his
answer
.
"
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
Plantagenet
,
that
it
is
possible
that
I
may
marry
,
and
if
so
this
arrangement
would
not
suit
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
be
married
?
"
asked
the
astonished
nephew
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
exactly
that
,
 
but
it
is
possible
that
I
may
do
so
.
<EOS>
Since
I
proposed
this
matter
to
Fothergill
,
I
have
been
thinking
over
it
,
and
I
have
changed
my
mind
.
<EOS>
It
will
make
but
<EOS>
little
difference
to
you
;
and
after
all
you
are
a
far
richer
man
than
I
am
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
thinking
of
money
,
Duke
,
"
said
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
what
then
were
you
thinking
?
"
  
"
Simply
of
what
you
told
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
in
the
least
mean
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
Plantagenet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
could
not
hear
such
a
statement
from
you
without
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
Whatever
you
do
<EOS>
I
hope
will
tend
to
make
you
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
much
passed
between
the
uncle
and
the
nephew
,
and
what
the
uncle
told
to
the
nephew
,
the
nephew
of
course
told
to
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
with
her
again
,
yesterday
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
for
more
than
an
hour
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
been
half
the
morning
dressing
himself
before
he
went
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
engaged
to
her
,
or
he
would
have
told
me
,
"
said
Plantagenet
Palliser
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
would
,
but
there
is
no
knowing
.
<EOS>
At
the
present
moment
I
have
only
one
doubt
,
 
whether
to
act
upon
him
or
upon
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
that
you
can
do
good
by
going
to
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
will
see
.
<EOS>
If
she
be
the
woman
I
take
her
to
be
,
I
think
I
could
do
something
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
supposed
her
to
be
a
bad
woman
,
 
never
.
<EOS>
I
will
think
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Lady
Glencora
left
her
husband
,
and
did
not
consult
him
afterwards
as
to
the
course
she
would
pursue
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
budget
to
manage
,
and
his
speeches
to
make
.
<EOS>
The
little
affair
of
the
Duke
and
Madame
Goesler
<EOS>
,
she
thought
it
best
to
take
into
her
own
hands
without
any
assistance
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
fool
I
was
,
"
she
said
to
herself
,
"
to
have
her
down
there
when
the
Duke
was
at
Matching
!
"
  
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
,
when
she
was
left
alone
,
felt
that
now
indeed
she
must
make
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
had
asked
for
two
days
.
<EOS>
The
intervening
day
was
a
Sunday
,
and
on
the
Monday
she
must
send
her
answer
.
<EOS>
She
might
doubt
at
any
rate
for
this
one
night
,
 
the
Saturday
night
,
 
and
sit
playing
,
as
it
were
,
with
the
coronet
of
a
duchess
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
born
the
daughter
of
a
small
country
attorney
,
and
now
a
duke
had
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
,
 
and
a
duke
who
was
acknowledged
to
stand
above
other
dukes
!
<EOS>
Nothing
at
any
rate
could
rob
her
of
that
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Whatever
resolution
she
might
form
at
last
,
she
had
by
her
own
resources
reached
a
point
of
success
in
remembering
which
there
would
always
be
a
keen
gratification
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
much
to
be
Duchess
of
Omnium
;
but
it
would
be
something
also
to
have
refused
to
be
a
Duchess
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
During
that
evening
,
that
night
,
and
the
next
morning
,
she
remained
playing
with
the
coronet
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
go
to
church
.
<EOS>
What
good
could
any
sermon
do
her
while
that
bauble
was
dangling
before
her
eyes
?
<EOS>
After
church
-
time
,
about
two
o'clock
,
Phineas
Finn
came
to
her
.
<EOS>
Just
at
this
period
Phineas
would
come
to
her
often
;
 
sometimes
full
of
a
new
decision
to
forget
Violet
Effingham
altogether
,
at
others
minded
to
continue
his
siege
<EOS>
let
the
hope
of
success
be
ever
so
small
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
heard
that
Violet
and
Lord
Chiltern
had
in
truth
quarrelled
,
and
was
of
course
anxious
to
be
advised
to
continue
the
siege
.
<EOS>
When
he
first
came
in
and
spoke
a
word
or
two
,
in
which
there
was
no
reference
to
Violet
Effingham
,
there
came
upon
Madame
Goesler
a
strong
wish
to
decide
at
once
that
she
would
play
no
longer
with
the
coronet
,
that
the
gem
was
not
worth
the
cost
she
would
be
called
upon
to
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
world
better
for
her
than
the
coronet
,
 
if
only
it
might
be
had
.
<EOS>
But
within
ten
minutes
he
had
told
her
the
whole
tale
about
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
how
he
had
seen
Violet
at
Lady
Baldock
's
,
 
and
how
there
might
yet
be
hope
for
him
.
<EOS>
What
would
she
advise
him
to
do
?
"
<EOS>
Go
home
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
write
a
sonnet
to
her
eyebrow
.
<EOS>
See
if
that
will
have
any
effect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
well
!
<EOS>
It
is
natural
that
you
should
laugh
at
me
;
but
somehow
,
I
did
not
expect
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
be
angry
with
me
.
<EOS>
What
I
mean
is
that
such
little
things
seem
to
influence
this
Violet
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
they
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
found
that
they
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
had
loved
Lord
Chiltern
she
would
not
have
quarrelled
with
him
for
a
few
words
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
loved
you
,
she
would
not
have
accepted
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
If
she
loves
neither
of
you
,
she
should
say
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
losing
my
respect
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
say
that
,
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
I
respect
her
as
strongly
as
I
love
her
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Madame
Goesler
almost
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
have
the
coronet
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
substance
about
the
coronet
that
would
not
elude
her
grasp
.
  
<EOS>
Late
that
afternoon
,
while
she
was
still
hesitating
,
there
came
another
caller
to
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
hesitating
,
feeling
that
she
had
as
yet
another
night
before
her
.
<EOS>
Should
she
be
Duchess
of
Omnium
or
not
?
<EOS>
All
that
she
wished
to
be
,
she
could
not
be
;
 
but
to
be
<EOS>
Duchess
of
Omnium
was
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
Then
she
began
to
ask
herself
various
questions
.
<EOS>
Would
the
Queen
refuse
to
accept
her
in
her
new
rank
?
<EOS>
Refuse
!
<EOS>
How
could
any
Queen
refuse
to
accept
her
?
<EOS>
She
had
not
done
aught
amiss
in
life
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
slur
on
her
name
;
no
stain
on
her
character
.
<EOS>
What
though
her
father
had
been
a
small
attorney
,
and
her
first
husband
a
Jew
banker
!
<EOS>
She
had
broken
no
law
of
God
or
man
,
had
been
accused
of
breaking
no
law
,
which
breaking
or
which
accusation
need
stand
in
the
way
of
her
being
as
good
a
duchess
as
any
other
woman
!
<EOS>
She
was
sitting
thinking
of
this
,
almost
angry
with
herself
at
the
awe
with
which
the
proposed
rank
inspired
her
,
when
Lady
Glencora
was
announced
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
Goesler
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
"
I
am
very
glad
to
find
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
more
than
equally
so
,
to
be
found
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
,
smiling
with
all
her
grace
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
has
been
with
you
since
I
saw
you
last
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
 
more
than
once
if
I
remember
right
.
<EOS>
He
was
here
yesterday
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
comes
often
to
you
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
so
often
as
I
would
wish
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
is
one
of
my
dearest
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
a
quick
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
a
quick
friendship
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
pause
for
some
moments
which
Madame
Goesler
was
determined
that
she
would
not
break
.
<EOS>
It
was
clear
to
her
now
on
what
ground
Lady
Glencora
had
come
to
her
,
and
she
was
fully
minded
that
if
she
could
bear
the
full
light
of
the
god
himself
in
all
his
glory
,
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
scorched
by
any
reflected
heat
coming
from
the
god
's
niece
.
<EOS>
She
thought
she
could
endure
anything
that
Lady
Glencora
might
say
;
but
she
would
wait
and
hear
what
might
be
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Madame
Goesler
,
that
I
had
better
hurry
on
to
my
subject
at
once
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
almost
hesitating
as
she
spoke
,
and
feeling
that
the
colour
was
rushing
up
to
her
cheeks
and
covering
her
brow
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
what
I
have
to
say
will
be
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
shall
offend
you
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
do
not
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
offended
at
nothing
,
Lady
Glencora
,
unless
I
think
that
you
mean
to
offend
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
protest
that
I
do
not
.
<EOS>
You
have
seen
my
little
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
The
sweetest
child
!
<EOS>
God
never
gave
me
anything
half
so
precious
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
Duke
's
heir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
myself
,
by
my
honour
as
a
woman
,
I
care
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
am
rich
and
have
all
that
the
world
can
give
me
.
<EOS>
For
my
husband
,
in
this
matter
,
I
care
nothing
.
<EOS>
His
career
he
will
make
for
himself
,
and
it
will
depend
on
no
title
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
all
this
to
me
,
Lady
Glencora
?
<EOS>
What
have
I
to
do
with
your
husband
's
titles
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
;
 
if
it
be
true
that
there
is
an
idea
of
marriage
between
you
and
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Psha
!
"
said
Madame
Goesler
,
with
all
the
scorn
of
which
she
was
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
untrue
,
then
?
"
asked
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
it
is
not
untrue
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
idea
of
such
a
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
engaged
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
am
not
engaged
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
he
asked
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Glencora
,
I
really
must
say
that
such
a
cross
-
questioning
from
one
lady
to
another
is
very
unusual
.
<EOS>
I
have
promised
not
to
be
offended
,
unless
I
thought
that
you
wished
to
offend
me
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
drive
me
too
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madame
Goesler
,
if
you
will
tell
me
that
I
am
mistaken
,
I
will
beg
your
pardon
,
and
offer
to
you
the
most
sincere
friendship
which
one
woman
can
give
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Glencora
,
I
can
tell
you
nothing
of
the
kind
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
is
to
be
so
!
<EOS>
And
have
you
thought
what
you
would
gain
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
much
of
what
I
should
gain
:
 
and
something
also
of
what
I
should
lose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
;
plenty
,
 
for
wants
so
moderate
as
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
position
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
yes
;
a
sort
of
position
.
<EOS>
Not
such
as
yours
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
That
,
if
it
be
not
born
to
a
woman
,
can
only
come
to
her
from
a
husband
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
win
it
for
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
free
as
air
,
going
where
you
like
,
and
doing
what
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
free
,
sometimes
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
will
you
gain
by
changing
all
this
simply
for
a
title
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
for
such
a
title
,
Lady
Glencora
!
<EOS>
It
may
be
little
to
you
to
be
Duchess
of
Omnium
,
but
think
what
it
must
be
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
for
this
you
will
not
hesitate
to
rob
him
of
all
his
friends
,
to
embitter
his
future
life
,
to
degrade
him
among
his
peers
,
 
"
  
"
Degrade
him
!
<EOS>
Who
dares
say
that
I
shall
degrade
him
?
<EOS>
He
will
exalt
me
,
but
I
shall
no
whit
degrade
him
.
<EOS>
You
forget
yourself
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
despise
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
did
,
would
I
offer
you
my
hand
in
friendship
?
<EOS>
But
an
old
man
,
over
seventy
,
carrying
the
weight
and
burden
of
such
rank
as
his
,
will
degrade
himself
in
the
eyes
of
his
fellows
,
if
he
marries
a
young
woman
without
rank
,
let
her
be
ever
so
clever
,
ever
so
beautiful
.
<EOS>
A
Duke
of
Omnium
may
not
do
as
he
pleases
,
as
may
another
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
well
,
Lady
Glencora
,
for
other
dukes
,
and
for
the
daughters
and
heirs
and
cousins
of
other
dukes
,
that
his
Grace
should
try
that
question
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
if
you
wish
it
,
argue
this
matter
with
you
on
many
points
,
but
I
will
not
allow
you
to
say
that
I
should
degrade
any
man
whom
I
might
marry
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
as
unstained
as
your
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
nothing
of
that
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
him
;
 
I
certainly
would
not
willingly
injure
him
.
<EOS>
Who
wishes
to
injure
a
friend
?
<EOS>
And
,
in
truth
,
I
have
so
little
to
gain
,
that
the
temptation
to
do
him
an
injury
,
if
I
thought
it
one
,
is
not
strong
.
<EOS>
For
your
little
boy
,
Lady
Glencora
,
I
think
your
fears
are
premature
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
said
this
,
there
came
a
smile
over
her
face
,
which
threatened
to
break
from
control
and
almost
become
laughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
,
my
mind
will
not
be
turned
against
this
marriage
half
so
strongly
by
any
arguments
you
can
use
as
by
those
which
I
can
adduce
myself
.
<EOS>
You
have
nearly
driven
me
into
it
by
telling
me
I
should
degrade
his
house
.
<EOS>
It
is
almost
incumbent
on
me
to
prove
that
you
are
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
you
had
better
leave
me
to
settle
the
matter
in
my
own
bosom
.
<EOS>
You
had
indeed
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
while
Lady
Glencora
did
leave
her
,
 
to
settle
the
matter
within
her
own
bosom
,
 
having
no
other
alternative
.
   
<EOS>
The
Letter
That
Was
Sent
to
Brighton
 
Monday
morning
came
and
Madame
Goesler
had
as
yet
written
no
answer
to
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
Had
not
Lady
Glencora
gone
to
Park
Lane
on
the
Sunday
afternoon
<EOS>
,
I
think
the
letter
would
have
been
written
on
that
day
;
but
,
whatever
may
have
been
the
effect
of
Lady
Glencora
's
visit
,
it
so
far
disturbed
Madame
Goesler
as
to
keep
her
from
her
writing
-
table
.
<EOS>
There
was
yet
another
night
for
thought
,
and
then
the
letter
should
be
written
on
the
Monday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lady
Glencora
left
Madame
Goesler
<EOS>
she
went
at
once
to
the
Duke
's
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
custom
to
see
her
husband
's
uncle
on
a
Sunday
,
and
she
would
most
frequently
find
him
just
at
this
hour
,
 
before
he
went
up
-
stairs
to
dress
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
She
usually
took
her
boy
with
her
,
but
on
this
occasion
she
went
alone
.
<EOS>
She
had
tried
what
she
could
do
with
Madame
Goesler
,
and
she
found
that
she
had
failed
.
<EOS>
She
must
now
make
her
attempt
upon
the
Duke
.
<EOS>
But
the
Duke
,
perhaps
anticipating
some
attack
of
the
kind
,
had
fled
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
his
Grace
,
Barker
?
"
said
Lady
Glencora
to
the
porter
.
<EOS>
"
We
do
not
know
,
your
ladyship
.
<EOS>
His
Grace
went
away
yesterday
evening
with
nobody
but
Lapoule
.
<EOS>
"
Lapoule
was
the
Duke
's
French
valet
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
could
only
return
home
and
consider
in
her
own
mind
what
batteries
might
yet
be
brought
to
bear
upon
the
Duke
,
towards
stopping
the
marriage
,
even
after
the
engagement
should
have
been
made
,
 
if
it
were
to
be
made
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
felt
that
such
batteries
might
still
be
brought
up
as
would
not
improbably
have
an
effect
on
a
proud
,
weak
old
man
.
<EOS>
If
all
other
resources
failed
,
royalty
in
some
of
its
branches
might
be
induced
to
make
a
request
,
and
every
august
relation
in
the
peerage
should
interfere
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
no
doubt
might
persevere
and
marry
whom
he
pleased
,
 
if
he
were
strong
enough
.
<EOS>
But
it
requires
much
personal
strength
,
 
that
standing
alone
against
the
well
-
armed
batteries
of
all
one
's
friends
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
had
once
tried
such
a
battle
on
her
own
behalf
,
and
had
failed
.
<EOS>
She
had
wished
to
be
imprudent
when
she
was
young
;
but
her
friends
had
been
too
strong
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
reduced
,
and
kept
in
order
,
and
made
to
run
in
a
groove
,
 
and
was
now
,
when
she
sat
looking
at
her
little
boy
with
his
bold
face
,
almost
inclined
to
think
that
the
world
was
right
,
and
that
grooves
were
best
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
had
been
controlled
when
she
was
young
,
so
ought
the
Duke
to
be
controlled
now
that
he
was
old
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
very
well
for
a
man
or
woman
to
boast
that
he
,
 
or
she
,
 
may
do
what
he
likes
with
his
own
,
 
or
with
her
own
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
circumstances
in
which
such
self
-
action
is
ruinous
to
so
many
that
coercion
from
the
outside
becomes
absolutely
needed
.
<EOS>
Nobody
had
felt
the
injustice
of
such
coercion
when
applied
to
herself
more
sharply
than
had
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
lived
to
acknowledge
that
such
coercion
might
be
proper
,
and
was
now
prepared
to
use
it
in
any
shape
in
which
it
might
be
made
available
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
for
Madame
Goesler
to
laugh
and
exclaim
,
"
Psha
!
"
<EOS>
when
Lady
Glencora
declared
her
real
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
should
it
ever
come
to
pass
that
a
black
-
browed
baby
with
a
yellow
skin
should
be
shown
to
the
world
as
Lord
Silverbridge
,
Lady
Glencora
knew
that
her
peace
of
mind
would
be
gone
for
ever
.
<EOS>
She
had
begun
the
world
desiring
one
thing
,
and
had
missed
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
suffered
much
,
and
had
then
reconciled
herself
to
other
hopes
.
<EOS>
If
those
other
hopes
were
also
to
be
cut
away
from
her
,
the
world
would
not
be
worth
a
pinch
of
snuff
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
had
fled
,
and
she
could
do
nothing
to
-
day
;
but
to
-
morrow
she
would
begin
with
her
batteries
.
<EOS>
And
she
herself
had
done
the
mischief
!
<EOS>
She
had
invited
this
woman
down
to
Matching
!
<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
!
 
<EOS>
that
such
a
man
as
the
Duke
should
be
such
a
fool
!
 
<EOS>
The
widow
of
a
Jew
banker
!
<EOS>
He
,
the
Duke
of
Omnium
,
 
and
thus
to
cut
away
from
himself
,
for
the
rest
of
his
life
,
all
honour
,
all
peace
of
mind
,
all
the
grace
of
a
noble
end
to
a
career
which
,
if
not
very
noble
in
itself
,
had
received
the
praise
of
nobility
!
<EOS>
And
to
do
this
for
a
thin
,
black
-
browed
,
yellow
-
visaged
woman
with
ringlets
and
devil
's
eyes
,
and
a
beard
on
her
upper
lip
,
 
a
Jewess
,
 
a
creature
of
whose
habits
of
life
and
manners
of
thought
they
all
were
absolutely
ignorant
;
who
drank
,
possibly
;
who
might
have
been
a
forger
,
for
what
any
one
knew
;
an
adventuress
who
had
found
her
way
into
society
by
her
art
and
perseverance
,
 
and
who
did
not
even
pretend
to
have
a
relation
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
That
such
a
one
should
have
influence
enough
to
intrude
herself
into
the
house
of
Omnium
,
and
blot
the
scutcheon
,
and
,
  
what
was
worst
of
all
,
 
perhaps
be
the
mother
of
future
dukes
!
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
,
in
her
anger
,
was
very
unjust
to
Madame
Goesler
,
thinking
all
evil
of
her
,
accusing
her
in
her
mind
of
every
crime
,
denying
her
all
charm
,
all
beauty
.
<EOS>
Had
the
Duke
forgotten
himself
and
his
position
for
the
sake
of
some
fair
girl
with
a
pink
complexion
and
grey
eyes
,
and
smooth
hair
,
and
a
father
,
Lady
Glencora
thought
that
she
would
have
forgiven
it
better
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
Madame
Goesler
would
win
her
way
to
the
coronet
;
but
when
she
came
to
put
it
on
,
she
should
find
that
there
were
sharp
thorns
inside
the
lining
of
it
.
<EOS>
Not
a
woman
worth
the
knowing
in
all
London
should
speak
to
her
;
 
nor
a
man
either
of
those
men
with
whom
a
Duchess
of
Omnium
would
wish
to
hold
converse
.
<EOS>
She
should
find
her
husband
rated
as
a
doting
fool
,
and
herself
rated
as
a
scheming
female
adventuress
.
<EOS>
And
it
should
go
hard
with
Lady
Glencora
,
if
the
Duke
were
not
separated
from
his
new
Duchess
before
the
end
of
the
first
year
!
<EOS>
In
her
anger
Lady
Glencora
was
very
unjust
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
,
when
he
left
his
house
without
telling
his
household
whither
he
was
going
,
did
send
his
address
to
,
 
the
top
brick
of
the
chimney
.
<EOS>
His
note
,
which
was
delivered
at
Madame
Goesler
's
house
late
on
the
Sunday
evening
,
was
as
follows
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
to
have
your
answer
on
Monday
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
Brighton
.
<EOS>
Send
it
by
a
private
messenger
to
the
Bedford
Hotel
there
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
with
what
expectation
,
with
what
hope
,
with
what
fear
I
shall
await
it
.
 
<EOS>
O.
"
Poor
old
man
!
<EOS>
He
had
run
through
all
the
pleasures
of
life
too
quickly
,
and
had
not
much
left
with
which
to
amuse
himself
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
had
set
his
eyes
on
a
top
brick
,
and
being
tired
of
everything
else
,
wanted
it
very
sorely
.
<EOS>
Poor
old
man
!
<EOS>
How
should
it
do
him
any
good
,
even
if
he
got
it
?
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
,
when
she
received
the
note
,
sat
with
it
in
her
hand
,
thinking
of
his
great
want
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
would
be
tired
of
his
new
plaything
after
a
month
,
"
she
said
to
herself
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
given
herself
to
the
next
morning
,
and
she
would
not
make
up
her
mind
that
night
.
<EOS>
She
would
sleep
once
more
with
the
coronet
of
a
duchess
within
her
reach
.
<EOS>
She
did
do
so
;
and
woke
in
the
morning
with
her
mind
absolutely
in
doubt
.
<EOS>
When
she
walked
down
to
breakfast
,
all
doubt
was
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
The
time
had
come
when
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
resolve
,
and
while
her
maid
was
brushing
her
hair
for
her
she
did
make
her
resolution
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
great
lady
,
"
said
the
maid
,
who
may
probably
have
reflected
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
did
not
come
here
so
often
for
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
,
Lotta
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
women
I
know
,
madame
,
talk
so
much
of
their
countesses
,
and
ladyships
,
and
duchesses
.
<EOS>
I
would
never
rest
till
I
had
a
title
in
this
country
,
if
I
were
a
lady
,
 
and
rich
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
can
the
countesses
,
and
the
ladyships
,
and
the
duchesses
do
as
they
please
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
madame
;
 
I
know
not
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
know
.
<EOS>
That
will
do
,
Lotta
.
<EOS>
Now
leave
me
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Madame
Goesler
had
made
up
her
mind
;
but
I
do
not
know
whether
that
doubt
as
to
having
her
own
way
had
much
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
As
the
wife
of
an
old
man
she
would
probably
have
had
much
of
her
own
way
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
breakfast
she
wrote
her
answer
to
the
Duke
,
which
was
as
follows
:
    
Park
Lane
,
Monday
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
DUKE
OF
OMNIUM
,
  
<EOS>
I
find
so
great
a
difficulty
in
expressing
myself
to
your
Grace
in
a
written
letter
,
that
since
you
left
me
I
have
never
ceased
to
wish
that
I
had
been
less
nervous
,
less
doubting
,
and
less
foolish
when
you
were
present
with
me
here
in
my
room
.
<EOS>
I
might
then
have
said
in
one
word
what
will
take
so
many
awkward
words
to
explain
.
  
<EOS>
Great
as
is
the
honour
you
propose
to
confer
on
me
,
rich
as
is
the
gift
you
offer
me
,
I
can
not
accept
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
your
Grace
's
wife
.
<EOS>
I
may
almost
say
that
I
knew
it
was
so
when
you
parted
from
me
;
but
the
surprise
of
the
situation
took
away
from
me
a
part
of
my
judgment
,
and
made
me
unable
to
answer
you
as
I
should
have
done
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
the
truth
is
,
that
I
am
not
fit
to
be
the
wife
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
I
should
injure
you
;
and
though
I
should
raise
myself
in
name
,
I
should
injure
myself
in
character
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
think
,
because
I
say
this
,
that
there
is
any
reason
why
I
should
not
be
an
honest
man
's
wife
.
<EOS>
There
is
none
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
on
my
conscience
which
I
could
not
tell
you
,
 
or
to
another
man
;
nothing
that
I
need
fear
to
tell
to
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
my
lord
,
there
is
nothing
to
tell
<EOS>
but
this
,
 
that
I
am
not
fitted
by
birth
and
position
to
be
the
wife
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
to
blush
for
me
,
and
that
no
man
shall
ever
have
to
do
on
my
account
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
own
that
I
have
been
ambitious
,
too
ambitious
,
and
have
been
pleased
to
think
that
one
so
exalted
as
you
are
,
one
whose
high
position
is
so
rife
in
the
eyes
of
all
men
,
should
have
taken
pleasure
in
my
company
.
<EOS>
I
will
confess
to
a
foolish
woman
's
silly
vanity
in
having
wished
to
be
known
to
be
the
friend
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
I
am
like
the
other
moths
that
flutter
near
the
light
and
have
their
wings
burned
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
wiser
than
they
in
this
,
that
having
been
scorched
,
I
know
that
I
must
keep
my
distance
.
<EOS>
You
will
easily
believe
that
a
woman
,
such
as
I
am
,
does
not
refuse
to
ride
in
a
carriage
with
your
Grace
's
arms
on
the
panels
without
a
regret
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
philosopher
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
pretend
to
despise
the
rich
things
of
the
world
,
or
the
high
things
.
<EOS>
According
to
my
way
of
thinking
a
woman
ought
to
wish
to
be
Duchess
of
Omnium
;
 
but
she
ought
to
wish
also
to
be
able
to
carry
her
coronet
with
a
proper
grace
.
<EOS>
As
Madame
Goesler
I
can
live
,
even
among
my
superiors
,
at
my
ease
.
<EOS>
As
your
Grace
's
wife
,
I
should
be
easy
no
longer
;
  
nor
would
your
Grace
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
think
perhaps
that
what
I
write
is
heartless
,
that
I
speak
altogether
of
your
rank
,
and
not
at
all
of
the
affection
you
have
shown
me
,
or
of
that
which
I
might
possibly
bear
towards
you
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
when
the
first
flush
of
passion
is
over
in
early
youth
men
and
women
should
strive
to
regulate
their
love
,
as
they
do
their
other
desires
,
by
their
reason
.
<EOS>
I
could
love
your
Grace
,
fondly
,
as
your
wife
,
if
I
thought
it
well
for
your
Grace
or
for
myself
that
we
should
be
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
As
I
think
it
would
be
ill
for
both
of
us
,
I
will
restrain
that
feeling
,
and
remember
your
Grace
ever
with
the
purest
feeling
of
true
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
close
this
letter
,
I
must
utter
a
word
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
In
the
kind
of
life
which
I
have
led
as
a
widow
,
a
life
which
has
been
very
isolated
as
regards
true
fellowship
,
it
has
been
my
greatest
effort
to
obtain
the
good
opinion
of
those
among
whom
I
have
attempted
to
make
my
way
.
<EOS>
I
may
,
perhaps
,
own
to
you
now
that
I
have
had
many
difficulties
.
<EOS>
A
woman
who
is
alone
in
the
world
is
ever
regarded
with
suspicion
.
<EOS>
In
this
country
a
woman
with
a
foreign
name
,
with
means
derived
from
foreign
sources
,
with
a
foreign
history
,
is
specially
suspected
.
<EOS>
I
have
striven
to
live
that
down
,
and
I
have
succeeded
.
<EOS>
But
in
my
wildest
dreams
I
never
dreamed
of
such
success
as
this
,
 
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
should
think
me
the
worthiest
of
the
worthy
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
that
I
am
not
ungrateful
,
 
that
I
never
will
be
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
And
I
trust
it
will
not
derogate
from
your
opinion
of
my
worth
,
that
I
have
known
what
was
due
to
your
Grace
's
highness
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
to
be
,
My
Lord
Duke
,
Your
most
obliged
and
faithful
servant
,
  
MARIE
MAX
GOESLER
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
many
unmarried
women
in
England
are
there
would
do
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
herself
,
as
she
folded
the
paper
,
and
put
it
into
an
envelope
,
and
sealed
the
cover
.
<EOS>
The
moment
that
the
letter
was
completed
she
sent
it
off
,
as
she
was
directed
to
send
it
,
so
that
there
might
be
no
possibility
of
repentance
and
subsequent
hesitation
.
<EOS>
She
had
at
last
made
up
her
mind
,
and
she
would
stand
by
the
making
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
there
would
come
moments
in
which
she
would
deeply
regret
the
opportunity
that
she
had
lost
,
 
the
chance
of
greatness
that
she
had
flung
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
But
so
would
she
have
often
regretted
it
,
also
,
had
she
accepted
the
greatness
.
<EOS>
Her
position
was
one
in
which
there
must
be
regret
,
let
her
decision
have
been
what
it
might
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
decided
,
and
the
thing
was
done
.
<EOS>
She
would
still
be
free
,
 
Marie
Max
Goesler
,
 
unless
in
abandoning
her
freedom
she
would
obtain
something
that
she
might
in
truth
prefer
to
it
.
<EOS>
When
the
letter
was
gone
she
sat
disconsolate
,
at
the
window
of
an
up
-
stairs
room
in
which
she
had
written
,
thinking
much
of
the
coronet
,
much
of
the
name
,
much
of
the
rank
,
much
of
that
position
in
society
which
she
had
flattered
herself
she
might
have
won
for
herself
as
Duchess
of
Omnium
by
her
beauty
,
her
grace
,
and
her
wit
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
simply
her
ambition
to
be
a
duchess
,
without
further
aim
or
object
.
<EOS>
She
had
fancied
that
she
might
have
been
such
a
duchess
as
there
is
never
another
,
so
that
her
fame
might
have
been
great
throughout
Europe
,
as
a
woman
charming
at
all
points
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
have
had
friends
,
then
,
 
real
friends
,
and
would
not
have
lived
alone
as
it
was
now
her
fate
to
do
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
have
loved
her
ducal
husband
,
old
though
he
was
,
and
stiff
with
pomp
and
ceremony
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
loved
him
,
and
done
her
best
to
add
something
of
brightness
to
his
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
true
that
there
was
one
whom
she
loved
better
;
but
of
what
avail
was
it
to
love
a
man
who
,
when
he
came
to
her
,
would
speak
to
her
of
nothing
but
of
the
charms
which
he
found
in
another
woman
!
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
sitting
thus
at
her
window
,
with
a
book
in
her
hand
,
at
which
she
never
looked
,
gazing
over
the
park
which
was
now
beautiful
with
its
May
verdure
,
when
on
a
sudden
a
thought
struck
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
Palliser
had
come
to
her
,
trying
to
enlist
her
sympathy
for
the
little
heir
,
behaving
,
indeed
,
not
very
well
,
as
Madame
Goesler
had
thought
,
but
still
with
an
earnest
purpose
which
was
in
itself
good
.
<EOS>
She
would
write
to
Lady
Glencora
and
put
her
out
of
her
misery
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
was
some
feeling
of
triumph
in
her
mind
as
she
returned
to
the
desk
from
which
her
epistle
had
been
sent
to
the
Duke
;
 
not
of
that
triumph
which
would
have
found
its
gratification
in
boasting
of
the
offer
that
had
been
made
to
her
,
but
arising
from
a
feeling
that
she
could
now
show
the
proud
mother
of
the
bold
-
faced
boy
that
though
she
would
not
pledge
herself
to
any
woman
as
to
what
she
might
do
or
not
do
,
she
was
nevertheless
capable
of
resisting
such
a
temptation
as
would
have
been
irresistible
to
many
.
<EOS>
Of
the
Duke
's
offer
to
her
she
would
have
spoken
to
no
human
being
,
had
not
this
woman
shown
that
the
Duke
's
purpose
was
known
at
least
to
her
,
and
now
,
in
her
letter
,
she
would
write
no
plain
word
of
that
offer
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
state
,
in
words
intelligible
to
any
one
who
might
read
,
that
the
Duke
had
offered
her
his
hand
and
his
coronet
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
write
so
that
Lady
Glencora
should
understand
her
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
be
careful
that
there
should
be
no
word
in
the
letter
to
make
Lady
Glencora
think
that
she
supposed
herself
to
be
unfit
for
the
rank
offered
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
very
humble
in
what
she
had
written
to
the
Duke
,
but
she
would
not
be
at
all
humble
in
what
she
was
about
to
write
to
the
mother
of
the
bold
-
faced
boy
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
letter
when
it
was
written
:
    
MY
DEAR
LADY
GLENCORA
,
  
<EOS>
I
venture
to
send
you
a
line
to
put
you
out
of
your
misery
;
 
for
you
<EOS>
were
very
miserable
when
you
were
so
good
as
to
come
here
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Your
dear
little
boy
is
safe
from
me
;
 
and
,
what
is
more
to
the
purpose
,
so
are
you
and
your
husband
,
 
and
your
uncle
,
whom
,
in
truth
,
I
love
.
<EOS>
You
asked
me
a
downright
question
which
I
did
not
then
choose
to
answer
by
a
downright
answer
.
<EOS>
The
downright
answer
was
not
at
that
time
due
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
has
since
been
given
,
and
as
I
like
you
too
well
to
wish
you
to
be
in
torment
<EOS>
,
I
send
you
a
line
to
say
that
I
shall
never
be
in
the
way
of
you
or
your
boy
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
dear
Lady
Glencora
,
one
word
more
.
<EOS>
Should
it
ever
again
appear
to
you
to
be
necessary
to
use
your
zeal
for
the
protection
of
your
husband
or
your
child
,
do
not
endeavour
to
dissuade
a
woman
by
trying
to
make
her
think
that
she
,
by
her
alliance
,
would
bring
degradation
into
any
house
,
or
to
any
man
.
<EOS>
If
there
could
have
been
an
argument
powerful
with
me
,
to
make
me
do
that
which
you
wished
to
prevent
,
it
was
the
argument
which
you
used
.
<EOS>
But
my
own
comfort
,
and
the
happiness
of
another
person
whom
I
value
almost
as
much
as
myself
,
were
too
important
to
be
sacrificed
even
to
a
woman
's
revenge
.
<EOS>
I
take
mine
by
writing
to
you
and
telling
you
that
I
am
better
and
more
rational
and
wiser
than
you
took
me
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
after
this
,
you
choose
to
be
on
good
terms
with
me
,
I
shall
be
happy
to
be
your
friend
.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
no
further
revenge
.
<EOS>
You
owe
me
some
little
apology
;
but
whether
you
make
it
or
not
,
I
will
be
contented
,
and
will
never
do
more
than
ask
whether
your
darling
's
prospects
are
still
safe
.
<EOS>
There
are
more
women
than
one
in
the
world
,
you
know
,
and
you
must
not
consider
yourself
to
be
out
of
the
wood
because
you
have
escaped
from
a
single
danger
.
<EOS>
If
there
arise
another
,
come
to
me
,
and
we
will
consult
together
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Lady
Glencora
,
yours
always
sincerely
,
  
MARIE
M.
G.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
thing
or
two
besides
which
she
longed
to
say
,
laughing
as
she
thought
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
she
refrained
,
and
her
letter
,
when
finished
,
was
as
it
is
given
above
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
following
,
Lady
Glencora
was
again
in
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
When
she
first
read
Madame
Goesler
's
letter
,
she
felt
herself
to
be
annoyed
and
angry
,
but
her
anger
was
with
herself
rather
than
with
her
correspondent
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
her
last
interview
with
the
woman
whom
she
had
feared
,
she
had
been
conscious
of
having
been
indiscreet
.
<EOS>
All
her
feelings
had
been
too
violent
,
and
it
might
well
have
been
that
she
should
have
driven
this
woman
to
do
the
very
thing
that
she
was
so
anxious
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
"
You
owe
me
some
little
apology
,
"
Madame
Goesler
had
said
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
,
 
and
she
would
apologise
.
<EOS>
Undue
pride
was
not
a
part
of
Lady
Glencora
's
character
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
there
was
not
enough
of
pride
in
her
composition
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
quite
ready
to
hate
this
woman
,
and
to
fight
her
on
every
point
as
long
as
the
danger
existed
;
but
she
was
equally
willing
to
take
the
woman
to
her
heart
now
that
the
danger
was
over
.
<EOS>
Apologise
!
<EOS>
Of
course
she
would
apologise
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
make
a
friend
of
the
woman
if
the
woman
wished
it
.
<EOS>
But
she
would
not
have
the
woman
and
the
Duke
at
Matching
together
again
,
lest
,
after
all
,
there
might
be
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
show
Madame
Goesler
's
letter
to
her
husband
,
or
tell
him
anything
of
the
relief
she
had
received
.
<EOS>
He
had
cared
but
little
for
the
danger
,
thinking
more
of
his
budget
than
of
the
danger
;
and
would
be
sufficiently
at
his
ease
if
he
heard
no
more
rumours
of
his
uncle
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
went
to
Park
Lane
early
on
the
Tuesday
morning
,
but
she
did
not
take
her
boy
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
understood
that
Madame
Goesler
might
perhaps
indulge
in
a
little
gentle
raillery
at
the
child
's
expense
,
and
the
mother
felt
that
this
might
be
borne
the
more
easily
if
the
child
were
not
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
thank
you
for
your
letter
,
Madame
Goesler
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
,
before
she
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
come
ye
in
peace
here
,
or
come
ye
in
war
,
or
to
dance
at
our
bridal
?
"
said
Madame
Goesler
,
standing
up
from
her
chair
and
laughing
,
as
she
sang
the
lines
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
to
dance
at
your
bridal
,
"
said
Lady
Glencora
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
You
have
forbidden
the
banns
too
effectually
for
that
,
and
I
sit
here
wearing
the
willow
all
alone
.
<EOS>
Why
should
n't
I
be
allowed
to
get
married
as
well
as
another
woman
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
have
been
very
hard
upon
me
among
you
.
<EOS>
But
sit
down
,
Lady
Glencora
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
you
come
in
peace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
in
peace
,
and
with
much
admiration
,
 
and
a
great
deal
of
love
and
affection
,
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
,
if
you
will
only
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
too
proud
,
Lady
Glencora
;
 
for
the
Duke
's
sake
,
if
for
no
other
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
have
to
make
my
apology
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
made
as
soon
as
your
carriage
stopped
at
my
door
with
friendly
wheels
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
understand
.
<EOS>
I
can
know
how
terrible
it
all
was
to
you
,
 
even
though
the
dear
little
Plantagenet
might
not
have
been
in
much
danger
.
<EOS>
Fancy
what
it
would
be
to
disturb
the
career
of
a
Plantagenet
!
<EOS>
I
am
far
too
well
read
in
history
,
I
can
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
a
word
for
which
I
am
sorry
,
and
which
I
should
not
have
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
mind
the
word
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
it
was
a
true
word
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
hesitate
to
say
so
now
myself
,
though
I
will
allow
no
other
woman
to
say
it
,
 
and
no
man
either
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
degraded
him
,
 
and
disgraced
him
.
"
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
now
had
dropped
the
bantering
tone
which
she
had
assumed
,
and
was
speaking
in
sober
earnest
.
<EOS>
"
I
,
for
myself
,
have
nothing
about
me
of
which
I
am
ashamed
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
history
to
hide
,
no
story
to
be
brought
to
light
to
my
discredit
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
been
so
born
,
or
so
placed
by
circumstances
,
as
make
me
fit
to
be
the
wife
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
been
happy
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
nothing
,
dear
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
You
have
all
that
society
can
give
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
much
given
to
me
by
society
,
but
there
are
many
things
that
I
want
;
 
a
bright
-
faced
little
boy
,
for
instance
,
to
go
about
with
me
in
my
carriage
.
<EOS>
Why
did
you
not
bring
him
,
Lady
Glencora
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
out
in
my
penitential
sheet
,
and
when
one
goes
in
that
guise
,
one
goes
alone
.
<EOS>
I
had
half
a
mind
to
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
bring
him
soon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
anxious
to
know
the
other
day
who
was
the
beautiful
lady
with
the
black
hair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
tell
him
that
the
beautiful
lady
with
the
black
hair
was
a
possible
aunt
,
was
a
possible
 
?
<EOS>
But
we
will
not
think
any
more
of
things
so
horrible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
nothing
of
my
fears
,
you
may
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
day
,
when
I
am
a
very
old
woman
,
and
when
his
father
is
quite
an
old
duke
,
and
when
he
has
a
dozen
little
boys
and
girls
of
his
own
,
you
will
tell
him
the
story
.
<EOS>
Then
he
will
reflect
what
a
madman
his
great
-
uncle
must
have
been
,
to
have
thought
of
making
a
duchess
out
of
such
a
wizened
old
woman
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
parted
the
best
of
friends
,
but
Lady
Glencora
was
still
of
opinion
that
if
the
lady
and
the
Duke
were
to
be
brought
together
at
Matching
,
or
elsewhere
,
there
might
still
be
danger
.
   
<EOS>
Showing
How
the
Duke
Stood
His
Ground
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
<EOS>
the
barrister
,
who
had
given
so
many
lectures
to
our
friend
Phineas
Finn
,
lectures
that
ought
to
have
been
useful
,
was
now
himself
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
having
reached
it
in
the
legitimate
course
of
his
profession
.
<EOS>
At
a
certain
point
of
his
career
,
supposing
his
career
to
have
been
sufficiently
prosperous
,
it
becomes
natural
to
a
barrister
to
stand
for
some
constituency
,
and
natural
for
him
also
to
form
his
politics
at
that
period
of
his
life
with
a
view
to
his
further
advancement
,
looking
,
as
he
does
so
,
carefully
at
the
age
and
standing
of
the
various
candidates
for
high
legal
office
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
has
worked
as
Mr.
Low
had
worked
,
he
begins
to
regard
the
bench
wistfully
,
and
to
calculate
the
profits
of
a
two
years
'
run
in
the
Attorney
-
Generalship
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
way
of
the
profession
,
and
thus
a
proper
and
sufficient
number
of
real
barristers
finds
its
way
into
the
House
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
had
been
angry
with
Phineas
because
he
,
being
a
barrister
,
had
climbed
into
it
after
another
fashion
,
having
taken
up
politics
,
not
in
the
proper
way
as
an
assistance
to
his
great
profession
,
but
as
a
profession
in
itself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
had
been
quite
sure
that
his
pupil
had
been
wrong
in
this
,
and
that
the
error
would
at
last
show
itself
,
to
his
pupil
's
cost
.
<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Low
had
been
more
sure
than
Mr.
Low
,
having
not
unnaturally
been
jealous
that
a
young
whipper
-
snapper
of
a
pupil
,
 
as
she
had
once
called
Phineas
,
 
should
become
a
Parliament
man
before
her
husband
,
who
had
worked
his
way
up
gallantly
,
in
the
usual
course
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
give
way
a
jot
even
now
,
 
not
even
when
she
heard
that
Phineas
was
going
to
marry
this
and
that
heiress
.
<EOS>
For
at
this
period
of
his
life
<EOS>
such
rumours
were
afloat
about
him
,
originating
probably
in
his
hopes
as
to
Violet
Effingham
and
his
intimacy
with
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
heiresses
!
"
said
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
in
heiresses
'
money
till
I
see
it
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
hundred
a
year
is
a
great
fortune
for
a
woman
,
but
it
do
n't
go
far
in
keeping
a
house
in
London
.
<EOS>
And
when
a
woman
has
got
a
little
money
she
generally
knows
how
to
spend
it
.
<EOS>
He
has
begun
at
the
wrong
end
,
and
they
who
do
that
never
get
themselves
right
at
the
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
time
Phineas
had
become
somewhat
of
a
fine
gentleman
,
which
made
Mrs.
Low
the
more
angry
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
showed
himself
willing
enough
to
go
to
Mrs.
Low
's
house
,
but
when
there
he
seemed
to
her
to
give
himself
airs
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
she
was
unjust
to
him
,
and
that
it
was
natural
that
he
should
not
bear
himself
beneath
her
remarks
exactly
as
he
had
done
when
he
was
nobody
.
<EOS>
He
had
certainly
been
very
successful
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
listened
to
in
the
House
,
and
rarely
spoke
except
on
subjects
which
belonged
to
him
,
or
had
been
allotted
to
him
as
part
of
his
business
.
<EOS>
He
lived
quite
at
his
ease
with
people
of
the
highest
rank
,
 
and
those
of
his
own
mode
of
life
who
disliked
him
did
so
simply
because
they
regarded
with
envy
his
too
rapid
rise
.
<EOS>
He
rode
upon
a
pretty
horse
in
the
park
,
and
was
careful
in
his
dress
,
and
had
about
him
an
air
of
comfortable
wealth
which
Mrs.
Low
thought
he
had
not
earned
.
<EOS>
When
her
husband
told
her
of
his
sufficient
salary
,
she
would
shake
her
head
and
express
her
opinion
that
a
good
time
was
coming
.
<EOS>
By
which
she
perhaps
meant
to
imply
a
belief
that
a
time
was
coming
in
which
her
husband
would
have
a
salary
much
better
than
that
now
enjoyed
by
Phineas
,
and
much
more
likely
to
be
permanent
.
<EOS>
The
Radicals
were
not
to
have
office
for
ever
,
and
when
they
were
gone
,
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
he
saves
a
shilling
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
he
,
keeping
a
horse
in
the
park
,
and
hunting
down
in
the
country
,
and
living
with
lords
?
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
is
n't
found
to
be
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
when
things
come
to
be
looked
into
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Low
was
fond
of
an
assured
prosperity
,
of
money
in
the
funds
,
and
was
proud
to
think
that
her
husband
lived
in
a
house
of
his
own
.

ground
-
rent
to
the
Portman
estate
is
what
we
pay
,
Mr.
Bunce
,
"
she
once
said
to
that
gallant
Radical
,
"
and
that
comes
of
beginning
at
the
right
end
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
had
nothing
when
he
began
the
world
,
and
I
had
just
what
made
us
decent
the
day
we
married
.
<EOS>
But
he
began
at
the
right
end
,
and
let
things
go
as
they
may
he
ca
n't
get
a
fall
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bunce
and
Mrs.
Low
,
though
they
differed
much
in
politics
,
sympathised
in
reference
to
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
believes
,
ma'am
,
in
nobody
doing
any
good
by
getting
a
place
,
"
said
Mr.
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
do
n't
mean
judges
and
them
like
,
which
must
be
.
<EOS>
But
when
a
young
man
has
ever
so
much
a
year
for
sitting
in
a
big
room
down
at
Whitehall
,
and
reading
a
newspaper
with
his
feet
up
on
a
chair
,
I
do
n't
think
it
honest
,
whether
he
's
a
Parliament
man
or
whether
he
ai
n't
.
"
<EOS>
Whence
Mr.
Bunce
had
got
his
notions
as
to
the
way
in
which
officials
at
Whitehall
pass
their
time
,
I
can
not
say
;
but
his
notions
are
very
common
notions
.
<EOS>
The
British
world
at
large
is
slow
to
believe
that
the
great
British
housekeeper
keeps
no
more
cats
than
what
kill
mice
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Low
,
who
was
now
frequently
in
the
habit
of
seeing
Phineas
at
the
House
,
had
somewhat
changed
his
opinions
,
and
was
not
so
eager
in
condemning
Phineas
as
was
his
wife
.
<EOS>
He
had
begun
to
think
that
perhaps
Phineas
had
shown
some
knowledge
of
his
own
aptitudes
in
the
career
which
he
had
sought
,
and
was
aware
,
at
any
rate
,
that
his
late
pupil
was
somebody
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
A
man
will
almost
always
respect
him
whom
those
around
him
respect
,
and
will
generally
look
up
to
one
who
is
evidently
above
himself
in
his
own
daily
avocation
.
<EOS>
Now
Phineas
was
certainly
above
Mr.
Low
in
parliamentary
reputation
.
<EOS>
He
sat
on
a
front
bench
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
leaders
of
parties
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
home
amidst
the
forms
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
He
enjoyed
something
of
the
prestige
of
Government
power
.
<EOS>
And
he
walked
about
familiarly
with
the
sons
of
dukes
and
the
brothers
of
earls
in
a
manner
which
had
its
effect
even
on
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
Seeing
these
things
Mr.
Low
could
not
maintain
his
old
opinion
as
stoutly
as
did
his
wife
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
a
privilege
to
Mr.
Low
to
be
intimate
with
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
How
then
could
he
look
down
upon
him
?
  
<EOS>
He
was
surprised
,
therefore
,
one
day
when
Phineas
discussed
the
matter
with
him
fully
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
asked
him
what
would
be
his
chance
of
success
if
even
now
he
were
to
give
up
politics
and
take
to
the
Bar
as
the
means
of
earning
his
livelihood
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
uphill
work
at
first
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
might
be
done
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
To
have
been
in
office
would
not
be
fatal
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
fatal
,
Nothing
of
the
kind
need
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
Men
have
succeeded
,
and
have
sat
on
the
bench
afterwards
,
who
did
not
begin
till
they
were
past
forty
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
to
live
down
a
prejudice
created
against
yourself
;
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
The
attorneys
do
not
like
barristers
who
are
anything
else
but
barristers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
attorneys
are
very
arbitrary
,
I
know
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
and
there
would
be
this
against
you
 
that
it
is
so
difficult
for
a
man
to
go
back
to
the
verdure
and
malleability
of
pupildom
,
who
has
once
escaped
from
the
necessary
humility
of
its
conditions
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
it
difficult
to
sit
and
wait
for
business
in
a
Vice
-
Chancellor
's
Court
,
after
having
had
Vice
-
Chancellors
,
or
men
as
big
as
Vice
-
Chancellors
,
to
wait
upon
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
much
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
others
would
think
of
it
,
and
you
would
find
that
there
were
difficulties
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
not
thinking
of
it
in
earnest
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
in
earnest
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
so
?
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
that
every
day
had
removed
you
further
and
further
from
any
such
idea
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
ground
I
'm
on
at
present
is
so
slippery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
can
understand
that
.
<EOS>
But
yet
it
is
less
slippery
than
it
used
to
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
you
do
not
exactly
see
.
<EOS>
What
if
I
were
to
lose
my
seat
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
safe
at
least
for
the
next
four
years
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
no
one
can
tell
.
<EOS>
And
suppose
I
took
it
into
my
head
to
differ
from
the
Government
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
You
have
put
yourself
into
a
boat
with
these
men
,
and
you
must
remain
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
all
that
was
easy
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
so
easy
as
it
seems
.
<EOS>
The
very
necessity
of
sitting
still
in
the
boat
is
in
itself
irksome
,
 
very
irksome
.
<EOS>
And
then
there
comes
some
crisis
in
which
a
man
can
not
sit
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
such
crisis
at
hand
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
;
 
but
I
am
beginning
to
find
that
sitting
still
is
very
disagreeable
to
me
.
<EOS>
When
I
hear
those
fellows
below
having
their
own
way
,
and
saying
just
what
they
like
,
it
makes
me
furious
.
<EOS>
There
is
Robson
.
<EOS>
He
tried
office
for
a
couple
of
years
,
and
has
broken
away
;
and
now
,
by
George
,
there
is
no
man
they
think
so
much
of
as
they
do
of
Robson
.
<EOS>
He
is
twice
the
man
he
was
when
he
sat
on
the
Treasury
Bench
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
man
of
fortune
;
 
is
he
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
is
,
because
he
lives
.
<EOS>
He
never
earns
anything
.
<EOS>
His
wife
had
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Finn
,
that
makes
all
the
difference
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
has
means
of
his
own
he
can
please
himself
.
<EOS>
Do
you
marry
a
wife
with
money
,
and
then
you
may
kick
up
your
heels
,
and
do
as
you
like
about
the
Colonial
Office
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
has
n't
money
,
of
course
he
must
fit
himself
to
the
circumstances
of
a
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Though
his
profession
may
require
him
to
be
dishonest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
say
it
,
my
dear
Low
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
is
ready
to
vote
black
white
because
somebody
tells
him
,
is
dishonest
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
,
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
shall
pull
through
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
and
tell
your
wife
all
this
,
or
she
'll
be
harder
upon
me
than
ever
when
she
sees
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
that
Mr.
Low
began
to
think
that
his
wife
's
judgment
in
this
matter
had
been
better
than
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
Robson
could
do
as
he
liked
because
he
had
married
a
woman
with
money
.
<EOS>
Phineas
told
himself
that
that
game
was
also
open
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
might
marry
money
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
had
money
;
 
quite
enough
to
make
him
independent
were
he
married
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
Madame
Goesler
had
money
;
 
plenty
of
money
.
<EOS>
And
an
idea
had
begun
to
creep
upon
him
that
Madame
Goesler
would
take
him
were
he
to
offer
himself
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
sooner
go
back
to
the
Bar
as
the
lowest
pupil
,
sooner
clean
boots
for
barristers
,
 
<EOS>
so
he
told
himself
,
 
than
marry
a
woman
simply
because
she
had
money
,
than
marry
any
other
woman
as
long
as
there
was
a
chance
that
Violet
might
be
won
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
very
desirable
that
he
should
know
whether
Violet
might
be
won
or
not
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
July
,
and
everybody
would
be
gone
in
another
month
.
<EOS>
Before
August
would
be
over
<EOS>
he
was
to
start
for
Ireland
with
Mr.
Monk
,
and
he
knew
that
words
would
be
spoken
in
Ireland
which
might
make
it
indispensable
for
him
to
be
,
at
any
rate
,
able
to
throw
up
his
office
.
<EOS>
In
these
days
he
became
more
anxious
than
he
used
to
be
about
Miss
Effingham
's
fortune
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
never
spoken
as
yet
to
Lord
Brentford
since
the
day
on
which
the
Earl
had
quarrelled
with
him
,
nor
had
he
ever
been
at
the
house
in
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
he
met
occasionally
,
and
had
always
spoken
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
gracious
to
him
,
but
there
had
been
no
renewal
of
their
intimacy
.
<EOS>
Rumours
had
reached
him
that
things
were
going
badly
with
her
and
her
husband
;
but
when
men
repeated
such
rumours
in
his
presence
,
he
said
little
or
nothing
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
for
him
,
at
any
rate
,
to
speak
of
Lady
Laura
's
unhappiness
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
he
had
seen
once
or
twice
during
the
last
month
,
and
they
had
met
cordially
as
friends
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
could
ask
no
question
from
Lord
Chiltern
as
to
Violet
;
but
he
did
learn
that
his
friend
had
again
patched
up
some
reconciliation
with
his
father
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
quarrelled
with
me
,
you
know
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
but
what
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
As
things
went
,
I
was
obliged
to
tell
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
suppose
for
a
moment
that
I
am
blaming
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
no
doubt
,
much
better
that
he
should
know
it
all
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
it
can
not
make
much
difference
to
you
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
One
does
n't
like
to
quarrel
with
those
who
have
been
kind
to
one
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
n't
your
doing
.
<EOS>
He
'll
come
right
again
after
a
time
.
<EOS>
When
I
can
get
my
own
affairs
settled
,
you
may
be
sure
I
'll
do
my
best
to
bring
him
round
.
<EOS>
But
what
's
the
reason
you
never
see
Laura
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
reason
that
everything
goes
awry
?
"
said
Phineas
,
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
mentioned
your
name
to
Kennedy
the
other
day
,
he
looked
as
black
as
thunder
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
odd
that
any
one
should
quarrel
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
stand
him
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
I
sometimes
think
that
Laura
will
have
to
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
Then
there
will
be
another
mess
in
the
family
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
all
very
well
as
coming
from
Lord
Chiltern
;
but
there
was
no
word
about
Violet
,
and
Phineas
did
not
know
how
to
get
a
word
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
could
have
told
him
everything
,
but
he
could
not
go
to
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
did
go
to
Lady
Baldock
's
house
as
often
as
he
thought
he
could
with
propriety
,
and
occasionally
he
saw
Violet
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
do
no
more
than
see
her
,
and
the
days
and
weeks
were
passing
by
,
and
the
time
was
coming
in
which
he
would
have
to
go
away
,
and
be
with
her
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
end
of
the
season
,
which
was
always
to
other
men
,
 
to
other
working
men
such
as
our
hero
,
 
a
period
of
pleasurable
anticipation
,
to
him
was
a
time
of
sadness
,
in
which
he
felt
that
he
was
not
exactly
like
to
,
or
even
equal
to
,
the
men
with
whom
he
lived
in
London
.
<EOS>
In
the
old
days
,
in
which
he
was
allowed
to
go
to
Loughlinter
or
to
Saulsby
,
when
all
men
and
women
were
going
to
their
Loughlinters
and
their
Saulsbys
,
it
was
very
well
with
him
;
but
there
was
something
melancholy
to
him
in
his
yearly
journey
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
He
loved
his
father
and
mother
and
sisters
as
well
as
do
other
men
;
but
there
was
a
falling
off
in
the
manner
of
his
life
which
made
him
feel
that
he
had
been
in
some
sort
out
of
his
own
element
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
liked
to
have
shot
grouse
at
Loughlinter
,
or
pheasants
at
Saulsby
,
or
to
have
hunted
down
at
Willingford
,
 
or
better
still
,
to
have
made
love
to
Violet
Effingham
wherever
Violet
Effingham
might
have
placed
herself
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
was
closed
to
him
now
;
and
there
would
be
nothing
for
him
but
to
remain
at
Killaloe
,
or
to
return
to
his
work
in
Downing
Street
,
from
August
to
February
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
,
indeed
,
was
going
with
him
for
a
few
weeks
;
but
even
this
association
did
not
make
up
for
that
sort
of
society
which
he
would
have
preferred
.
  
<EOS>
The
session
went
on
very
quietly
.
<EOS>
The
question
of
the
Irish
Reform
Bill
was
postponed
till
the
next
year
,
which
was
a
great
thing
gained
.
<EOS>
He
carried
his
bill
about
the
Canada
Railway
,
with
sundry
other
small
bills
appertaining
to
it
,
through
the
House
in
a
manner
which
redounded
infinitely
to
his
credit
.
<EOS>
There
was
just
enough
of
opposition
to
give
a
zest
to
the
work
,
and
to
make
the
affair
conspicuous
among
the
affairs
of
the
year
.
<EOS>
As
his
chief
was
in
the
other
house
,
the
work
fell
altogether
into
his
hands
,
so
that
he
came
to
be
conspicuous
among
Under
-
Secretaries
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
he
said
a
word
to
any
leaders
of
his
party
about
other
matters
,
 
about
Irish
Tenant
-
right
,
for
instance
,
which
was
beginning
to
loom
very
large
,
that
he
found
himself
to
be
snubbed
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
room
for
action
this
year
in
reference
to
Irish
Tenant
-
right
,
and
therefore
any
deep
consideration
of
that
discomfort
might
be
legitimately
postponed
.
<EOS>
If
he
did
by
chance
open
his
mouth
on
the
subject
to
Mr.
Monk
,
even
Mr.
Monk
discouraged
him
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
early
days
of
July
,
when
the
weather
was
very
hot
,
and
people
were
beginning
to
complain
of
the
Thames
,
and
members
were
becoming
thirsty
after
grouse
,
and
the
remaining
days
of
parliamentary
work
were
being
counted
up
<EOS>
,
there
came
to
him
news
,
 
news
that
was
soon
known
throughout
the
fashionable
world
,
 
that
the
Duke
of
Omnium
was
going
to
give
a
garden
party
at
a
certain
villa
residence
on
the
banks
of
the
Thames
above
Richmond
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
such
a
garden
party
as
had
never
been
seen
before
.
<EOS>
And
it
would
be
the
more
remarkable
because
the
Duke
had
never
been
known
to
do
such
a
thing
.
<EOS>
The
villa
was
called
The
Horns
,
and
had
,
indeed
,
been
given
by
the
Duke
to
Lady
Glencora
on
her
marriage
;
but
the
party
was
to
be
the
Duke
's
party
,
and
The
Horns
,
with
all
its
gardens
,
conservatories
,
lawns
,
shrubberies
,
paddocks
,
boat
-
houses
,
and
boats
,
was
to
be
made
bright
and
beautiful
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Scores
of
workmen
were
about
the
place
through
the
three
first
weeks
of
July
.
<EOS>
The
world
at
large
did
not
at
all
know
why
the
Duke
was
doing
so
unwonted
a
thing
,
 
why
he
should
undertake
so
new
a
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Glencora
knew
,
and
Madame
Goesler
shrewdly
guessed
,
the
riddle
.
<EOS>
When
Madame
Goesler
's
unexpected
refusal
had
reached
his
Grace
,
he
felt
that
he
must
either
accept
the
lady
's
refusal
,
or
persevere
.
<EOS>
After
a
day
's
consideration
,
he
resolved
that
he
would
accept
it
.
<EOS>
The
top
brick
of
the
chimney
was
very
desirable
;
but
perhaps
it
might
be
well
that
he
should
endeavour
to
live
without
it
.
<EOS>
Then
,
accepting
this
refusal
,
he
must
either
stand
his
ground
and
bear
the
blow
,
 
or
he
must
run
away
to
that
villa
at
Como
,
or
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
The
running
away
seemed
to
him
at
first
to
be
the
better
,
or
at
least
the
more
pleasant
,
course
;
but
at
last
he
determined
that
he
would
stand
his
ground
and
bear
the
blow
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
gave
his
garden
party
at
The
Horns
.
  
<EOS>
Who
was
to
be
invited
?
<EOS>
Before
the
first
week
in
July
was
over
,
many
a
bosom
in
London
was
fluttering
with
anxiety
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
,
in
giving
his
short
word
of
instruction
to
Lady
Glencora
,
made
her
understand
that
he
would
wish
her
to
be
particular
in
her
invitations
.
<EOS>
Her
Royal
Highness
the
Princess
,
and
his
Royal
Highness
the
Prince
,
had
both
been
so
gracious
as
to
say
that
they
would
honour
his
fête
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
himself
had
made
out
a
short
list
,
with
not
more
than
a
dozen
names
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
was
employed
to
select
the
real
crowd
,
 
the
five
hundred
out
of
the
ten
thousand
who
were
to
be
blessed
.
<EOS>
On
the
Duke
's
own
private
list
was
the
name
of
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Lady
Glencora
understood
it
all
.
<EOS>
When
Madame
Goesler
got
her
card
,
she
thought
that
she
understood
it
too
.
<EOS>
And
she
thought
also
that
the
Duke
was
behaving
in
a
gallant
way
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
,
no
doubt
,
much
difficulty
about
the
invitations
,
and
a
considerable
amount
of
ill
-
will
was
created
.
<EOS>
And
they
who
considered
themselves
entitled
to
be
asked
,
and
were
not
asked
,
were
full
of
wrath
against
their
more
fortunate
friends
,
instead
of
being
angry
with
the
Duke
or
with
Lady
Glencora
,
who
had
neglected
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
soon
known
that
Lady
Glencora
was
the
real
dispenser
of
the
favours
,
and
I
fancy
that
her
ladyship
was
tired
of
her
task
before
it
was
completed
.
<EOS>
The
party
was
to
take
place
on
Wednesday
,
the
27th
of
July
,
and
before
the
day
had
come
,
men
and
women
had
become
so
hardy
in
the
combat
that
personal
applications
were
made
with
unflinching
importunity
;
and
letters
were
written
to
Lady
Glencora
putting
forward
this
claim
and
that
claim
with
a
piteous
clamour
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
that
is
too
bad
,
"
Lady
Glencora
said
to
her
particular
friend
,
Mrs.
Grey
,
when
a
letter
came
from
Mrs.
Bonteen
,
stating
all
that
her
husband
had
ever
done
towards
supporting
Mr.
Palliser
in
Parliament
,
 
and
all
that
he
ever
would
do
.
"
<EOS>
She
sha
n't
have
it
,
even
though
she
could
put
Plantagenet
into
a
minority
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Bonteen
did
not
get
a
card
;
and
when
she
heard
that
Phineas
Finn
had
received
one
,
her
wrath
against
Phineas
was
very
great
.
<EOS>
He
was
"
an
Irish
adventurer
,
"
and
she
regretted
deeply
that
Mr.
Bonteen
had
ever
interested
himself
in
bringing
such
an
upstart
forward
in
the
world
of
politics
.
<EOS>
But
as
Mr.
Bonteen
never
had
done
anything
towards
bringing
Phineas
forward
,
there
was
not
much
cause
for
regret
on
this
head
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
however
,
got
his
card
,
and
,
of
course
,
accepted
the
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
The
grounds
were
opened
at
four
.
<EOS>
There
was
to
be
an
early
dinner
out
in
tents
at
five
;
and
after
dinner
men
and
women
were
to
walk
about
,
or
dance
,
or
make
love
 
or
hay
,
as
suited
them
.
<EOS>
The
haycocks
,
however
,
were
ready
prepared
,
while
it
was
expected
that
they
should
bring
the
love
with
them
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
knowing
that
he
should
meet
Violet
Effingham
,
took
a
great
deal
with
him
ready
made
.
  
<EOS>
For
an
hour
and
a
half
Lady
Glencora
kept
her
position
in
a
saloon
through
which
the
guests
passed
to
the
grounds
,
and
to
every
comer
she
imparted
the
information
that
the
Duke
was
on
the
lawn
;
 
to
every
comer
but
one
.
<EOS>
To
Madame
Goesler
<EOS>
she
said
no
such
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
glad
to
see
you
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
pressed
her
friend
's
hand
:
"
if
I
am
not
killed
by
this
work
,
I
'll
make
you
out
again
by
-
and
-
by
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Madame
Goesler
passed
on
,
and
soon
found
herself
amidst
a
throng
of
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
minutes
she
saw
the
Duke
seated
in
an
arm
-
chair
,
close
to
the
river
-
bank
,
and
she
bravely
went
up
to
him
,
and
thanked
him
for
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
"
The
thanks
are
due
to
you
for
gracing
our
entertainment
,
"
said
the
Duke
,
rising
to
greet
her
.
<EOS>
There
were
a
dozen
people
standing
round
,
and
so
the
thing
was
done
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
there
came
a
notice
that
their
royal
highnesses
were
on
the
ground
,
and
the
Duke
,
of
course
,
went
off
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
word
more
spoken
between
the
Duke
and
Madame
Goesler
on
that
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
come
till
late
,
 
till
seven
,
when
the
banquet
was
over
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
was
right
in
this
,
as
the
banqueting
in
tents
loses
in
comfort
almost
more
than
it
gains
in
romance
.
<EOS>
A
small
picnic
may
be
very
well
,
and
the
distance
previously
travelled
may
give
to
a
dinner
on
the
ground
the
seeming
excuse
of
necessity
.
<EOS>
Frail
human
nature
must
be
supported
,
 
and
human
nature
,
having
gone
so
far
in
pursuit
of
the
beautiful
,
is
entitled
to
what
best
support
the
unaccustomed
circumstances
will
allow
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
out
with
the
cold
pies
,
out
with
the
salads
,
and
the
chickens
,
and
the
champagne
.
<EOS>
Since
no
better
may
be
,
let
us
recruit
human
nature
sitting
upon
this
moss
,
and
forget
our
discomforts
in
the
glory
of
the
verdure
around
us
.
<EOS>
And
dear
Mary
,
seeing
that
the
cushion
from
the
waggonet
is
small
,
and
not
wishing
to
accept
the
too
generous
offer
that
she
should
take
it
all
for
her
own
use
,
will
admit
a
contact
somewhat
closer
than
the
ordinary
chairs
of
a
dining
-
room
render
necessary
.
<EOS>
That
in
its
way
is
very
well
;
 
but
I
hold
that
a
banquet
on
narrow
tables
in
a
tent
is
displeasing
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
strolled
into
the
grounds
when
the
tent
was
nearly
empty
,
and
when
Lady
Glencora
,
almost
sinking
beneath
her
exertions
,
was
taking
rest
in
an
inner
room
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
at
this
time
was
dining
with
their
royal
highnesses
,
and
three
or
four
others
,
specially
selected
,
very
comfortably
within
doors
.
<EOS>
Out
of
doors
the
world
had
begun
to
dance
,
 
and
the
world
was
beginning
to
say
that
it
would
be
much
nicer
to
go
and
dance
upon
the
boards
inside
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
For
,
though
of
all
parties
a
garden
party
is
the
nicest
,
everybody
is
always
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
garden
as
quick
as
may
be
.
<EOS>
A
few
ardent
lovers
of
suburban
picturesque
effect
were
sitting
beneath
the
haycocks
,
and
four
forlorn
damsels
were
vainly
endeavouring
to
excite
the
sympathy
of
manly
youth
by
playing
croquet
in
a
corner
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
,
however
,
that
the
lovers
beneath
the
haycocks
and
the
players
at
croquet
were
not
actors
hired
by
Lady
Glencora
for
the
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
had
not
been
long
on
the
lawn
before
he
saw
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
with
another
lady
,
and
Barrington
Erle
was
with
them
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
have
been
successful
?
"
said
Barrington
,
greeting
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Successful
in
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
what
?
<EOS>
In
getting
a
ticket
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
to
promise
three
tide
-
waiterships
,
and
to
give
deep
hints
about
a
bishopric
expected
to
be
vacant
,
before
I
got
in
.
<EOS>
But
what
matters
?
<EOS>
Success
pays
for
everything
.
<EOS>
My
only
trouble
now
is
how
I
'm
to
get
back
to
London
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
shook
hands
with
Phineas
,
and
then
as
he
was
passing
on
,
followed
him
for
a
step
and
whispered
a
word
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
you
are
not
going
yet
,
come
back
to
me
presently
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
far
from
the
river
,
and
shall
stay
here
for
about
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
said
that
he
would
,
and
then
went
on
,
not
knowing
exactly
where
he
was
going
.
<EOS>
He
had
one
desire
,
 
to
find
Violet
Effingham
,
but
when
he
should
find
her
he
could
not
carry
her
off
,
and
sit
with
her
beneath
a
haycock
.
   
<EOS>
The
Horns
 
<EOS>
While
looking
for
Violet
Effingham
,
Phineas
encountered
Madame
Goesler
,
among
a
crowd
of
people
who
were
watching
the
adventurous
embarkation
of
certain
daring
spirits
in
a
pleasure
-
boat
.
<EOS>
There
were
watermen
there
in
the
Duke
's
livery
,
ready
to
take
such
spirits
down
to
Richmond
or
up
to
Teddington
lock
,
and
many
daring
spirits
did
take
such
trips
,
 
to
the
great
peril
of
muslins
,
ribbons
,
and
starch
,
to
the
peril
also
of
ornamental
summer
white
garments
,
so
that
when
the
thing
was
over
,
the
boats
were
voted
to
have
been
a
bore
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
venture
?
"
said
Phineas
to
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
of
all
things
if
I
were
not
afraid
for
my
clothes
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
never
good
upon
the
water
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
sea
-
sick
to
a
certainty
.
<EOS>
They
are
going
down
beneath
the
bridge
too
,
and
we
should
be
splashed
by
the
steamers
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
my
courage
is
high
enough
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
Phineas
excused
himself
,
being
still
intent
on
prosecuting
his
search
for
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
neither
will
I
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
One
dash
from
a
peccant
oar
would
destroy
the
whole
symmetry
of
my
dress
.
<EOS>
Look
.
<EOS>
That
green
young
lady
has
already
been
sprinkled
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
the
blue
young
gentleman
has
been
sprinkled
also
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
they
will
be
happy
in
a
joint
baptism
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
they
strolled
along
the
river
path
together
,
and
were
soon
alone
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
leaving
town
soon
,
Madame
Goesler
?
"
  
"
Almost
immediately
.
"
  
"
And
where
do
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
to
Vienna
.
<EOS>
I
am
there
for
a
couple
of
months
every
year
,
minding
my
business
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
you
would
know
me
,
if
you
saw
me
;
 
sometimes
sitting
on
a
stool
in
a
counting
-
house
,
sometimes
going
about
among
old
houses
,
settling
what
must
be
done
to
save
them
from
tumbling
down
.
<EOS>
I
dress
so
differently
at
such
times
,
and
talk
so
differently
,
and
look
so
much
older
,
that
I
almost
fancy
myself
to
be
another
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
great
trouble
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
 
I
rather
like
it
.
<EOS>
It
makes
me
feel
that
I
do
something
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
go
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Quite
alone
.
<EOS>
I
take
a
German
maid
with
me
,
and
never
speak
a
word
to
any
one
else
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
must
be
very
bad
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
it
is
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
then
I
am
so
much
accustomed
to
be
alone
.
<EOS>
You
see
me
in
society
,
and
in
society
only
,
and
therefore
naturally
look
upon
me
as
one
of
a
gregarious
herd
;
but
I
am
in
truth
an
animal
that
feeds
alone
and
lives
alone
.
<EOS>
Take
the
hours
of
the
year
all
through
,
and
I
am
a
solitary
during
four
-
fifths
of
them
.
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
intend
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
go
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Home
to
your
own
people
.
<EOS>
How
nice
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
people
to
go
to
.
<EOS>
I
have
one
sister
,
who
lives
with
her
husband
at
Riga
.
<EOS>
She
is
my
only
relation
,
and
I
never
see
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
thousands
of
friends
in
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
as
you
see
them
,
"
 
and
she
turned
and
spread
out
her
hands
towards
the
crowded
lawn
,
which
was
behind
them
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
such
friends
worth
?
<EOS>
What
would
they
do
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
the
Duke
would
do
much
,
"
said
Phineas
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
laughed
also
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Duke
is
not
so
bad
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
The
Duke
would
do
as
much
as
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
have
the
Duke
abused
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
may
be
your
particular
friend
,
for
what
I
know
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
particular
friend
.
<EOS>
And
were
I
to
wish
to
choose
one
,
I
should
think
the
Duke
a
little
above
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
yes
;
 
and
too
stiff
,
and
too
old
,
and
too
pompous
,
and
too
cold
,
and
too
make
-
believe
,
and
too
gingerbread
.
"
  
"
Mr.
Finn
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Duke
is
all
buckram
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
you
come
to
his
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
see
you
,
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
true
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
it
is
true
in
its
way
.
<EOS>
One
goes
about
to
meet
those
whom
one
likes
,
not
always
for
the
pleasure
of
the
host
's
society
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
am
not
wrong
because
I
go
to
houses
at
which
I
like
neither
the
host
nor
the
hostess
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
as
he
said
this
was
thinking
of
Lady
Baldock
,
to
whom
of
late
he
had
been
exceedingly
civil
,
 
but
he
certainly
did
not
like
Lady
Baldock
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
have
been
too
hard
upon
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
him
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Personally
?
<EOS>
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
Do
you
?
<EOS>
Does
anybody
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
a
gracious
gentleman
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
,
"
and
though
I
can
not
boast
of
knowing
him
well
,
I
do
not
like
to
hear
him
called
buckram
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
he
is
buckram
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
very
easy
for
a
man
in
his
position
to
live
so
as
to
please
all
people
.
<EOS>
He
has
to
maintain
the
prestige
of
the
highest
aristocracy
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Look
at
his
nephew
,
who
will
be
the
next
Duke
,
and
who
works
as
hard
as
any
man
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Will
he
not
maintain
it
better
?
<EOS>
What
good
did
the
present
man
ever
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
believe
only
in
motion
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
and
not
at
all
in
quiescence
.
<EOS>
An
express
train
at
full
speed
is
grander
to
you
than
a
mountain
with
heaps
of
snow
.
<EOS>
I
own
that
to
me
there
is
something
glorious
in
the
dignity
of
a
man
too
high
to
do
anything
,
 
if
only
he
knows
how
to
carry
that
dignity
with
a
proper
grace
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
there
should
be
breasts
made
to
carry
stars
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stars
which
they
have
never
earned
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
well
;
we
will
not
fight
about
it
.
<EOS>
Go
and
earn
your
star
,
and
I
will
say
that
it
becomes
you
better
than
any
glitter
on
the
coat
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
.
<EOS>
"
This
she
said
with
an
earnestness
which
he
could
not
pretend
not
to
notice
or
not
to
understand
.
<EOS>
"
I
too
may
be
able
to
see
that
the
express
train
is
really
greater
than
the
mountain
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Though
,
for
your
own
life
,
you
would
prefer
to
sit
and
gaze
upon
the
snowy
peaks
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
;
 
that
is
not
so
.
<EOS>
For
myself
,
I
would
prefer
to
be
of
use
somewhere
,
 
to
some
one
,
if
it
were
possible
.
<EOS>
I
strive
sometimes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
sure
successfully
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
talk
about
myself
.
<EOS>
You
and
the
Duke
are
fair
subjects
for
conversation
;
you
as
the
express
train
,
who
will
probably
do
your
sixty
miles
an
hour
in
safety
,
but
may
possibly
go
down
a
bank
with
a
crash
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
may
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
Duke
,
as
the
mountain
,
which
is
fixed
in
its
stateliness
,
short
of
the
power
of
some
earthquake
,
which
shall
be
grander
and
more
terrible
than
any
earthquake
yet
known
.
<EOS>
Here
we
are
at
the
house
again
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
in
and
sit
down
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
leave
you
,
Madame
Goesler
,
I
will
say
good
-
bye
till
next
winter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
in
town
again
before
Christmas
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
will
come
and
see
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
this
love
trouble
of
course
will
be
over
,
 
one
way
or
the
other
;
 
will
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
who
can
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Faint
heart
never
won
fair
lady
.
<EOS>
But
your
heart
is
never
faint
.
<EOS>
Farewell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
left
her
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
moment
he
had
not
seen
Violet
,
and
yet
he
knew
that
she
was
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
She
had
herself
told
him
that
she
was
to
accompany
Lady
Laura
,
whom
he
had
already
met
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
had
not
been
invited
,
and
had
expressed
great
animosity
against
the
Duke
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
She
had
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
Duke
was
a
man
at
whose
house
a
young
lady
such
as
her
niece
ought
not
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
But
Violet
had
laughed
at
this
,
and
declared
her
intention
of
accepting
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
"
Go
,
"
she
had
said
;
"
of
course
I
shall
go
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
broken
my
heart
if
I
could
not
have
got
there
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
therefore
was
sure
that
she
must
be
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
He
had
kept
his
eyes
ever
on
the
alert
,
and
yet
he
had
not
found
her
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
must
keep
his
appointment
with
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
So
he
went
down
to
the
path
by
the
river
,
and
there
he
found
her
seated
close
by
the
water
's
edge
.
<EOS>
Her
cousin
Barrington
Erle
was
still
with
her
,
but
as
soon
as
Phineas
joined
them
,
Erle
went
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
told
him
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
that
I
wished
to
speak
to
you
,
and
he
stayed
with
me
till
you
came
.
<EOS>
There
are
worse
men
than
Barrington
a
great
deal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
and
he
still
friends
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
  
"
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
see
so
much
of
him
as
I
did
when
I
had
less
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
that
you
have
got
into
altogether
a
different
set
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
gone
as
circumstances
have
directed
me
,
but
I
have
certainly
not
intended
to
throw
over
so
old
and
good
a
friend
as
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
 
he
does
not
blame
you
.
<EOS>
He
tells
me
that
you
have
found
your
way
among
what
he
calls
the
working
men
of
the
party
,
and
he
thinks
you
will
do
very
well
,
 
if
you
can
only
be
patient
enough
.
<EOS>
We
all
expected
a
different
line
from
you
,
you
know
,
 
more
of
words
and
less
of
deeds
,
if
I
may
say
so
;
 
more
of
liberal
oratory
and
less
of
government
action
;
but
I
do
not
doubt
that
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
I
have
been
wrong
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
becoming
heartily
sick
of
officialities
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
comes
from
the
fickleness
about
which
papa
is
so
fond
of
quoting
his
Latin
.
<EOS>
The
ox
desires
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
The
charger
wants
to
plough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
which
am
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
career
may
combine
the
dignity
of
the
one
with
the
utility
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
you
must
not
think
of
changing
now
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
Mr.
Kennedy
lately
?
"
<EOS>
She
asked
the
question
abruptly
,
showing
that
she
was
anxious
to
get
to
the
matter
respecting
which
she
had
summoned
him
to
her
side
,
and
that
all
that
she
had
said
hitherto
had
been
uttered
as
it
were
in
preparation
of
that
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seen
him
?
<EOS>
yes
;
I
see
him
daily
.
<EOS>
But
we
hardly
do
more
than
speak
,
"
  
"
Why
not
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
stood
for
a
moment
in
silence
,
hesitating
.
<EOS>
"
Why
is
it
that
he
and
you
do
not
speak
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
answer
that
question
,
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
know
any
reason
?
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
or
,
if
you
please
,
I
will
get
up
and
walk
with
you
.
<EOS>
He
tells
me
that
you
have
chosen
to
quarrel
with
him
,
and
that
I
have
made
you
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
says
that
you
have
confessed
to
him
that
I
have
asked
you
to
quarrel
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
can
hardly
have
said
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
has
said
it
,
 
in
so
many
words
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
I
would
tell
you
such
a
story
falsely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
here
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
he
is
not
here
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
come
.
<EOS>
I
came
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
not
Miss
Effingham
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
she
is
to
come
with
my
father
later
.
<EOS>
She
is
here
no
doubt
,
now
.
<EOS>
But
answer
my
question
,
Mr.
Finn
;
 
unless
you
find
that
you
can
not
answer
it
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
that
you
did
say
to
my
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
to
justify
what
he
has
told
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
that
he
has
spoken
falsely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
use
no
harsh
word
,
 
<EOS>
but
I
think
that
Mr.
Kennedy
when
troubled
in
his
spirit
looks
at
things
gloomily
,
and
puts
meaning
upon
words
which
they
should
not
bear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
has
troubled
his
spirit
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
that
better
than
I
can
do
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
all
that
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
He
invited
me
to
his
house
<EOS>
and
I
would
not
go
,
because
you
had
forbidden
me
.
<EOS>
Then
he
asked
me
some
questions
about
you
.
<EOS>
Did
I
refuse
because
of
you
,
 
or
of
anything
that
you
had
said
?
<EOS>
If
I
remember
right
,
I
told
him
that
I
did
fancy
that
you
would
not
be
glad
to
see
me
,
 
and
that
therefore
I
would
rather
stay
away
.
<EOS>
What
was
I
to
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
with
him
would
have
been
worse
than
what
I
did
say
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
he
asked
me
the
question
point
-
blank
,
and
that
no
reply
would
have
been
equal
to
an
affirmation
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
confessed
that
his
suggestion
was
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
could
not
then
have
twitted
me
with
your
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
have
erred
,
Lady
Laura
,
and
brought
any
sorrow
on
you
,
I
am
indeed
grieved
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
all
sorrow
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
but
sorrow
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Lady
Laura
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
bad
,
 
but
not
so
bad
,
I
think
,
as
the
life
I
am
now
leading
.
<EOS>
He
has
accused
me
 
,
of
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
He
says
that
you
are
my
lover
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
say
that
,
 
in
those
words
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
it
in
words
which
made
me
feel
that
I
must
part
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
answer
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
answer
him
at
all
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
come
to
me
like
a
man
,
 
not
accusing
me
,
but
asking
me
,
 
I
would
have
told
him
everything
.
<EOS>
And
what
was
there
to
tell
?
<EOS>
I
should
have
broken
my
faith
to
you
,
in
speaking
of
that
scene
at
Loughlinter
,
but
women
always
tell
such
stories
to
their
husbands
when
their
husbands
are
good
to
them
,
and
true
,
and
just
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
well
that
they
should
be
told
.
<EOS>
But
to
Mr.
Kennedy
I
can
tell
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
believe
my
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
believe
you
,
Lady
Laura
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Because
I
did
not
blurt
out
to
him
all
that
story
about
your
foolish
duel
,
 
because
I
thought
it
best
to
keep
my
brother
's
secret
,
as
long
as
there
was
a
secret
to
be
kept
,
he
told
me
that
I
had
,
 
lied
to
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
with
that
word
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
with
that
very
word
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
particular
about
his
words
,
when
he
thinks
it
necessary
to
express
himself
strongly
.
<EOS>
And
he
has
told
me
since
that
because
of
that
he
could
never
believe
me
again
.
<EOS>
How
is
it
possible
that
a
woman
should
live
with
such
a
man
?
"
<EOS>
But
why
did
she
come
to
him
with
this
story
,
 
to
him
whom
she
had
been
accused
of
entertaining
as
a
lover
;
 
to
him
who
of
all
her
friends
was
the
last
whom
she
should
have
chosen
as
the
recipient
for
such
a
tale
?
<EOS>
Phineas
as
he
thought
how
he
might
best
answer
her
,
with
what
words
he
might
try
to
comfort
her
,
could
not
but
ask
himself
this
question
.
<EOS>
"
The
moment
that
the
word
was
out
of
his
mouth
,
"
she
went
on
to
say
,
"
I
resolved
that
I
would
tell
you
.
<EOS>
The
accusation
is
against
you
as
it
is
against
me
,
and
is
equally
false
to
both
.
<EOS>
I
have
written
to
him
,
and
there
is
my
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
see
him
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
will
go
to
my
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
arranged
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
has
my
letter
by
this
time
,
and
I
go
from
hence
home
with
my
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
wish
that
I
should
read
the
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
 
certainly
.
<EOS>
I
wish
that
you
should
read
it
.
<EOS>
Should
I
ever
meet
him
again
,
I
shall
tell
him
that
you
saw
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
standing
close
upon
the
river
's
bank
,
at
a
corner
of
the
grounds
,
and
,
though
the
voices
of
people
sounded
near
to
them
,
they
were
alone
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
no
alternative
but
to
read
the
letter
,
which
was
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
After
what
you
have
said
to
me
it
is
impossible
that
I
should
return
to
your
house
.
<EOS>
I
shall
meet
my
father
at
the
Duke
of
Omnium
's
,
and
have
already
asked
him
to
give
me
an
asylum
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
wish
to
remain
wherever
he
may
be
,
either
in
town
or
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Should
I
change
my
purpose
in
this
,
and
change
my
residence
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
fail
to
let
you
know
where
I
go
and
what
I
propose
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
I
think
must
have
forgotten
that
I
was
your
wife
;
but
I
will
never
forget
it
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
accused
me
of
having
a
lover
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
have
expected
that
I
should
continue
to
live
with
you
after
such
an
accusation
.
<EOS>
For
myself
I
can
not
understand
how
any
man
can
have
brought
himself
to
bring
such
a
charge
against
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Even
had
it
been
true
the
accusation
should
not
have
been
made
by
your
mouth
to
my
ears
.
  
<EOS>
That
it
is
untrue
<EOS>
I
believe
you
must
be
as
well
aware
as
I
am
myself
.
<EOS>
How
intimate
I
was
with
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
and
what
were
the
limits
of
my
intimacy
with
him
you
knew
before
I
married
you
.
<EOS>
After
our
marriage
I
encouraged
his
friendship
till
I
found
that
there
was
something
in
it
that
displeased
you
,
 
and
,
after
learning
that
,
I
discouraged
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
said
that
he
is
my
lover
,
but
you
have
probably
not
defined
for
yourself
that
word
very
clearly
.
<EOS>
You
have
felt
yourself
slighted
because
his
name
has
been
mentioned
with
praise
;
 
and
your
jealousy
has
been
wounded
because
you
have
thought
that
I
have
regarded
him
as
in
some
way
superior
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
have
never
really
thought
that
he
was
my
lover
,
 
that
he
spoke
words
to
me
which
others
might
not
hear
,
that
he
claimed
from
me
aught
that
a
wife
may
not
give
,
that
he
received
aught
which
a
friend
should
not
receive
.
<EOS>
The
accusation
has
been
a
coward
's
accusation
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
my
father
's
to
-
night
,
and
to
-
morrow
I
will
get
you
to
let
my
servant
bring
to
me
such
things
as
are
my
own
,
 
my
clothes
,
namely
,
and
desk
,
and
a
few
books
.
<EOS>
She
will
know
what
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
trust
you
may
be
happier
without
a
wife
,
than
ever
you
have
been
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
felt
almost
daily
since
we
were
married
that
you
were
a
man
who
would
have
been
happier
without
a
wife
than
with
one
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
affectionately
,
  
LAURA
KENNEDY
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
at
any
rate
true
,
"
she
said
,
when
Phineas
had
read
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
True
!
<EOS>
Doubtless
it
is
true
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
except
that
I
do
not
suppose
he
was
ever
really
angry
with
me
,
or
jealous
,
or
anything
of
the
sort
,
 
because
I
got
on
well
.
<EOS>
It
seems
absurd
even
to
think
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
too
absurd
for
some
men
.
<EOS>
I
remember
your
telling
me
that
he
was
weak
,
and
poor
,
and
unworthy
.
<EOS>
I
remember
your
saying
so
when
I
first
thought
that
he
might
become
my
husband
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
believed
you
when
you
told
me
so
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
made
such
a
shipwreck
of
myself
as
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
That
is
all
I
had
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
After
what
has
passed
between
us
I
did
not
choose
that
you
should
hear
how
I
was
separated
from
my
husband
from
any
lips
but
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
now
and
find
papa
.
<EOS>
Do
not
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
prefer
being
alone
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
was
left
standing
by
himself
,
looking
down
upon
the
river
as
it
glided
by
.
<EOS>
How
would
it
have
been
with
both
of
them
if
Lady
Laura
had
accepted
him
three
years
ago
,
when
she
consented
to
join
her
lot
with
that
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
and
had
rejected
him
?
<EOS>
As
he
stood
he
heard
the
sound
of
music
from
the
house
,
and
remembered
that
he
had
come
there
with
the
one
sole
object
of
seeing
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
He
had
known
that
he
would
meet
Lady
Laura
,
and
it
had
been
in
his
mind
to
break
through
that
law
of
silence
which
she
had
imposed
upon
him
,
and
once
more
to
ask
her
to
assist
him
,
 
to
implore
her
for
the
sake
of
their
old
friendship
to
tell
him
whether
there
might
yet
be
for
him
any
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
interview
which
had
just
taken
place
it
had
been
impossible
for
him
to
speak
a
word
of
himself
or
of
Violet
.
<EOS>
To
her
,
in
her
great
desolation
,
he
could
address
himself
on
no
other
subject
than
that
of
her
own
misery
.
<EOS>
But
not
the
less
when
she
was
talking
to
him
of
her
own
sorrow
,
of
her
regret
that
she
had
not
listened
to
him
when
in
years
past
he
had
spoken
slightingly
of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
was
he
thinking
of
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Kennedy
had
certainly
mistaken
the
signs
of
things
when
he
had
accused
his
wife
by
saying
that
Phineas
was
her
lover
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
soon
got
over
that
early
feeling
;
and
as
far
as
he
himself
was
concerned
had
never
regretted
Lady
Laura
's
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
He
remained
down
by
the
water
for
a
few
minutes
,
giving
Lady
Laura
time
to
escape
,
and
then
he
wandered
across
the
grounds
towards
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
about
nine
o'clock
,
and
though
there
were
still
many
walking
about
the
grounds
,
the
crowd
of
people
were
in
the
rooms
.
<EOS>
The
musicians
were
ranged
out
on
a
verandah
,
so
that
their
music
might
have
been
available
for
dancing
within
or
without
;
but
the
dancers
had
found
the
boards
pleasanter
than
the
lawn
,
and
the
Duke
's
garden
party
was
becoming
a
mere
ball
,
with
privilege
for
the
dancers
to
stroll
about
the
lawn
between
the
dances
.
<EOS>
And
in
this
respect
the
fun
was
better
than
at
a
ball
,
 
<EOS>
that
let
the
engagements
made
for
partners
be
what
they
might
,
they
could
always
be
broken
with
ease
.
<EOS>
No
lady
felt
herself
bound
to
dance
with
a
cavalier
who
was
displeasing
to
her
;
and
some
gentlemen
were
left
sadly
in
the
lurch
.
<EOS>
Phineas
felt
himself
to
be
very
much
in
the
lurch
,
even
after
he
had
discovered
Violet
Effingham
standing
up
to
dance
with
Lord
Fawn
.
  
<EOS>
He
bided
his
time
patiently
,
and
at
last
he
found
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
she
dance
with
him
?
"
<EOS>
She
declared
that
she
intended
to
dance
no
more
,
and
that
she
had
promised
to
be
ready
to
return
home
with
Lord
Brentford
before
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
pledged
myself
not
to
be
after
ten
,
"
she
said
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
Then
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
and
they
stepped
out
upon
the
terrace
together
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
anything
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
asked
him
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
it
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
dreadful
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
it
is
the
best
thing
she
can
do
.
<EOS>
She
has
never
been
happy
with
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
to
be
accused
after
that
fashion
,
 
by
her
husband
!
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
One
can
hardly
believe
it
in
these
days
.
<EOS>
And
of
all
women
she
is
the
last
to
deserve
such
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
very
last
,
"
said
Phineas
,
feeling
that
the
subject
was
one
upon
which
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
conceive
to
whom
he
can
have
alluded
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
began
to
understand
that
Violet
had
not
heard
the
whole
story
;
but
the
difficulty
of
speaking
was
still
very
great
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
the
result
of
ungovernable
temper
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
a
man
does
not
usually
strive
to
dishonour
himself
because
he
is
in
a
rage
.
<EOS>
And
this
man
is
incapable
of
rage
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
cursed
with
one
of
those
dark
gloomy
minds
in
which
love
always
leads
to
jealousy
.
<EOS>
She
will
never
return
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
can
not
say
.
<EOS>
In
many
respects
it
would
be
better
that
she
should
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
never
return
to
him
,
"
repeated
Violet
,
 
"
never
.
<EOS>
Would
you
advise
her
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
say
?
<EOS>
If
one
were
called
upon
for
advice
,
one
would
think
so
much
before
one
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
,
 
not
for
a
minute
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
to
be
accused
of
that
!
<EOS>
How
are
a
man
and
woman
to
live
together
after
there
have
been
such
words
between
them
?
<EOS>
Poor
Laura
!
<EOS>
What
a
terrible
end
to
all
her
high
hopes
!
<EOS>
Do
you
not
grieve
for
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
now
at
some
distance
from
the
house
,
and
Phineas
could
not
but
feel
that
chance
had
been
very
good
to
him
in
giving
him
his
opportunity
.
<EOS>
She
was
leaning
on
his
arm
,
and
they
were
alone
,
and
she
was
speaking
to
him
with
all
the
familiarity
of
old
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
I
may
change
the
subject
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
ask
you
a
word
about
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
word
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
 
"
  
"
What
have
you
heard
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Simply
this
,
 
that
you
are
not
now
as
you
were
six
months
ago
.
<EOS>
Your
marriage
was
then
fixed
for
June
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
unfixed
since
then
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
it
has
been
unfixed
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
,
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
if
I
say
that
when
I
heard
it
was
so
,
something
of
a
hope
,
 
no
,
I
must
not
call
it
a
hope
,
 
something
that
longed
to
form
itself
into
hope
returned
to
my
breast
,
and
from
that
hour
to
this
has
been
the
only
subject
on
which
I
have
cared
to
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Chiltern
is
your
friend
,
Mr.
Finn
?
"
  
"
He
is
so
,
and
I
do
not
think
that
I
have
ever
been
untrue
to
my
friendship
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
that
no
man
has
ever
had
a
truer
friend
.
<EOS>
He
will
swear
to
that
in
all
companies
.
<EOS>
And
I
,
when
it
was
allowed
to
me
to
swear
with
him
,
swore
it
too
.
<EOS>
As
his
friend
,
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
,
 
one
thing
which
I
would
never
tell
to
any
other
man
,
 
one
thing
which
I
know
I
may
tell
you
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
gentleman
,
and
will
not
break
my
confidence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
will
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
not
,
because
you
are
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
told
Lord
Chiltern
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
that
I
loved
him
.
<EOS>
And
I
did
love
him
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
have
the
same
confession
to
make
to
another
man
.
<EOS>
That
he
and
I
are
not
now
,
 
on
those
loving
terms
,
 
which
once
existed
,
can
make
no
difference
in
that
.
<EOS>
A
woman
can
not
transfer
her
heart
.
<EOS>
There
have
been
things
which
have
made
me
feel
,
 
that
I
was
perhaps
mistaken
,
 
in
saying
that
I
would
be
,
 
his
wife
.
<EOS>
But
I
said
so
,
and
can
not
now
give
myself
to
another
.
<EOS>
Here
is
Lord
Brentford
,
and
we
will
join
him
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
Lord
Brentford
with
Lady
Laura
on
his
arm
,
very
gloomy
,
 
resolving
on
what
way
he
might
be
avenged
on
the
man
who
had
insulted
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
took
but
little
notice
of
Phineas
as
he
resumed
his
charge
of
Miss
Effingham
;
but
the
two
ladies
wished
him
good
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
Lady
Laura
,
"
said
Phineas
,
standing
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
 
"
good
night
,
Miss
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
was
alone
,
 
quite
alone
.
<EOS>
Would
it
not
be
well
for
him
to
go
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
and
fling
himself
into
the
quiet
river
,
so
that
there
might
be
an
end
of
him
?
<EOS>
Or
would
it
not
be
better
still
that
he
should
create
for
himself
some
quiet
river
of
life
,
away
from
London
,
away
from
politics
,
away
from
lords
,
and
titled
ladies
,
and
fashionable
squares
,
and
<EOS>
the
parties
given
by
dukes
,
and
the
disappointments
incident
to
a
small
man
in
attempting
to
make
for
himself
a
career
among
big
men
?
<EOS>
There
had
frequently
been
in
the
mind
of
this
young
man
an
idea
that
there
was
something
almost
false
in
his
own
position
,
 
that
his
life
was
a
pretence
,
and
that
he
would
ultimately
be
subject
to
that
ruin
which
always
comes
,
sooner
or
later
,
on
things
which
are
false
;
and
now
as
he
wandered
alone
about
Lady
Glencora
's
gardens
,
this
feeling
was
very
strong
within
his
bosom
,
and
robbed
him
altogether
of
the
honour
and
glory
of
having
been
one
of
the
Duke
of
Omnium
's
guests
.
   
<EOS>
The
Cabinet
Minister
at
Killaloe
 
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
throw
himself
into
the
river
from
the
Duke
's
garden
;
and
was
ready
,
in
spite
of
Violet
Effingham
,
to
start
for
Ireland
with
Mr.
Monk
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
in
August
.
<EOS>
The
close
of
that
season
in
London
certainly
was
not
a
happy
period
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
Violet
had
spoken
to
him
after
such
a
fashion
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
not
to
believe
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
him
no
hint
whether
it
was
likely
or
unlikely
that
she
and
Lord
Chiltern
would
be
reconciled
;
but
she
had
convinced
him
that
he
could
not
be
allowed
to
take
Lord
Chiltern
's
place
.
<EOS>
"
A
woman
can
not
transfer
her
heart
,
"
she
had
said
.
<EOS>
Phineas
was
well
aware
that
many
women
do
transfer
their
hearts
;
but
he
had
gone
to
this
woman
too
soon
after
the
wrench
which
her
love
had
received
;
he
had
been
too
sudden
with
his
proposal
for
a
transfer
;
and
the
punishment
for
such
ill
judgment
must
be
that
success
would
now
be
impossible
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
yet
how
could
he
have
waited
,
feeling
that
Miss
Effingham
,
if
she
were
at
all
like
other
girls
whom
he
had
known
,
might
have
promised
herself
to
some
other
lover
before
she
would
return
within
his
reach
in
the
succeeding
spring
?
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
like
some
other
girls
.
<EOS>
Ah
;
 
he
knew
that
now
,
and
repented
him
of
his
haste
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
ready
for
Mr.
Monk
on
the
7th
of
August
,
and
they
started
together
.
<EOS>
Something
less
than
twenty
hours
took
them
from
London
to
Killaloe
,
and
during
four
or
five
of
those
twenty
hours
Mr.
Monk
was
unfitted
for
any
conversation
by
the
uncomfortable
feelings
incidental
to
the
passage
from
Holyhead
to
Kingstown
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
conversation
between
them
during
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
sad
to
me
to
have
to
confess
it
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
the
truth
is
that
my
old
rival
,
Turnbull
,
is
right
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
begins
his
political
life
as
I
began
mine
,
is
not
the
man
of
whom
a
Minister
should
be
formed
.
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
Ministers
of
Government
require
almost
as
much
education
in
their
trade
as
shoemakers
or
tallow
-
chandlers
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
you
can
make
a
good
public
servant
of
a
man
simply
because
he
has
got
the
ear
of
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
mean
to
say
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
that
we
are
altogether
wrong
from
beginning
to
end
,
in
our
way
of
arranging
these
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
that
at
all
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
men
who
have
been
leading
statesmen
since
our
present
mode
of
government
was
formed
,
 
from
the
days
in
which
it
was
forming
itself
,
say
from
Walpole
down
,
and
you
will
find
that
all
who
have
been
of
real
use
had
early
training
as
public
servants
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
we
never
to
get
out
of
the
old
groove
?
"
  
"
Not
if
the
groove
is
good
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
"
Those
who
have
been
efficient
as
ministers
sucked
in
their
efficacy
with
their
mother
's
milk
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brock
did
so
,
and
Lord
de
Terrier
,
and
Mr.
Mildmay
.
<EOS>
They
seated
themselves
in
office
chairs
the
moment
they
left
college
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
was
in
office
before
he
was
eight
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
St.
Bungay
was
at
work
as
a
Private
Secretary
when
he
was
three
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
You
,
luckily
for
yourself
,
have
done
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
regret
it
every
hour
of
my
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
cause
for
regret
,
but
it
is
not
so
with
me
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
any
man
unfitted
by
his
previous
career
for
office
,
it
is
he
who
has
become
,
or
who
has
endeavoured
to
become
,
a
popular
politician
,
 
an
exponent
,
if
I
may
say
so
,
of
public
opinion
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
can
see
,
office
is
offered
to
such
men
with
one
view
only
,
 
that
of
clipping
their
wings
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
of
obtaining
their
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
Help
from
Turnbull
would
mean
the
withdrawal
of
all
power
of
opposition
from
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
give
other
help
for
any
long
term
,
as
the
very
fact
of
his
accepting
power
and
patronage
would
take
from
him
his
popular
leadership
.
<EOS>
The
masses
outside
require
to
have
their
minister
as
the
Queen
has
hers
;
but
the
same
man
can
not
be
minister
to
both
.
<EOS>
If
the
people
's
minister
chooses
to
change
his
master
,
and
to
take
the
Queen
's
shilling
,
something
of
temporary
relief
may
be
gained
by
government
in
the
fact
that
the
other
place
will
for
a
time
be
vacant
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
candidates
enough
for
such
places
,
and
the
vacancy
is
not
a
vacancy
long
.
<EOS>
Of
course
the
Crown
has
this
pull
,
that
it
pays
wages
,
and
the
people
do
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
that
that
influenced
you
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
did
not
influence
me
.
<EOS>
To
you
I
will
make
bold
to
state
so
much
positively
,
though
it
would
be
foolish
,
perhaps
,
to
do
so
to
others
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
go
for
the
shilling
,
though
I
am
so
poor
<EOS>
a
man
that
the
shilling
is
more
to
me
than
it
would
be
to
almost
any
man
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
shilling
,
much
doubting
,
but
guided
in
part
by
this
,
that
I
was
ashamed
of
being
afraid
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
They
told
me
,
 
Mr.
Mildmay
and
the
Duke
,
 
that
I
could
earn
it
to
the
benefit
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
earned
it
,
and
the
country
has
not
been
benefited
,
 
unless
it
be
for
the
good
of
the
country
that
my
voice
in
the
House
should
be
silenced
.
<EOS>
If
I
believe
that
,
I
ought
to
hold
my
tongue
without
taking
a
salary
for
holding
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
a
mistake
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
Such
mistakes
made
at
my
time
of
life
can
not
be
wholly
rectified
;
but
,
being
convinced
of
my
error
,
I
must
do
the
best
in
my
power
to
put
myself
right
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
bitterness
in
all
this
to
Phineas
himself
of
which
he
could
not
but
make
plaint
to
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
a
man
in
office
must
be
a
slave
,
and
that
slavery
is
distasteful
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
I
think
you
are
wrong
.
<EOS>
If
you
mean
that
you
can
not
do
joint
work
with
other
men
altogether
after
your
own
fashion
the
same
may
be
said
of
all
work
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
stuck
to
the
Bar
you
must
have
pleaded
your
causes
in
conformity
with
instructions
from
the
attorneys
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
guided
by
my
own
lights
in
advising
those
attorneys
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
see
that
you
suffer
anything
that
ought
to
go
against
the
grain
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
beginning
young
,
and
it
is
your
first
adopted
career
.
<EOS>
With
me
it
is
otherwise
.
<EOS>
If
by
my
telling
you
this
I
shall
have
led
you
astray
,
I
shall
regret
my
openness
with
you
.
<EOS>
Could
I
begin
again
,
I
would
willingly
begin
as
you
began
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
day
in
Killaloe
,
that
on
which
Mr.
Monk
arrived
with
Phineas
at
the
doctor
's
house
.
<EOS>
In
London
,
perhaps
,
a
bishop
inspires
more
awe
than
a
Cabinet
Minister
.
<EOS>
In
Killaloe
,
where
a
bishop
might
be
seen
walking
about
every
day
,
the
mitred
dignitary
of
the
Church
,
though
much
loved
,
was
thought
of
,
I
fear
,
but
lightly
;
whereas
a
Cabinet
Minister
coming
to
stay
in
the
house
of
a
townsman
was
a
thing
to
be
wondered
at
,
to
be
talked
about
,
to
be
afraid
of
,
to
be
a
fruitful
source
of
conversation
for
a
year
to
come
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
in
Killaloe
,
especially
among
the
elder
ladies
,
who
had
shaken
their
heads
and
expressed
the
saddest
doubts
when
young
Phineas
Finn
had
first
become
a
Parliament
man
.
<EOS>
And
though
by
degrees
they
had
been
half
brought
round
,
having
been
driven
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
been
wonderfully
successful
as
a
Parliament
man
,
still
they
had
continued
to
shake
their
heads
among
themselves
,
and
to
fear
something
in
the
future
,
 
until
he
appeared
at
his
old
home
leading
a
Cabinet
Minister
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
There
was
such
assurance
in
this
that
even
old
Mrs.
Callaghan
,
at
the
brewery
,
gave
way
,
and
began
to
say
all
manner
of
good
things
,
and
to
praise
the
doctor
's
luck
in
that
he
had
a
son
gifted
with
parts
so
excellent
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
desire
to
see
the
Cabinet
Minister
in
the
flesh
,
to
be
with
him
when
he
ate
and
drank
,
to
watch
the
gait
and
countenance
of
the
man
,
and
to
drink
water
from
this
fountain
of
state
lore
which
had
been
so
wonderfully
brought
among
them
by
their
young
townsman
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
was
aware
that
it
behoved
her
to
be
chary
of
her
invitations
,
but
the
lady
from
the
brewery
had
said
such
good
things
of
Mrs.
Finn
's
black
swan
,
that
she
carried
her
point
,
and
was
invited
to
meet
the
Cabinet
Minister
at
dinner
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
and
her
daughter
were
invited
also
to
be
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
When
Phineas
had
been
last
at
Killaloe
,
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
,
as
the
reader
may
remember
,
had
remained
with
her
daughter
at
Floodborough
,
 
feeling
it
to
be
her
duty
to
keep
her
daughter
away
from
the
danger
of
an
unrequited
attachment
.
<EOS>
But
it
seemed
that
her
purpose
was
changed
now
,
or
that
she
no
longer
feared
the
danger
,
 
for
both
Mary
and
her
mother
were
now
again
living
in
Killaloe
,
and
Mary
was
at
the
doctor
's
house
as
much
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
A
day
or
two
before
the
coming
of
the
god
and
the
demigod
to
the
little
town
,
Barbara
Finn
and
her
friend
had
thus
come
to
understand
each
other
as
they
walked
along
the
Shannon
side
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
my
dear
,
that
he
is
engaged
to
nobody
,
"
said
Barbara
Finn
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
sure
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
that
I
do
not
care
whether
he
is
or
is
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
care
?
<EOS>
Five
years
ago
I
had
a
foolish
dream
,
and
now
I
am
awake
again
.
<EOS>
Think
how
old
I
have
got
to
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
you
are
twenty
-
three
.
<EOS>
What
has
that
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
this
to
do
with
it
;
 
that
I
am
old
enough
to
know
better
.
<EOS>
Mamma
and
I
quite
understand
each
other
.
<EOS>
She
used
to
be
angry
with
him
,
but
she
has
got
over
all
that
foolishness
now
.
<EOS>
It
always
made
me
so
vexed
;
 
<EOS>
the
idea
of
being
angry
with
a
man
<EOS>
because
,
 
because
 
!
<EOS>
You
know
one
ca
n't
talk
about
it
,
it
is
so
foolish
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
n't
care
for
him
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
what
you
used
to
swear
to
me
less
than
two
years
ago
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
all
very
well
,
and
I
remember
what
a
goose
I
was
.
<EOS>
As
for
caring
for
him
,
of
course
I
do
,
 
because
he
is
your
brother
,
and
because
I
have
known
him
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
were
going
to
be
married
to
-
morrow
,
you
would
see
that
it
would
make
no
difference
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Barbara
Finn
walked
on
for
a
couple
of
minutes
in
silence
before
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
"
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
 
then
all
that
I
shall
ask
of
you
is
,
that
we
may
not
talk
about
him
any
more
.
<EOS>
Mamma
believes
it
,
and
that
is
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
they
did
talk
about
Phineas
during
the
whole
of
that
day
,
and
very
often
talked
about
him
afterwards
,
as
long
as
Mary
remained
at
Killaloe
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
dinner
party
at
the
doctor
's
on
the
day
after
Mr.
Monk
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
The
bishop
was
not
there
,
though
he
was
on
terms
sufficiently
friendly
with
the
doctor
's
family
to
have
been
invited
on
so
grand
an
occasion
;
but
he
was
not
there
,
because
Mrs.
Finn
was
determined
that
she
would
be
taken
out
to
dinner
by
a
Cabinet
Minister
in
the
face
of
all
her
friends
.
<EOS>
She
was
aware
that
had
the
bishop
been
there
,
she
must
have
taken
the
bishop
's
arm
.
<EOS>
And
though
there
would
have
been
glory
in
that
,
the
other
glory
was
more
to
her
taste
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
had
ever
seen
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
and
I
think
that
she
was
a
little
disappointed
at
finding
him
so
like
other
middle
-
aged
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
She
had
hoped
that
Mr.
Monk
would
have
assumed
something
of
the
dignity
of
his
position
;
but
he
assumed
nothing
.
<EOS>
Now
the
bishop
,
though
he
was
a
very
mild
man
,
did
assume
something
by
the
very
facts
of
his
apron
and
knee
-
breeches
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
sir
,
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
put
up
with
our
humble
way
of
living
,
"
said
Mrs.
Finn
to
her
guest
,
as
they
sat
down
at
table
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
had
resolved
that
she
would
not
make
any
speech
of
the
kind
,
 
that
she
would
condescend
to
no
apology
,
 
that
she
would
bear
herself
as
though
a
Cabinet
Minister
dined
with
her
at
least
once
a
year
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
moment
came
,
she
broke
down
,
and
made
this
apology
with
almost
abject
meekness
,
and
then
hated
herself
because
she
had
done
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
madam
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
"
I
live
myself
so
much
like
a
hermit
that
your
house
is
a
palace
of
luxury
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
he
felt
that
he
had
made
a
foolish
speech
,
and
he
also
hated
himself
.
<EOS>
He
found
it
very
difficult
to
talk
to
his
hostess
upon
any
subject
,
until
by
chance
he
mentioned
his
young
friend
Phineas
.
<EOS>
Then
her
tongue
was
unloosed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
son
,
madam
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
going
with
me
to
Limerick
and
back
to
Dublin
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
shame
,
I
know
,
taking
him
so
soon
away
from
home
,
but
I
should
not
know
how
to
get
on
without
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Monk
,
it
is
such
a
blessing
for
him
,
and
such
an
honour
for
us
,
that
you
should
be
so
good
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
mother
spoke
out
all
her
past
fears
and
all
her
present
hopes
,
and
acknowledged
the
great
glory
which
it
was
to
her
to
have
a
son
sitting
in
Parliament
,
holding
an
office
with
a
stately
name
and
a
great
salary
,
and
blessed
with
the
friendship
of
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
After
that
Mr.
Monk
got
on
better
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
any
young
man
,
"
said
he
,
"
in
whose
career
I
have
taken
so
strong
an
interest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
always
good
,
"
said
Mrs.
Finn
,
with
a
tear
forcing
itself
into
the
corner
of
each
eye
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
his
mother
,
and
of
course
I
ought
not
to
say
so
,
 
not
in
this
way
;
but
it
is
true
,
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
the
poor
lady
was
obliged
to
raise
her
handkerchief
and
wipe
away
the
drops
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
on
this
occasion
had
taken
out
to
dinner
the
mother
of
his
devoted
Mary
,
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
pleasure
it
must
be
to
the
doctor
and
Mrs.
Finn
to
see
you
come
back
in
this
way
,
"
said
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
bones
unbroken
?
"
said
he
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
with
all
your
bones
unbroken
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
Phineas
,
when
we
first
heard
that
you
were
to
sit
in
Parliament
,
we
were
afraid
that
you
might
break
a
rib
or
two
,
 
since
you
choose
to
talk
about
the
breaking
of
bones
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
Everybody
thought
I
should
come
to
grief
;
but
nobody
felt
so
sure
of
it
as
I
did
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
not
come
to
grief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
out
of
the
wood
yet
,
you
know
,
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
There
is
plenty
of
possibility
for
grief
in
my
way
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
can
understand
it
,
you
are
out
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
All
that
your
friends
here
want
to
see
now
is
,
that
you
should
marry
some
nice
English
girl
,
with
a
little
money
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
Rumours
have
reached
us
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rumours
always
lie
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
they
do
,
of
course
;
and
I
am
not
going
to
ask
any
indiscreet
questions
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
what
we
all
hope
.
<EOS>
Mary
was
saying
,
only
the
other
day
,
that
if
you
were
once
married
,
we
should
all
feel
quite
safe
about
you
.
<EOS>
And
you
know
we
all
take
the
most
lively
interest
in
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
every
day
that
a
man
from
County
Clare
gets
on
as
you
have
done
,
and
therefore
we
are
bound
to
think
of
you
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
signified
to
Phineas
Finn
that
she
had
forgiven
him
the
thoughtlessness
of
his
early
youth
,
 
even
though
there
had
been
something
of
treachery
in
that
thoughtlessness
to
her
own
daughter
;
and
showed
him
,
also
,
that
whatever
Mary
's
feelings
might
have
been
once
,
they
were
not
now
of
a
nature
to
trouble
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
you
will
marry
?
"
said
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
very
likely
not
,
"
said
Phineas
,
who
perhaps
looked
farther
into
the
mind
of
the
lady
than
the
lady
intended
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
,
"
said
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Every
man
should
marry
as
soon
as
he
can
,
and
especially
a
man
in
your
position
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
ladies
met
together
in
the
drawing
-
room
after
dinner
,
it
was
impossible
but
that
they
should
discuss
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
There
was
Mrs.
Callaghan
from
the
brewery
there
,
and
old
Lady
Blood
,
of
Bloodstone
,
 
who
on
ordinary
occasions
would
hardly
admit
that
she
was
on
dining
-
out
terms
with
any
one
in
Killaloe
except
the
bishop
,
but
who
had
found
it
impossible
to
decline
to
meet
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
 
and
there
was
Mrs.
Stackpoole
from
Sixmiletown
,
a
far
-
away
cousin
of
the
Finns
,
who
hated
Lady
Blood
with
a
true
provincial
hatred
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
anything
particularly
uncommon
in
him
,
after
all
,
"
said
Lady
Blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
very
nice
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
very
quiet
,
my
dear
,
and
just
like
other
people
,
"
said
Mrs.
Callaghan
,
meaning
to
pronounce
a
strong
eulogium
on
the
Cabinet
Minister
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
like
other
people
indeed
,
"
said
Lady
Blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
would
you
expect
,
Lady
Blood
?
"
said
Mrs.
Stackpoole
.
<EOS>
"
Men
and
women
in
London
walk
upon
two
legs
,
just
as
they
do
in
Ennis
.
"
<EOS>
Now
Lady
Blood
herself
had
been
born
and
bred
in
Ennis
,
whereas
Mrs.
Stackpoole
had
come
from
Limerick
,
which
is
a
much
more
considerable
town
,
and
therefore
there
was
a
satire
in
this
allusion
to
the
habits
of
the
men
of
Ennis
which
Lady
Blood
understood
thoroughly
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Stackpoole
,
I
know
how
the
people
walk
in
London
quite
as
well
as
you
do
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Blood
had
once
passed
three
months
in
London
while
Sir
Patrick
had
been
alive
,
whereas
Mrs.
Stackpoole
had
never
done
more
than
visit
the
metropolis
for
a
day
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
doubt
,
"
said
Mrs.
Stackpoole
;
"
but
I
never
can
understand
what
it
is
that
people
expect
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Mr.
Monk
ought
to
have
come
with
his
stars
on
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
to
have
pleased
Lady
Blood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Stackpoole
,
Cabinet
Ministers
do
n't
have
stars
,
"
said
Lady
Blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
said
they
did
,
"
said
Mrs.
Stackpoole
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
so
nice
and
gentle
to
talk
to
,
"
said
Mrs.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
say
what
you
will
,
but
men
who
are
high
up
do
very
often
give
themselves
airs
.
<EOS>
Now
I
must
say
that
this
friend
of
my
son
's
does
not
do
anything
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
the
least
,
"
said
Mrs.
Callaghan
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
the
contrary
,
"
said
Mrs.
Stackpoole
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
he
is
a
wonderful
man
,
"
said
Lady
Blood
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
say
is
,
that
I
did
n't
hear
anything
wonderful
come
out
of
his
mouth
;
and
as
for
people
in
Ennis
walking
on
two
legs
,
I
have
seen
donkeys
in
Limerick
doing
just
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
"
Now
it
was
well
known
that
Mrs.
Stackpoole
had
two
sons
living
in
Limerick
,
as
to
neither
of
whom
was
it
expected
that
he
would
set
the
Shannon
on
fire
.
<EOS>
After
this
little
speech
there
was
no
further
mention
of
Mr.
Monk
,
as
it
became
necessary
that
all
the
good
-
nature
of
Mrs.
Finn
and
all
the
tact
of
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
and
all
the
energy
of
Mrs.
Callaghan
should
be
used
,
to
prevent
the
raging
of
an
internecine
battle
between
Mrs.
Stackpoole
and
Lady
Blood
.
   
<EOS>
Victrix
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
's
holiday
programme
allowed
him
a
week
at
Killaloe
,
and
from
thence
he
was
to
go
to
Limerick
,
and
from
Limerick
to
Dublin
,
in
order
that
,
at
both
places
,
he
might
be
entertained
at
a
public
dinner
and
make
a
speech
about
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
Foreseeing
that
Phineas
might
commit
himself
if
he
attended
these
meetings
,
Mr.
Monk
had
counselled
him
to
remain
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
But
Phineas
had
refused
to
subject
himself
to
such
cautious
abstinence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
had
come
to
Ireland
as
his
friend
,
and
he
would
see
him
through
his
travels
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
,
probably
,
be
asked
to
speak
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
if
I
am
asked
,
I
need
not
say
more
than
a
few
words
.
<EOS>
And
what
if
I
did
speak
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
find
it
disadvantageous
to
you
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
take
my
chance
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
tie
myself
down
for
ever
and
ever
for
the
sake
of
being
Under
-
Secretary
to
the
Colonies
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
said
very
much
to
him
on
the
subject
,
 
was
constantly
saying
very
much
to
him
about
it
;
but
in
spite
of
all
that
Mr.
Monk
said
,
Phineas
did
make
the
journey
to
Limerick
and
Dublin
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
,
since
his
arrival
at
Killaloe
,
been
a
moment
alone
with
Mary
Flood
Jones
till
the
evening
before
he
started
with
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
She
had
kept
out
of
his
way
successfully
,
though
she
had
constantly
been
with
him
in
company
,
and
was
beginning
to
plume
herself
on
the
strength
and
valour
of
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
But
her
self
-
praise
had
in
it
nothing
of
joy
,
and
her
glory
was
very
sad
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
would
care
for
him
no
more
,
 
more
especially
as
it
was
so
very
evident
that
he
cared
not
at
all
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
the
very
fact
of
her
keeping
out
of
his
way
,
made
her
acknowledge
to
herself
that
her
position
was
very
miserable
.
<EOS>
She
had
declared
to
her
mother
that
she
might
certainly
go
to
Killaloe
with
safety
,
 
that
it
would
be
better
for
her
to
put
herself
in
the
way
of
meeting
him
as
an
old
friend
,
 
that
the
idea
of
the
necessity
of
shutting
herself
up
because
of
his
approach
,
was
the
one
thing
that
gave
her
real
pain
.
<EOS>
Therefore
her
mother
had
brought
her
to
Killaloe
and
she
had
met
him
;
but
her
fancied
security
had
deserted
her
,
and
she
found
herself
to
be
miserable
,
hoping
for
something
she
did
not
know
what
,
still
dreaming
of
possibilities
,
feeling
during
every
moment
of
his
presence
with
her
that
some
special
conduct
was
necessary
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
make
further
confession
to
her
mother
and
ask
to
be
carried
back
to
Floodborough
;
but
she
knew
that
she
was
very
wretched
at
Killaloe
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Phineas
,
he
had
felt
that
his
old
friend
was
very
cold
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
that
humour
with
reference
to
Violet
Effingham
which
seemed
especially
to
require
consolation
.
<EOS>
He
knew
now
that
all
hope
was
over
there
.
<EOS>
Violet
Effingham
could
never
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Even
were
she
not
to
marry
Lord
Chiltern
for
the
next
five
years
,
she
would
not
,
during
those
five
years
,
marry
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
Such
was
our
hero
's
conviction
;
and
,
suffering
under
this
conviction
,
he
was
in
want
of
the
comfort
of
feminine
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Had
Mary
known
all
this
,
and
had
it
suited
her
to
play
such
a
part
<EOS>
,
I
think
she
might
have
had
Phineas
at
her
feet
before
he
had
been
a
week
at
home
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
kept
aloof
from
him
and
had
heard
nothing
of
his
sorrows
.
<EOS>
As
a
natural
consequence
of
this
,
Phineas
was
more
in
love
with
her
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
before
he
started
with
Mr.
Monk
for
Limerick
,
he
managed
to
be
alone
with
her
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
Barbara
may
probably
have
assisted
in
bringing
about
this
arrangement
,
and
had
,
perhaps
,
been
guilty
of
some
treachery
,
 
sisters
in
such
circumstances
will
sometimes
be
very
treacherous
to
their
friends
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
,
however
,
that
Mary
herself
was
quite
innocent
of
any
guile
in
the
matter
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
"
Phineas
said
to
her
suddenly
,
"
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
avoided
me
purposely
ever
since
I
have
been
at
home
.
"
<EOS>
She
smiled
and
blushed
,
and
stammered
and
said
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
Has
there
been
any
reason
for
it
,
Mary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
reason
at
all
that
I
know
of
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
used
to
be
such
great
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
before
you
were
a
great
man
,
Phineas
.
<EOS>
It
must
necessarily
be
different
now
.
<EOS>
You
know
so
many
people
now
,
and
people
of
such
a
different
sort
,
that
of
course
I
fall
a
little
into
the
background
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
talk
in
that
way
,
Mary
,
I
know
that
you
are
laughing
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
indeed
I
am
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
there
is
no
one
in
the
whole
world
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
pause
,
"
whose
friendship
is
more
to
me
than
yours
is
.
<EOS>
I
think
of
it
so
often
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
Say
that
when
we
come
back
it
shall
be
between
us
as
it
used
to
be
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
put
out
his
hand
for
hers
,
and
she
could
not
help
giving
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
there
will
be
people
,
"
he
said
,
"
who
talk
nonsense
,
and
one
can
not
help
it
;
but
I
will
not
put
up
with
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
to
talk
nonsense
,
Phineas
!
"
<EOS>
Then
there
came
some
one
across
them
,
and
the
conversation
was
ended
;
but
the
sound
of
his
voice
remained
on
her
ears
,
and
she
could
not
help
but
remember
that
he
had
declared
that
her
friendship
was
dearer
to
him
than
the
friendship
of
any
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
went
with
Mr.
Monk
first
to
Limerick
and
then
to
Dublin
,
and
found
himself
at
both
places
to
be
regarded
as
a
hero
only
second
to
the
great
hero
.
<EOS>
At
both
places
the
one
subject
of
debate
was
tenant
-
right
;
 
could
anything
be
done
to
make
it
profitable
for
men
with
capital
to
put
their
capital
into
Irish
land
?
<EOS>
The
fertility
of
the
soil
was
questioned
by
no
one
,
 
nor
the
sufficiency
of
external
circumstances
,
such
as
railroads
and
the
like
;
 
nor
the
abundance
of
labour
;
 
nor
even
security
for
the
wealth
to
be
produced
.
<EOS>
The
only
difficulty
was
in
this
,
that
the
men
who
were
to
produce
the
wealth
had
no
guarantee
that
it
would
be
theirs
when
it
was
created
.
<EOS>
In
England
and
elsewhere
such
guarantees
were
in
existence
.
<EOS>
Might
it
not
be
possible
to
introduce
them
into
Ireland
?
<EOS>
That
was
the
question
which
Mr.
Monk
had
in
hand
;
and
in
various
speeches
which
he
made
both
before
and
after
the
dinners
given
to
him
,
he
pledged
himself
to
keep
it
well
in
hand
when
Parliament
should
meet
.
<EOS>
Of
course
Phineas
spoke
also
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
that
he
should
be
silent
when
his
friend
and
leader
was
pouring
out
his
eloquence
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
spoke
,
and
of
course
he
pledged
himself
.
<EOS>
Something
like
the
old
pleasures
of
the
debating
society
returned
to
him
,
as
standing
upon
a
platform
before
a
listening
multitude
,
he
gave
full
vent
to
his
words
.
<EOS>
In
the
House
of
Commons
,
of
late
he
had
been
so
cabined
,
cribbed
,
and
confined
by
office
as
to
have
enjoyed
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
from
the
commencement
of
his
career
,
he
had
fallen
so
thoroughly
into
the
decorum
of
Government
ways
,
as
to
have
missed
altogether
the
delights
of
that
wild
irresponsible
oratory
of
which
Mr.
Monk
had
spoken
to
him
so
often
.
<EOS>
He
had
envied
men
below
the
gangway
,
who
,
though
supporting
the
Government
on
main
questions
,
could
get
up
on
their
legs
whenever
the
House
was
full
enough
to
make
it
worth
their
while
,
and
say
almost
whatever
they
pleased
.
<EOS>
There
was
that
Mr.
Robson
,
who
literally
did
say
just
what
came
uppermost
;
and
the
thing
that
came
uppermost
was
often
ill
-
natured
,
often
unbecoming
the
gravity
of
the
House
,
was
always
startling
;
but
men
listened
to
him
and
liked
him
to
speak
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Robson
had
 
married
a
woman
with
money
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
why
,
 
why
,
had
not
Violet
Effingham
been
kinder
to
him
?
<EOS>
He
might
even
yet
,
perhaps
,
marry
a
woman
with
money
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
so
unless
he
loved
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
upshot
of
the
Dublin
meeting
was
that
he
also
positively
pledged
himself
to
support
during
the
next
session
of
Parliament
a
bill
advocating
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
you
went
so
far
as
that
,
"
Mr.
Monk
said
to
him
almost
as
soon
as
the
meeting
was
over
.
<EOS>
They
were
standing
on
the
pier
at
Kingstown
,
and
Mr.
Monk
was
preparing
to
return
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
not
I
as
far
as
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
had
thought
about
it
,
and
I
do
not
think
that
you
have
.
<EOS>
I
am
prepared
to
resign
my
office
to
-
morrow
;
and
directly
that
I
can
see
Mr.
Gresham
and
explain
to
him
what
I
have
done
,
I
shall
offer
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
accept
your
resignation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
accept
it
,
unless
he
is
prepared
to
instruct
the
Irish
Secretary
to
bring
in
such
a
bill
as
I
can
support
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
exactly
in
the
same
boat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
ought
not
to
be
in
the
same
boat
;
 
nor
need
you
.
<EOS>
My
advice
to
you
is
to
say
nothing
about
it
till
you
get
back
to
London
,
and
then
speak
to
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
you
will
not
say
anything
on
the
subject
in
the
House
,
but
that
in
the
event
of
there
being
a
division
you
hope
to
be
allowed
to
vote
as
on
an
open
question
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
I
shall
get
Gresham
's
assent
,
and
if
so
we
shall
be
all
right
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
not
,
and
if
they
choose
to
make
it
a
point
with
you
,
you
must
resign
also
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
shall
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
not
think
they
will
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
too
useful
,
and
they
will
wish
to
avoid
the
weakness
which
comes
to
a
ministry
from
changing
its
team
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
my
dear
fellow
;
and
remember
this
,
 
my
last
word
of
advice
to
you
is
to
stick
by
the
ship
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
it
is
a
career
which
will
suit
you
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
begin
it
soon
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
was
rather
melancholy
as
he
returned
alone
to
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
to
bid
him
stick
to
the
ship
,
and
he
knew
as
well
as
any
one
could
tell
him
how
material
the
ship
was
to
him
;
but
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
man
can
not
stick
to
his
ship
,
 
can
not
stick
,
at
least
,
to
this
special
Government
ship
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
whither
Mr.
Monk
went
,
in
this
session
,
he
must
follow
.
<EOS>
He
had
considerable
hope
that
when
Mr.
Monk
explained
his
purpose
to
the
Prime
Minister
,
the
Prime
Minister
would
feel
himself
obliged
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
Phineas
would
not
only
be
able
to
keep
his
office
,
but
would
have
such
an
opportunity
of
making
a
speech
in
Parliament
as
circumstances
had
never
yet
given
to
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
again
at
home
he
said
nothing
to
his
father
or
to
the
Killaloeians
as
to
the
danger
of
his
position
.
<EOS>
Of
what
use
would
it
be
to
make
his
mother
and
sisters
miserable
,
or
to
incur
the
useless
counsels
of
the
doctor
?
<EOS>
They
seemed
to
think
his
speech
at
Dublin
very
fine
,
and
were
never
tired
of
talking
of
what
Mr.
Monk
and
Phineas
were
going
to
do
;
but
the
idea
had
not
come
home
to
them
that
if
Mr.
Monk
or
Phineas
chose
to
do
anything
on
their
own
account
,
they
must
give
up
the
places
which
they
held
under
the
Crown
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
September
when
Phineas
found
himself
back
at
Killaloe
,
and
he
was
due
to
be
at
his
office
in
London
in
November
.
<EOS>
The
excitement
of
Mr.
Monk
's
company
was
now
over
,
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
receive
pouches
full
of
official
papers
from
the
Colonial
Office
,
and
study
all
the
statistics
which
came
within
his
reach
in
reference
to
the
proposed
new
law
for
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mary
was
still
living
with
her
mother
at
Killaloe
,
and
still
kept
herself
somewhat
aloof
from
the
man
she
loved
.
<EOS>
How
could
it
be
possible
for
him
not
to
give
way
in
such
circumstances
as
those
?
  
<EOS>
One
day
he
found
himself
talking
to
her
about
himself
,
and
speaking
to
her
of
his
own
position
with
more
frankness
than
he
ever
used
with
his
own
family
.
<EOS>
He
had
begun
by
reminding
her
of
that
conversation
which
they
had
had
before
he
went
away
with
Mr.
Monk
,
and
by
reminding
her
also
that
she
had
promised
to
return
to
her
old
friendly
ways
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Phineas
;
there
was
no
promise
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
are
we
not
to
be
friends
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
say
that
I
made
no
particular
promise
.
<EOS>
Of
course
we
are
friends
.
<EOS>
We
have
always
been
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
say
if
you
heard
that
I
had
resigned
my
office
and
given
up
my
seat
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
Of
course
she
expressed
her
surprise
,
almost
her
horror
,
at
such
an
idea
,
and
then
he
told
her
everything
.
<EOS>
It
took
long
in
the
telling
,
because
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
explain
to
her
the
working
of
the
system
which
made
it
impossible
for
him
,
as
a
member
of
the
Government
,
to
entertain
an
opinion
of
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
mean
that
you
would
lose
your
salary
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
should
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
not
that
be
very
dreadful
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
laughed
as
he
acknowledged
that
it
would
be
dreadful
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
dreadful
,
Mary
,
to
have
nothing
to
eat
and
drink
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
a
man
to
do
?
<EOS>
Would
you
recommend
me
to
say
that
black
is
white
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
will
never
do
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Mary
,
it
is
very
nice
to
be
called
by
a
big
name
and
to
have
a
salary
,
and
it
is
very
comfortable
to
be
envied
by
one
's
friends
and
enemies
;
 
but
there
are
drawbacks
.
<EOS>
There
is
this
especial
drawback
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
paused
for
a
moment
before
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
especial
drawback
,
Phineas
?
"
  
"
A
man
can
not
do
what
he
pleases
with
himself
.
<EOS>
How
can
a
man
marry
,
so
circumstanced
as
I
am
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
and
then
she
answered
him
,
 
"
A
man
may
be
very
happy
without
marrying
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
also
paused
for
many
moments
before
he
spoke
again
,
and
she
then
made
a
faint
attempt
to
escape
from
him
.
<EOS>
But
before
she
succeeded
he
had
asked
her
a
question
which
arrested
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
you
would
listen
to
me
if
I
were
to
tell
you
a
history
?
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
listened
,
and
the
history
he
told
her
was
the
tale
of
his
love
for
Violet
Effingham
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
has
money
of
her
own
?
"
<EOS>
Mary
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
she
is
rich
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
large
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Mr.
Finn
,
you
must
seek
some
one
else
who
is
equally
blessed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
,
that
is
untrue
,
 
that
is
ill
-
natured
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
mean
that
.
<EOS>
Say
that
you
do
not
mean
it
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
believed
that
I
loved
Miss
Effingham
because
she
was
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
told
me
that
you
could
love
no
one
who
is
not
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
Love
is
involuntary
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
often
run
in
a
yoke
with
prudence
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
my
history
as
far
as
it
is
concerned
with
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
I
did
love
her
very
dearly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
love
her
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
did
love
her
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
inconstancy
in
ceasing
to
love
when
one
is
not
loved
?
<EOS>
Is
there
inconstancy
in
changing
one
's
love
,
and
in
loving
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
said
Mary
,
to
whom
the
occasion
was
becoming
so
embarrassing
that
she
no
longer
was
able
to
reply
with
words
that
had
a
meaning
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
be
,
dear
,
I
am
inconstant
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
,
but
of
course
she
had
not
a
syllable
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
changed
my
love
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
speak
of
a
new
passion
till
I
had
told
the
story
of
that
which
has
passed
away
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
it
all
now
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
Can
you
try
to
love
me
,
after
that
?
<EOS>
"
It
had
come
at
last
,
 
the
thing
for
which
she
had
been
ever
wishing
.
<EOS>
It
had
come
in
spite
of
her
imprudence
,
and
in
spite
of
her
prudence
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
heard
him
to
the
end
she
was
not
a
whit
angry
with
him
,
 
<EOS>
she
was
not
in
the
least
aggrieved
,
 
because
he
had
been
lost
to
her
in
his
love
for
this
Miss
Effingham
,
while
she
had
been
so
nearly
lost
by
her
love
for
him
.
<EOS>
For
women
such
episodes
in
the
lives
of
their
lovers
have
an
excitement
which
is
almost
pleasurable
,
whereas
each
man
is
anxious
to
hear
his
lady
swear
that
until
he
appeared
upon
the
scene
her
heart
had
been
fancy
free
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
upon
the
whole
,
had
liked
the
story
,
 
had
thought
that
it
had
been
finely
told
,
and
was
well
pleased
with
the
final
catastrophe
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
she
was
not
prepared
with
her
reply
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
no
answer
to
give
me
,
Mary
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
looking
up
into
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
that
he
did
not
doubt
what
would
be
her
answer
,
 
as
it
would
be
good
that
all
lovers
should
do
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
vouchsafe
me
some
word
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
she
essayed
to
speak
she
found
that
she
was
dumb
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
get
her
voice
to
give
her
the
assistance
of
a
single
word
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
cry
,
but
there
was
a
motion
as
of
sobbing
in
her
throat
which
impeded
all
utterance
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
happy
as
earth
,
 
as
heaven
could
make
her
;
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
tell
him
that
she
was
happy
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
longed
to
tell
it
,
that
he
might
know
how
thankful
she
was
to
him
for
his
goodness
.
<EOS>
He
still
sat
looking
at
her
,
and
now
by
degrees
he
had
got
her
hand
in
his
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
,
"
he
said
,
"
will
you
be
my
wife
,
 
my
own
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
When
half
an
hour
had
passed
,
they
were
still
together
,
and
now
she
had
found
the
use
of
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
Do
whatever
you
like
best
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
which
you
do
.
<EOS>
If
you
came
to
me
to
-
morrow
and
told
me
you
had
no
income
,
it
would
make
no
difference
.
<EOS>
Though
to
love
you
and
to
have
your
love
is
all
the
world
to
me
,
 
though
it
makes
all
the
difference
between
misery
and
happiness
,
 
I
would
sooner
give
up
that
than
be
a
clog
on
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Phineas
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
do
love
you
so
entirely
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
one
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
your
own
one
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
had
known
it
always
!
<EOS>
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
Now
you
are
my
own
,
 
are
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
yes
,
dearest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
victorious
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
are
you
two
doing
here
these
two
hours
together
?
<EOS>
"
said
Barbara
,
bursting
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
we
doing
?
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
what
are
you
doing
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
in
particular
,
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
at
all
in
particular
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
this
,
 
that
we
have
engaged
ourselves
to
marry
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
a
trifle
,
 
is
it
not
,
Mary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Barbara
!
"
said
the
joyful
girl
,
springing
forward
into
her
friend
's
arms
;
"
I
do
believe
I
am
the
happiest
creature
on
the
face
of
this
earth
!
"
   
<EOS>
Job
's
Comforters
 
<EOS>
Before
Phineas
had
returned
to
London
his
engagement
with
Mary
Flood
Jones
was
known
to
all
his
family
,
was
known
to
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
,
and
was
indeed
known
generally
to
all
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
That
other
secret
of
his
,
which
had
reference
to
the
probability
of
his
being
obliged
to
throw
up
his
office
,
was
known
only
to
Mary
herself
.
<EOS>
He
thought
that
he
had
done
all
that
honour
required
of
him
in
telling
her
of
his
position
before
he
had
proposed
;
 
so
that
she
might
on
that
ground
refuse
him
if
she
were
so
minded
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
had
known
very
well
that
such
prudence
on
her
part
was
not
to
be
expected
.
<EOS>
If
she
loved
him
,
of
course
she
would
say
so
when
she
was
asked
.
<EOS>
And
he
had
known
that
she
loved
him
.
<EOS>
"
There
may
be
delay
,
Mary
,
"
he
said
to
her
as
he
was
going
;
"
nay
,
there
must
be
delay
,
if
I
am
obliged
to
resign
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
care
a
straw
for
delay
if
you
will
be
true
to
me
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
doubt
my
truth
,
dearest
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
will
swear
by
it
as
the
one
thing
that
is
truest
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
dearest
.
<EOS>
And
if
this
should
come
to
pass
I
must
go
to
work
and
put
my
shoulder
to
the
wheel
,
and
earn
an
income
for
you
by
my
old
profession
before
I
can
make
you
my
wife
.
<EOS>
With
such
a
motive
before
me
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
shall
earn
an
income
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
thus
they
parted
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
though
of
course
she
would
have
preferred
that
her
future
husband
should
remain
in
his
high
office
,
that
he
should
be
a
member
of
Parliament
and
an
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
,
admitted
no
doubt
into
her
mind
to
disturb
her
happiness
;
and
Phineas
,
though
he
had
many
misgivings
as
to
the
prudence
of
what
he
had
done
,
was
not
the
less
strong
in
his
resolution
of
constancy
and
endurance
.
<EOS>
He
would
throw
up
his
position
,
resign
his
seat
,
and
go
to
work
at
the
Bar
instantly
,
if
he
found
that
his
independence
as
a
man
required
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
And
,
above
all
,
let
come
what
might
,
he
would
be
true
to
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
December
was
half
over
before
he
saw
Lord
Cantrip
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
 
yes
;
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
,
when
the
Under
-
Secretary
began
to
tell
his
story
;
"
I
saw
what
you
were
about
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
been
at
your
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
the
country
as
I
know
it
,
you
would
be
as
eager
about
it
as
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
can
only
say
that
I
am
very
glad
that
I
do
not
know
the
country
as
you
know
it
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
Finn
,
it
's
my
idea
<EOS>
that
if
a
man
wants
to
make
himself
useful
he
should
stick
to
some
special
kind
of
work
.
<EOS>
With
you
it
's
a
thousand
pities
that
you
should
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
,
then
,
I
ought
to
resign
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
anything
about
that
.
<EOS>
As
you
wish
it
,
of
course
I
'll
speak
to
Gresham
.
<EOS>
Monk
,
I
believe
,
has
resigned
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
written
to
me
,
and
told
me
so
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
felt
afraid
of
him
for
your
sake
,
Finn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
is
a
clever
man
,
and
as
honest
a
man
as
any
in
the
House
,
but
I
always
thought
that
he
was
a
dangerous
friend
for
you
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
will
see
.
<EOS>
I
will
speak
to
Gresham
after
Christmas
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
hurry
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
Parliament
met
the
first
great
subject
of
interest
was
the
desertion
of
Mr.
Monk
from
the
Ministry
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
took
his
place
below
the
gangway
,
sitting
as
it
happened
exactly
in
front
of
Mr.
Turnbull
,
and
there
he
made
his
explanation
.
<EOS>
Some
one
opposite
asked
a
question
whether
a
certain
right
honourable
gentleman
had
not
left
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Gresham
replied
that
to
his
infinite
regret
his
right
honourable
friend
,
who
lately
presided
at
the
Board
of
Trade
,
had
resigned
;
and
he
went
on
to
explain
that
this
resignation
had
,
according
to
his
ideas
,
been
quite
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
His
right
honourable
friend
entertained
certain
ideas
about
Irish
tenant
-
right
,
as
to
which
he
himself
and
his
right
honourable
friend
the
Secretary
for
Ireland
could
not
exactly
pledge
themselves
to
be
in
unison
with
him
;
but
he
had
thought
that
the
motion
might
have
rested
at
any
rate
over
this
session
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Monk
explained
,
making
his
first
great
speech
on
Irish
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
He
found
himself
obliged
to
advocate
some
immediate
measure
for
giving
security
to
the
Irish
farmer
;
and
as
he
could
not
do
so
as
a
member
of
the
Cabinet
,
he
was
forced
to
resign
the
honour
of
that
position
.
<EOS>
He
said
something
also
as
to
the
great
doubt
which
had
ever
weighed
on
his
own
mind
as
to
the
inexpediency
of
a
man
at
his
time
of
life
submitting
himself
for
the
first
time
to
the
trammels
of
office
.
<EOS>
This
called
up
Mr.
Turnbull
,
who
took
the
opportunity
of
saying
that
he
now
agreed
cordially
with
his
old
friend
for
the
first
time
since
that
old
friend
had
listened
to
the
blandishments
of
the
ministerial
seducer
,
and
that
he
welcomed
his
old
friend
back
to
those
independent
benches
with
great
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
the
debate
was
very
exciting
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
said
which
made
it
then
necessary
for
Phineas
to
get
upon
his
legs
or
to
declare
himself
;
but
he
perceived
that
the
time
would
rapidly
come
in
which
he
must
do
so
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
,
though
he
strove
to
speak
with
gentle
words
,
was
evidently
very
angry
with
the
late
President
of
the
Board
of
Trade
;
and
,
moreover
,
it
was
quite
clear
that
a
bill
would
be
introduced
by
Mr.
Monk
himself
,
which
Mr.
Gresham
was
determined
to
oppose
.
<EOS>
If
all
this
came
to
pass
and
there
should
be
a
close
division
,
Phineas
felt
that
his
fate
would
be
sealed
.
<EOS>
When
he
again
spoke
to
Lord
Cantrip
on
the
subject
,
the
Secretary
of
State
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
advise
you
,
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
,
"
to
forget
all
that
took
place
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
do
so
,
nobody
else
will
remember
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
As
if
it
were
possible
to
forget
such
things
,
"
he
said
in
the
letter
which
he
wrote
to
Mary
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
shall
go
now
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
not
for
your
sake
,
I
should
not
in
the
least
regret
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
with
Madame
Goesler
frequently
in
the
winter
,
and
had
discussed
with
her
so
often
the
question
of
his
official
position
that
she
had
declared
that
she
was
coming
at
last
to
understand
the
mysteries
of
an
English
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
quite
right
,
my
friend
,
"
she
said
,
 
"
quite
right
.
<EOS>
What
 
you
are
to
be
in
Parliament
and
say
that
this
black
thing
is
white
,
or
that
this
white
thing
is
black
,
because
you
like
to
take
your
salary
!
<EOS>
That
can
not
be
honest
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
when
he
came
to
talk
to
her
of
money
,
 
that
he
must
give
up
Parliament
itself
,
if
he
gave
up
his
place
,
 
she
offered
to
lend
him
money
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
not
treat
me
as
a
friend
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
When
he
pointed
out
to
her
that
there
would
never
come
a
time
in
which
he
could
pay
such
money
back
,
she
stamped
her
foot
and
told
him
that
he
had
better
leave
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
high
principle
,
"
she
said
,
"
but
not
principle
sufficiently
high
to
understand
that
this
thing
could
be
done
between
you
and
me
without
disgrace
to
either
of
us
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
assured
her
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
such
an
arrangement
was
impossible
without
disgrace
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
whispered
to
this
new
friend
no
word
of
the
engagement
with
his
dear
Irish
Mary
.
<EOS>
His
Irish
life
,
he
would
tell
himself
,
was
a
thing
quite
apart
and
separate
from
his
life
in
England
.
<EOS>
He
said
not
a
word
about
Mary
Flood
Jones
to
any
of
those
with
whom
he
lived
in
London
.
<EOS>
Why
should
he
,
feeling
as
he
did
that
it
would
so
soon
be
necessary
that
he
should
disappear
from
among
them
?
<EOS>
About
Miss
Effingham
he
had
said
much
to
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
She
had
asked
him
whether
he
had
abandoned
all
hope
.
<EOS>
"
That
affair
,
then
,
is
over
?
"
she
had
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
it
is
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
will
marry
the
red
-
headed
,
violent
lord
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
will
.
<EOS>
But
she
is
exactly
the
girl
to
remain
unmarried
if
she
takes
it
into
her
head
that
the
man
she
likes
is
in
any
way
unfitted
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
she
love
this
lord
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
;
 
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
.
"
<EOS>
And
Phineas
,
as
he
made
this
acknowledgment
,
seemed
to
do
so
without
much
inward
agony
of
soul
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
been
last
in
London
he
could
not
speak
of
Violet
and
Lord
Chiltern
together
without
showing
that
his
misery
was
almost
too
much
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
time
he
received
some
counsel
from
two
friends
.
<EOS>
One
was
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
and
the
other
was
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
Laurence
had
always
been
true
to
him
after
a
fashion
,
and
had
never
resented
his
intrusion
at
the
Colonial
Office
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
,
me
boy
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
all
this
is
thrue
,
you
're
about
up
a
tree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
that
I
shall
support
Monk
's
motion
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
me
boy
,
you
're
up
a
tree
as
far
as
office
goes
.
<EOS>
A
place
like
that
niver
suited
me
,
because
,
you
see
,
that
poker
of
a
young
lord
expected
so
much
of
a
man
;
but
you
do
n't
mind
that
kind
of
thing
,
and
I
thought
you
were
as
snug
as
snug
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Troubles
will
come
,
you
see
,
Laurence
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Bedad
,
yes
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
throubles
,
I
think
,
sometimes
.
<EOS>
But
you
've
a
way
out
of
all
your
throubles
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
What
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pop
the
question
to
Madame
Max
.
<EOS>
The
money
's
all
thrue
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
doubt
the
money
in
the
least
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
's
my
belief
<EOS>
she
'll
take
you
without
a
second
word
.
<EOS>
Anyways
,
thry
it
,
Phinny
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
That
's
my
advice
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
so
far
agreed
with
his
friend
Laurence
that
he
thought
it
possible
that
Madame
Goesler
might
accept
him
were
he
to
propose
marriage
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
knew
,
of
course
,
that
that
mode
of
escape
from
his
difficulties
was
out
of
the
question
for
him
,
but
he
could
not
explain
this
to
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
you
have
taken
up
a
bad
cause
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
;
 
is
it
not
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
worst
of
it
is
that
you
'll
sacrifice
yourself
and
do
no
good
to
the
cause
.
<EOS>
I
never
knew
a
man
break
away
in
this
fashion
,
and
not
feel
afterwards
that
he
had
done
it
all
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
is
a
man
to
do
,
Barrington
?
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
smother
his
convictions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Convictions
!
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
on
earth
that
I
'm
so
much
afraid
of
in
a
young
member
of
Parliament
as
convictions
.
<EOS>
There
are
ever
so
many
rocks
against
which
men
get
broken
.
<EOS>
One
man
ca
n't
keep
his
temper
.
<EOS>
Another
ca
n't
hold
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
A
third
ca
n't
say
a
word
unless
he
has
been
priming
himself
half
a
session
.
<EOS>
A
fourth
is
always
thinking
of
himself
,
and
wanting
more
than
he
can
get
.
<EOS>
A
fifth
is
idle
,
and
wo
n't
be
there
when
he
's
wanted
.
<EOS>
A
sixth
is
always
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
A
seventh
lies
so
that
you
never
can
trust
him
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
to
do
with
them
all
,
but
a
fellow
with
convictions
is
the
worst
of
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
how
a
fellow
is
to
help
himself
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
When
a
fellow
begins
to
meddle
with
politics
they
will
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
ca
n't
you
grow
into
them
gradually
as
your
betters
and
elders
have
done
before
you
?
<EOS>
It
ought
to
be
enough
for
any
man
,
when
he
begins
,
to
know
that
he
's
a
Liberal
.
<EOS>
He
understands
which
side
of
the
House
<EOS>
he
's
to
vote
,
and
who
is
to
lead
him
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
meaning
of
having
a
leader
to
a
party
,
if
it
's
not
that
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
you
and
Mr.
Monk
can
go
and
make
a
government
between
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
I
think
,
I
'm
sure
he
does
n't
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
so
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
But
look
here
,
Phineas
,
I
do
n't
care
two
straws
about
Monk
's
going
.
<EOS>
I
always
thought
that
Mildmay
and
the
Duke
were
wrong
when
they
asked
him
to
join
.
<EOS>
I
knew
he
'd
go
over
the
traces
,
 
unless
,
indeed
,
he
took
his
money
and
did
nothing
for
it
,
which
is
the
way
with
some
of
those
Radicals
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
him
as
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
devil
go
along
with
him
,
as
you
say
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
be
such
a
fool
as
to
ruin
yourself
for
a
crotchet
of
Monk
's
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
too
late
yet
for
you
to
hold
back
.
<EOS>
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
Gresham
has
said
a
word
to
me
about
it
already
.
<EOS>
He
is
most
anxious
that
you
should
stay
,
but
of
course
you
ca
n't
stay
and
vote
against
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
look
upon
you
,
you
know
,
as
in
some
sort
my
own
child
.
<EOS>
I
've
tried
to
bring
other
fellows
forward
who
seemed
to
have
something
in
them
,
but
I
have
never
succeeded
as
I
have
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
've
hit
the
thing
off
,
and
have
got
the
ball
at
your
foot
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
in
the
whole
course
of
my
experience
I
have
never
known
such
good
fortune
as
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
shall
always
remember
how
it
began
,
Barrington
,
"
said
Phineas
,
who
was
greatly
moved
by
the
energy
and
solicitude
of
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
for
God
's
sake
,
do
n't
go
and
destroy
it
all
by
such
mad
perversity
as
this
.
<EOS>
They
mean
to
do
something
next
session
.
<EOS>
Morrison
is
going
to
take
it
up
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
Morrison
was
at
this
time
Secretary
for
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
But
of
course
we
ca
n't
let
a
fellow
like
Monk
take
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
just
when
he
pleases
.
<EOS>
I
call
it
d
 
d
treachery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Monk
is
no
traitor
,
Barrington
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Men
will
have
their
own
opinions
about
that
.
<EOS>
It
's
generally
understood
that
when
a
man
is
asked
to
take
a
seat
in
the
Cabinet
he
is
expected
to
conform
with
his
colleagues
,
unless
something
very
special
turns
up
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
speaking
of
you
now
,
and
not
of
Monk
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
a
man
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
afford
to
make
ducks
and
drakes
.
<EOS>
You
are
excellently
placed
,
and
you
have
plenty
of
time
to
hark
back
,
if
you
'll
only
listen
to
reason
.
<EOS>
All
that
Irish
stump
balderdash
will
never
be
thrown
in
your
teeth
by
us
,
if
you
will
just
go
on
as
though
it
had
never
been
uttered
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
could
only
thank
his
friend
for
his
advice
,
which
was
at
least
disinterested
,
and
was
good
of
its
kind
,
and
tell
him
that
he
would
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
think
of
it
very
much
.
<EOS>
He
almost
thought
that
,
were
it
to
do
again
,
he
would
allow
Mr.
Monk
to
go
upon
his
tour
alone
,
and
keep
himself
from
the
utterance
of
anything
that
so
good
a
judge
as
Erle
could
call
stump
balderdash
.
<EOS>
As
he
sat
in
his
arm
-
chair
in
his
room
at
the
Colonial
Office
,
with
despatch
-
boxes
around
him
,
and
official
papers
spread
before
him
,
 
feeling
himself
to
be
one
of
those
who
in
truth
managed
and
governed
the
affairs
of
this
great
nation
,
feeling
also
that
if
he
relinquished
his
post
now
he
could
never
regain
it
,
 
he
did
wish
that
he
had
been
a
little
less
in
love
with
independence
,
a
little
quieter
in
his
boastings
that
no
official
considerations
should
ever
silence
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
was
too
late
now
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
his
skin
was
not
thick
enough
to
bear
the
arrows
of
those
archers
who
would
bend
their
bows
against
him
if
he
should
now
dare
to
vote
against
Mr.
Monk
's
motion
.
<EOS>
His
own
party
might
be
willing
to
forgive
and
forget
;
but
there
would
be
others
who
would
read
those
reports
,
and
would
appear
in
the
House
with
the
odious
tell
-
tale
newspapers
in
their
hands
.
  
<EOS>
Then
he
received
a
letter
from
his
father
.
<EOS>
Some
good
-
natured
person
had
enlightened
the
doctor
as
to
the
danger
in
which
his
son
was
placing
himself
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Finn
,
who
in
his
own
profession
was
a
very
excellent
and
well
-
instructed
man
,
had
been
so
ignorant
of
Parliamentary
tactics
,
as
to
have
been
proud
at
his
son
's
success
at
the
Irish
meetings
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
that
Phineas
was
carrying
on
his
trade
as
a
public
speaker
with
proper
energy
and
continued
success
.
<EOS>
He
had
cared
nothing
himself
for
tenant
-
right
,
and
had
acknowledged
to
Mr.
Monk
that
he
could
not
understand
in
what
it
was
that
the
farmers
were
wronged
.
<EOS>
But
he
knew
that
Mr.
Monk
was
a
Cabinet
Minister
,
and
he
thought
that
Phineas
was
earning
his
salary
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
some
one
who
undeceived
him
,
and
the
paternal
bosom
of
the
doctor
was
dismayed
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
interfere
,
"
he
said
in
his
letter
,
"
but
I
can
hardly
believe
that
you
really
intend
to
resign
your
place
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
am
told
that
you
must
do
so
if
you
go
on
with
this
matter
.
<EOS>
My
dear
boy
,
pray
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
imagine
you
are
disposed
to
lose
all
that
you
have
won
for
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
also
wrote
to
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
had
been
talking
to
her
,
and
Mary
had
taught
herself
to
believe
that
after
the
many
sweet
conversations
she
had
had
with
a
man
so
high
in
office
as
Phineas
,
she
really
did
understand
something
about
the
British
Government
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Finn
had
interrogated
Mary
,
and
Mary
had
been
obliged
to
own
that
it
was
quite
possible
that
Phineas
would
be
called
upon
to
resign
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
why
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
Resign
two
thousand
a
year
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
he
may
maintain
his
independence
,
"
said
Mary
proudly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fiddlestick
!
"
said
Mrs.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
How
is
he
to
maintain
you
,
or
himself
either
,
if
he
goes
on
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
did
n't
get
himself
all
wrong
,
even
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Finn
began
to
cry
;
and
Mary
could
only
write
to
her
lover
,
pointing
out
to
him
how
very
anxious
all
his
friends
were
that
he
should
do
nothing
in
a
hurry
.
<EOS>
But
what
if
the
thing
were
done
already
!
<EOS>
Phineas
in
his
great
discomfort
went
to
seek
further
counsel
from
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Of
all
his
counsellors
,
Madame
Goesler
was
the
only
one
who
applauded
him
for
what
he
was
about
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
after
all
,
what
is
it
you
give
up
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
may
be
out
to
-
morrow
,
and
then
where
will
be
your
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
does
not
seem
to
be
much
chance
of
that
at
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
can
tell
?
<EOS>
Of
course
I
do
not
understand
,
 
but
it
was
only
the
other
day
when
Mr.
Mildmay
was
there
,
and
only
the
day
before
that
when
Lord
de
Terrier
was
there
,
and
again
only
the
day
before
that
when
Lord
Brock
was
there
.
"
<EOS>
Phineas
endeavoured
to
make
her
understand
that
of
the
four
Prime
Ministers
whom
she
had
named
,
three
were
men
of
the
same
party
as
himself
,
under
whom
it
would
have
suited
him
to
serve
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
serve
under
any
man
if
I
were
an
English
gentleman
in
Parliament
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
a
poor
fellow
to
do
?
"
said
Phineas
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
poor
fellow
need
not
be
a
poor
fellow
unless
he
likes
,
"
said
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
this
Phineas
left
her
,
and
as
he
went
along
the
street
he
began
to
question
himself
whether
the
prospects
of
his
own
darling
Mary
were
at
all
endangered
by
his
visits
to
Park
Lane
;
and
to
reflect
what
sort
of
a
blackguard
he
would
be
,
 
a
blackguard
of
how
deep
a
dye
,
 
were
he
to
desert
Mary
and
marry
Madame
Max
Goesler
.
<EOS>
Then
he
also
asked
himself
as
to
the
nature
and
quality
of
his
own
political
honesty
if
he
were
to
abandon
Mary
in
order
that
he
might
maintain
his
parliamentary
independence
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
if
it
should
ever
come
to
pass
that
his
biography
should
be
written
,
his
biographer
would
say
very
much
more
about
the
manner
in
which
he
kept
his
seat
in
Parliament
than
of
the
manner
in
which
he
kept
his
engagement
with
Miss
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
people
who
knew
him
and
her
might
think
ill
of
him
for
his
conduct
to
Mary
,
but
the
world
would
not
condemn
him
!
<EOS>
And
when
he
thundered
forth
his
liberal
eloquence
from
below
the
gangway
as
an
independent
member
,
having
the
fortune
of
his
charming
wife
to
back
him
,
giving
excellent
dinners
at
the
same
time
in
Park
Lane
,
would
not
the
world
praise
him
very
loudly
?
  
<EOS>
When
he
got
to
his
office
he
found
a
note
from
Lord
Brentford
inviting
him
to
dine
in
Portman
Square
.
   
<EOS>
The
Joint
Attack
 
<EOS>
The
note
from
Lord
Brentford
surprised
our
hero
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
no
communication
with
the
Earl
since
the
day
on
which
he
had
been
so
savagely
scolded
about
the
duel
,
when
the
Earl
had
plainly
told
him
that
his
conduct
had
been
as
bad
as
it
could
be
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
not
on
that
account
become
at
all
ashamed
of
his
conduct
in
reference
to
the
duel
,
but
he
had
conceived
that
any
reconciliation
between
him
and
the
Earl
had
been
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Now
there
had
come
a
civilly
-
worded
invitation
,
asking
him
to
dine
with
the
offended
nobleman
.
<EOS>
The
note
had
been
written
by
Lady
Laura
,
but
it
had
purported
to
come
from
Lord
Brentford
himself
.
<EOS>
He
sent
back
word
to
say
that
he
should
be
happy
to
have
the
honour
of
dining
with
Lord
Brentford
.
  
<EOS>
Parliament
at
this
time
had
been
sitting
nearly
a
month
,
and
it
was
already
March
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
heard
nothing
of
Lady
Laura
,
and
did
not
even
know
that
she
was
in
London
till
he
saw
her
handwriting
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
that
she
had
not
gone
back
to
her
husband
,
and
that
she
had
remained
with
her
father
all
the
winter
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
He
had
also
heard
that
Lord
Chiltern
had
been
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
had
been
talking
of
the
separation
of
Mr.
Kennedy
from
his
wife
,
one
half
of
the
world
declaring
that
his
wife
,
if
not
absolutely
false
to
him
,
had
neglected
all
her
duties
;
and
the
other
half
asserting
that
Mr.
Kennedy
's
treatment
of
his
wife
had
been
so
bad
that
no
woman
could
possibly
have
lived
with
him
.
<EOS>
There
had
even
been
a
rumour
that
Lady
Laura
had
gone
off
with
a
lover
from
the
Duke
of
Omnium
's
garden
party
,
and
some
indiscreet
tongue
had
hinted
that
a
certain
unmarried
Under
-
Secretary
of
State
was
missing
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Chiltern
upon
this
had
shown
his
teeth
with
so
strong
a
propensity
to
do
some
real
biting
,
that
no
one
had
ventured
to
repeat
that
rumour
.
<EOS>
Its
untruth
was
soon
established
by
the
fact
that
Lady
Laura
Kennedy
was
living
with
her
father
at
Saulsby
.
<EOS>
Of
Mr.
Kennedy
,
Phineas
had
as
yet
seen
nothing
since
he
had
been
up
in
town
.
<EOS>
That
gentleman
,
though
a
member
of
the
Cabinet
,
had
not
been
in
London
at
the
opening
of
the
session
,
nor
had
he
attended
the
Cabinet
meetings
during
the
recess
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
stated
in
the
newspapers
that
he
was
ill
,
and
stated
in
private
that
he
could
not
bear
to
show
himself
since
his
wife
had
left
him
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
he
came
to
London
,
and
Phineas
saw
him
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
Then
,
when
the
first
meeting
of
the
Cabinet
was
summoned
after
his
return
,
it
became
known
that
he
also
had
resigned
his
office
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
said
about
his
resignation
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
He
had
resigned
on
the
score
of
ill
-
health
,
and
that
very
worthy
peer
,
Lord
Mount
Thistle
,
formerly
Sir
Marmaduke
Morecombe
,
came
back
to
the
Duchy
of
Lancaster
in
his
place
.
<EOS>
A
Prime
Minister
sometimes
finds
great
relief
in
the
possession
of
a
serviceable
stick
who
can
be
made
to
go
in
and
out
as
occasion
may
require
;
only
it
generally
happens
that
the
stick
will
expect
some
reward
when
he
is
made
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
Lord
Mount
Thistle
immediately
saw
his
way
to
a
viscount
's
coronet
,
when
he
was
once
more
summoned
to
the
august
councils
of
the
Ministers
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
this
had
been
arranged
,
in
the
interval
between
Lord
Brentford
's
invitation
and
Lord
Brentford
's
dinner
,
Phineas
encountered
Mr.
Kennedy
so
closely
in
one
of
the
passages
of
the
House
that
it
was
impossible
that
they
should
not
speak
to
each
other
,
unless
they
were
to
avoid
each
other
as
people
do
who
have
palpably
quarrelled
.
<EOS>
Phineas
saw
that
Mr.
Kennedy
was
hesitating
,
and
therefore
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
.
<EOS>
He
greeted
his
former
friend
in
a
friendly
fashion
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
,
and
then
prepared
to
pass
on
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Kennedy
,
though
he
had
hesitated
at
first
,
now
detained
his
brother
member
.
<EOS>
"
Finn
,
"
he
said
,
"
if
you
are
not
engaged
I
should
like
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
was
not
engaged
,
and
allowed
himself
to
be
led
out
arm
-
in
-
arm
by
the
late
Chancellor
of
the
Duchy
into
Westminster
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
know
what
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
to
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
have
heard
of
it
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
has
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
That
is
one
of
the
terrible
cruelties
of
such
a
blow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
those
things
are
very
bad
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
grieved
,
 
because
you
have
both
been
intimate
friends
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
 
yes
;
we
were
.
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
see
her
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
since
last
July
,
 
at
the
Duke
's
party
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
the
morning
of
that
day
was
the
last
on
which
I
spoke
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
she
left
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
dine
with
Lord
Brentford
to
-
morrow
,
and
I
dare
say
she
will
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
she
is
in
town
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
yesterday
in
her
father
's
carriage
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
she
had
no
cause
to
leave
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
can
not
say
anything
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
had
no
cause
to
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
as
he
heard
this
could
not
but
remember
all
that
Lady
Laura
had
told
himself
,
and
thought
that
no
woman
had
ever
had
a
better
reason
for
leaving
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
There
were
things
I
did
not
like
,
and
I
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
is
generally
the
way
,
"
replied
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
a
wife
should
listen
to
a
word
of
caution
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
they
never
like
it
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
are
we
all
of
us
to
have
all
that
we
like
?
<EOS>
I
have
not
found
it
so
.
<EOS>
Or
would
it
be
good
for
us
if
we
had
?
<EOS>
"
Then
he
paused
;
but
as
Phineas
had
no
further
remark
to
make
,
he
continued
speaking
after
they
had
walked
about
a
third
of
the
length
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
of
my
own
comfort
I
am
thinking
now
so
much
as
of
her
name
and
her
future
conduct
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
will
in
every
sense
be
best
for
her
that
she
should
come
back
to
her
husband
's
roof
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
yes
;
 
perhaps
it
would
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
she
not
accepted
that
lot
for
better
or
for
worse
?
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
solemnly
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
incompatibility
of
temper
,
you
know
,
is
always
,
 
always
supposed
 
.
<EOS>
You
understand
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
intention
that
she
should
come
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wish
to
make
any
legal
demand
;
 
at
any
rate
,
not
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Will
you
consent
to
be
the
bearer
of
a
message
from
me
both
to
herself
and
to
the
Earl
?
"
  
<EOS>
Now
it
seemed
to
Phineas
that
of
all
the
messengers
whom
Mr.
Kennedy
could
have
chosen
<EOS>
he
was
the
most
unsuited
to
be
a
Mercury
in
this
cause
,
 
not
perceiving
that
he
had
been
so
selected
with
some
craft
,
in
order
that
Lady
Laura
might
understand
that
the
accusation
against
her
was
,
at
any
rate
,
withdrawn
,
which
had
named
Phineas
as
her
lover
.
<EOS>
He
paused
again
before
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
should
be
most
willing
to
be
of
service
,
if
it
were
possible
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
see
how
I
can
speak
to
the
Earl
about
it
.
<EOS>
Though
I
am
going
to
dine
with
him
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
he
has
asked
me
;
 
for
he
and
I
are
on
very
bad
terms
.
<EOS>
He
heard
that
stupid
story
about
the
duel
,
and
has
not
spoken
to
me
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
heard
that
,
too
,
"
said
Mr.
Kennedy
,
frowning
blackly
as
he
remembered
his
wife
's
duplicity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
has
made
such
a
difference
between
him
and
me
,
that
I
do
n't
think
I
can
meddle
.
<EOS>
Send
for
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
to
Chiltern
!
<EOS>
Never
!
<EOS>
He
would
probably
strike
me
on
the
head
with
his
club
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Call
on
the
Earl
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
and
he
would
not
see
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Write
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
and
he
sent
back
my
letter
unopened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Write
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
;
 
and
she
answered
me
,
saying
only
thus
;
"
Indeed
,
indeed
,
it
can
not
be
so
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
must
be
so
.
<EOS>
The
laws
of
God
require
it
,
and
the
laws
of
man
permit
it
.
<EOS>
I
want
some
one
to
point
out
that
to
them
more
softly
than
I
could
do
if
I
were
simply
to
write
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
To
the
Earl
,
of
course
,
I
can
not
write
again
.
<EOS>
"
The
conference
ended
by
a
promise
from
Phineas
that
he
would
,
if
possible
,
say
a
word
to
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
was
shown
into
Lord
Brentford
's
drawing
-
room
he
found
not
only
Lady
Laura
there
,
but
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
was
not
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
was
there
,
and
so
also
were
Lord
and
Lady
Cantrip
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
not
your
father
going
to
be
here
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
Lady
Laura
,
after
their
first
greeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
live
in
that
hope
,
"
said
she
,
"
and
do
not
at
all
know
why
he
should
be
late
.
<EOS>
What
has
become
of
him
,
Oswald
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
came
in
with
me
half
an
hour
ago
,
and
I
suppose
he
does
not
dress
as
quickly
as
I
do
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
;
upon
which
Phineas
immediately
understood
that
the
father
and
the
son
were
reconciled
,
and
he
rushed
to
the
conclusion
that
Violet
and
her
lover
would
also
soon
be
reconciled
,
if
such
were
not
already
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
felt
some
remnant
of
a
soreness
that
it
should
be
so
,
as
a
man
feels
where
his
headache
has
been
when
the
real
ache
itself
has
left
him
.
<EOS>
Then
the
host
came
in
and
made
his
apologies
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Chiltern
kept
me
standing
about
,
"
he
said
,
"
till
the
east
wind
had
chilled
me
through
and
through
.
<EOS>
The
only
charm
I
recognise
in
youth
is
that
it
is
impervious
to
the
east
wind
.
"
<EOS>
Phineas
felt
quite
sure
now
that
Violet
and
her
lover
were
reconciled
,
and
he
had
a
distinct
feeling
of
the
place
where
the
ache
had
been
.
<EOS>
Dear
Violet
!
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
Violet
lacked
that
sweet
,
clinging
,
feminine
softness
which
made
Mary
Flood
Jones
so
pre
-
eminently
the
most
charming
of
her
sex
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
when
he
had
repeated
his
general
apology
,
especially
to
Lady
Cantrip
,
who
was
the
only
lady
present
except
his
daughter
,
came
up
to
our
hero
and
shook
him
kindly
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
He
took
him
up
to
one
of
the
windows
and
then
addressed
him
in
a
voice
of
mock
solemnity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stick
to
the
colonies
,
young
man
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
never
meddle
with
foreign
affairs
;
 
especially
not
at
Blankenberg
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
again
,
my
Lord
;
 
never
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
leave
all
questions
of
fire
-
arms
to
be
arranged
between
the
Horse
Guards
and
the
War
Office
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
a
good
deal
about
it
since
I
saw
you
,
and
I
retract
a
part
of
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
But
a
duel
is
a
foolish
thing
,
 
a
very
foolish
thing
.
<EOS>
Come
;
 
here
is
dinner
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
Earl
walked
off
with
Lady
Cantrip
,
and
Lord
Cantrip
walked
off
with
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
followed
,
and
Phineas
had
an
opportunity
of
saying
a
word
to
his
friend
,
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
they
went
down
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
right
between
you
and
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
after
a
fashion
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
knowing
how
long
it
will
last
.
<EOS>
He
wants
me
to
do
three
things
,
and
I
wo
n't
do
any
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
the
three
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
go
into
Parliament
,
to
be
an
owner
of
sheep
and
oxen
,
and
to
hunt
in
his
own
county
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
attend
the
first
,
I
should
ruin
myself
with
the
second
,
and
I
should
never
get
a
run
in
the
third
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
was
not
a
word
said
about
his
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
only
seven
who
sat
down
to
dinner
,
and
the
six
were
all
people
with
whom
Phineas
was
or
had
been
on
most
intimate
terms
.
<EOS>
Lord
Cantrip
was
his
official
chief
,
and
,
since
that
connection
had
existed
between
them
,
Lady
Cantrip
had
been
very
gracious
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
quite
understood
the
comfort
which
it
was
to
her
husband
to
have
under
him
,
as
his
representative
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
a
man
whom
he
could
thoroughly
trust
and
like
,
and
therefore
she
had
used
her
woman
's
arts
to
bind
Phineas
to
her
lord
in
more
than
mere
official
bondage
.
<EOS>
She
had
tried
her
skill
also
upon
Laurence
Fitzgibbon
,
 
but
altogether
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
had
eaten
her
dinners
and
accepted
her
courtesies
,
and
had
given
for
them
no
return
whatever
.
<EOS>
But
Phineas
had
possessed
a
more
grateful
mind
,
and
had
done
all
that
had
been
required
of
him
;
 
had
done
all
that
had
been
required
of
him
till
there
had
come
that
terrible
absurdity
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
very
well
what
sort
of
things
would
happen
when
they
brought
such
a
man
as
Mr.
Monk
into
the
Cabinet
,
"
Lady
Cantrip
had
said
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
the
party
was
very
small
,
and
though
the
guests
were
all
his
intimate
friends
,
Phineas
suspected
nothing
special
till
an
attack
was
made
upon
him
as
soon
as
the
servants
had
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
This
was
done
in
the
presence
of
the
two
ladies
,
and
,
no
doubt
,
had
been
preconcerted
.
<EOS>
There
was
Lord
Cantrip
there
,
who
had
already
said
much
to
him
,
and
Barrington
Erle
who
had
said
more
even
than
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
,
himself
a
member
of
the
Cabinet
,
opened
the
attack
by
asking
whether
it
was
actually
true
that
Mr.
Monk
meant
to
go
on
with
his
motion
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
asserted
that
Mr.
Monk
positively
would
do
so
.
"
<EOS>
And
Gresham
will
oppose
it
?
"
asked
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
he
will
,
"
said
Barrington
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
will
,
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
I
should
think
of
him
if
he
did
not
,
"
said
Lady
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
be
forced
into
a
thing
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
knew
pretty
well
what
was
coming
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
began
again
by
asking
how
many
supporters
Mr.
Monk
would
have
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
"
That
depends
upon
the
amount
of
courage
which
the
Conservatives
may
have
,
"
said
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
"
If
they
dare
to
vote
for
a
thoroughly
democratic
measure
,
simply
for
the
sake
of
turning
us
out
,
it
is
quite
on
the
cards
that
they
may
succeed
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
of
our
own
people
?
"
asked
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
inquire
that
of
Phineas
Finn
,
"
said
Barrington
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
attack
was
made
.
  
<EOS>
Our
hero
had
a
bad
half
hour
of
it
,
though
many
words
were
said
which
must
have
gratified
him
much
.
<EOS>
They
all
wanted
to
keep
him
,
 
so
Lord
Cantrip
declared
,
"
except
one
or
two
whom
I
could
name
,
and
who
are
particularly
anxious
to
wear
his
shoes
,
"
said
Barrington
,
thinking
that
certain
reminiscences
of
Phineas
with
regard
to
Mr.
Bonteen
and
others
might
operate
as
strongly
as
any
other
consideration
to
make
him
love
his
place
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
declared
that
he
could
not
understand
it
,
 
that
he
should
find
himself
lost
in
amazement
if
such
a
man
as
his
young
friend
allowed
himself
to
be
led
into
the
outer
wilderness
by
such
an
ignis
-
fatuus
of
light
as
this
.
<EOS>
Lord
Cantrip
laid
down
the
unwritten
traditional
law
of
Government
officials
very
plainly
.
<EOS>
A
man
in
office
,
 
in
an
office
which
really
imposed
upon
him
as
much
work
as
he
could
possibly
do
with
credit
to
himself
or
his
cause
,
 
was
dispensed
from
the
necessity
of
a
conscience
with
reference
to
other
matters
.
<EOS>
It
was
for
Sir
Walter
Morrison
to
have
a
conscience
about
Irish
tenant
-
right
,
as
no
doubt
he
had
,
 
just
as
Phineas
Finn
had
a
conscience
about
Canada
,
and
Jamaica
,
and
the
Cape
.
<EOS>
Barrington
Erle
was
very
strong
about
parties
in
general
,
and
painted
the
comforts
of
official
position
in
glowing
colours
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
that
the
two
ladies
were
more
efficacious
than
even
their
male
relatives
in
the
arguments
which
they
used
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
so
happy
to
have
you
among
us
,
"
said
Lady
Cantrip
,
looking
at
him
with
beseeching
,
almost
loving
eyes
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
knows
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
that
since
he
first
came
into
Parliament
I
have
always
believed
in
his
success
,
and
I
have
been
very
proud
to
see
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
shall
weep
over
him
,
as
over
a
fallen
angel
,
if
he
leaves
us
,
"
said
Lady
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
say
that
I
will
weep
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
"
but
I
do
not
know
anything
of
the
kind
that
would
so
truly
make
me
unhappy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
was
he
to
say
in
answer
to
applications
so
flattering
and
so
pressing
?
<EOS>
He
would
have
said
nothing
,
had
that
been
possible
,
but
he
felt
himself
obliged
to
reply
.
<EOS>
He
replied
very
weakly
,
 
of
course
,
not
justifying
himself
,
but
declaring
that
as
he
had
gone
so
far
he
must
go
further
.
<EOS>
He
must
vote
for
the
measure
now
.
<EOS>
Both
his
chief
and
Barrington
Erle
proved
,
or
attempted
to
prove
,
that
he
was
wrong
in
this
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
would
not
speak
on
the
measure
,
and
his
vote
for
his
party
would
probably
be
allowed
to
pass
without
notice
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
newspapers
might
perhaps
attack
him
;
but
what
public
man
cared
for
such
attacks
as
those
?
<EOS>
His
whole
party
would
hang
by
him
,
and
in
that
he
would
find
ample
consolation
.
<EOS>
Phineas
could
only
say
that
he
would
think
of
it
;
 
and
this
he
said
in
so
irresolute
a
tone
of
voice
that
all
the
men
then
present
believed
that
he
was
gained
.
<EOS>
The
two
ladies
,
however
,
were
of
a
different
opinion
.
"
<EOS>
In
spite
of
anything
that
anybody
may
say
,
he
will
do
what
he
thinks
right
when
the
time
comes
,
"
said
Laura
to
her
father
afterwards
.
<EOS>
But
then
Lady
Laura
had
been
in
love
with
him
,
 
was
perhaps
almost
in
love
with
him
still
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
he
is
a
mule
,
"
said
Lady
Cantrip
to
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
good
mule
up
a
hill
with
a
load
on
his
back
,
"
said
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
with
a
mule
there
always
comes
a
time
when
you
ca
n't
manage
him
,
"
said
Lady
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Cantrip
had
never
been
in
love
with
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
found
a
moment
,
before
he
left
Lord
Brentford
's
house
,
to
say
a
word
to
Lady
Laura
as
to
the
commission
that
had
been
given
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
never
be
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
,
shuddering
;
 
"
<EOS>
never
,
never
,
never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
angry
with
me
for
speaking
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
 
not
if
he
told
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
made
me
promise
that
I
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
it
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
if
he
has
any
instruction
to
send
me
as
to
what
he
considers
to
be
my
duty
,
I
will
endeavour
to
comply
,
if
that
duty
can
be
done
apart
.
<EOS>
I
will
recognize
him
so
far
,
because
of
my
vow
.
<EOS>
But
not
even
for
the
sake
of
my
vow
,
will
I
endeavour
to
live
with
him
.
<EOS>
His
presence
would
kill
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
Phineas
repeated
this
,
or
as
much
of
this
as
he
judged
to
be
necessary
,
to
Mr.
Kennedy
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
that
gentleman
replied
that
in
such
case
he
would
have
no
alternative
but
to
seek
redress
at
law
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
nothing
to
my
wife
,
"
said
he
,
"
of
which
I
need
be
ashamed
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
sad
,
no
doubt
,
to
have
all
our
affairs
bandied
about
in
court
,
and
made
the
subject
of
comment
in
newspapers
,
but
a
man
must
go
through
that
,
or
worse
than
that
,
in
the
vindication
of
his
rights
,
and
for
the
performance
of
his
duty
to
his
Maker
.
<EOS>
"
That
very
day
Mr.
Kennedy
went
to
his
lawyer
,
and
desired
that
steps
might
be
taken
for
the
restitution
to
him
of
his
conjugal
rights
.
   
<EOS>
The
Temptress
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
's
bill
was
read
the
first
time
before
Easter
,
and
Phineas
Finn
still
held
his
office
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
to
the
Prime
Minister
once
on
the
subject
,
and
had
been
surprised
at
that
gentleman
's
courtesy
;
 
for
Mr.
Gresham
had
the
reputation
of
being
unconciliatory
in
his
manners
,
and
very
prone
to
resent
anything
like
desertion
from
that
allegiance
which
was
due
to
himself
as
the
leader
of
his
party
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
stay
where
you
are
and
take
no
step
that
may
be
irretrievable
,
till
you
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
have
made
up
my
mind
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
can
be
done
till
after
Easter
,
"
replied
the
great
man
,
"
and
there
is
no
knowing
how
things
may
go
then
.
<EOS>
I
strongly
recommend
you
to
stay
with
us
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
do
this
it
will
be
only
necessary
that
you
shall
put
your
resignation
in
Lord
Cantrip
's
hands
before
you
speak
or
vote
against
us
.
<EOS>
See
Monk
and
talk
it
over
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
possibly
imagined
that
Mr.
Monk
might
be
moved
to
abandon
his
bill
,
when
he
saw
what
injury
<EOS>
he
was
about
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
time
Phineas
received
the
following
letter
from
his
darling
Mary
:
    
Floodborough
,
Thursday
.
  
<EOS>
DEAREST
PHINEAS
,
  
<EOS>
We
have
just
got
home
from
Killaloe
,
and
mean
to
remain
here
all
through
the
summer
.
<EOS>
After
leaving
your
sisters
this
house
seems
so
desolate
;
but
I
shall
have
the
more
time
to
think
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
reading
Tennyson
,
as
you
told
me
,
and
I
fancy
that
I
could
in
truth
be
a
Mariana
here
,
if
it
were
not
that
I
am
so
quite
certain
that
you
will
come
;
 
and
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
in
a
moated
grange
.
<EOS>
Last
night
I
sat
at
the
window
and
tried
to
realise
what
I
should
feel
if
you
were
to
tell
me
that
you
did
not
want
me
;
and
I
got
myself
into
such
an
ecstatic
state
of
mock
melancholy
that
I
cried
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
But
when
one
has
such
a
real
living
joy
at
the
back
of
one
's
romantic
melancholy
,
tears
are
very
pleasant
;
  
they
water
and
do
not
burn
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
about
them
all
at
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
They
certainly
are
very
unhappy
at
the
idea
of
your
resigning
.
<EOS>
Your
father
says
very
little
,
but
I
made
him
own
that
to
act
as
you
are
acting
for
the
sake
of
principle
is
very
grand
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
leave
him
till
he
had
said
so
,
and
he
did
say
it
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mrs.
Finn
does
not
understand
it
as
well
,
but
she
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
complains
mostly
for
my
sake
,
and
when
I
tell
her
that
I
will
wait
twenty
years
if
it
is
necessary
,
she
tells
me
I
do
not
know
what
waiting
means
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
,
 
and
will
be
happy
,
and
will
never
really
think
myself
a
Mariana
.
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
,
<EOS>
dear
Phineas
,
indeed
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
The
girls
are
half
sad
and
half
proud
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
wholly
proud
,
and
know
that
you
are
doing
just
what
you
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
shall
think
more
of
you
as
a
man
who
might
have
been
a
Prime
Minister
than
if
you
were
really
sitting
in
the
Cabinet
like
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
As
for
mamma
,
I
can
not
make
her
quite
understand
it
.
<EOS>
She
merely
says
that
no
young
man
who
is
going
to
be
married
ought
to
resign
anything
.
<EOS>
Dear
mamma
;
 
sometimes
she
does
say
such
odd
things
.
  
<EOS>
You
told
me
to
tell
you
everything
,
and
so
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
talk
to
some
of
the
people
here
,
and
tell
them
what
they
might
do
if
they
had
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
One
old
fellow
,
Mike
Dufferty
,
 
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
remember
him
,
 
<EOS>
asked
if
he
would
have
to
pay
the
rent
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
When
I
said
certainly
he
would
,
then
he
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
But
as
you
said
once
,
when
we
want
to
do
good
to
people
one
has
no
right
to
expect
that
they
should
understand
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
baptizing
little
infants
.
  
<EOS>
I
got
both
your
notes
;
 
<EOS>
seven
words
in
one
,
Mr.
Under
-
Secretary
,
and
nine
in
the
other
!
<EOS>
But
the
one
little
word
at
the
end
was
worth
a
whole
sheet
full
of
common
words
.
<EOS>
How
nice
it
is
to
write
letters
without
paying
postage
,
and
to
send
them
about
the
world
with
a
grand
name
in
the
corner
.
<EOS>
When
Barney
brings
me
one
he
always
looks
as
if
he
did
n't
know
whether
it
was
a
love
letter
or
an
order
to
go
to
Botany
Bay
.
<EOS>
If
he
saw
the
inside
of
them
,
how
short
they
are
,
I
do
n't
think
he
'd
think
much
of
you
as
a
lover
nor
yet
as
an
Under
-
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
think
ever
so
much
of
you
as
both
;
 
I
do
,
indeed
;
and
I
am
not
scolding
you
a
bit
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
I
can
have
two
or
three
dear
,
sweet
,
loving
words
,
I
shall
be
as
happy
as
a
queen
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
if
you
knew
it
all
!
<EOS>
But
you
never
can
know
it
all
.
<EOS>
A
man
has
so
many
other
things
to
learn
that
he
can
not
understand
it
.
  
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
dear
,
dear
,
dearest
man
.
<EOS>
Whatever
you
do
I
shall
be
quite
sure
you
have
done
the
best
.
  
<EOS>
Ever
your
own
,
with
all
the
love
of
her
heart
,
  
<EOS>
MARY
F.
JONES
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
very
nice
.
<EOS>
Such
a
man
as
was
Phineas
Finn
always
takes
a
delight
which
he
can
not
express
even
to
himself
in
the
receipt
of
such
a
letter
as
this
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
so
flattering
as
the
warm
expression
of
the
confidence
of
a
woman
's
love
,
and
Phineas
thought
that
no
woman
ever
expressed
this
more
completely
than
did
his
Mary
.
<EOS>
Dear
,
dearest
Mary
.
<EOS>
As
for
giving
her
up
,
as
for
treachery
to
one
so
trusting
,
so
sweet
,
so
well
beloved
,
that
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
But
nevertheless
the
truth
came
home
to
him
more
clearly
day
by
day
,
that
he
of
all
men
was
the
last
who
ought
to
have
given
himself
up
to
such
a
passion
.
<EOS>
For
her
sake
he
ought
to
have
abstained
.
<EOS>
So
he
told
himself
now
.
<EOS>
For
her
sake
he
ought
to
have
kept
aloof
from
her
;
 
and
for
his
own
sake
he
ought
to
have
kept
aloof
from
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
That
very
day
,
with
Mary
's
letter
in
his
pocket
,
he
went
to
the
livery
stables
and
explained
that
he
would
not
keep
his
horse
any
longer
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
difficulty
about
the
horse
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Howard
Macleod
of
the
Treasury
would
take
him
from
that
very
hour
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
walked
away
,
uttered
a
curse
upon
Mr.
Howard
Macleod
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Howard
Macleod
was
just
beginning
the
glory
of
his
life
in
London
,
and
he
,
Phineas
Finn
,
was
bringing
his
to
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
With
Mary
's
letter
in
his
pocket
he
went
up
to
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
He
had
again
got
into
the
habit
of
seeing
Lady
Laura
frequently
,
and
was
often
with
her
brother
,
who
now
again
lived
at
his
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
A
letter
had
reached
Lord
Brentford
,
through
his
lawyer
,
in
which
a
demand
was
made
by
Mr.
Kennedy
for
the
return
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
determined
that
she
would
never
go
back
to
him
;
and
there
had
come
to
her
a
doubt
whether
it
would
not
be
expedient
that
she
should
live
abroad
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
persecution
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
was
in
great
wrath
,
and
Lord
Chiltern
had
once
or
twice
hinted
that
perhaps
he
had
better
"
see
"
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
The
amenities
of
such
an
interview
,
as
this
would
be
,
had
up
to
the
present
day
been
postponed
;
and
,
in
a
certain
way
,
Phineas
had
been
used
as
a
messenger
between
Mr.
Kennedy
and
his
wife
's
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
will
end
,
"
she
said
,
"
in
my
going
to
Dresden
,
and
settling
myself
there
.
<EOS>
Papa
will
come
to
me
when
Parliament
is
not
sitting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
very
dull
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dull
!
<EOS>
What
does
dulness
amount
to
when
one
has
come
to
such
a
pass
as
this
?
<EOS>
When
one
is
in
the
ruck
of
fortune
,
to
be
dull
is
very
bad
;
but
when
misfortune
comes
,
simple
dulness
is
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
sounds
almost
like
relief
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
hard
that
you
should
be
driven
away
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
not
answer
him
for
a
while
,
and
he
was
beginning
to
think
of
his
own
case
also
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
hard
that
he
too
should
be
driven
away
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
is
odd
enough
that
we
should
both
be
going
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
not
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
.
<EOS>
I
have
resolved
upon
this
,
 
that
if
I
give
up
my
place
,
I
will
give
up
my
seat
too
.
<EOS>
I
went
into
Parliament
with
the
hope
of
office
,
and
how
can
I
remain
there
when
I
shall
have
gained
it
and
then
have
lost
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
stay
in
London
,
Mr.
Finn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
After
all
that
has
come
and
gone
I
should
not
be
happy
here
,
and
I
should
make
my
way
easier
and
on
cheaper
terms
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
My
present
idea
is
that
I
shall
endeavour
to
make
a
practice
over
in
my
own
country
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
hard
work
beginning
at
the
bottom
;
 
will
it
not
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
so
unnecessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Lady
Laura
,
 
if
it
only
could
be
avoided
!
<EOS>
But
it
is
of
no
use
going
through
all
that
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
we
would
both
of
us
avoid
if
we
could
only
have
another
chance
!
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
only
be
as
I
was
before
I
persuaded
myself
to
marry
a
man
whom
I
never
loved
,
what
a
paradise
the
earth
would
be
to
me
!
<EOS>
With
me
all
regrets
are
too
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
with
me
as
much
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Even
should
you
resign
your
office
,
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
give
up
your
seat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Simply
that
I
have
no
income
to
maintain
me
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
,
during
which
she
changed
her
seat
so
as
to
come
nearer
to
him
,
placing
herself
on
a
corner
of
a
sofa
close
to
the
chair
on
which
he
was
seated
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
I
may
speak
to
you
plainly
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
On
any
subject
?
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
on
any
subject
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
you
have
been
able
to
rid
your
bosom
of
all
remembrances
of
Violet
Effingham
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
of
all
remembrances
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
all
hope
,
then
?
"
  
"
I
have
no
such
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
of
all
lingering
desires
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
,
yes
;
 
and
of
all
lingering
desires
.
<EOS>
I
know
now
that
it
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
is
welcome
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
 
of
that
I
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
,
with
his
perversity
,
has
estranged
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
sure
of
this
,
 
that
if
she
do
not
marry
him
,
she
will
marry
no
one
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
on
account
of
him
that
I
speak
.
<EOS>
He
must
fight
his
own
battles
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
interfere
with
him
,
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
should
you
not
establish
yourself
by
a
marriage
that
will
make
place
a
matter
of
indifference
to
you
?
<EOS>
I
know
that
it
is
within
your
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
put
his
hand
up
to
his
breastcoat
pocket
,
and
felt
that
Mary
's
letter
,
 
her
precious
letter
,
 
was
there
safe
.
<EOS>
It
certainly
was
not
in
his
power
to
do
this
thing
which
Lady
Laura
recommended
to
him
,
but
he
hardly
thought
that
the
present
was
a
moment
suitable
for
explaining
to
her
the
nature
of
the
impediment
which
stood
in
the
way
of
such
an
arrangement
.
<EOS>
He
had
so
lately
spoken
to
Lady
Laura
with
an
assurance
of
undying
constancy
of
his
love
for
Miss
Effingham
,
that
he
could
not
as
yet
acknowledge
the
force
of
another
passion
.
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
by
way
of
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
that
it
is
so
,
"
she
said
with
energy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
to
Madame
Goesler
,
and
ask
her
.
<EOS>
Hear
what
she
will
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Madame
Goesler
would
laugh
at
me
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
You
do
not
think
so
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
she
would
not
laugh
.
<EOS>
And
are
you
the
man
to
be
afraid
of
a
woman
's
laughter
?
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
he
did
not
answer
her
at
once
,
and
when
he
did
speak
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
altered
.
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
<EOS>
you
said
of
yourself
,
just
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
I
say
of
myself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
regretted
that
you
had
consented
to
marry
a
man
,
 
whom
you
did
not
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
not
love
her
?
<EOS>
And
it
is
so
different
with
a
man
!
<EOS>
A
woman
is
wretched
if
she
does
not
love
her
husband
,
but
I
fancy
that
a
man
gets
on
very
well
without
any
such
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
domineer
over
you
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
expect
you
to
pluck
yourself
out
of
your
own
soil
,
and
begin
a
new
growth
altogether
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
which
Mr.
Kennedy
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
for
a
moment
think
that
she
would
take
me
,
if
I
were
to
offer
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
her
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
energetically
.
<EOS>
"
Such
trials
cost
you
but
little
;
 
we
both
of
us
know
that
!
"
<EOS>
Still
he
said
nothing
of
the
letter
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
everything
that
you
should
go
on
now
that
you
have
once
begun
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
in
you
working
at
the
Bar
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
has
commenced
life
as
you
have
done
with
the
excitement
of
politics
,
who
has
known
what
it
is
to
take
a
prominent
part
in
the
control
of
public
affairs
,
can
not
give
it
up
and
be
happy
at
other
work
.
<EOS>
Make
her
your
wife
,
and
you
may
resign
or
remain
in
office
just
as
you
choose
.
<EOS>
Office
will
be
much
easier
to
you
than
it
is
now
,
because
it
will
not
be
a
necessity
.
<EOS>
Let
me
at
any
rate
have
the
pleasure
of
thinking
that
one
of
us
can
remain
here
,
 
that
we
need
not
both
fall
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
Still
he
did
not
tell
her
of
the
letter
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
she
moved
him
,
 
that
she
made
him
acknowledge
to
himself
<EOS>
how
great
would
be
the
pity
of
such
a
failure
as
would
be
his
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
as
much
alive
as
she
could
be
to
the
fact
that
work
at
the
Bar
,
either
in
London
or
in
Dublin
,
would
have
no
charms
for
him
now
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
such
a
life
was
very
dreary
to
him
.
<EOS>
Even
with
the
comfort
of
Mary
's
love
such
a
life
would
be
very
dreary
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
knew
,
 
he
thought
that
he
knew
,
 
that
were
he
to
offer
himself
to
Madame
Goesler
he
would
not
in
truth
be
rejected
.
<EOS>
She
had
told
him
that
if
poverty
was
a
trouble
to
him
he
need
be
no
longer
poor
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
had
understood
this
.
<EOS>
Her
money
was
at
his
service
if
he
should
choose
to
stoop
and
pick
it
up
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
not
only
money
that
such
a
marriage
would
give
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
acknowledged
to
himself
more
than
once
that
Madame
Goesler
was
very
lovely
,
that
she
was
clever
,
attractive
in
every
way
,
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
,
blessed
with
a
sweet
temper
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
position
,
too
,
in
the
world
that
would
help
him
rather
than
mar
him
.
<EOS>
What
might
he
not
do
with
an
independent
seat
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
as
joint
owner
of
the
little
house
in
Park
Lane
?
<EOS>
Of
all
careers
which
the
world
could
offer
to
a
man
the
pleasantest
would
then
be
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
appear
to
me
as
a
tempter
,
"
he
said
at
last
to
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
unkind
of
you
to
say
that
,
and
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
I
would
do
anything
on
earth
in
my
power
to
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
you
are
a
tempter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
it
ought
to
have
been
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
very
well
how
it
ought
to
have
been
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
kept
myself
free
till
that
time
when
we
met
on
the
braes
of
Loughlinter
,
and
then
all
would
have
been
well
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
how
that
might
have
been
,
"
said
Phineas
,
hoarsely
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
know
!
<EOS>
But
I
know
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
have
stabbed
me
with
a
thousand
daggers
when
you
have
told
me
from
time
to
time
of
your
love
for
Violet
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
very
cruel
,
 
needlessly
cruel
.
<EOS>
Men
are
so
cruel
!
<EOS>
But
for
all
that
I
have
known
that
I
could
have
kept
you
,
 
had
it
not
been
too
late
when
you
spoke
to
me
.
<EOS>
Will
you
not
own
as
much
as
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
would
have
been
everything
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
thought
of
Violet
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
only
kind
word
you
have
said
to
me
from
that
day
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
comfort
myself
in
thinking
that
it
would
have
been
so
.
<EOS>
But
all
that
is
past
and
gone
,
and
done
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
my
romance
and
you
have
had
yours
.
<EOS>
As
you
are
a
man
,
it
is
natural
that
you
should
have
been
disturbed
by
a
double
image
;
 
it
is
not
so
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
you
can
advise
me
to
offer
marriage
to
a
woman
,
 
a
woman
whom
I
am
to
seek
merely
because
she
is
rich
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
I
do
so
advise
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
had
your
romance
and
must
now
put
up
with
reality
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
so
advise
you
but
for
the
interest
that
I
have
in
you
?
<EOS>
Your
prosperity
will
do
me
no
good
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
even
be
here
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
of
it
only
as
so
many
a
woman
banished
out
of
England
hears
a
distant
misunderstood
report
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
country
she
has
left
.
<EOS>
But
I
still
have
regard
enough
,
 
I
will
be
bold
,
and
,
knowing
that
you
will
not
take
it
amiss
<EOS>
,
will
say
love
enough
for
you
,
 
to
feel
a
desire
that
you
should
not
be
shipwrecked
.
<EOS>
Since
we
first
took
you
in
hand
between
us
,
Barrington
and
I
,
I
have
never
swerved
in
my
anxiety
on
your
behalf
.
<EOS>
When
I
resolved
that
it
would
be
better
for
us
both
that
we
should
be
only
friends
,
I
did
not
swerve
.
<EOS>
When
you
would
talk
to
me
so
cruelly
of
your
love
for
Violet
,
I
did
not
swerve
.
<EOS>
When
I
warned
you
from
Loughlinter
because
I
thought
there
was
danger
,
I
did
not
swerve
.
<EOS>
When
I
bade
you
not
to
come
to
me
in
London
because
of
my
husband
,
I
did
not
swerve
.
<EOS>
When
my
father
was
hard
upon
you
,
I
did
not
swerve
then
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
leave
him
till
he
was
softened
.
<EOS>
When
you
tried
to
rob
Oswald
of
his
love
,
and
I
thought
you
would
succeed
,
 
<EOS>
for
I
did
think
so
,
 
I
did
not
swerve
.
<EOS>
I
have
ever
been
true
to
you
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
I
must
hide
myself
and
go
away
,
and
be
seen
no
more
,
I
am
true
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
,
 
dearest
Laura
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
speaking
with
no
touch
of
anger
,
but
all
in
sorrow
;
 
<EOS>
"
it
must
not
be
like
that
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
room
for
that
.
<EOS>
Nor
do
you
mean
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
so
ill
of
you
.
<EOS>
But
there
may
not
be
even
words
of
affection
between
us
 
<EOS>
only
such
as
I
may
speak
to
make
you
know
that
I
am
your
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
my
friend
,
"
he
said
,
stretching
out
his
hand
to
her
as
he
turned
away
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
my
friend
,
indeed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
do
as
I
would
have
you
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
and
had
the
letter
between
his
fingers
with
the
purport
of
showing
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
moment
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
were
he
to
do
so
,
then
,
indeed
,
he
would
be
bound
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
was
bound
for
ever
,
 
bound
for
ever
to
his
own
Mary
;
but
he
desired
to
have
the
privilege
of
thinking
over
such
bondage
once
more
before
he
proclaimed
it
even
to
his
dearest
friend
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
her
that
she
tempted
him
,
and
she
stood
before
him
now
as
a
temptress
.
<EOS>
But
lest
it
might
be
possible
that
she
should
not
tempt
in
vain
,
 
that
letter
in
his
pocket
must
never
be
shown
to
her
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
Lady
Laura
must
never
hear
from
his
lips
the
name
of
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
  
<EOS>
He
left
her
without
any
assured
purpose
;
 
without
,
that
is
,
the
assurance
to
her
of
any
fixed
purpose
.
<EOS>
There
yet
wanted
a
week
to
the
day
on
which
Mr.
Monk
's
bill
was
to
be
read
,
 
or
not
to
be
read
,
 
the
second
time
;
and
he
had
still
that
interval
before
he
need
decide
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
his
club
,
and
before
he
dined
he
strove
to
write
a
line
to
Mary
;
 
but
when
he
had
the
paper
before
him
he
found
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Though
he
did
not
even
suspect
himself
of
an
intention
to
be
false
,
the
idea
that
was
in
his
mind
made
the
effort
too
much
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
paper
away
from
him
and
went
down
and
eat
his
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
Saturday
,
and
there
was
no
House
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
He
had
remained
in
Portman
Square
with
Lady
Laura
till
near
seven
o'clock
,
and
was
engaged
to
go
out
in
the
evening
to
a
gathering
at
Mrs.
Gresham
's
house
.
<EOS>
Everybody
in
London
would
be
there
,
and
Phineas
was
resolved
that
as
long
as
he
remained
in
London
he
would
be
seen
at
places
where
everybody
was
seen
.
<EOS>
He
would
certainly
be
at
Mrs.
Gresham
's
gathering
;
but
there
was
an
hour
or
two
before
he
need
go
home
to
dress
,
and
as
he
had
nothing
to
do
,
he
went
down
to
the
smoking
-
room
of
his
club
.
<EOS>
The
seats
were
crowded
,
but
there
was
one
vacant
;
and
before
he
had
looked
about
him
to
scrutinise
his
neighbourhood
,
he
found
that
he
had
placed
himself
with
Bonteen
on
his
right
hand
and
Ratler
on
his
left
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
two
men
in
all
London
whom
he
more
thoroughly
disliked
;
but
it
was
too
late
for
him
to
avoid
them
now
.
  
<EOS>
They
instantly
attacked
him
,
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
So
I
am
told
you
are
going
to
leave
us
,
"
said
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
can
have
been
ill
-
natured
enough
to
whisper
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
whispers
are
very
loud
,
I
can
tell
you
,
"
said
Ratler
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
know
already
pretty
nearly
how
every
man
in
the
House
will
vote
,
and
I
have
not
got
your
name
down
on
the
right
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Change
it
for
heaven
's
sake
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
if
you
'll
tell
me
seriously
that
I
may
,
"
said
Ratler
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
is
,
"
said
Bonteen
,
"
that
a
man
should
be
known
either
as
a
friend
or
foe
.
<EOS>
I
respect
a
declared
foe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Know
me
as
a
declared
foe
then
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
respect
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
,
"
said
Ratler
,
"
but
it
means
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
've
always
had
a
sort
of
fear
about
you
,
Finn
,
that
you
would
go
over
the
traces
some
day
.
<EOS>
Of
course
it
's
a
very
grand
thing
to
be
independent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
finest
thing
in
the
world
,
"
said
Bonteen
;
"
only
so
d
 
d
useless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
a
man
should
n't
be
independent
and
stick
to
the
ship
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
You
forget
the
trouble
you
cause
,
and
how
you
upset
all
calculations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
n't
thought
of
the
calculations
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
Finn
,
"
said
Bonteen
,
"
you
are
made
of
clay
too
fine
for
office
.
<EOS>
I
've
always
found
it
has
been
so
with
men
from
your
country
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
grandest
horses
in
the
world
to
look
at
out
on
a
prairie
,
but
you
do
n't
like
the
slavery
of
harness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
sound
of
a
whip
over
our
shoulders
sets
us
kicking
;
 
does
it
not
,
Ratler
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
show
the
list
to
Gresham
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Ratler
,
"
and
of
course
he
can
do
as
he
pleases
;
but
I
do
n't
understand
this
kind
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
be
in
a
hurry
,
"
said
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bet
you
a
sovereign
Finn
votes
with
us
yet
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
like
being
a
little
coy
to
set
off
a
girl
's
charms
.
<EOS>
I
'll
bet
you
a
sovereign
,
Ratler
,
that
Finn
goes
out
into
the
lobby
with
you
and
me
against
Monk
's
bill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
not
being
able
to
stand
any
more
of
this
most
unpleasant
raillery
,
got
up
and
went
away
.
<EOS>
The
club
was
distasteful
to
him
,
and
he
walked
off
and
sauntered
for
a
while
about
the
park
.
<EOS>
He
went
down
by
the
Duke
of
York
's
column
as
though
he
were
going
to
his
office
,
which
of
course
was
closed
at
this
hour
,
but
turned
round
when
he
got
beyond
the
new
public
buildings
,
 
buildings
which
he
was
never
destined
to
use
in
their
completed
state
,
 
and
entered
the
gates
of
the
enclosure
,
and
wandered
on
over
the
bridge
across
the
water
.
<EOS>
As
he
went
his
mind
was
full
of
thought
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
good
for
him
to
give
up
everything
for
a
fair
face
?
<EOS>
He
swore
to
himself
that
of
all
women
whom
he
had
ever
seen
Mary
was
the
sweetest
and
the
dearest
and
the
best
.
<EOS>
If
it
could
be
well
to
lose
the
world
for
a
woman
,
it
would
be
well
to
lose
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
Violet
,
with
all
her
skill
,
and
all
her
strength
,
and
all
her
grace
,
could
never
have
written
such
a
letter
as
that
which
he
still
held
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
The
best
charm
of
a
woman
is
that
she
should
be
soft
,
and
trusting
,
and
generous
;
and
who
ever
had
been
more
soft
,
more
trusting
,
and
more
generous
than
his
Mary
?
<EOS>
Of
course
he
would
be
true
to
her
,
though
he
did
lose
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
yield
such
a
triumph
to
the
Ratlers
and
Bonteens
whom
he
left
behind
him
,
 
to
let
them
have
their
will
over
him
,
 
to
know
that
they
would
rejoice
scurrilously
behind
his
back
over
his
downfall
!
<EOS>
The
feeling
was
terrible
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
last
words
which
Bonteen
had
spoken
made
it
impossible
to
him
now
not
to
support
his
old
friend
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
what
Bonteen
had
said
,
but
that
the
words
of
Mr.
Bonteen
so
plainly
indicated
what
would
be
the
words
of
all
the
other
Bonteens
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
was
weak
in
this
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
had
he
been
strong
,
he
would
have
allowed
himself
to
be
guided
,
 
if
not
by
the
firm
decision
of
his
own
spirit
,
 
by
the
counsels
of
such
men
as
Mr.
Gresham
and
Lord
Cantrip
,
and
not
by
the
sarcasms
of
the
Bonteens
and
Ratlers
of
official
life
.
<EOS>
But
men
who
sojourn
amidst
savagery
fear
the
mosquito
more
than
they
do
the
lion
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
to
think
that
he
should
yield
his
blood
to
such
a
one
as
Bonteen
.
  
<EOS>
And
he
must
yield
his
blood
,
unless
he
could
vote
for
Mr.
Monk
's
motion
,
and
hold
his
ground
afterwards
among
them
all
in
the
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
He
would
at
any
rate
see
the
session
out
,
and
try
a
fall
with
Mr.
Bonteen
when
they
should
be
sitting
on
different
benches
,
 
if
ever
fortune
should
give
him
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
meantime
,
what
should
he
do
about
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
What
a
fate
was
his
to
have
the
handsomest
woman
in
London
with
thousands
and
thousands
a
year
at
his
disposal
!
<EOS>
For
,
 
so
he
now
swore
to
himself
,
 
Madame
Goesler
was
the
handsomest
woman
in
London
,
as
Mary
Flood
Jones
was
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
arrived
at
any
decision
so
fixed
as
to
make
him
comfortable
when
he
went
home
and
dressed
for
Mrs.
Gresham
's
party
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
knew
,
 
he
thought
that
he
knew
that
he
would
be
true
to
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
   
<EOS>
The
Prime
Minister
's
House
 
<EOS>
The
rooms
and
passages
and
staircases
at
Mrs.
Gresham
's
house
were
very
crowded
when
Phineas
arrived
there
.
<EOS>
Men
of
all
shades
of
politics
were
there
,
and
the
wives
and
daughters
of
such
men
;
and
there
was
a
streak
of
royalty
in
one
of
the
saloons
,
and
a
whole
rainbow
of
foreign
ministers
with
their
stars
,
and
two
blue
ribbons
were
to
be
seen
together
on
the
first
landing
-
place
,
with
a
stout
lady
between
them
carrying
diamonds
enough
to
load
a
pannier
.
<EOS>
Everybody
was
there
.
<EOS>
Phineas
found
that
even
Lord
Chiltern
was
come
,
as
he
stumbled
across
his
friend
on
the
first
foot
-
ground
that
he
gained
in
his
ascent
towards
the
rooms
.
"
<EOS>
Halloa
,
 
you
here
?
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
by
George
!
"
said
the
other
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
am
going
to
escape
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
trying
to
make
my
way
up
for
the
last
hour
,
but
could
never
get
round
that
huge
promontory
there
.
<EOS>
Laura
was
more
persevering
.
"
<EOS>
"
Is
Kennedy
here
?
"
<EOS>
Phineas
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
,
"
said
Chiltern
,
"
but
<EOS>
she
was
determined
to
run
the
chance
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
higher
up
,
 
for
Phineas
was
blessed
with
more
patience
than
Lord
Chiltern
possessed
,
 
he
came
upon
Mr.
Monk
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
are
still
admitted
privately
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
<EOS>
yes
,
 
and
we
have
just
been
having
a
most
friendly
conversation
about
you
.
<EOS>
What
a
man
he
is
!
<EOS>
He
knows
everything
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
accurate
;
so
just
in
the
abstract
,
 
and
in
the
abstract
so
generous
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
very
generous
to
me
in
detail
as
well
as
in
abstract
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
yes
;
I
am
not
thinking
of
individuals
exactly
.
<EOS>
His
want
of
generosity
is
to
large
masses
,
 
to
a
party
,
to
classes
,
to
a
people
;
whereas
his
generosity
is
for
mankind
at
large
.
<EOS>
He
assumes
the
god
,
affects
to
nod
,
and
seems
to
shake
the
spheres
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
nothing
against
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
asked
me
here
to
-
night
,
and
has
talked
to
me
most
familiarly
about
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
your
chance
of
a
second
reading
?
"
asked
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
it
?
 
<EOS>
you
hear
more
of
those
things
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
says
it
will
be
a
close
division
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
expected
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
,
till
I
heard
what
Daubeny
said
at
the
first
reading
.
<EOS>
They
will
all
vote
for
the
bill
en
masse
,
 
hating
it
in
their
hearts
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hope
they
are
not
so
bad
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
way
with
them
always
.
<EOS>
They
do
all
our
work
for
us
,
 
sailing
either
on
one
tack
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
That
is
their
use
in
creation
,
that
when
we
split
among
ourselves
,
as
we
always
do
,
they
come
in
and
finish
our
job
for
us
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
unpleasant
for
them
to
be
always
doing
that
which
they
always
say
should
never
be
done
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wherever
the
gift
horse
may
come
from
,
I
shall
not
look
it
in
the
mouth
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
only
one
man
in
the
House
whom
I
hope
I
may
not
see
in
the
lobby
with
me
,
and
that
is
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
question
is
decided
now
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
is
it
decided
?
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
could
not
tell
his
friend
that
a
question
of
so
great
magnitude
to
him
had
been
decided
by
the
last
sting
which
he
had
received
from
an
insect
so
contemptible
as
Mr.
Bonteen
,
but
he
expressed
the
feeling
as
well
as
he
knew
how
to
express
it
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
shall
be
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
,
and
I
know
how
good
you
are
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
stand
it
.
<EOS>
Men
are
beginning
already
to
say
things
which
almost
make
me
get
up
and
kick
them
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
help
it
,
I
will
give
occasion
to
no
man
to
hint
anything
to
me
which
can
make
me
be
so
wretched
as
I
have
been
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Pray
do
not
say
anything
more
.
<EOS>
My
idea
is
that
I
shall
resign
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
hope
that
we
may
fight
the
battle
side
by
side
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
giving
him
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
fight
the
battle
side
by
side
,
"
replied
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
he
pushed
his
way
still
higher
up
the
stairs
,
having
no
special
purpose
in
view
,
not
dreaming
of
any
such
success
as
that
of
reaching
his
host
or
hostess
,
 
merely
feeling
that
it
should
be
a
point
of
honour
with
him
to
make
a
tour
through
the
rooms
before
he
descended
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
thing
,
he
thought
,
was
to
be
done
with
courage
and
patience
,
and
this
might
,
probably
,
be
the
last
time
in
his
life
that
he
would
find
himself
in
the
house
of
a
Prime
Minister
.
<EOS>
Just
at
the
turn
of
the
balustrade
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
he
found
Mr.
Gresham
in
the
very
spot
on
which
Mr.
Monk
had
been
talking
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
Very
glad
to
see
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
I
find
,
are
a
persevering
man
,
with
a
genius
for
getting
upwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Like
the
sparks
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
so
quickly
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
with
the
same
assurance
of
speedy
loss
of
my
little
light
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
did
not
suit
Mr.
Gresham
to
understand
this
,
so
he
changed
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
the
news
from
America
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
seen
it
,
but
do
not
believe
it
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
have
such
faith
in
a
combination
of
British
colonies
,
properly
backed
in
Downing
Street
,
as
to
think
them
strong
against
a
world
in
arms
.
<EOS>
In
your
place
I
should
hold
to
the
same
doctrine
,
 
hold
to
it
stoutly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
now
,
I
hope
,
Mr.
Gresham
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
 
yes
,
 
I
am
not
down
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
But
I
confess
to
a
feeling
that
the
world
would
go
on
even
though
we
had
nothing
to
say
to
a
single
province
in
North
America
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
for
your
private
ear
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
whisper
that
in
Downing
Street
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
came
up
somebody
else
,
and
Phineas
went
on
upon
his
slow
course
.
<EOS>
He
had
longed
for
an
opportunity
to
tell
Mr.
Gresham
that
he
could
go
to
Downing
Street
no
more
,
but
such
opportunity
had
not
reached
him
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
he
found
himself
stuck
close
by
the
side
of
Miss
Fitzgibbon
,
 
Miss
Aspasia
Fitzgibbon
,
 
who
had
once
relieved
him
from
terrible
pecuniary
anxiety
by
paying
for
him
a
sum
of
money
which
was
due
by
him
on
her
brother
's
account
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
very
nice
thing
to
be
here
,
but
one
does
get
tired
of
it
,
"
said
Miss
Fitzgibbon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
tired
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
a
part
of
your
duty
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
You
are
on
your
promotion
and
are
bound
to
be
here
.
<EOS>
When
I
asked
Laurence
to
come
,
he
said
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
till
the
cards
were
shuffled
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
'll
be
shuffled
very
soon
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whatever
colour
comes
up
,
you
'll
hold
trumps
,
I
know
,
"
said
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"
Some
hands
always
hold
trumps
.
<EOS>
"
He
could
not
explain
to
Miss
Fitzgibbon
that
it
would
never
again
be
his
fate
to
hold
a
single
trump
in
his
hand
;
so
he
made
another
fight
,
and
got
on
a
few
steps
farther
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
a
word
as
he
went
to
half
a
dozen
friends
,
 
as
friends
went
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
detained
for
five
minutes
by
Lady
Baldock
,
who
was
very
gracious
and
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
She
told
him
that
Violet
was
in
the
room
,
but
where
she
did
not
know
.
"
<EOS>
She
is
somewhere
with
Lady
Laura
,
I
believe
;
and
really
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
do
not
like
it
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
had
heard
that
Phineas
had
quarrelled
with
Lord
Brentford
,
but
had
not
heard
of
the
reconciliation
.
"
<EOS>
Really
,
I
do
not
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
Mr.
Kennedy
is
in
the
house
,
and
nobody
knows
what
may
happen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kennedy
is
not
likely
to
say
anything
.
"
  
"
One
can
not
tell
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
hear
that
a
woman
is
separated
from
her
husband
,
I
always
think
that
she
must
have
been
imprudent
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
uncharitable
,
but
I
think
it
is
most
safe
so
to
consider
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
have
heard
the
circumstances
,
Lady
Laura
was
quite
right
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
so
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
will
always
take
the
lady
's
part
,
 
of
course
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
have
a
daughter
separated
from
her
husband
,
 
very
sorry
.
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
had
nothing
now
to
gain
from
Lady
Baldock
's
favour
,
left
her
abruptly
,
and
went
on
again
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
great
desire
to
see
Lady
Laura
and
Violet
together
,
though
he
could
hardly
tell
himself
why
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
seen
Miss
Effingham
since
his
return
from
Ireland
,
and
he
thought
that
if
he
met
her
alone
he
could
hardly
have
talked
to
her
with
comfort
;
but
he
knew
that
if
he
met
her
with
Lady
Laura
,
she
would
greet
him
as
a
friend
,
and
speak
to
him
as
though
there
were
no
cause
for
embarrassment
between
them
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
so
far
disappointed
,
that
he
suddenly
encountered
Violet
alone
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
leaning
on
the
arm
of
Lord
Baldock
,
and
Phineas
saw
her
cousin
leave
her
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
not
be
such
a
coward
as
to
avoid
her
,
especially
as
he
knew
that
she
had
seen
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr.
Finn
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
do
you
see
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
See
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
;
There
is
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
We
had
heard
that
it
was
possible
,
and
Laura
made
me
promise
that
I
would
not
leave
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
turned
his
head
,
and
saw
Mr.
Kennedy
standing
with
his
back
bolt
upright
against
a
door
-
post
,
with
his
brow
as
black
as
thunder
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
just
opposite
to
him
,
where
he
can
see
her
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
take
me
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
will
think
nothing
of
you
,
because
I
know
that
you
are
still
friends
with
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
came
away
because
Lord
Baldock
wanted
to
introduce
me
to
Lady
Mouser
.
<EOS>
You
know
he
is
going
to
marry
Miss
Mouser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
,
not
caring
much
about
Lord
Baldock
and
Miss
Mouser
,
took
Violet
's
hand
upon
his
arm
,
and
very
slowly
made
his
way
across
the
room
to
the
spot
indicated
.
<EOS>
There
they
found
Lady
Laura
alone
,
sitting
under
the
upas
-
tree
influence
of
her
husband
's
gaze
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
concourse
of
people
between
them
,
and
Mr.
Kennedy
did
not
seem
inclined
to
make
any
attempt
to
lessen
the
distance
.
<EOS>
But
Lady
Laura
had
found
it
impossible
to
move
while
she
was
under
her
husband
's
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
said
,
"
could
you
find
Oswald
?
<EOS>
I
know
he
is
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
gone
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
speaking
to
him
downstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
seen
my
father
?
<EOS>
He
said
he
would
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
seen
him
,
but
I
will
search
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
it
will
do
no
good
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
stay
.
<EOS>
His
carriage
is
there
,
I
know
,
 
waiting
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
Phineas
immediately
started
off
to
have
the
carriage
called
,
and
promised
to
return
with
as
much
celerity
as
he
could
use
.
<EOS>
As
he
went
,
making
his
way
much
quicker
through
the
crowd
than
he
had
done
when
he
had
no
such
object
for
haste
,
he
purposely
avoided
the
door
by
which
Mr.
Kennedy
had
stood
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
his
nearest
way
,
but
his
present
service
,
he
thought
,
required
that
he
should
keep
aloof
from
the
man
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Kennedy
passed
through
the
door
and
intercepted
him
in
his
path
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
going
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
she
may
before
long
.
<EOS>
I
shall
look
for
Lord
Brentford
's
carriage
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
her
she
need
not
go
because
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
return
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
annoy
her
here
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
much
better
that
a
woman
in
such
a
plight
should
not
have
come
to
such
an
assembly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
not
wish
her
to
shut
herself
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
wish
her
to
come
back
to
the
home
that
she
has
left
,
and
,
if
there
be
any
law
in
the
land
,
she
shall
be
made
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
You
tell
her
that
I
say
so
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Kennedy
fought
his
way
down
the
stairs
,
and
Phineas
Finn
followed
in
his
wake
.
  
<EOS>
About
half
an
hour
afterwards
Phineas
returned
to
the
two
ladies
with
tidings
that
the
carriage
would
be
at
hand
as
soon
as
they
could
be
below
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
he
see
you
?
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
followed
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
he
speak
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
he
spoke
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
did
he
say
?
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
in
the
presence
of
Violet
,
Phineas
gave
the
message
.
<EOS>
He
thought
it
better
that
it
should
be
given
;
and
were
he
to
decline
to
deliver
it
now
,
it
would
never
be
given
.
"
<EOS>
Whether
there
be
law
in
the
land
to
protect
me
or
whether
there
be
none
,
I
will
never
live
with
him
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
Is
a
woman
like
a
head
of
cattle
,
that
she
can
be
fastened
in
her
crib
by
force
?
<EOS>
I
will
never
live
with
him
though
all
the
judges
of
the
land
should
decide
that
I
must
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Phineas
thought
much
of
all
this
as
he
went
to
his
solitary
lodgings
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
was
not
the
world
much
better
with
him
than
it
was
with
either
of
those
two
wretched
married
beings
?
<EOS>
And
why
?
<EOS>
He
had
not
,
at
any
rate
as
yet
,
sacrificed
for
money
or
social
gains
any
of
the
instincts
of
his
nature
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
fickle
,
foolish
,
vain
,
uncertain
,
and
perhaps
covetous
;
 
but
as
yet
he
had
not
been
false
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
out
Mary
's
last
letter
and
read
it
again
.
   
<EOS>
Comparing
Notes
 
<EOS>
It
would
,
perhaps
,
be
difficult
to
decide
,
 
between
Lord
Chiltern
and
Miss
Effingham
,
 
which
had
been
most
wrong
,
or
which
had
been
nearest
to
the
right
,
in
the
circumstances
which
had
led
to
their
separation
.
<EOS>
The
old
lord
,
wishing
to
induce
his
son
to
undertake
work
of
some
sort
,
and
feeling
that
his
own
efforts
in
this
direction
were
worse
than
useless
,
had
closeted
himself
with
his
intended
daughter
-
in
-
law
,
and
had
obtained
from
her
a
promise
that
she
would
use
her
influence
with
her
lover
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
I
think
it
right
that
he
should
do
something
,
"
Violet
had
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
he
will
if
you
bid
him
,
"
replied
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
Violet
expressed
a
great
doubt
as
to
this
willingness
of
obedience
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
promised
to
do
her
best
,
and
she
did
her
best
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
,
when
she
spoke
to
him
,
knit
his
brows
with
an
apparent
ferocity
of
anger
which
his
countenance
frequently
expressed
without
any
intention
of
ferocity
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
He
was
annoyed
,
but
was
not
savagely
disposed
to
Violet
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
at
her
,
however
,
he
seemed
to
be
very
savagely
disposed
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
you
would
have
me
do
?
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
you
choose
some
occupation
,
Oswald
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
occupation
?
<EOS>
What
is
it
that
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Ought
I
to
be
a
shoemaker
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
by
preference
,
I
should
say
;
but
that
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
When
her
lover
had
frowned
at
her
,
Violet
had
resolved
,
 
had
strongly
determined
,
with
inward
assertions
of
her
own
rights
,
 
that
she
would
not
be
frightened
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
talking
nonsense
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
can
not
be
a
shoemaker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
into
Parliament
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
neither
can
,
nor
would
I
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
I
dislike
the
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
farm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
afford
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
,
 
might
do
anything
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
do
something
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
you
ought
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
your
father
is
right
in
what
he
says
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
is
easily
asserted
,
Violet
;
but
it
would
,
I
think
,
be
better
that
you
should
take
my
part
than
my
father
's
,
if
it
be
that
you
intend
to
be
my
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
I
intend
to
be
your
wife
;
but
would
you
wish
that
I
should
respect
my
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
you
not
do
so
if
you
marry
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Violet
looked
into
his
face
and
saw
that
the
frown
was
blacker
than
ever
.
<EOS>
The
great
mark
down
his
forehead
was
deeper
and
more
like
an
ugly
wound
than
she
had
ever
seen
it
;
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
anger
;
and
his
face
was
red
as
with
fiery
wrath
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
so
with
him
when
she
was
no
more
than
engaged
to
him
,
how
would
it
be
when
they
should
be
man
and
wife
?
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
she
would
not
fear
him
,
 
not
now
at
least
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
Oswald
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
resolve
upon
being
an
idle
man
,
I
shall
not
respect
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
that
I
should
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
great
deal
better
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
respect
one
whose
whole
life
will
be
,
 
will
be
 
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
be
what
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
with
a
loud
shout
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oswald
,
you
are
very
rough
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
that
my
life
will
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
Then
she
again
resolved
that
she
would
not
fear
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
discreditable
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
not
discredit
you
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
bring
disgrace
on
one
I
have
loved
so
well
.
<EOS>
Violet
,
after
what
you
have
said
,
we
had
better
part
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
still
proud
,
still
determined
,
and
they
did
part
.
<EOS>
Though
it
nearly
broke
her
heart
to
see
him
leave
her
,
she
bid
him
go
.
<EOS>
She
hated
herself
afterwards
for
her
severity
to
him
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
would
not
submit
to
recall
the
words
which
she
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
She
had
thought
him
to
be
wrong
,
and
,
so
thinking
,
had
conceived
it
to
be
her
duty
and
her
privilege
to
tell
him
what
she
thought
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
no
wish
to
lose
him
;
 
no
wish
not
to
be
his
wife
<EOS>
even
,
though
he
should
be
as
idle
as
the
wind
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
constituted
that
she
had
never
allowed
him
or
any
other
man
to
be
master
of
her
heart
,
 
till
she
had
with
a
full
purpose
<EOS>
given
her
heart
away
.
<EOS>
The
day
before
she
had
resolved
to
give
it
to
one
man
,
she
might
,
I
think
,
have
resolved
to
give
it
to
another
.
<EOS>
Love
had
not
conquered
her
,
but
had
been
taken
into
her
service
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
she
could
not
now
rid
herself
of
her
servant
,
when
she
found
that
his
services
would
stand
her
no
longer
in
good
stead
.
<EOS>
She
parted
from
Lord
Chiltern
with
an
assent
,
with
an
assured
brow
,
and
with
much
dignity
in
her
gait
;
but
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
she
was
a
prey
to
remorse
.
<EOS>
She
had
declared
to
the
man
who
was
to
have
been
her
husband
that
his
life
was
discreditable
,
 
and
,
of
course
,
no
man
would
bear
such
language
.
<EOS>
Had
Lord
Chiltern
borne
it
,
he
would
not
have
been
worthy
of
her
love
.
  
<EOS>
She
herself
told
Lady
Laura
and
Lord
Brentford
what
had
occurred
,
 
and
had
told
Lady
Baldock
also
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
had
,
of
course
,
triumphed
,
 
and
Violet
sought
her
revenge
by
swearing
that
she
would
regret
for
ever
the
loss
of
so
inestimable
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
Then
why
have
you
given
him
up
,
my
dear
?
"
demanded
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
I
found
that
he
was
too
good
for
me
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
doubtful
whether
Lady
Baldock
was
not
justified
,
when
she
declared
that
her
niece
was
to
her
a
care
so
harassing
that
no
aunt
known
in
history
had
ever
been
so
troubled
before
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Brentford
had
fussed
and
fumed
,
and
had
certainly
made
things
worse
.
<EOS>
He
had
quarrelled
with
his
son
,
and
then
made
it
up
,
and
then
quarrelled
again
,
 
swearing
that
the
fault
must
all
be
attributed
to
Chiltern
's
stubbornness
and
Chiltern
's
temper
.
<EOS>
Latterly
,
however
,
by
Lady
Laura
's
intervention
,
Lord
Brentford
and
his
son
had
again
been
reconciled
,
and
the
Earl
endeavoured
manfully
to
keep
his
tongue
from
disagreeable
words
,
and
his
face
from
evil
looks
,
when
his
son
was
present
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
make
it
up
,
"
Lady
Laura
had
said
,
"
if
you
and
I
do
not
attempt
to
make
it
up
for
them
.
<EOS>
If
we
do
,
they
will
never
come
together
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Earl
was
convinced
,
and
did
his
best
.
<EOS>
But
the
task
was
very
difficult
to
him
.
<EOS>
How
was
he
to
keep
his
tongue
off
his
son
while
his
son
was
daily
saying
things
of
which
any
father
,
 
any
such
father
as
Lord
Brentford
,
 
could
not
but
disapprove
?
<EOS>
Lord
Chiltern
professed
to
disbelieve
even
in
the
wisdom
of
the
House
of
Lords
,
and
on
one
occasion
asserted
that
it
must
be
a
great
comfort
to
any
Prime
Minister
to
have
three
or
four
old
women
in
the
Cabinet
.
<EOS>
The
father
,
when
he
heard
this
,
tried
to
rebuke
his
son
tenderly
,
strove
even
to
be
jocose
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
one
wish
of
his
heart
that
Violet
Effingham
should
be
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
But
even
with
this
wish
he
found
it
very
hard
to
keep
his
tongue
off
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lady
Laura
discussed
the
matter
with
Violet
,
Violet
would
always
declare
that
there
was
no
hope
.
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
"
she
said
on
the
morning
of
that
day
on
which
they
both
went
to
Mrs.
Gresham
's
,
"
that
though
we
like
each
other
,
 
love
each
other
,
if
you
choose
to
say
so
,
 
we
are
not
fit
to
be
man
and
wife
.
"
  
"
And
why
not
fit
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
too
much
alike
.
<EOS>
Each
is
too
violent
,
too
headstrong
,
and
too
masterful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
as
the
woman
,
ought
to
give
way
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
do
not
always
do
just
what
we
ought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
how
difficult
it
is
for
me
to
advise
,
seeing
to
what
a
pass
I
have
brought
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
say
that
,
dear
;
 
or
rather
do
say
it
,
for
we
have
,
both
of
us
,
brought
ourselves
to
what
you
call
a
pass
,
 
to
such
a
pass
that
we
are
like
to
be
able
to
live
together
and
discuss
it
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
.
<EOS>
The
difference
is
,
I
take
it
,
that
you
have
not
to
accuse
yourself
,
and
that
I
have
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
say
that
I
have
not
to
accuse
myself
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
I
have
done
much
wrong
to
Mr.
Kennedy
since
I
married
him
;
but
in
marrying
him
I
did
him
a
grievous
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
he
has
avenged
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
talk
of
vengeance
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
is
wretched
,
and
I
know
that
I
am
;
 
and
that
has
come
of
the
wrong
that
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
no
man
wretched
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
your
mind
is
made
up
against
Oswald
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
,
and
I
mean
much
more
.
<EOS>
I
say
that
I
will
make
no
man
wretched
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
is
not
the
only
man
who
is
so
weak
as
to
be
willing
to
run
the
hazard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
Lord
Fawn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
there
is
Lord
Fawn
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
should
not
do
him
much
harm
;
but
then
I
should
do
him
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
poor
Phineas
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
there
is
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
something
,
Laura
.
<EOS>
The
only
man
I
ever
saw
in
the
world
whom
I
have
thought
for
a
moment
that
it
was
possible
that
I
should
like
,
 
like
enough
to
love
as
my
husband
,
 
except
your
brother
,
was
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
now
?
"
  
"
Oh
;
 
now
;
of
course
that
is
over
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
over
?
"
  
"
Quite
over
.
<EOS>
Is
he
not
going
to
marry
Madame
Goesler
?
<EOS>
I
suppose
all
that
is
fixed
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
will
be
good
to
him
,
and
gracious
,
and
let
him
have
his
own
way
,
and
give
him
his
tea
comfortably
when
he
comes
up
tired
from
the
House
;
for
I
confess
that
my
heart
is
a
little
tender
towards
Phineas
still
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
like
to
think
that
he
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
female
Philistine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
he
will
marry
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
tell
you
;
 
but
I
do
not
think
he
will
.
<EOS>
And
you
loved
him
once
,
 
eh
,
Violet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
that
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
difficult
with
me
to
love
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
with
most
girls
,
I
fancy
,
is
not
to
love
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
,
when
I
came
to
measure
him
in
my
mind
,
was
not
small
,
but
he
was
never
quite
tall
enough
.
<EOS>
One
feels
oneself
to
be
a
sort
of
recruiting
sergeant
,
going
about
with
a
standard
of
inches
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Finn
was
just
half
an
inch
too
short
.
<EOS>
He
lacks
something
in
individuality
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
little
too
much
a
friend
to
everybody
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
you
a
secret
,
Violet
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
dear
;
though
I
fancy
it
is
one
I
know
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
the
only
man
whom
I
ever
loved
,
"
said
Lady
Laura
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
too
late
when
you
learned
to
love
him
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
too
late
,
when
I
was
so
sure
of
it
as
to
wish
that
I
had
never
seen
Mr.
Kennedy
.
<EOS>
I
felt
it
coming
on
me
,
and
I
argued
with
myself
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
bad
for
us
both
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
there
was
trouble
in
the
family
,
and
I
had
not
a
shilling
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
paid
it
for
Oswald
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
At
any
rate
,
I
had
nothing
;
 
and
he
had
nothing
.
<EOS>
How
could
I
have
dared
to
think
even
of
such
a
marriage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
he
think
of
it
,
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
he
did
.
<EOS>
Did
you
not
tell
me
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
 
yes
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
come
to
some
foolish
,
half
-
sentimental
resolution
as
to
friendship
,
believing
that
he
and
I
could
be
knit
together
by
some
adhesion
of
fraternal
affection
that
should
be
void
of
offence
to
my
husband
;
and
in
furtherance
of
this
he
was
asked
to
Loughlinter
when
I
went
there
,
just
after
I
had
accepted
Robert
.
<EOS>
He
came
down
,
and
I
measured
him
too
,
as
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
I
measured
him
,
and
I
found
that
he
wanted
nothing
to
come
up
to
the
height
required
by
my
standard
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
knew
him
better
than
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
possibly
;
 
but
why
measure
him
at
all
,
when
such
measurement
was
useless
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
one
help
such
things
?
<EOS>
He
came
to
me
one
day
as
I
was
sitting
up
by
the
Linter
.
<EOS>
You
remember
the
place
,
where
it
makes
its
first
leap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I.
Robert
had
shown
it
me
as
the
fairest
spot
in
all
Scotland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
this
lover
of
ours
sang
his
song
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
what
he
told
me
then
;
but
I
know
that
I
told
him
that
I
was
engaged
;
and
I
felt
when
I
told
him
so
that
my
engagement
was
a
sorrow
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
it
has
been
a
sorrow
from
that
day
to
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
hero
,
Phineas
,
 
<EOS>
he
is
still
dear
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
hated
me
,
had
he
become
my
husband
?
<EOS>
And
you
will
hate
Madame
Goesler
when
she
becomes
his
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
dog
in
the
manger
.
<EOS>
I
have
even
gone
so
far
as
almost
to
wish
,
at
certain
moments
,
that
you
should
accept
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
he
has
wished
it
so
heartily
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
One
can
hardly
forgive
a
man
for
such
speedy
changes
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
I
not
to
forgive
him
;
 
I
,
who
had
turned
myself
away
from
him
with
a
fixed
purpose
the
moment
that
I
found
that
he
had
made
a
mark
upon
my
heart
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
wipe
off
the
mark
,
and
yet
I
married
.
<EOS>
Was
he
not
to
try
to
wipe
off
his
mark
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
that
he
wiped
it
off
very
quickly
;
 
and
since
that
he
has
wiped
off
another
mark
.
<EOS>
One
does
n't
know
how
many
marks
he
has
wiped
off
.
<EOS>
They
are
like
the
inn
-
keeper
's
score
which
he
makes
in
chalk
.
<EOS>
A
damp
cloth
brings
them
all
away
,
and
leaves
nothing
behind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
you
have
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
should
be
a
little
notch
on
the
stick
,
 
to
remember
by
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
that
I
complain
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
complain
,
as
I
was
not
notched
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
silly
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
not
having
allowed
myself
to
be
notched
by
this
great
champion
?
"
  
"
A
man
like
Mr.
Finn
has
his
life
to
deal
with
,
 
to
make
the
most
of
it
,
and
to
divide
it
between
work
,
pleasure
,
duty
,
ambition
,
and
the
rest
of
it
as
best
he
may
.
<EOS>
If
he
have
any
softness
of
heart
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
him
that
love
should
bear
a
part
in
all
these
interests
.
<EOS>
But
a
man
will
be
a
fool
who
will
allow
love
to
be
the
master
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
one
whose
mind
is
so
ill
-
balanced
as
to
allow
him
to
be
the
victim
of
a
single
wish
.
<EOS>
Even
in
a
woman
passion
such
as
that
is
evidence
of
weakness
,
and
not
of
strength
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
,
then
,
Laura
,
that
you
are
weak
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
if
I
am
,
does
that
condemn
him
?
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
,
if
I
judge
him
rightly
,
who
will
be
constant
as
the
sun
,
when
constancy
can
be
of
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
the
future
Mrs.
Finn
will
be
secure
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
I
mean
;
 
and
that
you
or
I
,
had
either
of
us
chosen
to
take
his
name
,
might
have
been
quite
secure
.
<EOS>
We
have
thought
it
right
to
refuse
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
many
more
,
I
wonder
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
unjust
,
and
unkind
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
So
unjust
and
unkind
that
it
is
clear
to
me
he
has
just
gratified
your
vanity
,
and
has
never
touched
your
heart
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
have
had
him
do
,
when
I
told
him
that
I
was
engaged
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
Mr.
Kennedy
would
not
have
gone
to
Blankenberg
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Violet
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
seems
to
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
.
<EOS>
But
even
that
does
not
adjust
things
finally
;
 
does
it
?
"
<EOS>
Then
some
one
came
upon
them
,
and
the
conversation
was
brought
to
an
end
.
   
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
's
Generosity
 
<EOS>
When
Phineas
Finn
left
Mr.
Gresham
's
house
he
had
quite
resolved
what
he
would
do
.
<EOS>
On
the
next
morning
he
would
tell
Lord
Cantrip
that
his
resignation
was
a
necessity
,
and
that
he
would
take
that
nobleman
's
advice
as
to
resigning
at
once
,
or
waiting
till
the
day
on
which
Mr.
Monk
's
Irish
Bill
would
be
read
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Finn
,
I
can
only
say
that
I
deeply
regret
it
,
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
do
I.
I
regret
to
leave
office
,
which
I
like
,
 
and
which
indeed
I
want
.
<EOS>
I
regret
specially
to
leave
this
office
,
as
it
has
been
a
thorough
pleasure
to
me
;
and
I
regret
,
above
all
,
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
convinced
that
Monk
is
right
,
and
I
find
it
impossible
not
to
support
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
that
Mr.
Monk
was
at
Bath
,
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
could
only
smile
,
and
shrug
his
shoulders
,
and
say
that
even
though
Mr.
Monk
were
at
Bath
it
would
not
probably
make
much
difference
.
<EOS>
When
he
tendered
his
letter
of
resignation
,
Lord
Cantrip
begged
him
to
withdraw
it
for
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
He
would
,
he
said
,
speak
to
Mr.
Gresham
.
<EOS>
The
debate
on
the
second
reading
of
Mr.
Monk
's
bill
would
not
take
place
till
that
day
week
,
and
the
resignation
would
be
in
time
if
it
was
tendered
before
Phineas
either
spoke
or
voted
against
the
Government
.
<EOS>
So
Phineas
went
back
to
his
room
,
and
endeavoured
to
make
himself
useful
in
some
work
appertaining
to
his
favourite
Colonies
.
  
<EOS>
That
conversation
had
taken
place
on
a
Friday
,
and
on
the
following
Sunday
,
early
in
the
day
,
he
left
his
rooms
after
a
late
breakfast
,
 
a
prolonged
breakfast
,
during
which
he
had
been
studying
tenant
-
right
statistics
,
preparing
his
own
speech
,
and
endeavouring
to
look
forward
into
the
future
which
that
speech
was
to
do
so
much
to
influence
,
 
and
turned
his
face
towards
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
certain
understanding
between
him
and
Madame
Goesler
that
he
was
to
call
in
Park
Lane
on
this
Sunday
morning
,
and
then
declare
to
her
what
was
his
final
resolve
as
to
the
office
which
he
held
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
simply
to
bid
her
adieu
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
for
I
shall
hardly
see
her
again
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
as
he
took
off
his
morning
easy
coat
,
and
dressed
himself
for
the
streets
,
and
stood
for
a
moment
before
his
looking
-
glass
,
and
saw
that
his
gloves
were
fresh
and
that
his
boots
were
properly
polished
,
I
think
there
was
a
care
about
his
person
which
he
would
have
hardly
taken
<EOS>
had
he
been
quite
assured
that
he
simply
intended
to
say
good
-
bye
to
the
lady
whom
he
was
about
to
visit
.
<EOS>
But
if
there
were
any
such
conscious
feeling
,
he
administered
to
himself
an
antidote
before
he
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
On
returning
to
the
sitting
-
room
he
went
to
a
little
desk
from
which
he
took
out
the
letter
from
Mary
which
the
reader
has
seen
,
and
carefully
perused
every
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
is
the
best
of
them
all
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
as
he
refolded
the
letter
and
put
it
back
into
his
desk
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
that
it
is
well
that
a
man
should
have
any
large
number
from
whom
to
select
a
best
;
as
,
in
such
circumstances
,
he
is
so
very
apt
to
change
his
judgment
from
hour
to
hour
.
<EOS>
The
qualities
which
are
the
most
attractive
before
dinner
sometimes
become
the
least
so
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
was
warm
,
and
he
took
a
cab
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
do
that
he
should
speak
even
his
last
farewell
to
such
a
one
as
Madame
Goesler
with
all
the
heat
and
dust
of
a
long
walk
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Having
been
so
careful
about
his
boots
and
gloves
he
might
as
well
use
his
care
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
was
a
very
pretty
woman
,
who
spared
herself
no
trouble
in
making
herself
as
pretty
as
Nature
would
allow
,
on
behalf
of
those
whom
she
favoured
with
her
smiles
;
and
to
such
a
lady
some
special
attention
was
due
by
one
who
had
received
so
many
of
her
smiles
as
had
Phineas
.
<EOS>
And
he
felt
,
too
,
that
there
was
something
special
in
this
very
visit
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
made
by
appointment
,
and
there
had
come
to
be
an
understanding
between
them
that
Phineas
should
tell
her
on
this
occasion
what
was
his
resolution
with
reference
to
his
future
life
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
he
had
been
very
wise
in
fortifying
himself
with
a
further
glance
at
our
dear
Mary
's
letter
,
before
he
trusted
himself
within
Madame
Goesler
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
was
at
home
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
by
Madame
Goesler
's
own
maid
,
who
,
smiling
,
explained
that
the
other
servants
were
all
at
church
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
become
sufficiently
intimate
at
the
cottage
in
Park
Lane
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
Madame
Goesler
's
own
maid
,
and
now
made
some
little
half
-
familiar
remark
as
to
the
propriety
of
his
visit
during
church
time
.
<EOS>
"
Madame
will
not
refuse
to
see
you
,
I
am
thinking
,
"
said
the
girl
,
who
was
a
German
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
is
alone
?
"
asked
Phineas
.
"
<EOS>
Alone
?
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
of
course
she
is
alone
.
<EOS>
Who
should
be
with
her
now
?
"
<EOS>
Then
she
took
him
up
into
the
drawing
-
room
;
but
,
when
there
,
he
found
that
Madame
Goesler
was
absent
.
<EOS>
"
She
shall
be
down
directly
,
"
said
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
tell
her
who
is
here
,
and
she
will
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
pretty
room
.
<EOS>
It
may
almost
be
said
that
there
could
be
no
prettier
room
in
all
London
.
<EOS>
It
looked
out
across
certain
small
private
gardens
,
 
which
were
as
bright
and
gay
as
money
could
make
them
when
brought
into
competition
with
London
smoke
,
 
right
on
to
the
park
.
<EOS>
Outside
and
inside
the
window
,
flowers
and
green
things
were
so
arranged
that
the
room
itself
almost
looked
as
though
it
were
a
bower
in
a
garden
.
<EOS>
And
everything
in
that
bower
was
rich
and
rare
;
and
there
was
nothing
there
which
annoyed
by
its
rarity
or
was
distasteful
by
its
richness
.
<EOS>
The
seats
,
though
they
were
costly
as
money
could
buy
,
were
meant
for
sitting
,
and
were
comfortable
as
seats
.
<EOS>
There
were
books
for
reading
,
and
the
means
of
reading
them
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
gems
of
English
art
were
hung
upon
the
walls
,
and
could
be
seen
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
mirrors
.
<EOS>
And
there
were
precious
toys
lying
here
and
there
about
the
room
,
 
toys
very
precious
,
but
placed
there
not
because
of
their
price
,
but
because
of
their
beauty
.
<EOS>
Phineas
already
knew
enough
of
the
art
of
living
to
be
aware
that
the
woman
who
had
made
that
room
what
it
was
,
had
charms
to
add
a
beauty
to
everything
she
touched
.
<EOS>
What
would
such
a
life
as
his
want
,
if
graced
by
such
a
companion
,
 
such
a
life
as
his
might
be
,
if
the
means
which
were
hers
were
at
his
command
?
<EOS>
It
would
want
one
thing
,
he
thought
,
 
the
self
-
respect
which
he
would
lose
if
he
were
false
to
the
girl
who
was
trusting
him
with
such
sweet
trust
at
home
in
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
very
few
minutes
Madame
Goesler
was
with
him
,
and
,
though
he
did
not
think
about
it
,
he
perceived
that
she
was
bright
in
her
apparel
,
that
her
hair
was
as
soft
as
care
could
make
it
,
and
that
every
charm
belonging
to
her
had
been
brought
into
use
for
his
gratification
.
<EOS>
He
almost
told
himself
that
he
was
there
in
order
that
he
might
ask
to
have
all
those
charms
bestowed
upon
himself
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
who
had
lately
come
to
Park
Lane
and
been
a
suppliant
for
the
possession
of
those
rich
endowments
;
but
I
wonder
whether
they
would
have
been
more
precious
in
his
eyes
<EOS>
had
he
known
that
they
had
so
moved
the
heart
of
the
great
Duke
as
to
have
induced
him
to
lay
his
coronet
at
the
lady
's
feet
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
had
he
known
that
the
lady
had
refused
the
coronet
,
that
knowledge
would
have
enhanced
the
value
of
the
prize
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
an
owl
not
to
be
ready
for
you
when
you
told
me
that
you
would
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
but
a
bird
of
paradise
to
come
to
me
so
sweetly
,
and
at
an
hour
when
all
the
other
birds
refuse
to
show
the
feather
of
a
single
wing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
,
 
you
feel
like
a
naughty
boy
,
do
you
not
,
in
thus
coming
out
on
a
Sunday
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
feel
like
a
naughty
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
just
a
little
so
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
that
I
should
care
for
everybody
to
hear
that
I
received
visitors
,
 
or
worse
still
,
a
visitor
,
 
at
this
hour
on
this
day
.
<EOS>
But
then
it
is
so
pleasant
to
feel
oneself
to
be
naughty
!
<EOS>
There
is
a
Bohemian
flavour
of
picnic
about
it
which
,
though
it
does
not
come
up
to
the
rich
gusto
of
real
wickedness
,
makes
one
fancy
that
one
is
on
the
border
of
that
delightful
region
in
which
there
is
none
of
the
constraint
of
custom
,
 
where
men
and
women
say
what
they
like
,
and
do
what
they
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
pleasant
enough
to
be
on
the
borders
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
just
it
.
<EOS>
Of
course
decency
,
morality
,
and
propriety
,
all
made
to
suit
the
eye
of
the
public
,
are
the
things
which
are
really
delightful
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
,
and
live
accordingly
,
 
as
well
as
we
can
.
<EOS>
I
do
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
do
not
I
,
Madame
Goesler
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
that
,
Mr.
Finn
,
and
want
to
ask
no
questions
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
do
,
I
am
sure
you
agree
with
me
that
you
often
envy
the
improper
people
,
 
the
Bohemians
,
 
the
people
who
do
n't
trouble
themselves
about
keeping
any
laws
except
those
for
breaking
which
they
would
be
put
into
nasty
,
unpleasant
prisons
.
<EOS>
I
envy
them
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
I
envy
them
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
free
as
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
most
cabined
,
cribbed
,
and
confined
creature
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
fighting
my
way
up
for
the
last
four
years
,
and
have
not
allowed
myself
the
liberty
of
one
flirtation
;
 
not
often
even
the
recreation
of
a
natural
laugh
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
should
n't
wonder
if
I
do
n't
find
myself
falling
back
a
year
or
two
,
just
because
I
have
allowed
you
to
come
and
see
me
on
a
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
When
I
told
Lotta
that
you
were
coming
,
she
shook
her
head
at
me
in
dismay
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
you
are
here
,
tell
me
what
you
have
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
as
yet
,
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
to
have
been
settled
on
Friday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
settled
,
 
before
Friday
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
as
I
look
back
at
it
all
now
,
I
can
hardly
tell
when
it
was
not
settled
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
,
and
has
been
impossible
,
that
I
should
do
otherwise
.
<EOS>
I
still
hold
my
place
,
Madame
Goesler
,
but
I
have
declared
that
I
shall
give
it
up
before
the
debate
comes
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
fixed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
fixed
,
my
friend
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
what
next
?
"
<EOS>
Madame
Goesler
,
as
she
thus
interrogated
him
,
was
leaning
across
towards
him
from
the
sofa
on
which
she
was
placed
,
with
both
her
elbows
resting
on
a
small
table
before
her
.
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
look
of
true
interest
which
the
countenance
of
a
real
friend
will
bear
when
the
welfare
of
his
friend
is
in
question
.
<EOS>
There
are
doubtless
some
who
can
assume
it
without
feeling
,
 
as
there
are
actors
who
can
personate
all
the
passions
.
<EOS>
But
in
ordinary
life
we
think
that
we
can
trust
such
a
face
,
and
that
we
know
the
true
look
when
we
see
it
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
as
he
gazed
into
Madame
Goesler
's
eyes
,
was
sure
that
the
lady
opposite
him
was
not
acting
.
<EOS>
She
at
least
was
anxious
for
his
welfare
,
and
was
making
his
cares
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
What
next
?
"
said
she
,
repeating
her
words
in
a
tone
that
was
somewhat
hurried
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
that
there
will
be
any
next
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
public
life
is
concerned
,
there
will
be
no
next
for
me
,
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
out
of
the
question
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
made
for
public
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
shall
be
untrue
to
my
making
,
I
fear
.
<EOS>
But
to
speak
plainly
 
"
  
"
Yes
;
speak
plainly
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
understand
the
reality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
reality
is
this
.
<EOS>
I
shall
keep
my
seat
to
the
end
of
the
session
,
as
I
think
I
may
be
of
use
.
<EOS>
After
that
I
shall
give
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Resign
that
too
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
in
a
tone
of
chagrin
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
chances
are
,
I
think
,
that
there
will
be
another
dissolution
.
<EOS>
If
they
hold
their
own
against
Mr.
Monk
's
motion
,
then
they
will
pass
an
Irish
Reform
Bill
.
<EOS>
After
that
I
think
they
must
dissolve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
not
come
forward
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
afford
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Psha
!
<EOS>
Some
five
hundred
pounds
or
so
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
,
besides
that
,
I
am
well
aware
that
my
only
chance
at
my
old
profession
is
to
give
up
all
idea
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
The
two
things
are
not
compatible
for
a
beginner
at
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
now
,
and
have
bought
my
knowledge
by
a
bitter
experience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
where
will
you
live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
Dublin
,
probably
.
"
  
"
And
you
will
do
,
 
will
do
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Anything
honest
in
a
barrister
's
way
that
may
be
brought
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
that
I
may
never
descend
below
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
stand
up
for
all
the
blackguards
,
and
try
to
make
out
that
the
thieves
did
not
steal
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
that
that
sort
of
work
may
come
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
you
will
wear
a
wig
and
try
to
look
wise
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
wig
is
not
universal
in
Ireland
,
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
wrangle
,
as
though
your
very
soul
were
in
it
,
for
somebody
's
twenty
pounds
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Exactly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
already
made
a
name
in
the
greatest
senate
in
the
world
,
and
have
governed
other
countries
larger
than
your
own
 
"
  
"
No
;
 
I
have
not
done
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
governed
no
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
my
friend
,
that
you
can
not
do
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Men
may
move
forward
from
little
work
to
big
work
;
but
they
can
not
move
back
and
do
little
work
,
when
they
have
had
tasks
which
were
really
great
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
that
the
House
of
Parliament
is
the
place
for
you
to
work
in
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
only
place
;
 
that
and
the
abodes
of
Ministers
.
<EOS>
Am
not
I
your
friend
who
tell
you
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
you
are
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
you
not
credit
me
when
I
tell
you
this
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
fear
,
that
you
should
run
away
?
<EOS>
You
have
no
wife
;
 
no
children
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
coming
misfortune
that
you
dread
?
"
<EOS>
She
paused
a
moment
as
though
for
an
answer
,
and
he
felt
that
now
had
come
the
time
in
which
it
would
be
well
that
he
should
tell
her
of
his
engagement
with
his
own
Mary
.
<EOS>
She
had
received
him
very
playfully
;
but
now
within
the
last
few
minutes
there
had
come
upon
her
a
seriousness
of
gesture
,
and
almost
a
solemnity
of
tone
,
which
made
him
conscious
that
he
should
in
no
way
trifle
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
earnest
in
her
friendship
that
he
owed
it
to
her
to
tell
her
everything
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
could
think
of
the
words
in
which
his
tale
should
be
told
,
she
had
gone
on
with
her
quick
questions
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
solely
about
money
that
you
fear
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
simply
that
I
have
no
income
on
which
to
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
not
offered
you
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Madame
Goesler
,
you
who
offer
it
would
yourself
despise
me
if
I
took
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
I
do
deny
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
she
said
this
,
 
not
loudly
but
with
much
emphasis
,
 
she
came
and
stood
before
him
where
he
was
sitting
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
looked
at
her
he
could
perceive
that
there
was
a
strength
about
her
of
which
he
had
not
been
aware
.
<EOS>
She
was
stronger
,
larger
,
more
robust
physically
than
he
had
hitherto
conceived
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
deny
it
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Money
is
neither
god
nor
devil
,
that
it
should
make
one
noble
and
another
vile
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
accident
,
and
,
if
honestly
possessed
,
may
pass
from
you
to
me
,
or
from
me
to
you
,
without
a
stain
.
<EOS>
You
may
take
my
dinner
from
me
if
I
give
it
you
,
<EOS>
my
flowers
,
my
friendship
,
my
,
 
my
,
 
my
everything
,
but
my
money
!
<EOS>
Explain
to
me
the
cause
of
the
phenomenon
.
<EOS>
If
I
give
to
you
a
thousand
pounds
,
now
this
moment
,
and
you
take
it
,
you
are
base
;
 
but
if
I
leave
it
you
in
my
will
,
 
and
die
,
 
<EOS>
you
take
it
,
and
are
not
base
.
<EOS>
Explain
to
me
the
cause
of
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
said
it
quite
all
,
"
said
Phineas
hoarsely
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
left
unsaid
?
<EOS>
If
I
have
left
anything
unsaid
,
do
you
say
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
you
are
a
woman
,
and
young
,
and
beautiful
,
that
no
man
may
take
wealth
from
your
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
is
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
that
partly
,
"
  
"
If
I
were
a
man
you
might
take
it
,
though
I
were
young
and
beautiful
as
the
morning
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
presents
of
money
are
always
bad
.
<EOS>
They
stain
and
load
the
spirit
,
and
break
the
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
specially
when
given
by
a
woman
's
hand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
so
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
argue
of
it
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
us
talk
of
it
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
can
I
argue
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
argue
,
but
I
can
be
generous
,
 
very
generous
.
<EOS>
I
can
deny
myself
for
my
friend
,
 
can
even
lower
myself
in
my
own
esteem
for
my
friend
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
more
than
a
man
can
do
for
a
friend
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
take
money
from
my
hand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Madame
Goesler
;
 
I
can
not
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
the
hand
then
first
.
<EOS>
When
it
and
all
that
it
holds
are
your
own
,
you
can
help
yourself
as
you
list
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
stood
before
him
with
her
right
hand
stretched
out
towards
him
.
  
<EOS>
What
man
will
say
that
he
would
not
have
been
tempted
?
<EOS>
Or
what
woman
will
declare
that
such
temptation
should
have
had
no
force
?
<EOS>
The
very
air
of
the
room
in
which
she
dwelt
was
sweet
in
his
nostrils
,
and
there
hovered
around
her
an
halo
of
grace
and
beauty
which
greeted
all
his
senses
.
<EOS>
She
invited
him
to
join
his
lot
to
hers
,
in
order
that
she
might
give
to
him
all
that
was
needed
to
make
his
life
rich
and
glorious
.
<EOS>
How
would
the
Ratlers
and
the
Bonteens
envy
him
when
they
heard
of
the
prize
which
had
become
his
!
<EOS>
The
Cantrips
and
the
Greshams
would
feel
that
he
was
a
friend
doubly
valuable
,
if
he
could
be
won
back
;
and
Mr.
Monk
would
greet
him
as
a
fitting
ally
,
 
an
ally
strong
with
the
strength
which
he
had
before
wanted
.
<EOS>
With
whom
would
he
not
be
equal
?
<EOS>
Whom
need
he
fear
?
<EOS>
Who
would
not
praise
him
?
<EOS>
The
story
of
his
poor
Mary
would
be
known
only
in
a
small
village
,
out
beyond
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
The
temptation
certainly
was
very
strong
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
a
moment
in
which
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
there
with
her
face
turned
from
him
,
but
with
her
hand
still
stretched
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
took
it
.
<EOS>
What
man
so
placed
could
do
other
than
take
a
woman
's
hand
?
  
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
called
friend
by
you
no
more
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
call
me
Marie
,
your
own
Marie
,
or
you
must
never
call
me
by
any
name
again
.
<EOS>
Which
shall
it
be
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
He
paused
a
moment
,
holding
her
hand
,
and
she
let
it
lie
there
for
an
instant
while
she
listened
.
<EOS>
But
still
she
did
not
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Speak
to
me
!
<EOS>
Tell
me
!
<EOS>
Which
shall
it
be
?
"
<EOS>
Still
he
paused
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
as
you
have
hinted
to
me
,
"
he
said
at
last
.
<EOS>
His
words
did
not
come
louder
than
a
low
whisper
;
but
they
were
plainly
heard
,
and
instantly
the
hand
was
withdrawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
not
be
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Then
I
have
betrayed
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
 
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
;
I
say
yes
!
<EOS>
If
you
will
allow
me
I
will
leave
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
I
know
,
excuse
me
if
I
am
abrupt
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
she
strode
out
of
the
room
,
and
was
no
more
seen
of
the
eyes
of
Phineas
Finn
.
  
<EOS>
He
never
afterwards
knew
how
he
escaped
out
of
that
room
and
found
his
way
into
Park
Lane
.
<EOS>
In
after
days
he
had
some
memory
that
he
remained
there
,
he
knew
not
how
long
,
standing
on
the
very
spot
on
which
she
had
left
him
;
and
that
at
last
there
grew
upon
him
almost
a
fear
of
moving
,
a
dread
lest
he
should
be
heard
,
an
inordinate
desire
to
escape
without
the
sound
of
a
footfall
,
without
the
clicking
of
a
lock
.
<EOS>
Everything
in
that
house
had
been
offered
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
refused
it
all
,
and
then
felt
that
of
all
human
beings
under
the
sun
none
had
so
little
right
to
be
standing
there
as
he
.
<EOS>
His
very
presence
in
that
drawing
-
room
was
an
insult
to
the
woman
whom
he
had
driven
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
length
he
was
in
the
street
,
and
had
found
his
way
across
Piccadilly
into
the
Green
Park
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
soon
as
he
could
find
a
spot
apart
from
the
Sunday
world
,
he
threw
himself
upon
the
turf
;
and
tried
to
fix
his
thoughts
upon
the
thing
that
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
His
first
feeling
,
I
think
,
was
one
of
pure
and
unmixed
disappointment
;
 
of
disappointment
so
bitter
,
that
even
the
vision
of
his
own
Mary
did
not
tend
to
comfort
him
.
<EOS>
How
great
might
have
been
his
success
,
and
how
terrible
was
his
failure
!
<EOS>
Had
he
taken
the
woman
's
hand
and
her
money
,
had
he
clenched
his
grasp
on
the
great
prize
offered
to
him
,
his
misery
would
have
been
ten
times
worse
the
first
moment
that
he
would
have
been
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
Then
,
indeed
,
 
it
being
so
that
he
was
a
man
with
a
heart
within
his
breast
<EOS>
,
 
there
would
have
been
no
comfort
for
him
,
in
his
outlooks
on
any
side
.
<EOS>
But
even
now
,
when
he
had
done
right
,
 
knowing
well
that
he
had
done
right
,
 
he
found
that
comfort
did
not
come
readily
within
his
reach
.
   
<EOS>
Amantium
Iræ
 
<EOS>
Miss
Effingham
's
life
at
this
time
was
not
the
happiest
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Her
lines
,
as
she
once
said
to
her
friend
Lady
Laura
,
were
not
laid
for
her
in
pleasant
places
.
<EOS>
Her
residence
was
still
with
her
aunt
,
and
she
had
come
to
find
that
it
was
almost
impossible
any
longer
to
endure
Lady
Baldock
,
and
quite
impossible
to
escape
from
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
In
former
days
she
had
had
a
dream
that
she
might
escape
,
and
live
alone
if
she
chose
to
be
alone
;
that
she
might
be
independent
in
her
life
,
as
a
man
is
independent
,
if
she
chose
to
live
after
that
fashion
;
that
she
might
take
her
own
fortune
in
her
own
hand
,
as
the
law
certainly
allowed
her
to
do
,
and
act
with
it
as
she
might
please
.
<EOS>
But
latterly
she
had
learned
to
understand
that
all
this
was
not
possible
for
her
.
<EOS>
Though
one
law
allowed
it
,
another
law
disallowed
it
,
and
the
latter
law
was
at
least
as
powerful
as
the
former
.
<EOS>
And
then
her
present
misery
was
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
she
was
now
banished
from
the
second
home
which
she
had
formerly
possessed
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
<EOS>
she
had
always
been
able
to
escape
from
Lady
Baldock
to
the
house
of
her
friend
,
but
now
such
escape
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Lady
Laura
and
Lord
Chiltern
lived
in
the
same
house
,
and
Violet
could
not
live
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
understood
all
this
,
and
tortured
her
niece
accordingly
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
premeditated
torture
.
<EOS>
The
aunt
did
not
mean
to
make
her
niece
's
life
a
burden
to
her
,
and
,
so
intending
,
systematically
work
upon
a
principle
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
,
no
doubt
,
desired
to
do
her
duty
conscientiously
.
<EOS>
But
the
result
was
torture
to
poor
Violet
,
and
a
strong
conviction
on
the
mind
of
each
of
the
two
ladies
that
the
other
was
the
most
unreasonable
being
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
The
aunt
,
in
these
days
,
had
taken
it
into
her
head
to
talk
of
poor
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
This
arose
partly
from
a
belief
that
the
quarrel
was
final
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
there
would
be
no
danger
in
aggravating
Violet
by
this
expression
of
pity
,
 
partly
from
a
feeling
that
it
would
be
better
that
her
niece
should
marry
Lord
Chiltern
than
that
she
should
not
marry
at
all
,
 
and
partly
,
perhaps
,
from
the
general
principle
that
,
as
she
thought
it
right
to
scold
her
niece
on
all
occasions
,
this
might
be
best
done
by
taking
an
opposite
view
of
all
questions
to
that
taken
by
the
niece
to
be
scolded
.
<EOS>
Violet
was
supposed
to
regard
Lord
Chiltern
as
having
sinned
against
her
,
and
therefore
Lady
Baldock
talked
of
"
poor
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
other
lovers
,
she
had
begun
to
perceive
that
their
conditions
were
hopeless
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
Augusta
had
explained
to
her
that
there
was
no
chance
remaining
either
for
Phineas
,
or
for
Lord
Fawn
,
or
for
Mr.
Appledom
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
she
will
be
an
old
maid
,
on
purpose
to
bring
me
to
my
grave
,
"
said
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
When
,
therefore
,
Lady
Baldock
was
told
one
day
that
Lord
Chiltern
was
in
the
house
,
and
was
asking
to
see
Miss
Effingham
<EOS>
,
she
did
not
at
once
faint
away
,
and
declare
that
they
would
all
be
murdered
,
 
as
she
would
have
done
some
months
since
.
<EOS>
She
was
perplexed
by
a
double
duty
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
possible
that
Violet
should
relent
and
be
reconciled
,
then
it
would
be
her
duty
to
save
Violet
from
the
claws
of
the
wild
beast
.
<EOS>
But
if
there
was
no
such
chance
,
then
it
would
be
her
duty
to
poor
Lord
Chiltern
to
see
that
he
was
not
treated
with
contumely
and
ill
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
she
know
that
he
is
here
?
"
<EOS>
Lady
Baldock
asked
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
oh
dear
!
<EOS>
I
suppose
she
ought
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
has
given
him
so
much
encouragement
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
will
do
as
she
pleases
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Augusta
,
how
can
you
talk
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
Am
I
to
have
no
control
in
my
own
house
?
<EOS>
"
It
was
,
however
,
soon
apparent
to
her
that
in
this
matter
she
was
to
have
no
control
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
Chiltern
is
down
-
stairs
,
"
said
Violet
,
coming
into
the
room
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
Augusta
tells
me
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
sit
down
,
aunt
,
 
not
just
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
sent
down
to
say
that
I
would
be
with
him
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
most
impatient
soul
alive
,
and
I
must
not
keep
him
waiting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
mean
to
see
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
shall
see
him
,
"
said
Violet
,
as
she
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
that
any
woman
should
ever
take
upon
herself
the
charge
of
a
niece
!
"
said
Lady
Baldock
to
her
daughter
in
a
despondent
tone
,
as
she
held
up
her
hands
in
dismay
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Violet
had
gone
down
-
stairs
with
a
quick
step
,
and
had
then
boldly
entered
the
room
in
which
her
lover
was
waiting
to
receive
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
to
thank
you
for
coming
to
me
,
Violet
,
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
There
was
still
in
his
face
something
of
savagery
,
 
an
expression
partly
of
anger
and
partly
of
resolution
to
tame
the
thing
with
which
he
was
angry
.
<EOS>
Violet
did
not
regard
the
anger
half
so
keenly
as
she
did
that
resolution
of
taming
.
<EOS>
An
angry
lord
,
she
thought
,
she
could
endure
,
but
she
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
being
tamed
by
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
not
come
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
came
when
I
was
told
that
you
were
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
there
need
be
a
quarrel
between
us
,
because
we
have
changed
our
minds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
changes
make
quarrels
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
not
do
so
with
me
,
unless
you
choose
that
it
shall
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
we
be
enemies
,
 
we
who
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
children
?
<EOS>
My
dearest
friends
are
your
father
and
your
sister
.
<EOS>
Why
should
we
be
enemies
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
ask
you
whether
you
think
that
I
have
ill
-
used
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ill
-
used
me
!
<EOS>
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
Has
any
one
told
you
that
I
have
accused
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
has
told
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
you
ask
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
would
not
have
you
think
so
,
 
if
I
could
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
intend
to
be
rough
with
you
.
<EOS>
When
you
told
me
that
my
life
was
disreputable
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
,
Oswald
,
do
not
let
us
go
back
to
that
.
<EOS>
What
good
will
it
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
that
was
your
word
,
 
the
harshest
word
that
you
could
use
in
all
the
language
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
to
be
harsh
.
<EOS>
If
I
used
it
,
I
will
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
Only
let
there
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
we
think
so
differently
about
life
in
general
,
it
was
better
that
we
should
not
be
married
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
settled
,
and
why
should
we
go
back
to
words
that
were
spoken
in
haste
,
and
which
are
simply
disagreeable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
to
know
whether
it
is
settled
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
.
<EOS>
You
settled
it
yourself
,
Oswald
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
what
I
thought
myself
bound
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
used
language
which
I
should
not
have
used
.
<EOS>
Then
you
told
me
that
I
could
not
be
your
wife
;
 
and
I
thought
you
were
right
,
quite
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
wrong
,
quite
wrong
,
"
he
said
impetuously
.
"
<EOS>
So
wrong
,
that
I
can
never
forgive
myself
,
if
you
do
not
relent
.
<EOS>
I
was
such
a
fool
,
that
I
can
not
forgive
myself
my
folly
.
<EOS>
I
had
known
before
that
I
could
not
live
without
you
;
and
when
you
were
mine
,
I
threw
you
away
for
an
angry
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
an
angry
word
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
it
again
,
and
let
me
have
another
chance
to
answer
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
said
that
idleness
was
not
,
 
respectable
,
or
something
like
that
,
taken
out
of
a
copy
-
book
probably
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
a
man
who
do
not
like
rebukes
,
even
out
of
copy
-
books
.
<EOS>
A
man
so
thin
-
skinned
as
you
are
must
choose
for
himself
a
wife
with
a
softer
tongue
than
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
choose
none
other
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
But
still
he
was
savage
in
his
tone
and
in
his
gestures
.
<EOS>
"
I
made
my
choice
long
since
,
as
you
know
well
enough
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
change
easily
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
change
in
this
.
<EOS>
Violet
,
say
that
you
will
be
my
wife
once
more
,
and
I
will
swear
to
work
for
you
like
a
coal
-
heaver
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
wish
is
that
my
husband
,
 
should
I
ever
have
one
,
 
should
work
,
not
exactly
as
a
coal
-
heaver
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Violet
,
"
he
said
,
 
and
<EOS>
now
the
look
of
savagery
departed
from
him
,
and
there
came
a
smile
over
his
face
,
which
,
however
,
had
in
it
more
of
sadness
than
of
hope
or
joy
,
 
"
treat
me
fairly
,
 
or
rather
,
treat
me
generously
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
whether
you
ever
loved
me
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
much
,
 
years
ago
,
when
you
were
a
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
not
since
?
<EOS>
If
it
be
so
,
I
had
better
go
.
<EOS>
Love
on
one
side
only
is
a
poor
affair
at
best
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
poor
affair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
better
to
bear
anything
than
to
try
and
make
out
life
with
that
.
<EOS>
Some
of
you
women
never
want
to
love
any
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
what
I
was
saying
of
myself
to
Laura
but
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
With
some
women
it
is
so
easy
.
<EOS>
With
others
it
is
so
difficult
,
that
perhaps
it
never
comes
to
them
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
with
me
 
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
better
in
these
matters
to
confine
oneself
to
generalities
.
<EOS>
If
you
please
,
I
will
not
describe
myself
personally
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
do
so
,
doubtless
I
should
do
it
falsely
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
love
no
one
else
,
Violet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
affair
,
my
lord
.
"
  
"
By
heavens
,
and
it
is
mine
too
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
that
you
do
,
and
I
will
go
away
and
leave
you
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
ask
his
name
,
and
I
will
trouble
you
no
more
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
not
so
,
and
if
it
is
possible
that
you
should
forgive
me
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Forgive
you
!
<EOS>
When
have
I
been
angry
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
my
question
,
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
answer
you
your
question
,
 
not
that
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
question
will
you
answer
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
that
may
concern
yourself
and
myself
.
<EOS>
None
that
may
concern
other
people
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
told
me
once
that
you
loved
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
moment
I
told
you
that
I
did
so
,
 
years
ago
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
now
?
"
  
"
That
is
another
matter
.
"
  
"
Violet
,
do
you
love
me
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
a
point
-
blank
question
at
any
rate
,
"
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
answer
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
answer
it
,
 
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Oswald
,
what
a
fool
you
are
!
<EOS>
Love
you
!
<EOS>
of
course
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
understand
anything
,
you
ought
to
know
that
I
have
never
loved
any
one
else
;
 
that
after
what
has
passed
between
us
,
I
never
shall
love
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
do
love
you
.
<EOS>
There
.
<EOS>
Whether
you
throw
me
away
from
you
,
as
you
did
the
other
day
,
 
with
great
scorn
,
mind
you
,
 
or
come
to
me
with
sweet
,
beautiful
promises
,
as
you
do
now
,
I
shall
love
you
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
your
wife
,
if
you
will
not
have
me
;
can
I
?
<EOS>
When
you
run
away
in
your
tantrums
because
I
quote
something
out
of
the
copy
-
book
,
I
ca
n't
run
after
you
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
pretty
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
loving
you
,
if
you
doubt
that
,
I
tell
you
,
you
are
a
 
fool
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
spoke
the
last
words
she
pouted
out
her
lips
at
him
,
and
when
he
looked
into
her
face
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
now
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
so
that
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
look
into
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
fool
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
 
you
are
;
but
I
do
n't
love
you
the
less
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
doubt
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
;
 
do
not
;
and
,
for
me
,
I
will
not
say
another
word
,
whether
you
choose
to
heave
coals
or
not
.
<EOS>
You
shall
do
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
meant
to
be
very
wise
;
 
I
did
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
grandest
girl
that
ever
was
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
want
to
be
grand
at
all
,
and
I
never
will
be
wise
any
more
.
<EOS>
Only
do
not
frown
at
me
and
look
savage
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
she
put
up
her
hand
to
smooth
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
half
afraid
of
you
still
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
There
.
<EOS>
That
will
do
.
<EOS>
Now
let
me
go
,
that
I
may
tell
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
During
the
last
two
months
she
has
been
full
of
pity
for
poor
Lord
Chiltern
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
poor
Lord
Chiltern
with
a
vengeance
!
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
now
that
we
have
made
it
up
,
she
will
be
horrified
again
at
all
your
wickednesses
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
a
turtle
dove
lately
;
 
now
you
will
be
an
ogre
again
.
<EOS>
But
,
Oswald
,
you
must
not
be
an
ogre
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
could
get
quit
of
her
lover
,
she
did
tell
her
tale
to
Lady
Baldock
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
accepted
him
again
!
"
<EOS>
said
her
aunt
,
holding
up
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
 
I
have
accepted
him
again
,
"
replied
Violet
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
responsibility
must
be
on
your
own
shoulders
,
"
said
her
aunt
;
<EOS>
"
I
wash
my
hands
of
it
.
"
<EOS>
That
evening
,
when
she
discussed
the
matter
with
her
daughter
,
Lady
Baldock
spoke
of
Violet
and
Lord
Chiltern
,
as
though
their
intended
marriage
were
the
one
thing
in
the
world
which
she
most
deplored
.
   
<EOS>
The
Beginning
of
the
End
 
<EOS>
The
day
of
the
debate
had
come
,
and
Phineas
Finn
was
still
sitting
in
his
room
at
the
Colonial
Office
.
<EOS>
But
his
resignation
had
been
sent
in
and
accepted
,
and
he
was
simply
awaiting
the
coming
of
his
successor
.
<EOS>
About
noon
his
successor
came
,
and
he
had
the
gratification
of
resigning
his
arm
-
chair
to
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
It
is
generally
understood
that
gentlemen
leaving
offices
give
up
either
seals
or
a
portfolio
.
<EOS>
Phineas
had
been
put
in
possession
of
no
seal
and
no
portfolio
;
but
there
was
in
the
room
which
he
had
occupied
a
special
arm
-
chair
,
and
this
with
much
regret
he
surrendered
to
the
use
and
comfort
of
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
glance
of
triumph
in
his
enemy
's
eyes
,
and
an
exultation
in
the
tone
of
his
enemy
's
voice
,
which
were
very
bitter
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
are
really
going
?
"
said
Mr.
Bonteen
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
I
dare
say
it
is
all
very
proper
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
quite
understand
the
thing
myself
,
but
I
have
no
doubt
you
are
right
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
easy
to
understand
;
is
it
?
"
said
Phineas
,
trying
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Bonteen
did
not
feel
the
intended
satire
,
and
poor
Phineas
found
it
useless
to
attempt
to
punish
the
man
he
hated
.
<EOS>
He
left
him
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
and
went
to
say
a
few
words
of
farewell
to
his
late
chief
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Finn
,
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
great
trouble
to
me
that
we
should
have
to
part
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
to
me
also
,
my
lord
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
could
have
been
avoided
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
gone
to
Ireland
with
so
dangerous
a
man
as
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
milk
is
spilt
;
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
these
terrible
rendings
asunder
never
last
very
long
,
"
said
Lord
Cantrip
,
"
unless
a
man
changes
his
opinions
altogether
.
<EOS>
How
many
quarrels
and
how
many
reconciliations
we
have
lived
to
see
!
<EOS>
I
remember
when
Gresham
went
out
of
office
,
because
he
could
not
sit
in
the
same
room
with
Mr.
Mildmay
,
and
yet
they
became
the
fastest
of
political
friends
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
time
when
Plinlimmon
and
the
Duke
could
not
stable
their
horses
together
at
all
;
and
do
n't
you
remember
when
Palliser
was
obliged
to
give
up
his
hopes
of
office
because
he
had
some
bee
in
his
bonnet
?
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
however
,
that
the
bee
in
Mr.
Palliser
's
bonnet
to
which
Lord
Cantrip
was
alluding
made
its
buzzing
audible
on
some
subject
that
was
not
exactly
political
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
you
back
again
before
long
,
I
do
n't
doubt
.
<EOS>
Men
who
can
really
do
their
work
are
too
rare
to
be
left
long
in
the
comfort
of
the
benches
below
the
gangway
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
very
kindly
said
,
and
Phineas
was
flattered
and
comforted
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
make
Lord
Cantrip
understand
the
whole
truth
.
<EOS>
For
him
the
dream
of
a
life
of
politics
was
over
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
had
tried
it
,
and
had
succeeded
beyond
his
utmost
hopes
;
but
,
in
spite
of
his
success
,
the
ground
had
crumbled
to
pieces
beneath
his
feet
,
and
he
knew
that
he
could
never
recover
the
niche
in
the
world
's
gallery
which
he
was
now
leaving
.
  
<EOS>
That
same
afternoon
he
met
Mr.
Gresham
in
one
of
the
passages
leading
to
the
House
,
and
the
Prime
Minister
put
his
arm
through
that
of
our
hero
as
they
walked
together
into
the
lobby
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
that
we
are
losing
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
sure
that
I
am
sorry
to
be
so
lost
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
These
things
will
occur
in
political
life
,
"
said
the
leader
;
"
but
I
think
that
they
seldom
leave
rancour
behind
them
when
the
purpose
is
declared
,
and
when
the
subject
of
disagreement
is
marked
and
understood
.
<EOS>
The
defalcation
which
creates
angry
feeling
is
that
which
has
to
be
endured
without
previous
warning
,
 
when
a
man
votes
against
his
party
,
 
or
a
set
of
men
,
from
private
pique
or
from
some
cause
which
is
never
clear
.
"
<EOS>
Phineas
,
when
he
heard
this
,
knew
well
how
terribly
this
very
man
had
been
harassed
,
and
driven
nearly
wild
,
by
defalcation
,
exactly
of
that
nature
which
he
was
attempting
to
describe
.
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
you
and
Mr.
Monk
think
you
are
right
,
"
continued
Mr.
Gresham
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
given
strong
evidence
that
we
think
so
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
We
give
up
our
places
,
and
we
are
,
both
of
us
,
very
poor
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
wrong
,
you
know
,
not
so
much
in
your
views
on
the
question
itself
 
which
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
hardly
understand
as
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
endeavour
to
explain
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
will
do
so
very
clearly
,
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
that
Mr.
Monk
was
wrong
in
desiring
,
as
a
member
of
a
Government
,
to
force
a
measure
which
,
whether
good
or
bad
,
the
Government
as
a
body
does
not
desire
to
initiate
,
 
at
any
rate
,
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
he
resigned
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
to
me
that
he
failed
to
comprehend
the
only
way
in
which
a
great
party
can
act
together
,
if
it
is
to
do
any
service
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
for
a
moment
think
that
I
am
blaming
him
or
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
nobody
in
this
matter
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
that
we
have
not
regarded
you
in
that
light
,
and
I
hope
that
the
time
may
come
when
we
may
be
sitting
together
again
on
the
same
bench
.
"
  
<EOS>
Neither
on
the
Treasury
bench
nor
on
any
other
in
that
House
was
he
to
sit
again
after
this
fashion
!
<EOS>
That
was
the
trouble
which
was
crushing
his
spirit
at
this
moment
,
and
not
the
loss
of
his
office
!
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
could
not
venture
to
think
of
remaining
in
London
as
a
member
of
Parliament
with
no
other
income
than
that
which
his
father
could
allow
him
,
even
if
he
could
again
secure
a
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
first
been
returned
for
Loughshane
he
had
assured
his
friends
that
his
duty
as
a
member
of
the
House
of
Commons
would
not
be
a
bar
to
his
practice
in
the
Courts
.
<EOS>
He
had
now
been
five
years
a
member
,
and
had
never
once
made
an
attempt
at
doing
any
part
of
a
barrister
's
work
.
<EOS>
He
had
gone
altogether
into
a
different
line
of
life
,
and
had
been
most
successful
;
 
so
successful
that
men
told
him
,
and
women
more
frequently
than
men
,
that
his
career
had
been
a
miracle
of
success
.
<EOS>
But
there
had
been
,
as
he
had
well
known
from
the
first
,
this
drawback
in
the
new
profession
which
he
had
chosen
,
that
nothing
in
it
could
be
permanent
.
<EOS>
They
who
succeed
in
it
,
may
probably
succeed
again
;
but
then
the
success
is
intermittent
,
and
there
may
be
years
of
hard
work
in
opposition
,
to
which
,
unfortunately
,
no
pay
is
assigned
.
<EOS>
It
is
almost
imperative
,
as
he
now
found
,
that
they
who
devote
themselves
to
such
a
profession
should
be
men
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
commenced
his
work
,
 
at
the
period
of
his
first
return
for
Loughshane
,
 
he
had
had
no
thought
of
mending
his
deficiency
in
this
respect
by
a
rich
marriage
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
it
ever
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
seek
a
marriage
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
Such
an
idea
would
have
been
thoroughly
distasteful
to
him
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
stain
of
premeditated
mercenary
arrangement
upon
him
at
any
time
.
<EOS>
But
circumstances
had
so
fallen
out
with
him
,
that
as
he
won
his
spurs
in
Parliament
,
as
he
became
known
,
and
was
placed
first
in
one
office
and
then
in
another
,
prospects
of
love
and
money
together
were
opened
to
him
,
and
he
ventured
on
,
leaving
Mr.
Low
and
the
law
behind
him
,
 
because
these
prospects
were
so
alluring
.
<EOS>
Then
had
come
Mr.
Monk
and
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
 
and
everything
around
him
had
collapsed
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
around
him
had
collapsed
,
 
with
,
however
,
a
terrible
temptation
to
him
to
inflate
his
sails
again
,
at
the
cost
of
his
truth
and
his
honour
.
<EOS>
The
temptation
would
have
affected
him
not
at
all
,
had
Madame
Goesler
been
ugly
,
stupid
,
or
personally
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
,
he
thought
,
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
had
ever
seen
,
the
most
witty
,
and
in
many
respects
the
most
charming
.
<EOS>
She
had
offered
to
give
him
everything
that
she
had
,
so
to
place
him
in
the
world
that
opposition
would
be
more
pleasant
to
him
than
office
,
to
supply
every
want
,
and
had
done
so
in
a
manner
that
had
gratified
all
his
vanity
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
refused
it
all
,
because
he
was
bound
to
the
girl
at
Floodborough
.
<EOS>
My
readers
will
probably
say
that
he
was
not
a
true
man
unless
he
could
do
this
without
a
regret
.
<EOS>
When
Phineas
thought
of
it
all
,
there
were
many
regrets
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
at
the
same
time
a
resolve
on
his
part
,
that
if
any
man
had
ever
loved
the
girl
he
promised
to
love
,
he
would
love
Mary
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
times
he
had
told
himself
that
she
had
not
the
spirit
of
Lady
Laura
,
or
the
bright
wit
of
Violet
Effingham
,
or
the
beauty
of
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
But
Mary
had
charms
of
her
own
that
were
more
valuable
than
them
all
.
<EOS>
Was
there
one
among
the
three
who
had
trusted
him
as
she
trusted
him
,
 
or
loved
him
with
the
same
satisfied
devotion
?
<EOS>
There
were
regrets
,
regrets
that
were
heavy
on
his
heart
;
 
for
London
,
and
Parliament
,
and
the
clubs
,
and
Downing
Street
,
had
become
dear
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
liked
to
think
of
himself
as
he
rode
in
the
park
,
and
was
greeted
by
all
those
whose
greeting
was
the
most
worth
having
.
<EOS>
There
were
regrets
,
 
sad
regrets
.
<EOS>
But
the
girl
whom
he
loved
better
than
the
parks
and
the
clubs
,
 
better
even
than
Westminster
and
Downing
Street
,
should
never
know
that
they
had
existed
.
  
<EOS>
These
thoughts
were
running
through
his
mind
even
while
he
was
listening
to
Mr.
Monk
,
as
he
propounded
his
theory
of
doing
justice
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
This
might
probably
be
the
last
great
debate
in
which
Phineas
would
be
able
to
take
a
part
,
and
he
was
determined
that
he
would
do
his
best
in
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
intend
to
speak
on
this
day
,
if
,
as
was
generally
supposed
,
the
House
would
be
adjourned
before
a
division
could
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
remain
on
the
alert
and
see
how
the
thing
went
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
to
understand
the
forms
of
the
place
,
and
was
as
well
-
trained
a
young
member
of
Parliament
as
any
there
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
quick
at
learning
a
lesson
that
is
not
easily
learned
,
and
knew
how
things
were
going
,
and
what
were
the
proper
moments
for
this
question
or
that
form
of
motion
.
<EOS>
He
could
anticipate
a
count
-
out
,
understood
the
tone
of
men
's
minds
,
and
could
read
the
gestures
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
little
likely
that
the
debate
should
be
over
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
;
and
as
the
present
time
was
the
evening
of
Tuesday
,
he
resolved
at
once
that
he
would
speak
as
early
as
he
could
on
the
following
Thursday
.
<EOS>
What
a
pity
it
was
,
that
with
one
who
had
learned
so
much
,
all
his
learning
should
be
in
vain
!
  
<EOS>
At
about
two
o'clock
,
he
himself
succeeded
in
moving
the
adjournment
of
the
debate
.
<EOS>
This
he
did
from
a
seat
below
the
gangway
,
to
which
he
had
removed
himself
from
the
Treasury
bench
.
<EOS>
Then
the
House
was
up
,
and
he
walked
home
with
Mr.
Monk
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Monk
,
since
he
had
been
told
positively
by
Phineas
that
he
had
resolved
upon
resigning
his
office
,
had
said
nothing
more
of
his
sorrow
at
his
friend
's
resolve
,
but
had
used
him
as
one
political
friend
uses
another
,
telling
him
all
his
thoughts
and
all
his
hopes
as
to
this
new
measure
of
his
,
and
taking
counsel
with
him
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
fight
should
be
fought
.
<EOS>
Together
they
had
counted
over
the
list
of
members
,
marking
these
men
as
supporters
,
those
as
opponents
,
and
another
set
,
now
more
important
than
either
,
as
being
doubtful
.
<EOS>
From
day
to
day
those
who
had
been
written
down
as
doubtful
were
struck
off
that
third
list
,
and
put
in
either
the
one
or
the
other
of
those
who
were
either
supporters
or
opponents
.
<EOS>
And
their
different
modes
of
argument
were
settled
between
these
two
allied
orators
,
<EOS>
how
one
should
take
this
line
and
the
other
that
.
<EOS>
To
Mr.
Monk
this
was
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
assured
now
that
opposition
was
more
congenial
to
his
spirit
,
and
more
fitting
for
him
than
office
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
to
him
as
to
his
future
sitting
in
Parliament
,
let
the
result
of
this
contest
be
what
it
might
.
<EOS>
The
work
which
he
was
now
doing
,
was
the
work
for
which
he
had
been
training
himself
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
While
he
had
been
forced
to
attend
Cabinet
Councils
from
week
to
week
,
he
had
been
depressed
.
<EOS>
Now
he
was
exultant
.
<EOS>
Phineas
seeing
and
understanding
all
this
,
said
<EOS>
but
little
to
his
friend
of
his
own
prospects
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
this
pleasant
battle
was
raging
,
he
could
fight
in
it
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
the
man
he
loved
.
<EOS>
After
that
there
would
be
a
blank
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
how
we
are
to
fail
to
have
a
majority
after
Daubeny
's
speech
to
-
night
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
as
they
walked
together
down
Parliament
Street
through
the
bright
moonlight
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
expressly
said
that
he
only
spoke
for
himself
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
know
what
that
means
.
<EOS>
He
is
bidding
for
office
,
and
of
course
those
who
want
office
with
him
will
vote
as
he
votes
.
<EOS>
We
have
already
counted
those
who
would
go
into
office
,
but
they
will
not
carry
the
whole
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
carry
enough
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
forty
or
fifty
men
on
his
side
of
the
House
,
and
as
many
perhaps
on
ours
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
"
who
have
no
idea
of
any
kind
on
any
bill
,
and
who
simply
follow
the
bell
,
whether
into
this
lobby
or
that
.
<EOS>
Argument
never
touches
them
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
even
look
to
the
result
of
a
division
on
their
own
interests
,
as
the
making
of
any
calculation
would
be
laborious
to
them
.
<EOS>
Their
party
leader
is
to
them
a
Pope
whom
they
do
not
dream
of
doubting
.
<EOS>
I
never
can
quite
make
up
my
mind
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
that
there
should
be
such
men
in
Parliament
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Men
who
think
much
want
to
speak
often
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
 
and
of
speaking
members
,
God
knows
that
we
have
enough
.
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
that
these
purblind
sheep
do
have
some
occult
weight
that
is
salutary
.
<EOS>
They
enable
a
leader
to
be
a
leader
,
and
even
in
that
way
they
are
useful
.
<EOS>
We
shall
get
a
division
on
Thursday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
that
Gresham
has
consented
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
Ratler
told
me
.
<EOS>
Palliser
is
to
speak
,
and
Barrington
Erle
.
<EOS>
And
they
say
that
Robson
is
going
to
make
an
onslaught
specially
on
me
.
<EOS>
We
shall
get
it
over
by
one
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
we
beat
them
?
"
asked
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
depend
on
the
numbers
.
<EOS>
Everybody
who
has
spoken
to
me
about
it
,
seems
to
think
that
they
will
dissolve
if
there
be
a
respectable
majority
against
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
he
will
dissolve
,
"
said
Phineas
,
speaking
of
Mr.
Gresham
;
"
what
else
can
he
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
anxious
to
carry
his
Irish
Reform
Bill
first
,
if
he
can
do
so
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
Phineas
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
down
to
-
morrow
as
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
on
Thursday
,
and
we
will
go
to
the
House
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
Wednesday
Phineas
was
engaged
to
dine
with
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dinner
party
in
Bedford
Square
,
and
Phineas
met
half
-
a
-
dozen
barristers
and
their
wives
,
 
men
to
whom
he
had
looked
up
as
successful
pundits
in
the
law
some
five
or
six
years
ago
,
but
who
since
that
time
had
almost
learned
to
look
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
they
treated
him
with
that
courteousness
of
manner
which
success
in
life
always
begets
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
judge
there
who
was
very
civil
to
him
;
and
the
judge
's
wife
whom
he
had
taken
down
to
dinner
was
very
gracious
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
judge
had
got
his
prize
in
life
,
and
was
therefore
personally
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
ministers
;
but
the
judge
's
wife
had
a
brother
who
wanted
a
County
Court
from
Lord
De
Terrier
,
and
it
was
known
that
Phineas
was
giving
valuable
assistance
towards
the
attainment
of
this
object
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
think
that
you
and
Mr.
Monk
are
so
right
,
"
said
the
judge
's
wife
.
<EOS>
Phineas
,
who
understood
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
judge
's
wife
should
so
cordially
approve
his
conduct
,
could
not
help
thinking
how
grand
a
thing
it
would
be
for
him
to
have
a
County
Court
for
himself
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
guests
were
gone
he
was
left
alone
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Low
,
and
remained
awhile
with
them
,
there
having
been
an
understanding
that
they
should
have
a
last
chat
together
over
the
affairs
of
our
hero
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
really
mean
that
you
will
not
stand
again
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
mean
it
.
<EOS>
I
may
say
that
I
can
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
My
father
is
hardly
so
well
able
to
help
me
as
he
was
when
I
began
this
game
,
and
I
certainly
shall
not
ask
him
for
money
to
support
a
canvass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
thousand
pities
,
"
said
Mrs.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
had
begun
to
think
that
you
would
make
it
answer
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
one
way
I
have
made
it
answer
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
three
years
I
have
lived
upon
what
I
have
earned
,
and
I
am
not
in
debt
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
must
begin
the
world
again
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
shall
find
the
drudgery
very
hard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
no
doubt
,
"
said
the
barrister
,
who
had
gone
through
it
all
,
and
was
now
reaping
the
fruits
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
you
have
not
forgotten
what
you
learned
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
can
say
?
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
have
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
not
mean
the
drudgery
of
learning
,
so
much
as
the
drudgery
of
looking
after
work
;
 
of
expecting
briefs
which
perhaps
will
never
come
.
<EOS>
I
am
thirty
years
old
now
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
indeed
?
"
said
Mrs.
Low
,
 
who
knew
his
age
to
a
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
the
time
passes
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
hope
you
'll
get
on
,
Mr.
Finn
.
<EOS>
I
do
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
will
,
if
he
puts
his
shoulder
to
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
  
<EOS>
Neither
the
lawyer
nor
his
wife
repeated
any
of
those
sententious
admonitions
,
which
had
almost
become
rebukes
,
and
which
had
been
so
common
in
their
mouths
.
<EOS>
The
fall
with
which
they
had
threatened
Phineas
Finn
had
come
upon
him
,
and
they
were
too
generous
to
remind
him
of
their
wisdom
and
sagacity
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
when
he
got
up
to
take
his
leave
,
Mrs.
Low
,
who
probably
might
not
see
him
again
for
years
,
was
quite
affectionate
in
her
manners
to
him
,
and
looked
as
if
she
were
almost
minded
to
kiss
him
as
she
pressed
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
come
and
see
you
,
"
she
said
,
"
when
you
are
Master
of
the
Rolls
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
him
before
then
thundering
at
us
poor
Tories
in
the
House
,
"
said
Mr.
Low
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
be
back
again
sooner
or
later
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
they
parted
.
   
<EOS>
P.
P.
C.
 
<EOS>
On
the
Thursday
morning
before
Phineas
went
to
Mr.
Monk
,
a
gentleman
called
upon
him
at
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Phineas
requested
the
servant
to
bring
up
the
gentleman
's
name
,
but
tempted
perhaps
by
a
shilling
the
girl
brought
up
the
gentleman
instead
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
from
the
office
of
the
"
Banner
of
the
People
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Quintus
,
with
his
hand
extended
,
"
I
have
come
to
offer
you
the
calumet
of
peace
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Phineas
certainly
desired
no
such
calumet
.
<EOS>
But
to
refuse
a
man
's
hand
is
to
declare
active
war
after
a
fashion
which
men
do
not
like
to
adopt
except
on
deliberation
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
cared
a
straw
for
the
abuse
which
Mr.
Slide
had
poured
upon
him
,
and
now
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
man
of
letters
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
sit
down
,
nor
did
he
offer
a
seat
to
Mr.
Slide
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
as
a
man
of
sense
who
knows
the
world
,
you
will
accept
the
calumet
of
peace
,
"
continued
Mr.
Slide
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
be
asked
particularly
to
accept
war
or
peace
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Finn
,
 
I
do
n't
often
quote
the
Bible
;
but
those
who
are
not
for
us
must
be
against
us
.
<EOS>
You
will
agree
to
that
.
<EOS>
Now
that
you
've
freed
yourself
from
the
iniquities
of
that
sink
of
abomination
in
Downing
Street
,
I
look
upon
you
as
a
man
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
you
are
very
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
a
man
and
also
a
brother
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
know
that
I
've
got
the
_
Banner
_
into
my
own
'
ands
now
.
<EOS>
"
Phineas
was
obliged
to
explain
that
he
had
not
hitherto
been
made
acquainted
with
this
great
literary
and
political
secret
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
,
yes
,
altogether
so
.
<EOS>
We
've
got
rid
of
old
Rusty
as
I
used
to
call
him
.
<EOS>
He
would
n't
go
the
pace
,
and
so
we
stripped
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
doing
the
_
West
of
England
Art
Journal
_
now
,
and
he
'
angs
out
down
at
Bristol
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
he
'll
succeed
,
Mr.
Slide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
earn
his
wages
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
man
who
will
always
earn
his
wages
,
but
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Well
,
now
,
Mr.
Finn
,
I
will
just
offer
you
one
word
of
apology
for
our
little
severities
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
shall
.
<EOS>
Dooty
is
dooty
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
things
printed
which
were
a
little
rough
,
but
if
one
is
n't
a
little
rough
there
ai
n't
no
flavour
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
wrote
'em
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
"
and
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
remember
that
there
was
some
throwing
of
mud
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Just
so
.
<EOS>
But
mud
do
n't
break
any
bones
;
does
it
?
<EOS>
When
you
turned
against
us
I
had
to
be
down
on
you
,
and
I
was
down
upon
you
;
 
<EOS>
that
's
just
about
all
of
it
.
<EOS>
Now
you
're
coming
among
us
again
,
and
so
I
come
to
you
with
a
calumet
of
peace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
coming
among
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
you
are
,
Finn
,
and
bringing
Monk
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
now
becoming
very
disagreeable
,
and
Phineas
was
beginning
to
perceive
that
it
would
soon
be
his
turn
to
say
something
rough
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
I
'll
tell
you
what
my
proposition
is
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
do
us
two
leaders
a
week
through
the
session
,
you
shall
have
a
cheque
for
£
16
on
the
last
day
of
every
month
.
<EOS>
If
that
's
not
honester
money
than
what
you
got
in
Downing
Street
,
my
name
is
not
Quintus
Slide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Slide
,
"
said
Phineas
,
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
are
to
come
to
business
,
drop
the
Mister
.
<EOS>
It
makes
things
go
so
much
easier
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
to
come
to
business
,
and
I
do
not
want
things
to
go
easy
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
said
some
things
of
me
in
your
newspaper
that
were
very
scurrilous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
of
that
?
<EOS>
If
you
mind
that
sort
of
thing
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
did
not
regard
it
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
You
are
quite
welcome
to
continue
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
doubt
<EOS>
but
you
will
continue
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
not
welcome
to
come
here
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
turn
me
out
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Just
that
.
<EOS>
You
printed
a
heap
of
lies
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lies
,
Mr.
Finn
!
<EOS>
Did
you
say
lies
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
lies
;
 
lies
;
 
lies
!
"
<EOS>
And
Phineas
walked
over
at
him
as
though
he
were
going
to
pitch
him
instantly
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
go
and
write
as
many
more
as
you
like
.
<EOS>
It
is
your
trade
,
and
you
must
do
it
or
starve
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
come
to
me
again
.
<EOS>
"
Then
he
opened
the
door
and
stood
with
it
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
shall
know
how
to
punish
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Exactly
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
please
you
'll
go
and
do
your
punishment
at
the
office
of
the
_
Banner
_
,
 
unless
you
like
to
try
it
here
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
kick
me
and
spit
at
me
,
but
you
will
prefer
to
do
it
in
print
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Quintus
Slide
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
prefer
to
do
it
in
print
,
 
though
I
must
own
that
the
temptation
to
adopt
the
manual
violence
of
a
ruffian
is
great
,
very
great
,
very
great
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
resisted
the
temptation
and
walked
down
the
stairs
,
concocting
his
article
as
he
went
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Quintus
Slide
did
not
so
much
impede
the
business
of
his
day
but
what
Phineas
was
with
Mr.
Monk
by
two
,
and
in
his
place
in
the
House
when
prayers
were
read
at
four
.
<EOS>
As
he
sat
in
his
place
,
conscious
of
the
work
that
was
before
him
,
listening
to
the
presentation
of
petitions
,
and
to
the
formal
reading
of
certain
notices
of
motions
,
which
with
the
asking
of
sundry
questions
occupied
over
half
an
hour
,
he
looked
back
and
remembered
accurately
his
own
feelings
on
a
certain
night
on
which
he
had
intended
to
get
up
and
address
the
House
.
<EOS>
The
ordeal
before
him
had
then
been
so
terrible
,
that
it
had
almost
obliterated
for
the
moment
his
senses
of
hearing
and
of
sight
.
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
been
able
to
perceive
what
had
been
going
on
around
him
,
and
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
occupy
himself
in
recalling
to
his
memory
the
words
which
he
wished
to
pronounce
.
<EOS>
When
the
time
for
pronouncing
them
had
come
,
he
had
found
himself
unable
to
stand
upon
his
legs
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
as
he
recalled
all
this
in
his
memory
,
waiting
impatiently
for
the
moment
in
which
he
might
rise
.
<EOS>
His
audience
was
assured
to
him
now
,
and
he
did
not
fear
it
.
<EOS>
His
opportunity
for
utterance
was
his
own
,
and
even
the
Speaker
could
not
deprive
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
During
these
minutes
he
thought
not
at
all
of
the
words
that
he
was
to
say
.
<EOS>
He
had
prepared
his
matter
but
had
prepared
no
words
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
words
would
come
readily
enough
to
him
,
and
that
he
had
learned
the
task
of
turning
his
thoughts
quickly
into
language
while
standing
with
a
crowd
of
listeners
around
him
,
 
as
a
practised
writer
does
when
seated
in
his
chair
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
violent
beating
at
his
heart
now
,
no
dimness
of
the
eyes
,
no
feeling
that
the
ground
was
turning
round
under
his
feet
.
<EOS>
If
only
those
weary
vain
questions
would
get
themselves
all
asked
,
so
that
he
might
rise
and
begin
the
work
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Then
there
came
the
last
thought
as
the
House
was
hushed
for
his
rising
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
good
of
it
all
,
when
he
would
never
have
an
opportunity
of
speaking
there
again
?
  
<EOS>
But
not
on
that
account
would
he
be
slack
in
his
endeavour
now
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
listened
to
once
at
least
,
not
as
a
subaltern
of
the
Government
but
as
the
owner
of
a
voice
prominent
in
opposition
to
the
Government
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
taught
by
Mr.
Monk
that
that
was
the
one
place
in
the
House
in
which
a
man
with
a
power
of
speaking
could
really
enjoy
pleasure
without
alloy
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
the
trial
,
 
once
,
if
never
again
.
<EOS>
Things
had
so
gone
with
him
that
the
rostrum
was
his
own
,
and
a
House
crammed
to
overflowing
was
there
to
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
given
up
his
place
in
order
that
he
might
be
able
to
speak
his
mind
,
and
had
become
aware
that
many
intended
to
listen
to
him
while
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
He
had
observed
that
the
rows
of
strangers
were
thick
in
the
galleries
,
that
peers
were
standing
in
the
passages
,
and
that
over
the
reporter
's
head
,
the
ribbons
of
many
ladies
were
to
be
seen
through
the
bars
of
their
cage
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
 
for
this
once
he
would
have
an
audience
.
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
for
about
an
hour
,
and
while
he
was
speaking
he
knew
nothing
about
himself
,
whether
he
was
doing
it
well
or
ill
.
<EOS>
Something
of
himself
he
did
say
soon
after
he
had
commenced
,
 
not
quite
beginning
with
it
,
as
though
his
mind
had
been
laden
with
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
he
said
,
found
himself
compelled
to
renounce
his
happy
allegiance
to
the
First
Lord
of
the
Treasury
,
and
to
quit
the
pleasant
company
in
which
,
humble
as
had
been
his
place
,
he
had
been
allowed
to
sit
and
act
,
by
his
unfortunate
conviction
in
this
great
subject
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
told
,
he
said
,
that
it
was
a
misfortune
in
itself
for
one
so
young
as
he
to
have
convictions
.
<EOS>
But
his
Irish
birth
and
Irish
connection
had
brought
this
misfortune
of
his
country
so
closely
home
to
him
that
he
had
found
the
task
of
extricating
himself
from
it
to
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Of
what
further
he
said
,
speaking
on
that
terribly
unintelligible
subject
,
a
tenant
-
right
proposed
for
Irish
farmers
,
no
English
reader
will
desire
to
know
much
.
<EOS>
Irish
subjects
in
the
House
of
Commons
are
interesting
or
are
dull
,
are
debated
before
a
crowded
audience
composed
of
all
who
are
leaders
in
the
great
world
of
London
,
or
before
empty
benches
,
in
accordance
with
the
importance
of
the
moment
and
the
character
of
the
debate
.
<EOS>
For
us
now
it
is
enough
to
know
that
to
our
hero
was
accorded
that
attention
which
orators
love
,
 
which
will
almost
make
an
orator
if
it
can
be
assured
.
<EOS>
A
full
House
with
a
promise
of
big
type
on
the
next
morning
would
wake
to
eloquence
the
propounder
of
a
Canadian
grievance
,
or
the
mover
of
an
Indian
budget
.
  
<EOS>
Phineas
did
not
stir
out
of
the
House
till
the
division
was
over
,
having
agreed
with
Mr.
Monk
that
they
two
would
remain
through
it
all
and
hear
everything
that
was
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
had
already
spoken
,
and
to
Mr.
Palliser
was
confided
the
task
of
winding
up
the
argument
for
the
Government
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Robson
spoke
also
,
greatly
enlivening
the
tedium
of
the
evening
,
and
to
Mr.
Monk
was
permitted
the
privilege
of
a
final
reply
.
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
the
division
came
,
and
the
Ministry
were
beaten
by
a
majority
of
twenty
-
three
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
as
he
again
walked
home
with
Phineas
,
"
the
pity
is
that
we
are
not
a
bit
nearer
tenant
-
right
than
we
were
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
are
nearer
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
one
sense
,
yes
.
<EOS>
Such
a
debate
and
such
a
majority
will
make
men
think
.
<EOS>
But
no
;
 
think
is
too
high
a
word
;
as
a
rule
men
do
n't
think
.
<EOS>
But
it
will
make
them
believe
that
there
is
something
in
it
.
<EOS>
Many
who
before
regarded
legislation
on
the
subject
as
chimerical
,
will
now
fancy
that
it
is
only
dangerous
,
or
perhaps
not
more
than
difficult
.
<EOS>
And
so
in
time
it
will
come
to
be
looked
on
as
among
the
things
possible
,
then
among
the
things
probable
;
 
and
so
at
last
<EOS>
it
will
be
ranged
in
the
list
of
those
few
measures
which
the
country
requires
as
being
absolutely
needed
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
way
in
which
public
opinion
is
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
no
loss
of
time
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
to
have
taken
the
first
great
step
in
making
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
great
step
was
taken
long
ago
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
,
 
"
taken
by
men
who
were
looked
upon
as
revolutionary
demagogues
,
almost
as
traitors
,
because
they
took
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
a
great
thing
to
take
any
step
that
leads
us
onwards
.
"
  
<EOS>
Two
days
after
this
Mr.
Gresham
declared
his
intention
of
dissolving
the
House
because
of
the
adverse
division
which
had
been
produced
by
Mr.
Monk
's
motion
,
but
expressed
a
wish
to
be
allowed
to
carry
an
Irish
Reform
Bill
through
Parliament
before
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
He
explained
how
expedient
this
would
be
,
but
declared
at
the
same
time
that
if
any
strong
opposition
were
made
,
he
would
abandon
the
project
.
<EOS>
His
intention
simply
was
to
pass
with
regard
to
Ireland
a
measure
which
must
be
passed
soon
,
and
which
ought
to
be
passed
before
a
new
election
took
place
.
<EOS>
The
bill
was
ready
,
and
should
be
read
for
the
first
time
on
the
next
night
,
if
the
House
were
willing
.
<EOS>
The
House
was
willing
,
though
there
were
very
many
recalcitrant
Irish
members
.
<EOS>
The
Irish
members
made
loud
opposition
,
and
then
twitted
Mr.
Gresham
with
his
promise
that
he
would
not
go
on
with
his
bill
,
if
opposition
were
made
.
<EOS>
But
,
nevertheless
,
he
did
go
on
,
and
the
measure
was
hurried
through
the
two
Houses
in
a
week
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
who
still
sat
for
Loughshane
,
but
who
was
never
to
sit
for
Loughshane
again
,
gave
what
assistance
he
could
to
the
Government
,
and
voted
for
the
measure
which
deprived
Loughshane
for
ever
of
its
parliamentary
honours
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
very
dirty
conduct
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
,
"
said
Lord
Tulla
,
when
he
discussed
the
subject
with
his
agent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
being
put
in
for
the
borough
twice
,
almost
free
of
expense
,
it
was
very
dirty
.
<EOS>
"
It
never
occurred
to
Lord
Tulla
that
a
member
of
Parliament
might
feel
himself
obliged
to
vote
on
such
a
subject
in
accordance
with
his
judgment
.
  
<EOS>
This
Irish
Reform
Bill
was
scrambled
through
the
two
Houses
,
and
then
the
session
was
over
.
<EOS>
The
session
was
over
,
and
they
who
knew
anything
of
the
private
concerns
of
Mr.
Phineas
Finn
were
aware
that
he
was
about
to
return
to
Ireland
,
and
did
not
intend
to
reappear
on
the
scene
which
had
known
him
so
well
for
the
last
five
years
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
tell
you
how
sad
it
makes
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
makes
me
sad
too
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
I
try
to
shake
off
the
melancholy
,
and
tell
myself
from
day
to
day
that
it
is
unmanly
.
<EOS>
But
it
gets
the
better
of
me
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
quite
certain
that
you
will
come
back
among
us
again
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
tells
me
so
;
and
yet
I
feel
quite
certain
that
I
shall
never
come
back
<EOS>
,
 
never
come
back
with
a
seat
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
As
my
old
tutor
,
Low
,
has
told
me
scores
of
times
,
I
began
at
the
wrong
end
.
<EOS>
Here
I
am
,
thirty
years
of
age
,
and
I
have
not
a
shilling
in
the
world
,
and
I
do
not
know
how
to
earn
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
for
me
you
would
still
be
receiving
ever
so
much
a
year
,
and
all
would
be
pleasant
,
"
said
Mr.
Monk
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
long
would
it
have
lasted
?
<EOS>
The
first
moment
that
Daubeny
got
the
upper
hand
I
should
have
fallen
lower
than
I
have
fallen
now
.
<EOS>
If
not
this
year
,
it
would
have
been
the
next
.
<EOS>
My
only
comfort
is
in
this
,
 
that
I
have
done
the
thing
myself
,
and
have
not
been
turned
out
.
"
<EOS>
To
the
very
last
,
however
,
Mr.
Monk
continued
to
express
his
opinion
that
Phineas
would
come
back
,
declaring
that
he
had
known
no
instance
of
a
young
man
who
had
made
himself
useful
in
Parliament
,
and
then
had
been
allowed
to
leave
it
in
early
life
.
  
<EOS>
Among
those
of
whom
he
was
bound
to
take
a
special
leave
,
the
members
of
the
family
of
Lord
Brentford
were
,
of
course
,
the
foremost
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
heard
of
the
reconciliation
of
Miss
Effingham
and
Lord
Chiltern
,
and
was
anxious
to
offer
his
congratulation
to
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
essential
to
him
that
he
should
see
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
To
her
he
wrote
a
line
,
saying
how
much
he
hoped
that
he
should
be
able
to
bid
her
adieu
,
and
a
time
was
fixed
for
his
coming
at
which
she
knew
that
she
would
meet
him
alone
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
chance
ruled
it
,
he
came
upon
the
two
lovers
together
,
and
then
remembered
that
he
had
hardly
ever
before
been
in
the
same
room
with
both
of
them
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Finn
,
what
a
beautiful
speech
you
made
.
<EOS>
I
read
every
word
of
it
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
did
n't
even
look
at
it
,
old
fellow
,
"
said
Chiltern
,
getting
up
and
putting
his
arm
on
the
other
's
shoulder
in
a
way
that
was
common
with
him
when
he
was
quite
intimate
with
the
friend
near
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Laura
went
down
and
heard
it
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
do
that
,
because
I
was
tied
to
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
conceive
how
dutiful
I
am
during
this
last
month
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
is
it
to
be
in
a
month
,
Chiltern
?
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
says
so
.
<EOS>
She
arranges
everything
,
 
in
concert
with
my
father
.
<EOS>
When
I
threw
up
the
sponge
,
I
simply
asked
for
a
long
day
.
<EOS>
"
A
long
day
,
my
lord
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
But
my
father
and
Violet
between
them
refused
me
any
mercy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
believe
him
,
"
said
Violet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
word
.
<EOS>
If
I
did
he
would
want
to
see
me
on
the
coast
of
Flanders
again
,
I
do
n't
doubt
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
to
congratulate
you
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Violet
,
taking
his
hand
with
hearty
kindness
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
been
quite
happy
without
one
nice
word
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
try
and
make
the
best
of
it
,
"
said
Chiltern
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
I
say
,
you
'll
come
over
and
ride
Bonebreaker
again
.
<EOS>
He
's
down
there
at
the
Bull
,
and
I
've
taken
a
little
box
close
by
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
stand
the
governor
's
county
for
hunting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
your
wife
go
down
to
Willingford
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
will
,
and
ride
to
hounds
a
great
deal
closer
than
I
can
ever
do
.
<EOS>
Mind
you
come
,
and
if
there
's
anything
in
the
stable
fit
to
carry
you
,
you
shall
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
had
to
explain
that
he
had
come
to
bid
them
farewell
,
and
that
it
was
not
at
all
probable
that
he
should
ever
be
able
to
see
Willingford
again
in
the
hunting
season
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
that
I
shall
make
either
of
you
quite
understand
it
,
but
I
have
got
to
begin
again
.
<EOS>
The
chances
are
that
I
shall
never
see
another
foxhound
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
in
Ireland
!
"
exclaimed
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
unless
I
should
have
to
examine
one
as
a
witness
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
before
me
but
downright
hard
work
;
and
a
great
deal
of
that
must
be
done
before
I
can
hope
to
earn
a
shilling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
so
clever
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
will
come
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
mean
to
be
impatient
about
it
,
nor
yet
unhappy
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
hunting
wo
n't
be
much
in
my
line
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
will
you
leave
London
altogether
?
<EOS>
"
Violet
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Altogether
.
<EOS>
I
shall
stick
to
one
club
,
 
Brooks
's
;
but
I
shall
take
my
name
off
all
the
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
deuce
of
a
nuisance
!
"
said
Lord
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
you
will
be
very
happy
,
"
said
Violet
;
"
and
you
'll
be
a
Lord
Chancellor
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
But
you
wo
n't
go
quite
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Next
Sunday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
return
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
here
for
our
wedding
;
 
indeed
you
must
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
married
unless
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Even
this
,
however
,
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
must
go
on
Sunday
,
and
must
return
no
more
.
<EOS>
Then
he
made
his
little
farewell
speech
,
which
he
could
not
deliver
without
some
awkward
stuttering
.
<EOS>
He
would
think
of
her
on
the
day
of
her
marriage
,
and
pray
that
she
might
be
happy
.
<EOS>
And
he
would
send
her
a
little
trifle
before
he
went
,
which
he
hoped
she
would
wear
in
remembrance
of
their
old
friendship
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
shall
wear
it
,
whatever
it
is
,
or
I
'll
know
the
reason
<EOS>
why
,
"
said
Chiltern
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
rough
bear
!
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
'll
wear
it
.
<EOS>
And
of
course
I
'll
think
of
the
giver
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
many
presents
,
but
few
that
I
will
think
of
so
much
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
left
the
room
,
with
his
throat
so
full
that
he
could
not
speak
another
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
still
broken
-
hearted
about
you
,
"
said
the
favoured
lover
as
soon
as
his
rival
had
left
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
that
,
"
said
Violet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
broken
-
hearted
about
everything
.
<EOS>
The
whole
world
is
vanishing
away
from
him
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
could
have
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
that
German
woman
with
all
the
money
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
understood
,
however
,
that
Phineas
had
never
spoken
a
word
to
any
one
as
to
the
offer
which
the
German
woman
had
made
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
morning
of
the
Sunday
on
which
he
was
to
leave
London
that
he
saw
Lady
Laura
.
<EOS>
He
had
asked
that
it
might
be
so
,
in
order
that
he
might
then
have
nothing
more
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
found
her
quite
alone
,
and
he
could
see
by
her
eyes
that
she
had
been
weeping
.
<EOS>
As
he
looked
at
her
,
remembering
that
it
was
not
yet
six
years
since
he
had
first
been
allowed
to
enter
that
room
,
he
could
not
but
perceive
how
very
much
she
was
altered
in
appearance
.
<EOS>
Then
she
had
been
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
had
not
looked
to
be
a
day
older
.
<EOS>
Now
she
might
have
been
taken
to
be
nearly
forty
,
so
much
had
her
troubles
preyed
upon
her
spirit
,
and
eaten
into
the
vitality
of
her
youth
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
have
come
to
say
good
-
bye
,
"
she
said
,
smiling
as
she
rose
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Lady
Laura
;
 
to
say
good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
Not
for
ever
,
I
hope
,
but
probably
for
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
for
ever
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
we
will
not
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
Then
she
paused
;
but
he
was
silent
,
sitting
with
his
hat
dangling
in
his
two
hands
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
she
continued
,
"
that
sometimes
I
am
very
angry
with
myself
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
must
be
because
you
have
been
too
kind
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
I
fear
that
I
have
done
much
to
injure
you
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
day
that
I
knew
you
,
 
do
you
remember
,
when
we
were
talking
here
,
in
this
very
room
,
about
the
beginning
of
the
Reform
Bill
;
 
from
that
day
I
wished
that
you
should
come
among
us
and
be
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
with
you
,
to
my
infinite
satisfaction
,
 
while
it
lasted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
has
not
lasted
,
and
now
I
fear
that
it
has
done
you
harm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
can
say
whether
it
has
been
for
good
or
evil
?
<EOS>
But
of
this
I
am
sure
you
will
be
certain
,
 
that
I
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
all
the
goodness
you
have
shown
me
.
"
<EOS>
Then
again
he
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
she
wanted
,
but
she
did
desire
some
expression
from
his
lips
that
should
be
warmer
than
an
expression
of
gratitude
.
<EOS>
An
expression
of
love
,
 
of
existing
love
,
 
she
would
have
felt
to
be
an
insult
,
and
would
have
treated
it
as
such
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
knew
that
from
him
no
such
insult
could
come
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
in
that
morbid
,
melancholy
state
of
mind
which
requires
the
excitement
of
more
than
ordinary
sympathy
,
even
though
that
sympathy
be
all
painful
;
and
I
think
that
she
would
have
been
pleased
had
he
referred
to
the
passion
for
herself
which
he
had
once
expressed
.
<EOS>
If
he
would
have
spoken
of
his
love
,
and
of
her
mistake
,
and
have
made
some
half
-
suggestion
as
to
what
might
have
been
their
lives
had
things
gone
differently
,
 
though
she
would
have
rebuked
him
even
for
that
,
 
still
it
would
have
comforted
her
.
<EOS>
But
at
this
moment
,
though
he
remembered
much
that
had
passed
between
them
,
he
was
not
even
thinking
of
the
Braes
of
Linter
.
<EOS>
All
that
had
taken
place
four
years
ago
;
 
and
there
had
been
so
many
other
things
since
which
had
moved
him
even
more
than
that
!
<EOS>
"
You
have
heard
what
I
have
arranged
for
myself
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
father
has
told
me
that
you
are
going
to
Dresden
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
 
he
will
accompany
me
,
 
coming
home
of
course
for
Parliament
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sad
break
-
up
,
is
it
not
?
<EOS>
But
the
lawyer
says
that
if
I
remain
here
I
may
be
subject
to
very
disagreeable
attempts
from
Mr.
Kennedy
to
force
me
to
go
back
again
.
<EOS>
It
is
odd
,
is
it
not
,
that
he
should
not
understand
how
impossible
it
is
?
"
  
"
He
means
to
do
his
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
.
<EOS>
But
he
becomes
more
stern
every
day
to
those
who
are
with
him
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
why
should
I
remain
here
?
<EOS>
What
is
there
to
tempt
me
?
<EOS>
As
a
woman
separated
from
her
husband
I
can
not
take
an
interest
in
those
things
which
used
to
charm
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
am
crushed
and
quelled
by
my
position
,
even
though
there
is
no
disgrace
in
it
.
"
  
"
No
disgrace
,
certainly
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
nobody
,
 
or
worse
than
nobody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
also
am
going
to
be
a
nobody
,
"
said
Phineas
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
you
are
a
man
and
will
get
over
it
,
and
you
have
many
years
before
you
will
begin
to
be
growing
old
.
<EOS>
I
am
growing
old
already
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
am
.
<EOS>
I
feel
it
,
and
know
it
,
and
see
it
.
<EOS>
A
woman
has
a
fine
game
to
play
;
but
then
she
is
so
easily
bowled
out
,
and
the
term
allowed
to
her
is
so
short
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
's
allowance
of
time
may
be
short
too
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
can
try
his
hand
again
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
was
another
pause
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
thought
,
Mr.
Finn
,
that
you
would
have
married
,
"
she
said
in
her
very
lowest
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
knew
all
my
hopes
and
fears
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
you
would
have
married
Madame
Goesler
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
made
you
think
that
,
Lady
Laura
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
I
saw
that
she
liked
you
,
and
because
such
a
marriage
would
have
been
so
suitable
.
<EOS>
She
has
all
that
you
want
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
they
say
of
her
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
they
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
the
Duke
of
Omnium
offered
to
make
her
his
wife
,
and
that
she
refused
him
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
that
people
wo
n't
say
;
 
nothing
on
earth
,
"
said
Phineas
.
<EOS>
Then
he
got
up
and
took
his
leave
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
also
wanted
to
part
from
her
with
some
special
expression
of
affection
,
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
choose
his
words
.
<EOS>
He
had
wished
that
some
allusion
should
be
made
,
not
to
the
Braes
of
Linter
,
but
to
the
close
confidence
which
had
so
long
existed
between
them
;
but
he
found
that
the
language
to
do
this
properly
was
wanting
to
him
.
<EOS>
Had
the
opportunity
arisen
he
would
have
told
her
now
the
whole
story
of
Mary
Flood
Jones
;
but
the
opportunity
did
not
come
,
and
he
left
her
,
never
having
mentioned
the
name
of
his
Mary
or
having
hinted
at
his
engagement
to
any
one
of
his
friends
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
better
so
,
"
he
said
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
My
life
in
Ireland
is
to
be
a
new
life
,
and
why
should
I
mix
two
things
together
that
will
be
so
different
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
to
dine
at
his
lodgings
,
and
then
leave
them
for
good
at
eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
He
had
packed
up
everything
before
he
went
to
Portman
Square
,
and
he
returned
home
only
just
in
time
to
sit
down
to
his
solitary
mutton
chop
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
sat
down
he
saw
a
small
note
addressed
to
himself
lying
on
the
table
among
the
crowd
of
books
,
letters
,
and
papers
,
of
which
he
had
still
to
make
disposal
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
small
note
in
an
envelope
of
a
peculiar
tint
of
pink
,
and
he
knew
the
handwriting
well
.
<EOS>
The
blood
mounted
all
over
his
face
as
he
took
it
up
,
and
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
he
opened
it
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
that
the
offer
should
be
repeated
to
him
.
<EOS>
Slowly
,
hardly
venturing
at
first
to
look
at
the
enclosure
,
he
opened
it
,
and
the
words
which
it
contained
were
as
follows
:
    
<EOS>
I
learn
that
you
are
going
to
-
day
,
and
I
write
a
word
which
you
will
receive
just
as
you
are
departing
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
say
merely
this
,
 
that
when
I
left
you
the
other
day
I
was
angry
,
not
with
you
,
but
with
myself
.
<EOS>
Let
me
wish
you
all
good
wishes
and
that
prosperity
which
I
know
you
will
deserve
,
and
which
<EOS>
I
think
you
will
win
.
  
<EOS>
Yours
very
truly
,
  
M.
M.
G.
  
Sunday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Should
he
put
off
his
journey
and
go
to
her
this
very
evening
and
claim
her
as
his
friend
?
<EOS>
The
question
was
asked
and
answered
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
would
not
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
Were
he
to
do
<EOS>
so
there
would
be
only
one
possible
word
for
him
to
say
,
and
that
word
should
certainly
never
be
spoken
.
<EOS>
But
he
wrote
to
her
a
reply
,
shorter
even
than
her
own
short
note
.
  
<EOS>
Thanks
,
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
doubt
but
that
you
and
I
understand
each
other
thoroughly
,
and
that
each
trusts
the
other
for
good
wishes
and
honest
intentions
.
  
<EOS>
Always
yours
,
  
<EOS>
P.
F.
  
I
write
these
as
I
am
starting
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
written
this
,
he
kept
it
till
the
last
moment
in
his
hand
,
thinking
that
he
would
not
send
it
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
slipped
into
the
cab
,
he
gave
the
note
to
his
late
landlady
to
post
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
station
Bunce
came
to
him
to
say
a
word
of
farewell
,
and
Mrs.
Bunce
was
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
done
,
Mr.
Finn
,
well
done
,
"
said
Bunce
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
knew
there
was
a
good
drop
in
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
always
told
me
I
should
ruin
myself
in
Parliament
,
and
so
I
have
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
takes
a
deal
to
ruin
a
man
if
he
's
got
the
right
sperrit
.
<EOS>
I
've
better
hopes
of
you
now
than
ever
I
had
in
the
old
days
when
you
used
to
be
looking
out
for
Government
place
;
 
and
Mr.
Monk
has
tried
that
too
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
would
find
the
iron
too
heavy
for
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Mr.
Finn
,
"
said
Mrs.
Bunce
with
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
not
one
of
'em
<EOS>
I
ever
had
as
lodgers
<EOS>
I
've
cared
about
half
as
much
as
I
did
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
Then
they
shook
hands
with
him
through
the
window
,
and
the
train
was
off
.
   
<EOS>
Conclusion
 
<EOS>
We
are
told
that
it
is
a
bitter
moment
with
the
Lord
Mayor
when
he
leaves
the
Mansion
House
and
becomes
once
more
Alderman
Jones
,
of
No
.
75
,
Bucklersbury
.
<EOS>
Lord
Chancellors
going
out
of
office
have
a
great
fall
though
they
take
pensions
with
them
for
their
consolation
.
<EOS>
And
the
President
of
the
United
States
when
he
leaves
the
glory
of
the
White
House
and
once
more
becomes
a
simple
citizen
<EOS>
must
feel
the
change
severely
.
<EOS>
But
our
hero
,
Phineas
Finn
,
as
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
scene
of
his
many
successes
,
and
prepared
himself
for
permanent
residence
in
his
own
country
,
was
,
I
think
,
in
a
worse
plight
than
any
of
the
reduced
divinities
to
whom
I
have
alluded
.
<EOS>
They
at
any
rate
had
known
that
their
fall
would
come
.
<EOS>
He
,
like
Icarus
,
had
flown
up
towards
the
sun
,
hoping
that
his
wings
of
wax
would
bear
him
steadily
aloft
among
the
gods
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
his
wings
were
wings
of
wax
,
we
must
acknowledge
that
they
were
very
good
.
<EOS>
But
the
celestial
lights
had
been
too
strong
for
them
,
and
now
,
having
lived
for
five
years
with
lords
and
countesses
,
with
Ministers
and
orators
,
with
beautiful
women
and
men
of
fashion
,
he
must
start
again
in
a
little
lodging
in
Dublin
,
and
hope
that
the
attorneys
of
that
litigious
city
might
be
good
to
him
.
<EOS>
On
his
journey
home
he
made
but
one
resolution
.
<EOS>
He
would
make
the
change
,
or
attempt
to
make
it
,
with
manly
strength
.
<EOS>
During
his
last
month
in
London
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
sad
,
depressed
,
and
melancholy
.
<EOS>
There
should
be
an
end
of
all
that
now
.
<EOS>
Nobody
at
home
should
see
that
he
was
depressed
.
<EOS>
And
Mary
,
his
own
Mary
,
should
at
any
rate
have
no
cause
to
think
that
her
love
and
his
own
engagement
had
ever
been
the
cause
to
him
of
depression
.
<EOS>
Did
he
not
value
her
love
more
than
anything
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
A
thousand
times
he
told
himself
that
he
did
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
there
in
the
old
house
at
Killaloe
to
greet
him
.
<EOS>
Her
engagement
was
an
affair
known
to
all
the
county
,
and
she
had
no
idea
that
it
would
become
her
to
be
coy
in
her
love
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
his
arms
before
he
had
spoken
to
his
father
and
mother
,
and
had
made
her
little
speech
to
him
,
 
very
inaudibly
indeed
,
 
while
he
was
covering
her
sweet
face
with
kisses
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Phineas
,
I
am
so
proud
of
you
;
and
I
think
you
are
so
right
,
and
I
am
so
glad
you
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Again
he
covered
her
face
with
kisses
.
<EOS>
Could
he
ever
have
had
such
satisfaction
as
this
had
he
allowed
Madame
Goesler
's
hand
to
remain
in
his
?
  
<EOS>
On
the
first
night
of
his
arrival
he
sat
for
an
hour
downstairs
with
his
father
talking
over
his
plans
.
<EOS>
He
felt
,
 
he
could
not
but
feel
,
 
that
he
was
not
the
hero
now
that
he
had
been
when
he
was
last
at
Killaloe
,
 
when
he
had
come
thither
with
a
Cabinet
Minister
under
his
wing
.
<EOS>
And
yet
his
father
did
his
best
to
prevent
the
growth
of
any
such
feeling
.
<EOS>
The
old
doctor
was
not
quite
as
well
off
as
he
had
been
when
Phineas
first
started
with
his
high
hopes
for
London
.
<EOS>
Since
that
day
he
had
abandoned
his
profession
and
was
now
living
on
the
fruits
of
his
life
's
labour
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
two
years
he
had
been
absolved
from
the
necessity
of
providing
an
income
for
his
son
,
and
had
probably
allowed
himself
to
feel
that
no
such
demand
upon
him
would
again
be
made
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
Could
his
son
manage
to
live
on
two
hundred
a
-
year
?
<EOS>
There
would
then
be
four
hundred
a
-
year
left
for
the
wants
of
the
family
at
home
.
<EOS>
Phineas
swore
that
he
could
fight
his
battle
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
and
they
ended
the
argument
by
splitting
the
difference
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
paying
exactly
the
same
sum
of
money
for
the
rooms
he
had
just
left
in
London
;
but
then
,
while
he
held
those
rooms
,
his
income
had
been
two
thousand
a
-
year
.
<EOS>
Tenant
-
right
was
a
very
fine
thing
,
but
could
it
be
worth
such
a
fall
as
this
?
  
<EOS>
"
And
about
dear
Mary
?
"
said
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
may
not
be
very
long
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
spoken
to
her
about
it
,
but
your
mother
says
that
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
is
very
averse
to
a
long
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
do
?
<EOS>
She
would
not
wish
me
to
marry
her
daughter
with
no
other
income
than
an
allowance
made
by
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
mother
says
that
she
has
some
idea
that
you
and
she
might
live
together
;
 
that
if
they
let
Floodborough
you
might
take
a
small
house
in
Dublin
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
Phineas
,
I
am
not
proposing
it
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Phineas
bethought
himself
that
he
was
not
even
yet
so
low
in
the
world
that
he
need
submit
himself
to
terms
dictated
to
him
by
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
that
you
do
not
propose
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
so
,
Phineas
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
should
have
been
obliged
to
oppose
the
plan
even
if
it
had
come
from
you
.
<EOS>
Mothers
-
in
-
law
are
never
a
comfort
in
a
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
tried
it
myself
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
never
will
try
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
that
Mary
does
not
expect
any
such
thing
,
and
that
she
is
willing
to
wait
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
shorten
the
term
of
waiting
by
hard
work
,
I
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
The
decision
to
which
Phineas
had
come
on
this
matter
was
probably
made
known
to
Mrs.
Flood
Jones
after
some
mild
fashion
by
old
Mrs.
Finn
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
to
Phineas
about
a
joint
household
;
but
he
was
quite
able
to
perceive
from
the
manner
of
the
lady
towards
him
that
his
proposed
mother
-
in
-
law
wished
him
to
understand
that
he
was
treating
her
daughter
very
badly
.
<EOS>
What
did
it
signify
?
<EOS>
None
of
them
knew
the
story
of
Madame
Goesler
,
and
of
course
none
of
them
would
know
it
.
<EOS>
None
of
them
would
ever
hear
how
well
he
had
behaved
to
his
little
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
did
know
it
all
before
he
left
her
to
go
up
to
Dublin
.
<EOS>
The
two
lovers
allowed
themselves
,
 
or
were
allowed
by
their
elders
,
one
week
of
exquisite
bliss
together
;
and
during
this
week
,
Phineas
told
her
,
I
think
,
everything
.
<EOS>
He
told
her
everything
as
far
as
he
could
do
so
without
seeming
to
boast
of
his
own
successes
.
<EOS>
How
is
a
man
not
to
tell
such
tales
when
he
has
on
his
arm
,
close
to
him
,
a
girl
who
tells
him
her
little
everything
of
life
,
and
only
asks
for
his
confidence
in
return
?
<EOS>
And
then
his
secrets
are
so
precious
to
her
and
so
sacred
,
that
he
feels
as
sure
of
her
fidelity
as
though
she
were
a
very
goddess
of
faith
and
trust
.
<EOS>
And
the
temptation
to
tell
is
so
great
.
<EOS>
For
all
that
he
has
to
tell
she
loves
him
the
better
and
still
the
better
.
<EOS>
A
man
desires
to
win
a
virgin
heart
,
and
is
happy
to
know
,
 
or
at
least
to
believe
,
 
that
he
has
won
it
.
<EOS>
With
a
woman
every
former
rival
is
an
added
victim
to
the
wheels
of
the
triumphant
chariot
in
which
she
is
sitting
.
<EOS>
"
All
these
has
he
known
and
loved
,
culling
sweets
from
each
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
has
come
to
me
,
and
I
am
the
sweetest
of
them
all
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
Mary
was
taught
to
believe
of
Laura
and
of
Violet
and
of
Madame
Goesler
,
 
that
though
they
had
had
charms
to
please
,
her
lover
had
never
been
so
charmed
as
he
was
now
while
she
was
hanging
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
that
she
was
right
in
her
belief
.
<EOS>
During
those
lovely
summer
evening
walks
along
the
shores
of
Lough
Derg
,
Phineas
was
as
happy
as
he
had
ever
been
at
any
moment
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
impatient
,
 
never
,
"
she
said
to
him
on
the
last
evening
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
want
is
that
you
should
write
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
want
more
than
that
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
must
come
down
and
see
me
.
<EOS>
When
you
do
come
they
will
be
happy
,
happy
days
for
me
.
<EOS>
But
of
course
we
can
not
be
married
for
the
next
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
forty
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
say
anything
that
you
like
;
 
you
will
know
what
I
mean
just
as
well
.
<EOS>
And
,
Phineas
,
I
must
tell
you
one
thing
,
 
though
it
makes
me
sad
to
think
of
it
,
and
will
make
me
sad
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
have
you
sad
on
our
last
night
,
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
say
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
beginning
to
understand
how
much
you
have
given
up
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
given
up
nothing
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
not
been
at
Killaloe
when
Mr.
Monk
was
here
,
and
if
we
had
not
,
 
had
not
,
 
oh
dear
,
if
I
had
not
loved
you
so
very
much
,
you
might
have
remained
in
London
,
and
that
lady
would
have
been
your
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
!
"
said
Phineas
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
she
not
?
<EOS>
She
must
not
be
your
wife
now
,
Phineas
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
pretend
that
I
will
give
you
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
unkind
,
Mary
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
well
;
you
may
say
what
you
please
.
<EOS>
If
that
is
unkind
,
I
am
unkind
.
<EOS>
It
would
kill
me
to
lose
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Had
he
done
right
?
<EOS>
How
could
there
be
a
doubt
about
it
?
<EOS>
How
could
there
be
a
question
about
it
?
<EOS>
Which
of
them
had
loved
him
,
or
was
capable
of
loving
him
as
Mary
loved
him
?
<EOS>
What
girl
was
ever
so
sweet
,
so
gracious
,
so
angelic
,
as
his
own
Mary
?
<EOS>
He
swore
to
her
that
he
was
prouder
of
winning
her
than
of
anything
he
had
ever
done
in
all
his
life
,
and
that
of
all
the
treasures
that
had
ever
come
in
his
way
<EOS>
she
was
the
most
precious
.
<EOS>
She
went
to
bed
that
night
the
happiest
girl
in
all
Connaught
,
although
when
she
parted
from
him
she
understood
that
she
was
not
to
see
him
again
till
Christmas
-
Eve
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
did
see
him
again
before
the
summer
was
over
,
and
the
manner
of
their
meeting
was
in
this
wise
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
the
passing
of
that
scrambled
Irish
Reform
Bill
,
Parliament
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
was
dissolved
.
<EOS>
This
was
in
the
early
days
of
June
,
and
before
the
end
of
July
the
new
members
were
again
assembled
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
This
session
,
late
in
summer
,
was
very
terrible
;
but
it
was
not
very
long
,
and
then
it
was
essentially
necessary
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
of
the
year
's
business
which
must
yet
be
done
,
and
the
country
would
require
to
know
who
were
to
be
the
Ministers
of
the
Government
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
needed
that
the
reader
should
be
troubled
any
further
with
the
strategy
of
one
political
leader
or
of
another
,
or
that
more
should
be
said
of
Mr.
Monk
and
his
tenant
-
right
.
<EOS>
The
House
of
Commons
had
offended
Mr.
Gresham
by
voting
in
a
majority
against
him
,
and
Mr.
Gresham
had
punished
the
House
of
Commons
by
subjecting
it
to
the
expense
and
nuisance
of
a
new
election
.
<EOS>
All
this
is
constitutional
,
and
rational
enough
to
Englishmen
,
though
it
may
be
unintelligible
to
strangers
.
<EOS>
The
upshot
on
the
present
occasion
was
that
the
Ministers
remained
in
their
places
and
that
Mr.
Monk
's
bill
,
though
it
had
received
the
substantial
honour
of
a
second
reading
,
passed
away
for
the
present
into
the
limbo
of
abortive
legislation
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
would
not
concern
us
at
all
,
nor
our
poor
hero
much
,
were
it
not
that
the
great
men
with
whom
he
had
been
for
two
years
<EOS>
so
pleasant
a
colleague
,
remembered
him
with
something
of
affectionate
regret
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
began
with
Mr.
Gresham
or
with
Lord
Cantrip
,
I
will
not
say
;
 
or
whether
Mr.
Monk
,
though
now
a
political
enemy
,
may
have
said
a
word
that
brought
about
the
good
deed
.
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
just
before
the
summer
session
was
brought
to
a
close
Phineas
<EOS>
received
the
following
letter
from
Lord
Cantrip
:
    
Downing
Street
,
August
4
,
186
 
.
  
<EOS>
MY
DEAR
MR
.
<EOS>
FINN
,
    
<EOS>
Mr.
Gresham
has
been
talking
to
me
,
and
we
both
think
that
possibly
a
permanent
Government
appointment
may
be
acceptable
to
you
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
doubt
,
that
should
this
be
the
case
,
your
services
would
be
very
valuable
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
vacancy
for
a
poor
-
law
inspector
at
present
in
Ireland
,
whose
residence
I
believe
should
be
in
Cork
.
<EOS>
The
salary
is
a
thousand
a
-
year
.
<EOS>
Should
the
appointment
suit
you
,
Mr.
Gresham
will
be
most
happy
to
nominate
you
to
the
office
.
<EOS>
Let
me
have
a
line
at
your
early
convenience
.
  
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
  
Most
sincerely
yours
,
  
CANTRIP
.
  
<EOS>
He
received
the
letter
one
morning
in
Dublin
,
and
within
three
hours
he
was
on
his
route
to
Killaloe
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
would
accept
the
appointment
,
but
he
would
not
even
do
that
without
telling
Mary
of
his
new
prospect
.
<EOS>
Of
course
he
would
accept
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
been
as
yet
barely
two
months
in
Dublin
,
though
he
had
hardly
been
long
enough
settled
to
his
work
to
have
hoped
to
be
able
to
see
in
which
way
there
might
be
a
vista
open
leading
to
success
,
still
he
had
fancied
that
he
had
seen
that
success
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
how
to
begin
,
 
and
men
were
afraid
of
him
,
thinking
that
he
was
unsteady
,
arrogant
,
and
prone
to
failure
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
seen
his
way
to
the
possibility
of
a
guinea
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
a
-
year
!
"
said
Mary
Flood
Jones
,
opening
her
eyes
wide
with
wonder
at
the
golden
future
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
nothing
very
great
for
a
perpetuity
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Phineas
;
surely
a
thousand
a
-
year
will
be
very
nice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
certain
,
"
said
Phineas
,
"
and
then
we
can
be
married
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
been
making
up
my
mind
to
wait
ever
so
long
,
"
said
Mary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
your
mind
must
be
unmade
,
"
said
Phineas
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
the
nature
of
the
reply
to
Lord
Cantrip
the
reader
may
imagine
,
and
thus
we
will
leave
our
hero
an
Inspector
of
Poor
Houses
in
the
County
of
Cork
.
    
<EOS>
