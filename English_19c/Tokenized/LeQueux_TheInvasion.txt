<EOS>
CHAPTER
I.
 
<EOS>
THE
SURPRISE
.
  
<EOS>
Two
of
the
myriad
of
London
's
nightworkers
were
walking
down
Fleet
Street
together
soon
after
dawn
on
Sunday
morning
,
2nd
September
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
had
not
yet
risen
.
<EOS>
That
main
artery
of
London
traffic
,
with
its
irregular
rows
of
closed
shops
and
newspaper
offices
,
was
quiet
and
pleasant
in
the
calm
,
mystic
light
before
the
falling
of
the
smoke
-
pall
.
 
<EOS>
Only
at
early
morning
does
the
dear
old
City
look
its
best
;
in
that
one
quiet
,
sweet
hour
when
the
night
's
toil
has
ended
and
the
day
's
has
not
yet
begun
.
<EOS>
Only
in
that
brief
interval
at
the
birth
of
day
,
when
the
rose
tints
of
the
sky
glow
slowly
into
gold
,
does
the
giant
metropolis
repose
--
at
least
,
as
far
as
its
business
streets
are
concerned
--
for
at
five
o'clock
the
toiling
millions
begin
to
again
pour
in
from
all
points
of
the
compass
,
and
the
stress
and
storm
of
London
at
once
recommences
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
that
hour
of
silent
charm
the
two
grey
-
bearded
sub
-
editors
,
though
engaged
in
offices
of
rival
newspapers
were
making
their
way
homeward
to
Dulwich
to
spend
Sunday
in
a
well
-
earned
rest
,
and
were
chatting
"
shop
,
"
as
Press
men
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
had
the
same
trouble
to
get
that
Yarmouth
story
through
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Fergusson
,
the
news
-
editor
of
the
"
Dispatch
,
"
as
they
crossed
Whitefriars
Street
.
<EOS>
"
We
got
about
half
a
column
,
and
then
the
wire
shut
down
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Telegraph
or
telephone
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Baines
,
who
was
four
or
five
years
younger
than
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
were
using
both
--
to
make
sure
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
were
we
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
rattling
good
story
--
the
robbery
was
mysterious
,
to
say
the
least
--
but
we
did
n't
get
more
than
half
of
it
.
<EOS>
Something
's
wrong
with
the
line
,
evidently
,
"
Baines
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
not
such
a
perfect
autumn
morning
,
I
should
be
inclined
to
think
there
'd
been
a
storm
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
--
funny
,
was
n't
it
?
"
remarked
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
A
shame
we
have
n't
the
whole
story
,
for
it
was
a
first
-
class
one
,
and
we
wanted
something
.
<EOS>
Did
you
put
it
on
the
contents
-
bill
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
because
we
could
n't
get
the
finish
.
<EOS>
I
tried
in
every
way
--
rang
up
the
Central
News
,
P.A.
,
Exchange
Telegraph
Company
,
tried
to
get
through
to
Yarmouth
on
the
trunk
,
and
spent
half
an
hour
or
so
pottering
about
,
but
the
reply
from
all
the
agencies
,
from
everywhere
,
in
fact
,
was
the
same
--
the
line
was
interrupted
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Just
our
case
.
<EOS>
I
telephoned
to
the
Post
Office
,
but
the
reply
came
back
that
the
lines
were
evidently
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
certainly
looks
as
though
there
'd
been
a
storm
,
but----
"
and
Baines
glanced
at
the
bright
,
clear
sky
overhead
,
just
flushed
by
<EOS>
the
bursting
sun--"there
are
certainly
no
traces
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
often
a
storm
on
the
coast
when
it
's
quite
still
in
London
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
remarked
his
friend
wisely
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
very
well
.
<EOS>
But
when
all
communication
with
a
big
place
like
Yarmouth
is
suddenly
cut
off
,
as
it
has
been
,
I
ca
n't
help
suspecting
that
something
has
happened
which
we
ought
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
perhaps
right
,
after
all
,
"
Fergusson
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
if
anything
has
happened
.
<EOS>
We
do
n't
want
to
be
called
back
to
the
office
,
either
of
us
.
<EOS>
My
assistant
,
Henderson
,
whom
I
've
left
in
charge
,
rings
me
up
over
any
mare
's
nest
.
<EOS>
The
trunk
telephones
all
come
into
the
Post
Office
Exchange
up
in
Carter
Lane
.
<EOS>
Why
not
look
in
there
before
we
go
home
?
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
take
us
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
we
have
several
trains
home
from
Ludgate
Hill
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Baines
looked
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
Like
his
companion
,
he
had
no
desire
to
be
called
back
to
his
office
after
getting
out
to
Dulwich
,
and
yet
he
was
in
no
mood
to
go
making
reporter
's
inquiries
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
'll
go
.
<EOS>
It
's
sure
to
be
nothing
,
my
dear
fellow
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
I
have
a
beastly
headache
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
heavy
night
's
work
.
<EOS>
One
of
my
men
is
away
ill
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
at
any
rate
,
I
think
I
'll
go
,
"
Fergusson
said
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
blame
me
if
you
get
called
back
for
a
special
edition
with
a
terrible
storm
,
great
loss
of
life
,
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
So
long
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
smiling
,
he
waved
his
hand
and
parted
from
his
friend
in
the
booking
office
of
Ludgate
Hill
Station
.
 
<EOS>
Quickening
his
pace
,
he
hurried
through
the
office
,
and
,
passing
out
by
the
back
,
ascended
the
steep
,
narrow
street
until
he
reached
the
Post
Office
Telephone
Exchange
in
Carter
Lane
,
where
,
presenting
his
card
,
he
asked
to
see
the
superintendent
-
in
-
charge
.
 
<EOS>
Without
much
delay
he
was
shown
upstairs
into
a
small
private
office
,
into
which
came
a
short
,
dapper
,
fair
-
moustached
man
with
the
bustle
of
a
man
in
a
great
hurry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
called
,
"
the
sub
-
editor
explained
,
"
to
know
whether
you
can
tell
me
anything
regarding
the
cause
of
the
interruption
of
the
line
to
Yarmouth
a
short
time
ago
.
<EOS>
We
had
some
important
news
coming
through
,
but
were
cut
off
just
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
then
we
received
information
that
all
the
telephone
and
telegraph
lines
to
Yarmouth
were
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
's
just
the
very
point
which
is
puzzling
us
at
this
moment
,
"
was
the
night
-
superintendent
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
unaccountable
.
<EOS>
Our
trunk
going
to
Yarmouth
seems
to
be
down
,
as
well
as
the
telegraphs
.
<EOS>
Yarmouth
,
Lowestoft
,
and
beyond
Beccles
seem
all
to
have
been
suddenly
cut
off
.
<EOS>
About
eighteen
minutes
to
four
the
operators
noticed
something
wrong
,
switched
the
trunks
through
to
the
testers
,
and
the
latter
reported
to
me
in
due
course
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
strange
!
<EOS>
Did
they
all
break
down
together
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
The
first
that
failed
was
the
one
that
runs
through
Chelmsford
,
Colchester
,
and
Ipswich
up
to
Lowestoft
and
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
The
operator
found
that
he
could
get
through
to
Ipswich
and
Beccles
.
<EOS>
Ipswich
knew
nothing
,
except
that
something
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
They
could
still
ring
up
Beccles
,
but
not
beyond
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
they
were
speaking
,
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
,
and
the
assistant
night
-
superintendent
entered
,
saying
:
 
"
The
Norwich
line
through
Scole
and
Long
Stratton
has
now
failed
,
sir
.
<EOS>
About
half
-
past
four
Norwich
reported
a
fault
somewhere
north
,
between
there
and
Cromer
.
<EOS>
But
the
operator
now
says
that
the
line
is
apparently
broken
,
and
so
are
all
the
telegraphs
from
there
to
Cromer
,
Sheringham
,
and
Holt
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Another
line
has
gone
,
then
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
superintendent
-
in
-
charge
,
utterly
astounded
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
tried
to
get
on
to
Cromer
by
the
other
routes
--
through
Nottingham
and
King
's
Lynn
,
or
through
Cambridge
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
testers
have
tried
every
route
,
but
there
's
no
response
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
could
get
through
to
some
of
the
places
--
Yarmouth
,
for
instance
--
by
telegraphing
to
the
Continent
,
I
suppose
?
"
asked
Fergusson
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
already
trying
,
"
responded
the
assistant
superintendent
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
cables
run
out
from
the
east
coast
in
that
neighbourhood
?
"
inquired
the
sub
-
editor
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
five
between
Southwold
and
Cromer
--
three
run
to
Germany
,
and
two
to
Holland
,
"
replied
the
assistant
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
cable
from
Yarmouth
to
Barkum
,
in
the
Frisian
Islands
;
from
Happisburg
,
near
Mundesley
,
to
Barkum
;
from
Yarmouth
to
Emden
;
from
Lowestoft
to
Haarlem
,
and
from
Kessingland
,
near
Southwold
,
to
Zandyport
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
you
are
trying
all
the
routes
?
"
asked
his
superior
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
spoke
to
Paris
myself
an
hour
ago
and
asked
them
to
cable
by
all
five
routes
to
Yarmouth
,
Lowestoft
,
Kessingland
,
and
Happisburg
,
"
was
the
assistant
's
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
also
asked
Liverpool
Street
Station
and
King
's
Cross
to
wire
down
to
some
of
their
stations
on
the
coast
,
but
the
reply
was
that
they
were
in
the
same
predicament
as
ourselves
--
their
lines
were
down
north
of
Beccles
,
Wymondham
,
East
Dereham
,
and
also
south
of
Lynn
.
<EOS>
I
'll
just
run
along
and
see
if
there
's
any
reply
from
Paris
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
be
through
by
this
time
,
as
it
's
Sunday
morning
,
and
no
traffic
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
went
out
hurriedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
's
certainly
something
very
peculiar
,
"
remarked
the
superintendent
-
in
-
charge
to
the
sub
-
editor
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
's
been
an
earthquake
or
an
electrical
disturbance
,
then
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
one
.
<EOS>
Every
single
line
reaching
to
the
coast
seems
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
It
's
uncommonly
funny
,
"
Fergusson
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
could
have
happened
.
<EOS>
You
've
never
had
a
complete
breakdown
like
this
before
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Never
.
<EOS>
But
I
think----
"
 
<EOS>
The
sentence
remained
unfinished
,
for
his
assistant
returned
with
a
slip
of
paper
in
his
hand
,
saying
:
 
"
This
message
has
just
come
in
from
Paris
,
I
'll
read
it
.
'
<EOS>
Superintendent
Telephones
,
Paris
,
to
Superintendent
Telephones
,
London.--Have
obtained
direct
telegraphic
communication
with
operators
of
all
five
cables
to
England
.
<EOS>
Haarlem
,
Zandyport
,
Barkum
,
and
Emden
all
report
that
cables
are
interrupted
.
<EOS>
They
can
get
no
reply
from
England
,
and
tests
show
that
cables
are
damaged
somewhere
near
English
shore
.
'
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
asked
Fergusson
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
.
<EOS>
Paris
knows
no
more
than
we
do
,
"
was
the
assistant
's
response
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
the
Norfolk
and
Suffolk
coasts
are
completely
isolated
--
cut
off
from
post
office
,
railways
,
telephones
,
and
cables
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
superintendent
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
mysterious
--
most
mysterious
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
taking
up
the
instrument
upon
his
table
,
he
placed
a
plug
in
one
of
the
holes
down
the
front
of
the
table
itself
,
and
a
moment
later
was
in
conversation
with
the
official
in
charge
of
the
traffic
at
Liverpool
Street
,
repeating
the
report
from
Paris
,
and
urging
him
to
send
light
engines
north
from
Wymondham
or
Beccles
into
the
zone
of
the
mystery
.
 
<EOS>
The
reply
came
back
that
he
had
already
done
so
,
but
a
telegram
had
reached
him
from
Wymondham
to
the
effect
that
the
road
-
bridges
between
Kimberley
and
Hardingham
had
apparently
fallen
in
,
and
the
line
was
blocked
by
debris
.
<EOS>
Interruption
was
also
reported
beyond
Swaffham
,
at
a
place
called
Little
Dunham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
even
the
railways
themselves
are
broken
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fergusson
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
that
there
has
been
a
great
earthquake
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
An
earthquake
could
n't
very
well
destroy
all
five
cables
from
the
Continent
,
"
remarked
the
superintendent
gravely
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
had
scarcely
placed
the
receiver
upon
the
hook
when
a
third
man
entered
--
an
operator
who
,
addressing
him
,
said
:
 
"
Will
you
please
come
to
the
switchboard
,
sir
?
<EOS>
There
's
a
man
in
the
Ipswich
call
office
who
has
just
told
me
a
most
extraordinary
story
.
<EOS>
He
says
that
he
started
in
his
motor
-
car
alone
from
Lowestoft
to
London
at
half
-
past
three
this
morning
,
and
just
as
it
was
getting
light
he
was
passing
along
the
edge
of
Henham
Park
,
between
Wangford
village
and
Blythburgh
,
when
he
saw
three
men
apparently
repairing
the
telegraph
wires
.
<EOS>
One
was
up
the
pole
,
and
the
other
two
were
standing
below
.
<EOS>
As
he
passed
he
saw
a
flash
,
for
,
to
his
surprise
,
one
of
the
men
fired
point
-
blank
at
him
with
a
revolver
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
the
shot
went
wide
,
and
he
at
once
put
on
a
move
and
got
down
into
Blythburgh
village
,
even
though
one
of
his
tyres
went
down
.
<EOS>
It
had
probably
been
pierced
by
the
bullet
fired
at
him
,
as
the
puncture
was
unlike
any
he
had
ever
had
before
.
<EOS>
At
Blythburgh
he
informed
the
police
of
the
outrage
,
and
the
constable
,
in
turn
,
woke
up
the
postmaster
,
who
tried
to
telegraph
back
to
the
police
at
Wrentham
,
but
found
that
the
line
was
interrupted
.
<EOS>
Was
it
possible
that
the
men
were
cutting
the
wires
,
instead
of
repairing
them
?
<EOS>
He
says
that
after
repairing
the
puncture
he
took
the
village
constable
and
three
other
men
on
his
car
and
went
back
to
the
spot
,
where
,
although
the
trio
had
escaped
,
they
saw
that
wholesale
havoc
had
been
wrought
with
the
telegraphs
.
<EOS>
The
lines
had
been
severed
in
four
or
five
places
,
and
whole
lengths
tangled
up
into
great
masses
.
<EOS>
A
number
of
poles
had
been
sawn
down
,
and
were
lying
about
the
roadside
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
nothing
could
be
done
,
the
gentleman
remounted
his
car
,
came
on
to
Ipswich
,
and
reported
the
damage
at
our
call
office
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
is
he
still
there
?
"
exclaimed
the
superintendent
quickly
,
amazed
at
the
motorist
's
statement
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
asked
him
to
wait
for
a
few
moments
in
order
to
speak
to
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
at
once
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'd
like
to
come
also
,
Mr.
Fergusson
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
all
three
ran
up
to
the
gallery
,
where
the
huge
switchboards
were
ranged
around
,
and
where
the
night
operators
,
with
the
receivers
attached
to
one
ear
,
were
still
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
moment
the
superintendent
had
taken
the
operator
's
seat
,
adjusted
the
ear
-
piece
,
and
was
in
conversation
with
Ipswich
.
<EOS>
A
second
later
he
was
speaking
with
the
man
who
had
actually
witnessed
the
cutting
of
the
trunk
line
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
engaged
an
operator
at
the
farther
end
of
the
switchboard
suddenly
gave
vent
to
a
cry
of
surprise
and
disbelief
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
,
Beccles
?
<EOS>
Repeat
it
,
"
he
asked
excitedly
.
 
<EOS>
Then
a
moment
later
he
shouted
aloud
:
 
<EOS>
"
Beccles
says
that
German
soldiers
--
hundreds
of
them
--
are
pouring
into
the
place
!
<EOS>
The
Germans
have
landed
at
Lowestoft
,
they
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
All
who
heard
those
ominous
words
sprang
up
dumbfounded
,
staring
at
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
assistant
-
superintendent
dashed
to
the
operator
's
side
and
seized
his
apparatus
.
 
<EOS>
"
Halloa
--
halloa
,
Beccles
!
<EOS>
Halloa
--
halloa
--
halloa
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
response
was
some
gruff
words
in
German
,
and
the
sound
of
scuffling
could
distinctly
be
heard
.
<EOS>
Then
all
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Time
after
time
he
rang
up
the
small
Suffolk
town
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Then
he
switched
through
to
the
testers
,
and
quickly
the
truth
was
plain
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
trunk
line
to
Norwich
,
running
from
Ipswich
by
Harleston
and
Beccles
,
had
been
cut
farther
towards
London
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
held
everyone
breathless
in
the
trunk
telephone
headquarters
was
that
the
Germans
had
actually
effected
<EOS>
the
surprise
landing
that
had
so
often
in
recent
years
been
predicted
by
military
critics
;
that
England
on
that
quiet
September
Sunday
morning
had
been
attacked
.
<EOS>
England
was
actually
invaded
.
<EOS>
It
was
incredible
!
 
<EOS>
Yet
London
's
millions
in
their
Sunday
morning
lethargy
were
in
utter
ignorance
of
the
grim
disaster
that
had
suddenly
fallen
upon
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
Fergusson
was
for
rushing
at
once
back
to
the
"
Dispatch
"
office
to
get
out
an
extraordinary
edition
,
but
the
superintendent
,
who
was
still
in
conversation
with
the
motorist
,
urged
judicious
forethought
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
the
present
,
let
us
wait
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
us
alarm
the
public
unnecessarily
.
<EOS>
We
want
corroboration
.
<EOS>
Let
us
have
the
motorist
up
here
,
"
he
suggested
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
cried
the
sub
-
editor
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
speak
to
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
Over
the
wire
Fergusson
begged
the
stranger
to
come
at
once
to
London
and
give
his
story
,
declaring
that
the
military
authorities
would
require
it
.
<EOS>
Then
,
just
as
the
man
who
had
been
shot
at
by
German
advance
spies
--
for
such
they
had
undoubtedly
been
--
in
order
to
prevent
the
truth
leaking
out
,
gave
his
promise
to
come
to
town
at
once
,
there
came
over
the
line
from
the
coastguard
at
Southwold
a
vague
,
incoherent
telephone
message
regarding
strange
ships
having
been
seen
to
the
northward
,
and
asking
for
connection
with
Harwich
;
while
King
's
Cross
and
Liverpool
Street
Stations
both
rang
up
almost
simultaneously
,
reporting
the
receipt
of
extraordinary
messages
from
King
's
Lynn
,
Diss
,
Harleston
,
Halesworth
,
and
other
places
.
<EOS>
All
declared
that
German
soldiers
were
swarming
over
the
north
,
that
Lowestoft
and
Beccles
had
been
seized
,
and
that
Yarmouth
and
Cromer
were
isolated
.
 
<EOS>
Various
stationmasters
reported
that
the
enemy
had
blown
up
bridges
,
taken
up
rails
,
and
effectually
blocked
all
communication
with
the
coast
.
<EOS>
Certain
important
junctions
were
already
held
by
the
enemy
's
outposts
.
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
amazing
news
received
in
that
high
-
up
room
in
Carter
Lane
,
City
,
on
that
sweet
,
sunny
morning
when
all
the
great
world
of
London
was
at
peace
,
either
still
slumbering
or
week
-
ending
.
 
<EOS>
Fergusson
remained
for
a
full
hour
and
a
half
at
the
Telephone
Exchange
,
anxiously
awaiting
any
further
corroboration
.
<EOS>
Many
wild
stories
came
over
the
wires
telling
how
panic
-
stricken
people
were
fleeing
inland
away
from
the
enemy
's
outposts
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
a
hansom
to
the
"
Dispatch
"
office
,
and
proceeded
to
prepare
a
special
edition
of
his
paper
--
an
edition
containing
surely
the
most
amazing
news
that
had
ever
startled
London
.
 
<EOS>
Fearing
to
create
undue
panic
,
he
decided
not
to
go
to
press
until
the
arrival
of
the
motorist
from
Ipswich
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
the
story
of
the
man
who
had
actually
seen
the
cutting
of
the
wires
.
<EOS>
He
paced
his
room
excitedly
,
wondering
what
effect
the
news
would
have
upon
the
world
.
<EOS>
In
the
rival
newspaper
offices
the
report
was
,
as
yet
,
unknown
.
<EOS>
With
journalistic
forethought
he
had
arranged
that
at
present
the
bewildering
truth
should
not
leak
out
to
his
rivals
,
either
from
the
railway
termini
or
from
the
telephone
exchange
.
<EOS>
His
only
fear
was
that
some
local
correspondent
might
telegraph
from
some
village
or
town
nearer
<EOS>
the
metropolis
which
was
still
in
communication
with
the
central
office
.
 
<EOS>
Time
passed
very
slowly
.
<EOS>
Each
moment
increased
his
anxiety
.
<EOS>
He
had
sent
out
the
one
reporter
who
remained
on
duty
to
the
house
of
Colonel
Sir
James
Taylor
,
the
Permanent
Under
-
Secretary
for
War
.
<EOS>
Halting
before
the
open
window
,
he
looked
up
and
down
the
street
for
the
arriving
motor
-
car
.
<EOS>
But
all
was
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Eight
o'clock
had
just
boomed
from
Big
Ben
,
and
London
still
remained
in
her
Sunday
morning
peace
.
<EOS>
The
street
,
bright
in
the
warm
sunshine
,
was
quite
empty
,
save
for
a
couple
of
motor
-
omnibuses
and
a
sprinkling
of
gaily
dressed
holiday
-
makers
on
their
way
to
the
day
excursion
trains
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
centre
of
London
--
the
hub
of
the
world
--
all
was
comparatively
silent
,
the
welcome
rest
after
the
busy
turmoil
that
through
six
days
in
the
week
is
unceasing
,
that
fevered
throbbing
of
the
heart
of
the
world
's
great
capital
.
 
<EOS>
Of
a
sudden
,
however
,
came
the
whirr
-
r
of
an
approaching
car
,
as
a
thin
-
faced
,
travel
-
stained
man
tore
along
from
the
direction
of
the
Strand
and
pulled
up
before
the
office
.
<EOS>
The
fine
car
,
a
six
-
cylinder
"
Napier
,
"
was
grey
with
the
mud
of
country
roads
,
while
the
motorist
himself
was
smothered
until
his
goggles
had
been
almost
entirely
covered
.
 
<EOS>
Fergusson
rushed
out
to
him
,
and
a
few
moments
later
the
pair
were
in
the
upstairs
room
,
the
sub
-
editor
swiftly
taking
down
the
motorist
's
story
,
which
differed
very
little
from
what
he
had
already
spoken
over
the
telephone
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
just
as
Big
Ben
chimed
the
half
-
hour
,
the
echoes
of
the
half
-
deserted
Strand
were
suddenly
awakened
by
the
loud
,
strident
voices
of
the
newsboys
shouting
:
 
"
'
Dispatch
,
'
spe
-
shall
!
<EOS>
Invasion
of
England
this
morning
!
<EOS>
Germans
in
Suffolk
!
<EOS>
Terrible
panic
!
<EOS>
Spe
-
shall
!
'
<EOS>
Dispatch
,
'
Spe
-
shall
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
paper
had
gone
to
press
Fergusson
urged
the
motorist
--
whose
name
was
Horton
,
and
who
lived
at
Richmond
--
to
go
with
him
to
the
War
Office
and
report
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
both
men
entered
the
car
,
and
as
they
did
so
a
man
jumped
from
a
hansom
in
breathless
haste
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
reporter
whom
Fergusson
had
sent
out
to
Sir
James
Taylor
's
house
in
Cleveland
Square
,
Hyde
Park
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
thought
Sir
James
spent
the
night
with
his
brother
up
at
Hampstead
,
"
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
there
,
but
find
that
he
's
away
for
the
week
-
end
at
Chilham
Hall
,
near
Buckden
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Buckden
!
<EOS>
That
's
on
the
Great
North
Road
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Horton
,
"
We
'll
go
at
once
and
find
him
.
<EOS>
Sixty
miles
from
London
.
<EOS>
We
can
be
there
under
two
hours
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
a
few
minutes
later
the
pair
were
tearing
due
north
,
turning
at
last
into
the
handsome
lodge
-
gates
of
Chilham
Park
,
and
running
up
the
great
elm
avenue
,
drew
up
before
the
main
door
of
the
ancient
hall
,
<EOS>
a
quaint
many
-
gabled
old
place
of
grey
stone
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
moments
later
the
breathless
journalist
faced
the
Permanent
Under
-
Secretary
with
the
news
that
England
was
invaded
--
that
the
Germans
had
actually
effected
a
surprise
landing
on
the
east
coast
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
James
and
his
host
stood
speechless
.
<EOS>
Like
others
,
they
at
first
believed
the
pale
-
faced
,
bearded
sub
-
editor
to
be
a
lunatic
,
but
a
few
moments
later
,
when
Horton
briefly
repeated
the
story
,
they
saw
that
,
whatever
might
have
occurred
,
the
two
men
were
at
least
in
deadly
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
cried
Sir
James
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
surely
have
heard
something
of
it
if
such
were
actually
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
coastguard
would
have
telephoned
the
news
instantly
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
where
is
our
fleet
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
Germans
evidently
laid
their
plans
with
great
cleverness
.
<EOS>
Their
spies
,
already
in
England
,
cut
the
wires
at
a
pre
-
arranged
hour
last
night
,
"
declared
Fergusson
.
<EOS>
"
They
sought
to
prevent
this
gentleman
from
giving
the
alarm
by
shooting
him
.
<EOS>
All
the
railways
to
London
are
already
either
cut
or
held
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
One
thing
,
however
,
is
clear
--
fleet
or
no
fleet
,
the
east
coast
is
entirely
at
their
mercy
.
"
 
<EOS>
Host
and
guest
exchanged
dark
glances
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
what
you
say
is
the
actual
truth
,
"
exclaimed
Sir
James
,
"
to
-
day
is
surely
the
blackest
day
that
England
has
ever
known
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
they
should
have
listened
to
Lord
Roberts
,
"
snapped
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
'll
go
at
once
,
Taylor
,
and
make
inquiries
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
responded
the
Permanent
Secretary
.
<EOS>
And
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
,
accepting
Horton
's
offer
,
he
was
sitting
in
the
car
as
it
headed
back
towards
London
.
 
<EOS>
Could
the
journalist
's
story
be
true
?
<EOS>
As
he
sat
there
,
with
his
head
bent
against
the
wind
and
the
mud
splashing
into
his
face
,
Sir
James
recollected
too
well
the
repeated
warnings
of
the
past
five
years
,
serious
warnings
by
men
who
knew
our
shortcomings
,
but
to
which
no
attention
had
been
paid
.
<EOS>
Both
the
Government
and
the
public
had
remained
apathetic
,
the
idea
of
peril
had
been
laughed
to
scorn
,
and
the
country
had
,
ostrich
-
like
,
buried
its
head
in
the
sand
,
and
allowed
Continental
nations
to
supersede
us
in
business
,
in
armaments
,
in
everything
.
 
<EOS>
The
danger
of
invasion
had
always
been
ridiculed
as
a
mere
alarmist
's
fiction
;
those
responsible
for
the
defence
of
the
country
had
smiled
,
the
Navy
had
been
reduced
,
and
the
Army
had
remained
in
contented
inefficiency
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
blow
had
really
been
struck
by
Germany
?
<EOS>
If
she
had
risked
three
or
four
,
out
of
her
twenty
-
three
,
army
corps
,
and
had
aimed
at
the
heart
of
the
British
Empire
?
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
Ay
!
<EOS>
what
then
?
 
<EOS>
As
the
car
glided
down
Regent
Street
into
Pall
Mall
and
towards
Whitehall
,
Sir
James
saw
on
every
side
crowds
discussing
the
vague
<EOS>
but
astounding
reports
now
published
in
special
editions
of
all
the
Sunday
papers
,
and
shouted
wildly
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
Boys
bearing
sheets
fresh
from
the
Fleet
Street
presses
were
seized
,
and
bundles
torn
from
them
by
excited
Londoners
eager
to
learn
the
latest
intelligence
.
 
<EOS>
Around
both
War
Office
and
Admiralty
great
surging
crowds
were
clamouring
loudly
for
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Was
it
the
truth
,
or
was
it
only
a
hoax
?
<EOS>
Half
London
disbelieved
it
.
<EOS>
Yet
from
every
quarter
,
from
the
north
and
from
across
the
bridges
,
thousands
were
pouring
in
to
ascertain
what
had
really
occurred
,
and
the
police
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
order
.
 
<EOS>
In
Trafalgar
Square
,
where
the
fountains
were
plashing
so
calmly
in
the
autumn
sunlight
,
a
shock
-
headed
man
mounted
the
back
of
one
of
the
lions
and
harangued
the
crowd
with
much
gesticulation
,
denouncing
the
Government
in
the
most
violent
terms
;
but
the
orator
was
ruthlessly
pulled
down
by
the
police
in
the
midst
of
his
fierce
attack
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
half
-
past
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
had
already
been
on
English
soil
ten
hours
,
yet
London
was
in
ignorance
of
where
they
had
actually
landed
,
and
utterly
helpless
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
II
.
 
<EOS>
EFFECT
IN
THE
CITY
.
  
<EOS>
Monday
,
3rd
September
,
1910
,
was
indeed
Black
Monday
for
London
.
 
<EOS>
By
midnight
on
Sunday
the
appalling
news
had
spread
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Though
the
full
details
of
the
terrible
naval
disasters
were
not
yet
to
hand
,
yet
it
was
vaguely
known
that
our
ships
had
been
defeated
in
the
North
Sea
,
and
many
of
them
sunk
.
 
<EOS>
Before
7
a.m.
on
Monday
,
however
,
telegrams
reaching
London
by
the
subterranean
lines
from
the
north
gave
thrilling
stories
of
frightful
disasters
we
had
,
while
all
unconscious
,
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
German
fleet
.
 
<EOS>
With
London
,
the
great
cities
of
the
north
,
Liverpool
,
Manchester
,
Sheffield
,
and
Birmingham
,
awoke
utterly
dazed
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
incredible
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
enemy
had
,
by
his
sudden
and
stealthy
blow
,
secured
command
of
the
sea
and
actually
landed
.
 
<EOS>
The
public
wondered
why
a
formal
declaration
of
war
had
not
previously
been
made
,
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
declaration
preceding
the
Franco
-
German
War
was
the
first
made
by
any
civilised
nation
prior
to
the
commencement
of
hostilities
for
one
hundred
and
seventy
years
.
<EOS>
The
peril
of
the
nation
was
now
recognised
on
every
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Eager
millions
poured
into
the
City
by
every
train
from
the
suburbs
and
towns
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Metropolis
,
anxious
to
ascertain
the
truth
for
themselves
,
pale
with
terror
,
wild
with
excitement
,
<EOS>
indignant
that
our
land
forces
were
not
already
mobilised
and
ready
to
move
eastward
to
meet
the
invader
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
banks
were
opened
there
was
a
run
on
them
,
but
by
noon
the
Bank
of
England
had
suspended
all
specie
payments
.
<EOS>
The
other
banks
,
being
thus
unable
to
meet
their
engagements
,
simply
closed
the
doors
,
bringing
business
to
an
abrupt
standstill
.
<EOS>
Consols
stood
at
90
on
Saturday
,
but
by
noon
on
Monday
were
down
to
42
-
-lower
even
than
they
were
in
1798
,
when
they
stood
at
47
-
1/4
.
<EOS>
Numbers
of
foreigners
tried
to
speculate
heavily
,
but
were
unable
to
do
so
,
for
banking
being
suspended
they
could
not
obtain
transfers
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
Stock
Exchange
the
panic
in
the
afternoon
was
indescribable
.
<EOS>
Securities
of
every
sort
went
entirely
to
pieces
,
and
there
were
no
buyers
.
<EOS>
Financiers
were
surprised
that
no
warning
in
London
had
betrayed
the
position
of
affairs
,
London
being
the
money
centre
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Prior
to
1870
Paris
shared
with
London
the
honour
of
being
the
pivot
of
the
money
market
,
but
on
the
suspension
of
cash
payments
by
the
Bank
of
France
during
the
Franco
-
German
War
,
Paris
lost
that
position
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
that
the
milliards
comprising
the
French
War
indemnity
were
intact
in
golden
louis
in
the
fortress
of
Spandau
,
Germany
could
never
have
hoped
to
wage
sudden
war
with
Great
Britain
before
she
had
made
Berlin
independent
of
London
in
a
money
sense
,
or
,
at
any
rate
,
to
accumulate
sufficient
gold
to
carry
on
the
war
for
at
least
twelve
months
.
<EOS>
The
only
way
in
which
she
could
have
done
this
was
to
raise
her
rate
so
as
to
offer
better
terms
than
London
.
<EOS>
Yet
directly
the
Bank
of
England
discovered
the
rate
of
exchange
going
against
her
,
and
her
stock
of
gold
diminishing
,
she
would
have
responded
by
raising
the
English
bank
-
rate
in
order
to
check
the
flow
.
<EOS>
Thus
competition
would
have
gone
on
until
the
rates
became
so
high
that
all
business
would
be
checked
,
and
people
would
have
realised
their
securities
to
obtain
the
necessary
money
to
carry
on
their
affairs
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
no
doubt
,
the
coming
war
would
have
been
forecasted
had
it
not
been
for
Germany
's
already
prepared
war
-
chest
,
which
the
majority
of
persons
have
nowadays
overlooked
.
<EOS>
Its
possession
had
enabled
Germany
to
strike
her
sudden
blow
,
and
now
the
Bank
of
England
,
which
is
the
final
reserve
of
gold
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
found
that
as
notes
were
cashed
so
the
stock
of
gold
diminished
until
it
was
in
a
few
hours
compelled
to
obtain
from
the
Government
suspension
of
the
Bank
charter
.
<EOS>
This
enabled
the
Bank
to
suspend
cash
payment
,
and
issue
notes
without
a
corresponding
deposit
of
the
equivalent
in
gold
.
 
<EOS>
The
suspension
,
contrary
to
increasing
the
panic
,
had
,
curiously
enough
the
immediate
effect
of
somewhat
allaying
it
.
<EOS>
Plenty
of
people
in
the
City
were
confident
that
the
blow
aimed
could
not
prove
an
effective
one
,
and
that
the
Germans
,
however
many
might
have
landed
,
would
quickly
be
sent
back
again
.
<EOS>
Thus
many
level
-
headed
business
men
regarded
the
position
calmly
,
believing
that
when
our
command
of
the
sea
was
again
re
-
established
,
as
it
must
be
in
a
day
or
two
,
the
enemy
would
soon
be
non
-
existent
.
 
<EOS>
Business
outside
the
money
market
was
,
of
course
,
utterly
demoralised
.
<EOS>
The
buying
of
necessities
was
now
uppermost
in
everyone
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Excited
crowds
in
the
streets
caused
most
of
the
shops
in
the
City
and
West
End
to
close
,
while
around
the
Admiralty
were
great
crowds
of
eager
men
and
women
of
all
classes
,
tearful
wives
of
bluejackets
jostling
with
officers
'
ladies
from
Mayfair
and
Belgravia
,
demanding
news
of
their
loved
ones
--
inquiries
which
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
casualty
office
were
unable
to
satisfy
.
<EOS>
The
scene
of
grief
,
terror
,
and
suspense
was
heartrending
.
<EOS>
Certain
ships
were
known
to
have
been
sunk
with
all
on
board
after
making
a
gallant
fight
,
and
those
who
had
husbands
,
brothers
,
lovers
,
or
fathers
on
board
wept
loudly
,
calling
upon
the
Government
to
avenge
the
ruthless
murder
of
their
loved
ones
.
 
<EOS>
In
Manchester
,
in
Liverpool
,
indeed
,
all
through
the
great
manufacturing
centres
of
the
north
,
the
excitement
of
London
was
reflected
.
 
<EOS>
In
Manchester
there
was
a
panic
"
on
'
Change
,
"
and
the
crowd
in
Deansgate
coming
into
collision
with
a
force
of
mounted
police
,
some
rioting
occurred
,
and
a
number
of
shop
windows
broken
,
while
several
agitators
who
attempted
to
speak
in
front
of
the
infirmary
were
at
once
arrested
.
 
<EOS>
Liverpool
was
the
scene
of
intense
anxiety
and
excitement
,
when
a
report
was
spread
that
German
cruisers
were
about
the
estuary
of
the
Mersey
.
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
the
coal
staithes
,
cranes
,
and
petroleum
tanks
at
Penarth
,
Cardiff
,
Barry
,
and
Llanelly
had
been
destroyed
;
that
Aberdeen
had
been
bombarded
;
and
there
were
rumours
that
,
notwithstanding
the
mines
and
defences
of
the
Mersey
,
the
city
of
Liverpool
,
with
all
its
crowd
of
valuable
shipping
,
was
to
share
the
same
fate
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
place
was
in
a
ferment
.
<EOS>
By
eleven
o'clock
the
stations
were
crowded
by
women
and
children
sent
by
the
men
away
into
the
country
--
anywhere
from
the
doomed
and
defenceless
city
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
Mayor
vainly
endeavoured
to
inspire
confidence
,
but
telegrams
from
London
,
announcing
the
complete
financial
collapse
,
only
increased
the
panic
.
 
<EOS>
In
London
all
through
the
morning
,
amid
the
chaos
of
business
in
the
City
,
the
excitement
had
been
steadily
growing
,
until
shortly
after
three
o'clock
the
"
Daily
Mail
"
issued
a
special
edition
containing
a
copy
of
a
German
proclamation
which
,
it
was
said
,
was
now
posted
everywhere
in
East
Norfolk
,
East
Suffolk
,
and
in
Maldon
in
Essex
,
already
occupied
by
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
The
original
proclamation
had
been
found
pasted
by
some
unknown
hand
upon
a
barn
door
near
the
town
of
Billericay
,
and
had
been
detached
and
brought
to
London
in
a
motor
-
car
by
a
correspondent
.
 
<EOS>
It
showed
plainly
the
German
intention
was
to
deal
a
hard
and
crushing
blow
,
and
it
struck
terror
into
the
heart
of
London
,
for
it
read
as
will
be
seen
on
next
page
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
walls
of
the
Mansion
House
,
the
Guildhall
,
outside
the
Bank
of
England
,
the
Royal
Exchange
,
upon
the
various
public
buildings
within
the
city
wards
,
and
westward
beyond
Temple
Bar
,
proclamations
were
being
posted
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
upon
all
the
hoardings
in
Greater
London
appeared
various
broadsheets
side
by
side
.
<EOS>
One
by
the
Chief
Commissioner
of
Police
,
regulating
the
traffic
in
the
streets
,
and
appealing
to
the
public
to
assist
in
the
preservation
of
order
;
and
a
Royal
Proclamation
,
brief
but
noble
,
urging
every
Briton
to
do
his
duty
,
to
take
his
part
in
the
defence
of
King
and
country
,
and
to
unfurl
the
banner
of
the
British
Empire
that
had
hitherto
carried
peace
and
civilisation
in
every
quarter
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
Germany
,
whose
independence
had
been
respected
,
had
attacked
us
without
provocation
;
therefore
hostilities
were
,
alas
,
inevitable
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
great
poster
printed
in
big
capitals
and
headed
by
the
Royal
Arms
made
its
appearance
it
was
greeted
with
wild
cheering
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
message
of
love
from
King
to
people
--
a
message
to
the
highest
and
to
the
lowest
.
<EOS>
Posted
in
Whitechapel
at
the
same
hour
as
in
Whitehall
,
the
throngs
crowded
eagerly
about
it
and
sang
"
God
Save
our
Gracious
King
,
"
for
if
they
had
but
little
confidence
in
the
War
Office
and
Admiralty
,
they
placed
their
trust
in
their
Sovereign
,
the
first
diplomat
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
Therefore
the
loyalty
was
spontaneous
,
as
it
always
is
.
<EOS>
They
read
the
royal
message
,
and
cheered
and
cheered
again
.
 
<EOS>
As
evening
closed
in
yet
another
poster
made
its
appearance
in
every
city
,
town
,
and
village
in
the
country
,
a
poster
issued
by
military

<EOS>
The
public
,
however
,
little
dreamed
of
the
hopeless
confusion
in
the
War
Office
,
in
the
various
regimental
depots
throughout
the
country
,
at
headquarters
everywhere
,
and
in
every

<EOS>
The
armed
forces
of
England
were
passing
from
a
peace
to
a
war
footing
;
but
the
mobilisation
of
the
various
units
--
namely
,
its
completion
in
men
,
horses
,
and
material
--
was
utterly
impossible
in
the
face
of
the
extraordinary
regulations
which
,
kept
a
strict
secret
by
the
Council
of
Defence
until
this
moment
,
revealed
a
hopeless
state
of
things
.
 
<EOS>
The
disorder
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
Not
a
regiment
was
found
fully
equipped
and
ready
to
march
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dearth
of
officers
,
equipment
,
horses
,
provisions
--
of
,
indeed
,
everything
.
<EOS>
Men
had
guns
without
ammunition
;
cavalry
and
artillery
were
without
horses
;
engineers
only
half
equipped
;
volunteers
with
no
transport
whatever
;
balloon
sections
without
balloons
,
and
searchlight
units
vainly
trying
to
obtain
the
necessary
instruments
.
 
<EOS>
Horses
were
being
requisitioned
everywhere
.
<EOS>
The
few
horses
that
,
in
the
age
of
motor
-
cars
,
now
remained
on
the
roads
in
London
were
quickly
taken
for
draught
,
and
all
horses
fit
to
ride
were
commandeered
for
the
cavalry
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
turmoil
daring
German
spies
were
actively
at
work
south
of
London
.
<EOS>
The
Southampton
line
of
the
London
and
South
-
Western
Railway
was
destroyed
--
with
explosives
placed
by
unknown
hands
--
by
the
bridge
over
the
Wey
,
near
Weybridge
,
being
blown
up
;
and
again
that
over
the
Mole
,
between
Walton
and
Esher
,
while
the
Reading
line
was
cut
by
the
great
bridge
over
the
Thames
at
Staines
being
destroyed
.
<EOS>
The
line
,
too
,
between
Guildford
and
Waterloo
,
was
also
rendered
impassable
by
the
wreck
of
the
midnight
train
,
which
was
blown
up
half
-
way
between
Wansborough
and
Guildford
,
while
in
several
other
places
nearer
London
bridges
were
rendered
unstable
by
dynamite
,
the
favourite
method
apparently
being
to
blow
the
crown
out
of
an
arch
.
 
<EOS>
The
well
-
laid
plans
of
the
enemy
were
thus
quickly
revealed
.
<EOS>
Among
the
thousands
of
Germans
working
in
London
,
the
hundred
or
so
spies
,
all
trusted
soldiers
,
had
passed
unnoticed
but
,
working
in
unison
,
each
little
group
of
two
or
three
had
been
allotted
its
task
,
and
had
previously
thoroughly
reconnoitred
the
position
and
studied
the
most
rapid
or
effective
means
.
 
<EOS>
The
railways
to
the
east
and
north
-
east
coasts
all
reported
wholesale
damage
done
on
Sunday
night
by
the
advance
agents
of
the
enemy
,
and
now
this
was
continued
on
the
night
of
Monday
in
the
south
,
the
objective
being
to
hinder
troops
from
moving
north
from
Aldershot
.
<EOS>
This
was
,
indeed
,
effectual
,
for
only
by
a
long
_
detour
<EOS>
_
could
the
troops
be
moved
to
the
northern
defences
of
London
,
and
while
many
were
on
Tuesday
entrained
,
others
were
conveyed
to
London
by
the
motor
omnibuses
sent
down
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Everywhere
through
London
and
its
vicinity
,
as
well
as
Manchester
,
Birmingham
,
Sheffield
,
Coventry
,
Leeds
,
and
Liverpool
,
motor
-
cars
and
motor
-
omnibuses
from
dealers
and
private
owners
were
being
requisitioned
by
the
military
authorities
,
for
they
would
,
it
was
believed
,
replace
cavalry
to
a
very
large
extent
.
 
<EOS>
Wild
and
extraordinary
reports
were
circulated
regarding
the
disasters
in
the
north
.
<EOS>
Hull
,
Newcastle
,
Gateshead
,
and
Tynemouth
had
,
it
was
believed
,
been
bombarded
and
sacked
.
<EOS>
The
shipping
in
the
Tyne
was
burning
,
and
the
Elswick
works
were
held
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Details
were
,
however
,
very
vague
,
as
the
Germans
were
taking
every
precaution
to
prevent
information
reaching
London
.

CHAPTER

<EOS>
NEWS
OF
THE
ENEMY
.
  
<EOS>
Terror
and
excitement
reigned
everywhere
.
<EOS>
The
wildest
rumours
were
hourly
afloat
.
<EOS>
London
was
a
seething
stream
of
breathless
multitudes
of
every
class
.
 
<EOS>
On
Monday
morning
the
newspapers
throughout
the
kingdom
had
devoted
greater
part
of
their
space
to
the
extraordinary
intelligence
from
Norfolk
and
Suffolk
,
and
Essex
,
and
other
places
.
<EOS>
Only
the
slow
,
old
-
fashioned
"
Globe
"
remained
asleep
,
or
pretended
to
know
nothing
of
what
was
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
That
we
were
actually
invaded
was
plain
,
but
most
of
the
newspapers
happily
preserved
a
calm
,
dignified
tone
,
and
made
no
attempt
at
sensationalism
.
<EOS>
The
situation
was
far
too
serious
.
 
<EOS>
Like
the
public
,
however
,
the
Press
had
been
taken
entirely
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
blow
had
been
so
sudden
and
so
staggering
that
half
the
alarming
reports
were
discredited
.
 
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
details
of
the
enemy
's
operations
,
as
far
as
could
as
yet
be
ascertained
,
the
"
Morning
Post
"
on
Monday
contained
an
account
of
a
mysterious
occurrence
at
Chatham
,
which
read
as
follows
:
     
"
CHATHAM
,
_
Sept.

(
<EOS>

P.M.

<EOS>
"
An
extraordinary
accident
took
place
on
the
Medway
about
eight
o'clock
this
evening
.
<EOS>
The
steamer
'
Pole
Star
,
'
1,200
tons
register
,
with
a
cargo
of
cement
from
Frindsbury
,
was
leaving
for
Hamburg
,
and
came
into
collision
with
the
'
Frauenlob
,
'
of
Bremen
,
a
somewhat
larger
boat
,
which
was
inward
bound
,
in
a
narrow
part
of
the
channel
about
half
-
way
between
Chatham
and
Sheerness
.
<EOS>
Various
accounts
of
the
mishap
are
current
,
but
whichever
of
the
vessels
was
responsible
for
the
bad
steering
or
neglect
of
the
ordinary
rules
of
the
road
<EOS>
,
it
is
certain
that
the
'
Frauenlob
'
was
cut
into
by
the
stem
of
the
'
Pole
Star
'
on
her
port
bow
,
and
sank
almost
across
the
channel
.
<EOS>
The
'
Pole
Star
'
swung
alongside
her
after
the
collision
,
and
very
soon
afterwards
sank
in
an
almost
parallel
position
.
<EOS>
Tugs
and
steamboats
carrying
a
number
of
naval
officers
and
the
port
authorities
are
about
to
proceed
to
the
scene
of
the
accident
,
and
if
,
as
seems
probable
,
there
is
no
chance
of
raising
the
vessels
,
steps
will
be
at
once
taken
to
blow
them
up
.
<EOS>
In
the
present
state
of
our
foreign
relations
such
an
obstruction
directly
across
the
entrance
to
one
of
our
principal
war
-
ports
is
a
national
danger
,
and
will
not
be
allowed
to
remain
a
moment
longer
than
can
be
helped
.

An
extraordinary
_
denouement
_
has
followed
the
collision
in
the
Medway
reported
in
my
telegram
of
last
night
,
which
renders
it
impossible
to
draw
any
other
conclusion
than
that
the
affair
is
anything
but
an
accident
.
<EOS>
Everything
now
goes
to
prove
that
the
whole
business
was
premeditated
and
was
the
result
of
an
organised
plot
with
the
object
of
'
bottling
up
'
the
numerous
men
-
of
-
war
that
are
now
being
hurriedly
equipped
for
service
in
Chatham
Dockyard
.
<EOS>
In
the
words
of
Scripture
,
'
An
enemy
hath
done
this
,
'
and
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
as
to
the
quarter
from
which
the
outrage
was
engineered
.
<EOS>
It
is
nothing
less
than
an
outrage
to
perpetrate
what
is
in
reality
an
overt
act
of
hostility
in
a
time
of
profound
peace
,
however
much
the
political
horizon
may
be
darkened
by
lowering
war
-
clouds
.
<EOS>
We
are
living
under
a
Government
whose
leader
lost
no
time
in
announcing
that
no
fear
of
being
sneered
at
as
a
'
Little
Englander
'
would
deter
him
from
seeking
peace
and
ensuring
it
by
a
reduction
of
our
naval
and
military
armaments
,
even
at
that
time
known
to
be
inadequate
to
the
demands
likely
to
be
made
upon
them
if
our
Empire
is
to
be
maintained
.
<EOS>
We
trust
,
however
,
that
even
this
parochially
-
minded
statesman
will
lose
no
time
in
probing
the
conspiracy
to
its
depths
,
and
in
seeking
instant
satisfaction
from
those
personages
,
however
highly
placed
and
powerful
,
who
have
committed
this
outrage
on
the
laws
of
civilisation
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
the
news
of
the
collision
reached
the
dockyard
the
senior
officer
at
Kethole
Reach
was
ordered
by
wire
to
take
steps
to
prevent
any
vessel
from
going
up
the
river
,
and
he
at
once
despatched
several
picket
-
boats
to
the
entrance
to
warn
in
-
coming
ships
of
the
blocking
of
the
channel
,
while
a
couple
of
other
boats
were
sent
up
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
obstruction
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
.
<EOS>
The
harbour
signals
ordering
'
suspension
of
all
movings
'
were
also
hoisted
at
Garrison
Point
.
 
<EOS>
"
Among
other
ships
which
were
stopped
in
consequence
of
these
measures
was
the
'
Van
Gysen
,
'
a
big
steamer
hailing
from
Rotterdam
,
laden
<EOS>
,
it
was
stated
,
with
steel
rails
for
the
London
,
Chatham
,
and
Dover
Railway
,
which
were
to
be
landed
at
Port
Victoria
.
<EOS>
She
was
accordingly
allowed
to
proceed
,
and
anchored
,
or
appeared
to
anchor
,
just
off
the
railway
pier
at
that
place
.
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
later
the
officer
of
the
watch
on
board
H.M.S.
'
Medici
'
reported
that
he
thought
she
was
getting
under
way
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
pretty
dark
.
<EOS>
An
electric
searchlight
being
switched
on
,
the
'
Van
Gysen
'
was
discovered
steaming
up
the
river
at
a
considerable
speed
.
<EOS>
The
'
Medici
'
flashed
the
news
to
the
flagship
,
which
at
once
fired
a
gun
,
hoisted
the
recall
and
the
'
Van
Gysen
's
'
number
in
the
international
code
,
and
despatched
her
steam
pinnace
,
with
orders
to
overhaul
the
Dutchman
and
stop
him
at
whatever
cost
.
<EOS>
A
number
of
the
marines
on
guard
were
sent
in
her
with
their
rifles
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
'
Van
Gysen
'
seemed
well
acquainted
with
the
channel
,
and
continually
increased
her
speed
as
she
went
up
the
river
,
so
that
she
was
within
half
a
mile
of
the
scene
of
the
accident
before
the
steamboat
came
up
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
officer
in
charge
called
to
the
skipper
through
the
megaphone
to
stop
his
engines
and
to
throw
him
a
rope
,
as
he
wanted
to
come
on
board
.
<EOS>
After
pretending
for
some
time
not
to
understand
him
,
the
skipper
slowed
his
engines
and
said
,
'
Ver
vel
,
come
'
longside
gangway
.
'
<EOS>
As
the
pinnace
hooked
on
at
the
gangway
,
a
heavy
iron
cylinder
cover
was
dropped
into
her
from
the
height
of
the
'
Van
Gysen
's
'
deck
.
<EOS>
It
knocked
the
bowman
overboard
and
crashed
into
the
fore
part
of
the
boat
,
knocking
a
big
hole
in
the
port
side
forward
.
<EOS>
She
swung
off
at
an
angle
and
stopped
to
pick
up
the
man
overboard
.
<EOS>
Her
crew
succeeded
in
rescuing
him
,
but
she
was
making
water
fast
,
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
run
her
into
the
bank
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
in
charge
ordered
a
rifle
to
be
fired
at
the
'
Van
Gysen
'
to
bring
her
to
,
but
she
paid
not
the
smallest
attention
,
as
might
have
been
expected
,
and
went
on
her
way
with
gathering
speed
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
report
,
however
,
served
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
two
picket
-
boats
which
were
patrolling
up
the
river
.
<EOS>
As
she
turned
a
bend
in
the
stream
they
both
shot
up
alongside
out
of
the
darkness
,
and
ordered
her
peremptorily
to
stop
.
<EOS>
But
the
only
answer
they
received
was
the
sudden
extinction
of
all
lights
in
the
steamer
.
<EOS>
They
kept
alongside
,
or
rather
one
of
them
did
,
but
they
were
quite
helpless
to
stay
the
progress
of
the
big
wall
-
sided
steamer
.
<EOS>
The
faster
of
the
picket
-
boats
shot
ahead
with
the
object
of
warning
those
who
were
busy
examining
the
wrecks
.
<EOS>
But
the
'
Van
Gysen
,
'
going
all
she
knew
,
was
close
behind
,
an
indistinguishable
black
blur
in
the
darkness
,
and
hardly
had
the
officer
in
the
picket
-
boat
delivered
his
warning
before
she
was
heard
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Within
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
of
the
two
wrecks
she
slowed
down
,
for
fear
of
running
right
over
them
.
<EOS>
On
she
came
,
inevitable
as
Fate
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
crash
as
she
came
into
collision
with
the
central
deckhouses
of
the
'
Frauenlob
'
and
as
her
bows
scraped
past
the
funnel
of
the
'
Pole
Star
.
'
<EOS>
Then
followed
no
fewer
than
half
a
dozen
muffled
reports
.
<EOS>
Her
engines
went
astern
for
a
moment
,
and
down
she
settled
athwart
the
other
two
steamers
,
heeling
over
to
port
as
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
All
was
turmoil
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
dockyard
and
naval
craft
present
were
equipped
with
searchlights
.
<EOS>
The
harbour
-
master
,
the
captain
of
the
yard
,
even
the
admiral
superintendent
,
who
had
just
come
down
in
his
steam
launch
,
all
bawled
out
orders
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lights
were
flashed
and
lanterns
swung
up
and
down
in
the
vain
endeavour
to
see
more
of
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Two
simultaneous
shouts
of
'
Man
overboard
!
'
came
from
tugs
and
boats
at
opposite
sides
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
When
a
certain
amount
of
order
was
restored
it
was
discovered
that
a
big
dockyard
tug
was
settling
down
by
the
head
.
<EOS>
It
seems
she
had
been
grazed
by
the
'
Van
Gysen
'
as
she
came
over
the
obstruction
,
and
forced
against
some
portion
of
one
of
the
foundered
vessels
,
which
had
pierced
a
hole
in
her
below
the
water
-
line
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
general
excitement
the
damage
had
not
been
discovered
,
and
now
she
was
sinking
fast
.
<EOS>
Hawsers
were
made
fast
to
her
with
the
utmost
expedition
possible
in
order
to
tow
her
clear
of
the
piled
-
up
wreckage
,
but
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
just
time
to
rescue
her
crew
before
she
too
added
herself
to
the
underwater
barricade
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
crew
of
the
'
Van
Gysen
,
'
it
is
thought
that
all
must
have
gone
down
in
her
,
as
no
trace
of
them
has
as
yet
been
discovered
,
despite
a
most
diligent
search
,
for
it
was
considered
that
,
in
an
affair
which
had
been
so
carefully
planned
as
this
certainly
must
have
been
,
some
provision
must
surely
have
been
made
for
the
escape
of
the
crew
.
<EOS>
Those
who
have
been
down
at
the
scene
of
the
disaster
report
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
clear
the
channel
in
less
than
a
week
or
ten
days
,
using
every
resource
of
the
dockyard
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
little
later
I
thought
I
would
go
down
to
the
dockyard
on
the
off
-
chance
of
picking
up
any
further
information
.
<EOS>
The
Metropolitan
policeman
at
the
gate
would
on
no
account
allow
me
to
pass
at
that
hour
,
and
I
was
just
turning
away
when
,
by
a
great
piece
of
good
fortune
,
I
ran
up
against
Commander
Shelley
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
on
board
his
ship
as
correspondent
during
the
manoeuvres
of
the
year
before
last
.
'
<EOS>
And
what
are
you
doing
down
here
?
'
<EOS>
was
his
very
natural
inquiry
after
we
had
shaken
hands
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
had
been
down
in
Chatham
for
a
week
past
as
special
correspondent
,
reporting
on
the
half
-
hearted
preparations
being
made
for
the
possible
mobilisation
,
and
took
the
opportunity
of
asking
him
if
he
could
give
me
any
further
information
about
the
collision
between
the
three
steamers
in
the
Medway
.
'
<EOS>
Well
,
'
said
he
,
'
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
come
right
along
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
been
hawked
out
of
bed
to
superintend
the
diving
operations
,
which
will
begin
the
moment
there
is
a
gleam
of
daylight
.
'
<EOS>
Needless
to
say
,
this
just
suited
me
,
and
I
hastened
to
thank
him
and
to
accept
his
kind
offer
.
'
<EOS>
All
right
,
'
he
said
,
'
but
I
shall
have
to
make
one
small
condition
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
And
that
is
?
'
<EOS>
I
queried
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Merely
to
let
me
"
censor
"
your
telegrams
before
you
send
them
,
'
he
returned
.
'
<EOS>
You
see
,
the
Admiralty
might
not
like
to
have
too
much
said
about
this
business
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
find
myself
in
the
dirt
-
tub
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
The
stipulation
was
a
most
reasonable
one
,
and
however
I
disliked
the
notion
of
having
probably
my
best
paragraphs
eliminated
,
I
could
not
but
assent
to
my
friend
's
proposition
.
<EOS>
So
away
we
marched
down
the
echoing
spaces
of
the
almost
deserted
dockyard
till
we
arrived
at
the
'
Thunderbolt
'
pontoon
.
<EOS>
Here
lay
a
pinnace
with
steam
up
,
and
lighted
down
the
sloping
side
of
the
old
ironclad
by
the
lantern
of
the
policeman
on
duty
,
we
stepped
on
board
and
shot
out
into
the
centre
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
We
blew
our
whistles
and
the
coxswain
waved
a
lantern
,
whereupon
a
small
tug
that
had
a
couple
of
dockyard
lighters
attached
gave
a
hoarse
'
toot
'
in
response
,
and
followed
us
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
We
sped
along
in
the
darkness
against
a
strong
tide
that
was
making
upstream
,
past
Upnor
Castle
,
that
quaint
old
Tudor
fortress
with
its
long
line
of
modern
powder
magazines
,
and
along
under
the
deeper
shadows
beneath
Hoo
Woods
till
we
came
abreast
of
the
medley
of
mud
flats
and
grass
-
grown
islets
just
beyond
them
.
<EOS>
Here
above
the
thud
of
the
engines
and
the
plash
of
the
water
,
a
thin
,
long
-
drawn
-
out
cry
wavered
through
the
night
.
'
<EOS>
Some
one
hailing
the
boat
,
sir
,
'
reported
the
lookout
forward
.
<EOS>
We
had
all
heard
it
.
'
<EOS>
Ease
down
,
'
ordered
Shelley
,
and
hardly
moving
against
the
rushing
tideway
we
listened
for
its
repetition
.
<EOS>
Again
the
voice
was
raised
in
quavering
supplication
.
'
<EOS>
What
the
dickens
does
he
say
?
'
<EOS>
queried
the
commander
.
'
<EOS>
It
's
German
,
'
I
answered
.
'
<EOS>
I
know
that
language
well
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
's
asking
for
help
.
<EOS>
May
I
answer
him
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
'
By
all
means
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
belongs
to
one
of
those
steamers
.
'
<EOS>
The
same
thought
was
in
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
I
hailed
in
return
,
asking
where
he
was
and
what
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
The
answer
came
back
that
he
was
a
shipwrecked
seaman
,
who
was
cold
,
wet
,
and
miserable
,
and
implored
to
be
taken
off
from
the
islet
where
he
found
himself
,
cut
off
from
everywhere
by
water
and
darkness
.
<EOS>
We
ran
the
boat
's
nose
into
the
bank
,
and
presently
succeeded
in
hauling
aboard
a
miserable
object
,
wet
through
,
and
plastered
from
head
to
foot
with
black
Medway
mud
.
<EOS>
The
broken
remains
of
a
cork
life
-
belt
hung
from
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
A
dram
of
whisky
somewhat
revived
him
.
'
<EOS>
And
now
,
'
said
Shelley
,
'
you
'd
better
cross
-
examine
him
.
<EOS>
We
may
get
something
out
of
the
fellow
.
'
<EOS>
The
foreigner
,
crouched
down
shivering
in
the
stern
-
sheets
half
covered
with
a
yellow
oilskin
that
some
charitable
bluejacket
had
thrown
over
him
,
appeared
to
me
in
the
light
of
the
lantern
that
stood
on
the
deck
before
him
to
be
not
only
suffering
from
cold
,
but
from
terror
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
'
conversation
with
him
confirmed
my
suspicions
.
<EOS>
I
turned
to
Shelley
and
exclaimed
,
'
He
says
he
'll
tell
us
everything
if
we
spare
his
life
,
'
I
explained
.
'
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
shoot
the
chap
,
'
replied
the
commander
.
'
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
's
implicated
in
this
"
bottling
up
"
affair
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
,
he
jolly
well
deserves
it
,
but
I
do
n't
suppose
anything
will
be
done
to
him
.
<EOS>
Anyway
,
his
information
may
be
valuable
,
and
so
you
may
tell
him
that
he
is
all
right
as
far
as
I
'm
concerned
,
and
I
will
do
my
best
for
him
with
the
Admiral
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
that
will
satisfy
him
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
you
might
threaten
him
a
bit
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
anything
you
like
if
you
think
it
will
make
him
speak
.
'
<EOS>
To
cut
a
long
story
short
,
I
found
the
damp
Dutchman
amenable
to
reason
,
and
the
following
is
the
substance
of
what
I
elicited
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
had
been
a
deck
hand
on
board
the
'
Van
Gysen
.
'
<EOS>
When
she
left
Rotterdam
he
did
not
know
that
the
trip
was
anything
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
new
skipper
whom
he
had
not
seen
before
,
and
there
were
also
two
new
mates
with
a
new
chief
engineer
.
<EOS>
Another
steamer
followed
them
all
the
way
till
they
arrived
at
the
Nore
.
<EOS>
On
the
way
over
he
and
several
other
seamen
were
sent
for
by
the
captain
,
and
asked
if
they
would
volunteer
for
a
dangerous
job
,
promising
them
L50
a
-
piece
if
it
came
off
all
right
.
<EOS>
He
and
five
others
agreed
,
as
did
two
or
three
stokers
,
and
were
then
ordered
to
remain
aft
and
not
communicate
with
any
others
of
the
crew
.
<EOS>
Off
the
Nore
all
the
remainder
were
transferred
to
the
following
steamer
,
which
steamed
off
to
the
eastward
.
<EOS>
After
they
were
gone
the
selected
men
were
told
that
the
officers
all
belonged
to
the
Imperial
German
Navy
,
and
by
orders
of
the
Kaiser
were
about
to
attempt
to
block
up
the
Medway
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
collision
between
two
other
ships
had
been
arranged
for
,
one
of
which
was
loaded
with
a
mass
of
old
steel
rails
into
which
liquid
cement
had
been
run
,
so
that
her
hold
contained
a
solid
impenetrable
block
.
<EOS>
The
'
Van
Gysen
'
carried
a
similar
cargo
,
and
was
provided
with
an
arrangement
for
blowing
holes
in
her
bottom
.
<EOS>
The
crew
were
provided
with
life
-
belts
,
and
the
half
of
the
money
promised
,
and
all
except
the
captain
,
the
engineer
,
and
the
two
mates
dropped
overboard
just
before
arriving
at
the
sunken
vessels
.
<EOS>
They
were
advised
to
make
their
way
to
Gravesend
,
and
then
to
shift
for
themselves
as
best
they
could
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
himself
on
a
small
island
,
and
could
not
muster
up
courage
to
plunge
into
the
cold
water
again
in
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
By
Jove
!
<EOS>
This
means
war
with
Germany
,
man!--War
!
'
<EOS>
was
Shelley
's
comment
.
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
this
afternoon
we
knew
that
it
did
,
for
the
news
of
the
enemy
's
landing
in
Norfolk
was
signalled
down
from
the
dockyard
.
<EOS>
We
also
knew
from
the
divers
that
the
cargo
of
the
sunken
steamers
was
what
the
rescued
seamen
had
stated
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
Our
bottle
has
been
fairly
well
corked
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
amazing
revelation
showed
how
cleverly
contrived
was
the
German
plan
of
hostilities
.
<EOS>
All
our
splendid
ships
at
Chatham
had
,
in
that
brief
half
-
hour
,
been
bottled
up
and
rendered
utterly
useless
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
authorities
were
not
blameless
in
the
matter
,
for
in
November
,
1905
,
a
foreign
warship
actually
came
up
the
Medway
in
broad
daylight
,
and
was
not
noticed
until
she
began
to
bang
away
her
salutes
,
much
to
the
utter
consternation
of
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
This
incident
,
however
,
was
but
one
of
the
many
illustrations
of
German
's
craft
and
cunning
.
<EOS>
The
whole
scheme
had
been
years
in
careful
preparation
.
 
<EOS>
She
intended
to
invade
us
,
and
regarded
every
stratagem
as
allowable
in
her
sudden
dash
upon
England
,
an
expedition
which
promised
to
result
in
the
most
desperate
war
of
modern
times
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
moment
the
"
Globe
,
"
at
last
aroused
from
its
long
and
peaceful
sleep
,
reproduced
those
plain
,
prophetic
words
of
Lord
Overstone
,
written
some
years
before
to
the
Royal
Defence
Commission
:
"
<EOS>
Negligence
alone
can
bring
about
the
calamity
under
discussion
.
<EOS>
Unless
we
suffer
ourselves
to
be
surprised
we
can
not
be
invaded
with
success
.
<EOS>
It
is
useless
to
discuss
what
will
occur
or
what
can
be
done
after
London
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
an
invading
foe
.
<EOS>
The
apathy
which
may
render
the
occurrence
of
such
a
catastrophe
possible
will
not
afterwards
enable
the
country
,
enfeebled
,
dispirited
,
and
disorganised
by
the
loss
of
its
capital
,
to
redeem
the
fatal
error
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Was
that
prophecy
to
be
fulfilled
?
 
<EOS>
Some
highly
interesting
information
was
given
by
the
Ipswich
correspondent
of
the
Central
News
.
 
<EOS>
Repeated
briefly
,
it
was
as
follows:--
 
"
<EOS>
Shortly
before
three
o'clock
on
Sunday
morning
the
coastguard
at
Lowestoft
,
Corton
,
and
Beach
End
discovered
that
their
telephonic
communication
was
interrupted
,
and
half
an
hour
later
,
to
the
surprise
of
every
one
a
miscellaneous
collection
of
mysterious
craft
were
seen
approaching
the
harbour
:
and
within
an
hour
many
of
them
were
high
and
dry
on
the
beach
,
while
others
were
lashed
alongside
the
old
dock
,
the
new
fish
-
docks
of
the
Great
Eastern
Railway
,
and
the
wharves
,
disembarking
a
huge
force
of
German
infantry
,
cavalry
,
motor
-
infantry
,
and
artillery
.
<EOS>
The
town
,
awakened
from
its
slumbers
,
was
utterly
paralysed
,
the
more
so
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
railway
to
London
was
already
interrupted
,
and
the
telegraph
lines
all
cut
.
<EOS>
On
landing
,
the
enemy
commandeered
all
provisions
,
including
all
motor
-
cars
they
could
discover
,
horses
and
forage
,
while
the
banks
were
seized
,
and
the
infantry
,
falling
in
marched
up
Old
Nelson
Street
into
High
Street
,
and
out
upon
the
Beccles
Road
.
<EOS>
The
first
care
of
the
invaders
was
to
prevent
the
people
of
Lowestoft
damaging
the
Swing
Bridge
,
a
strong
guard
being
instantly
mounted
upon
it
,
and
so
quietly
and
orderly
<EOS>
was
the
landing
effected
that
it
was
plain
the
German
plans
of
invasion
were
absolutely
perfect
in
every
detail
.
 
<EOS>
"
Few
hitches
seemed
to
occur
.
<EOS>
The
mayor
was
summoned
at
six
o'clock
by
General
von
Kronhelm
,
the
generalissimo
of
the
German
Army
,
and
briefly
informed
that
the
town
of
Lowestoft
was
occupied
,
and
that
all
armed
resistance
would
be
punished
by
death
.
<EOS>
Then
,
ten
minutes
later
,
when
the
German
war
-
flag
was
flying
from
several
flagstaffs
in
various
parts
of
the
town
,
the
people
realised
their
utter
helplessness
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Germans
,
of
course
,
knew
that
,
irrespective
of
the
weather
,
a
landing
could
be
effected
at
Lowestoft
,
where
the
fish
-
docks
and
wharves
,
with
their
many
cranes
,
were
capable
of
dealing
with
a
large
amount
of
stores
.
<EOS>
The
Denes
,
that
flat
,
sandy
plain
between
the
upper
town
and
the
sea
<EOS>
,
they
turned
into
a
camping
-
ground
,
and
large
numbers
were
billeted
in
various
quarters
of
the
town
itself
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
people
were
terror
-
stricken
.
<EOS>
To
appeal
to
London
for
help
was
impossible
,
as
the
place
had
been
cut
entirely
off
,
and
around
it
a
strong
chain
of
outposts
had
already
been
thrown
,
preventing
any
one
from
escaping
.
<EOS>
The
town
had
,
in
a
moment
,
as
it
seemed
,
fallen
at
the
mercy
of
the
foreigners
.
<EOS>
Even
the
important
-
looking
police
constables
of
Lowestoft
,
with
their
little
canes
,
were
crestfallen
,
sullen
,
and
inactive
.
 
<EOS>
"
While
the
landing
was
continuing
during
all
Sunday
the
advance
guard
moved
rapidly
over
Mutford
Bridge
,
along
the
Beccles
Road
,
occupying
a
strong
position
on
the
west
side
of
the
high
ground
east
of
Lowestoft
.
<EOS>
Beccles
,
where
von
Kronhelm
established
his
headquarters
,
resting
as
it
does
on
the
River
Waveney
,
is
strongly
held
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
main
position
appears
to
run
from
Windle
Hill
,
one
mile
north
-
east
of
Gillingham
,
thence
north
-
west
through
Bull
's
Green
,
Herringfleet
Hill
,
over
to
Grove
Farm
and
Hill
House
to
Raveningham
,
whence
it
turns
easterly
to
Haddiscoe
,
which
is
at
present
its
northern
limit
.
<EOS>
The
total
front
from
Beccles
<EOS>
Bridge
north
is
about
five
miles
,
and
commands
the
whole
of
the
flat
plain
west
towards
Norwich
.
<EOS>
It
has
its
south
flank
resting
on
the
River
Waveney
,
and
to
the
north
on
Thorpe
Marshes
.
<EOS>
The
chief
artillery
position
is
at
Toft
Monks
--
the
highest
point
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
high
tower
of
Beccles
Church
is
established
a
signal
station
,
communication
being
made
constantly
with
Lowestoft
by
helio
by
day
,
and
acetylene
lamps
by
night
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
enemy
's
position
has
been
most
carefully
chosen
,
for
it
is
naturally
strong
,
and
,
being
well
held
to
protect
Lowestoft
from
any
attack
from
the
west
,
the
landing
can
continue
uninterruptedly
,
for
Lowestoft

CHAPTER

<EOS>
A
PROPHECY
FULFILLED
.
  
<EOS>
This
authentic
news
of
the
position
of
the
enemy
,
combined
with
the
vague
rumours
of
other
landings
at
Yarmouth
,
along
the
coast
at
some
unknown
point
north
of
Cromer
,
at
King
's
Lynn
,
and
other
places
,
produced
an
enormous
sensation
in
London
,
while
the
Central
News
account
,
circulated
to
all
the
papers
in
the
Midlands
and
Lancashire
,
increased
the
panic
in
the
manufacturing
districts
.
 
<EOS>
The
special
edition
of
the
"
Evening
Star
,
"
issued
about
six
o'clock
on
Tuesday
evening
,
contained
another
remarkable
story
which
threw
some
further
light
upon
the
German
movements
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
of
course
,
known
that
practically
the
whole
of
the
Norfolk
and
Suffolk
coast
was
already
held
by
the
enemy
,
but
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
the
enemy
's
cavalry
vedettes
and
reconnoitring
patrols
were
out
everywhere
at
a
distance
about
twenty
miles
from
the
shore
,
England
was
entirely
in
the
dark
as
to
what
had
occurred
anywhere
else
but
at
Lowestoft
.
<EOS>
Attempts
had
been
made
to
penetrate
the
cavalry
screen
at
various
points
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
What
was
in
progress
was
carefully
kept
a
secret
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
veil
was
,
however
,
now
lifted
.
<EOS>
The
story
which
the
"
Evening
Star
"
had
obtained
exclusively
,
and
which
was
eagerly
read
everywhere
,
had
been
related
by
a
man
named
Scotney
,
a
lobster
-
fisherman
,
of
Sheringham
,
in
Norfolk
,
who
had
made
the
following
statement
to
the
chief
officer
of
coastguard
at
Wainfleet
,
in
Lincolnshire
:
 
<EOS>
"
Just
before
dawn
on
Sunday
morning
I
was
in
the
boat
with
my
son
Ted
off
the
Robin
Friend
,
taking
up
the
lobster
pots
,
when
we
suddenly
saw
about
three
miles
off
shore
<EOS>
a
mixed
lot
of
curious
-
looking
craft
strung
out
right
across
the
horizon
,
and
heading
apparently
for
Cromer
.
<EOS>
There
were
steamers
big
and
little
,
many
of
them
towing
queer
flat
-
bottomed
kind
of
boats
,
lighters
,
and
barges
,
which
,
on
approaching
nearer
,
we
could
distinctly
see
were
filled
to
their
utmost
capacity
with
men
and
horses
.
 
<EOS>
"
Both
Ted
and
I
stood
staring
at
the
unusual
sight
,
wondering
whatever
it
meant
.
<EOS>
They
came
on
very
quickly
,
however
--
so
quickly
,
indeed
,
that
we
thought
it
best
to
move
on
.
<EOS>
The
biggest
ships
went
along
to
Weybourne
Gap
,
where
they
moored
in
the
twenty
-
five
feet
of
water
that
runs
in
close
to
the
shore
,
while
some
smaller
steamers
and
the
flats
were
run
high
and
dry
on
the
hard
shingle
.
<EOS>
Before
this
I
noticed
that
there
were
quite
a
number
of
foreign
warships
in
the
offing
,
with
several
destroyers
far
away
in
the
distance
both
to
east
and
west
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
the
larger
steamships
all
sorts
of
boats
were
lowered
,
including
apparently
many
collapsible
whaleboats
,
and
into
these
,
in
a
most
orderly
manner
,
from
every
gangway
and
accommodation
-
ladder
,
troops
--
Germans
we
afterwards
discovered
them
to
be
,
to
our
utter
astonishment
--
began
to
descend
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
boats
were
at
once
taken
charge
of
by
steam
pinnaces
and
cutters
and
towed
to
the
beach
.
<EOS>
When
we
saw
this
we
were
utterly
dumbfounded
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
at
first
I
believed
it
to
be
a
dream
,
for
ever
since
I
was
a
lad
<EOS>
I
had
heard
the
ancient
rhyme
my
old
father
was
so
fond
of
repeating
:
     
"
'
He
who
would
Old
England
win
,
    
Must
at
Weybourne
Hoop
begin
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
As
everybody
knows
,
nature
has
provided
at
that
lonely
spot
every
advantage
for
the
landing
of
hostile
forces
,
and
when
the
Spanish
Armada
was
expected
,
and
again
when
Napoleon
threatened
an
invasion
,
the
place
was
constantly
watched
.
<EOS>
Yet
nowadays
,
except
for
the
coastguard
,
it
has
been
utterly
unprotected
and
neglected
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
very
first
soldiers
who
landed
formed
up
quickly
,
and
under
the
charge
of
an
officer
ran
up
the
low
hill
to
the
coastguard
station
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
in
order
to
prevent
them
signalling
a
warning
.
<EOS>
The
funny
thing
was
,
however
,
that
the
coastguards
had
already
been
held
up
by
several
well
-
dressed
men
--
spies
of
the
Germans
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
could
distinctly
see
one
man
holding
one
of
the
guards
with
his
back
to
the
wall
,
and
threatening
him
with
a
revolver
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ted
<EOS>
and
I
had
somehow
been
surrounded
by
the
crowd
of
odd
craft
which
dodged
about
everywhere
,
and
the
foreigners
now
and
then
shouted
to
me
words
that
unfortunately
I
could
not
understand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Meanwhile
,
from
all
the
boats
strung
out
along
the
beach
,
from
Sheringham
right
across
to
the
Rocket
House
at
Salthouse
,
swarms
of
drab
-
coated
soldiers
were
disembarking
,
the
boats
immediately
returning
to
the
steamers
for
more
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
been
packed
as
tightly
as
herrings
in
a
barrel
;
but
they
all
seemed
to
know
where
to
go
to
,
because
all
along
at
various
places
little
flags
were
held
by
men
,
and
each
regiment
appeared
to
march
across
and
assemble
at
its
own
flag
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ted
<EOS>
and
I
sat
there
as
if
we
were
watching
a
play
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
we
saw
from
some
of
the
ships
and
<EOS>
bigger
barges
horses
being
lowered
into
the
water
and
allowed
to
swim
ashore
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
seemed
to
gain
the
beach
even
as
we
were
looking
at
them
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
the
first
lot
of
horses
had
gone
,
boats
full
of
saddles
followed
them
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
the
foreigners
were
too
busy
to
notice
us
,
and
we
--
not
wanting
to
share
the
fate
of
Mr.
Gunter
,
the
coastguard
,
and
his
mates
--
just
sat
tight
and
watched
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
the
steamers
there
continued
to
pour
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
soldiers
,
who
were
towed
to
land
,
and
then
formed
up
in
solid
squares
,
which
got
bigger
and
bigger
.
<EOS>
Horses
innumerable
--
quite
a
thousand
,
I
should
reckon
--
were
slung
overboard
from
some
of
the
smaller
steamers
which
had
been
run
high
and
dry
on
the
beach
,
and
as
the
tide
had
now
begun
to
run
down
,
they
landed
only
knee
-
deep
in
water
.
<EOS>
Those
steamers
,
it
seemed
to
me
,
had
big
bilge
keels
,
for
as
the
tide
ebbed
they
did
not
heel
over
.
<EOS>
They
had
,
no
doubt
,
been
specially
fitted
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Out
of
some
they
began
to
hoist
all
sorts
of
things
,
wagons
,
guns
,
motor
-
cars
,
large
bales
of
fodder
,
clothing
,
ambulances
with
big
red
crosses
on
them
,
flat
-
looking
boats
--
pontoons
I
think
they
call
them
--
and
great
piles
of
cooking
pots
and
pans
,
square
boxes
of
stores
,
or
perhaps
ammunition
,
and
as
soon
as
anything
was
landed
it
was
hauled
up
above
high
-
water
mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
meantime
lots
of
men
had
mounted
on
horseback
and
ridden
off
up
the
lane
which
leads
into
Weybourne
village
.
<EOS>
At
first
half
a
dozen
started
at
a
time
;
then
,
as
far
as
I
could
judge
,
about
fifty
more
started
.
<EOS>
Then
larger
bodies
went
forward
,
but
more
and
more
horses
kept
going
ashore
,
as
though
their
number
was
never
-
ending
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
been
stowed
mighty
close
,
and
many
of
the
ships
must
have
been
specially
fitted
up
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
soon
I
saw
cavalry
swarming
up
over
Muckleburgh
,
Warborough
,
and
Telegraph
Hills
,
while
a
good
many
trotted
away
in
the
direction
of
Runton
and
Sheringham
.
<EOS>
Then
,
soon
after
they
had
gone
--
that
is
,
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
from
their
first
arrival
--
the
infantry
began
to
move
off
,
and
as
far
as
I
could
see
,
they
marched
inland
by
every
road
,
some
in
the
direction
of
Kelling
Street
and
Holt
,
others
over
Weybourne
Heath
towards
Bodham
,
and
still
others
skirting
the
woods
over
to
Upper
Sheringham
.
<EOS>
Large
masses
of
infantry
marched
along
the
Sheringham
Road
,
and
seemed
to
have
a
lot
of
officers
on
horseback
with
them
,
while
up
on
Muckleburgh
Hill
I
saw
frantic
signalling
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
this
time
they
had
a
quantity
of
carts
and
wagons
landed
,
and
a
large
number
of
motor
-
cars
.
<EOS>
The
latter
were
soon
started
,
and
,
manned
by
infantry
,
moved
swiftly
in
procession
after
the
troops
.
<EOS>
The
great
idea
of
the
Germans
was
apparently
to
get
the
beach
clear
of
everything
as
soon
as
landed
,
for
all
stores
,
equipment
,
and
other
tackle
were
pushed
inland
as
soon
as
disembarked
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
enemy
kept
on
landing
.
<EOS>
Thousands
of
soldiers
got
ashore
without
any
check
,
and
all
proceeding
orderly
and
without
the
slightest
confusion
,
as
though
the
plans
were
absolutely
perfect
.
<EOS>
Everybody
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
From
where
we
were
we
could
see
the
coastguards
held
prisoners
in
their
station
,
with
German
sentries
mounted
around
;
and
as
the
tide
was
now
setting
strong
to
the
westward
,
Ted
<EOS>
and
I
just
let
our
anchor
off
the
ground
and
allowed
ourselves
to
drift
.
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
me
that
perhaps
I
might
be
able
give
the
alarm
at
some
other
coastguard
station
if
I
could
only
drift
away
unnoticed
in
the
busy
scene
now
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
the
Germans
had
actually
landed
in
England
now
apparent
;
yet
we
wondered
what
our
own
fleet
could
be
doing
,
and
pictured
to
ourselves
the
jolly
good
drubbing
that
our
cruisers
would
give
the
audacious
foreigner
when
they
did
haul
in
sight
.
<EOS>
It
was
for
us
,
at
all
costs
,
to
give
the
alarm
,
so
gradually
we
drifted
off
to
the
nor'-westward
,
in
fear
every
moment
lest
we
should
be
noticed
and
fired
at
.
<EOS>
At
last
we
got
around
Blakeney
Point
successfully
,
and
breathed
more
freely
;
then
hoisting
our
sail
,
we
headed
for
Hunstanton
,
but
seeing
numbers
of
ships
entering
the
Wash
,
and
believing
them
to
be
also
Germans
,
we
put
our
helm
down
and
ran
across
into
Wainfleet
Swatchway
to
Gibraltar
Point
,
where
I
saw
the
chief
officer
of
coastguards
and
told
him
all
the
extraordinary
events
of
that
memorable
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
report
added
that
the
officer
of
coastguard
in
question
had
,
three
hours
before
,
noticed
strange
vessels
coming
up
the
Wash
,
and
had
already
tried
to
report
by
telegraph
to
his
divisional
inspecting
officer
at
Harwich
,
but
could
obtain
no
communication
.
<EOS>
An
hour
later
,
however
,
it
had
become
apparent
that
a
still
further
landing
was
being
effected
on
the
south
side
of
the
Wash
,
in
all
probability
at
King
's
Lynn
.
 
<EOS>
The
fisherman
Scotney
's
statement
had
been
sent
by
special
messenger
from
Wainfleet
on
Sunday
evening
,
but
owing
to
the
dislocation
of
the
railway
traffic
north
of
London
,
the
messenger
was
unable
to
reach
the
offices
of
the
coastguard
in
Victoria
Street
,
Westminster
,
until
Monday
.
<EOS>
The
report
received
by
the
Admiralty
had
been
treated
as
confidential
until
corroborated
,
lest
undue
public
alarm
should
be
caused
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
then
been
given
to
the
Press
as
revealing
the
truth
of
what
had
actually
happened
.
 
<EOS>
The
enemy
had
entered
by
the
back
door
of
England
,
and
the
sensation
it
caused
everywhere
was
little
short
of
panic
.
 
<EOS>
Some
further
very
valuable
information
was
also
received
by
the
Intelligence
Department
of
the
War
Office
,
revealing
the
military
position
of
the
invaders
who
had
landed
at
Weybourne
Hoop
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
IVth
German
Army
Corps
,
about
38,000
men
,
had
been
landed
at
Weybourne
,
Sheringham
,
and
Cromer
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
the
7th
and
8th
Divisions
complete
,
commanded
respectively
by
Major
-
General
Dickmann
and
Lieutenant
-
General
von
Mirbach
.
<EOS>
The
7th
Division
comprised
the
13th
and
14th
Infantry
Brigades
,
consisting
of
Prince
Leopold

Anhalt
-
Dessau

<EOS>
Attached
to
this
division
were
the
Magdeburg
Hussars
No
.
10
,
and
the
Uhlan
Regiment
of
Altmaerk
No
.
16
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
8th
Division
were
the
15th
and
16th
Brigades
,
comprising
a
Magdeburg
Fusilier
Regiment
,
an
Anhalt
Infantry
Regiment
,
the
4th
and
8th
Thuringen
Infantry
,
with
the
Magdeburg
Cuirassiers
,
and
a
regiment
of
Thuringen
Hussars
.
<EOS>
The
cavalry
were
commanded
by
Colonel
Froelich
,
while
General
von
Kleppen
was
in
supreme
command
of
the
whole
corps
.
 
<EOS>
Careful
reconnaissance
of
the
occupied
area
showed
that
immediately
on
landing
,
the
German
position
extended
from
the
little
town
of
Holt
,
on
the
west
,
eastward
,
along
the
main
Cromer
road
,
as
far
as
Gibbet
Lane
,
slightly
south
of
Cromer
,
a
distance
of
about
five
miles
.
<EOS>
This
constituted
a
naturally
strong
position
;
indeed
,
nature
seemed
to
have
provided
it
specially
to
suit
the
necessities
of
a
foreign
invader
.
<EOS>
The
ground
for
miles
to
the
south
sloped
gently
away
down
to
the
plain
,
while
the
rear
was
completely
protected
,
so
that
the
landing
could
proceed
until
every
detail
had
been
completed
.

THE
FIRST
NEWS
IN
BERLIN
OF
THE
GERMAN
VICTORY
.
]
  
<EOS>
Artillery
were
massed
on
both
flanks
,
namely
,
at
Holt
and
on
the
high
ground
near
Felbrigg
,
immediately
south
of
Cromer
.
<EOS>
This
last
-
named
artillery
was
adequately
supported
by
the
detached
infantry
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
The
whole
force
was
covered
by
a
strong
line
of
outposts
.
<EOS>
Their
advanced
sentries
were
to
be
found
along
a
line
starting
from
Thornage
village
,
through
Hunworth
,
Edgefield
,
Barningham
Green
,
Squallham
,
Aldborough
,
Hanworth
,
to
Roughton
.
<EOS>
In
rear
of
them
lay
their
pickets
,
which
were
disposed
in
advantageous
situations
.
<EOS>
The
general
line
of
these
latter
were
at
North
Street
,
Pondhills
to
Plumstead
,
thence
over
to
Matlash
Hall
,
Aldborough
Hall
,
and
the
rising
ground
north
of
Hanworth
.
<EOS>
These
,
in
their
turn
,
were
adequately
supplemented
by
the
supports
,
which
were
near
Hempstead
Green
,
Baconsthorpe
,
North
Narningham
,
Bessingham
,
Sustead
,
and
Melton
.
 
<EOS>
In
case
of
sudden
attack
,
reserves
were
at
Bodham
,
West
Beckham
,
East
Beckham
,
and
Aylmerton
,
but
orders
had
been
issued
by
Von
Kleppen
,
who
had
established
his
headquarters
at
Upper
Sheringham
,
that
the
line
of
resistance
was
to
be
as
already
indicated
--
namely
,
that
having
the
Holt
-
Cromer
Road
for
its
crest
.
<EOS>
Cuirassiers
,
Hussars
,
and
some
motorists
--
commanded
by
Colonel
von
Dorndorf
--
were
acting
independently
some
fifteen
miles
to
the
south
scouring
the
whole
country
,
terrifying
the
villagers
,
commandeering
all
supplies
,
and
posting
Von
Kronhelm
's
proclamation
,
which
has
already
been
reproduced
.
 
<EOS>
From
inquiries
it
was
shown
that
on
the
night
of
the
invasion
six
men
,
now
known
to
have
been
advance
agents
of
the
enemy
,
arrived
at
the
Ship
Inn
,
at
Weybourne
.
<EOS>
Three
of
them
took
accommodation
for
the
night
,
while
their
companions
slept
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
the
trio
let
themselves
out
quietly
,
were
joined
by
six
other
men
,
and
just
as
the
enemy
's
ships
hove
in
sight
nine
of
them
seized
the
coastguards
and
cut
the
wires
,
while
the
other
three
broke
into
the
Weybourne
Stores
,
and
,
drawing
revolvers
,
obtained
possession
of
the
telegraph
instrument
to
Sheringham
and
Cromer
until
they
could
hand
it
over
to
the
Germans
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
Fourth
German
Army
Corps
were
in
a
position
as
strong
as
those
who
landed
at
Lowestoft
could
not
be
denied
,
and
the
military
authorities
could
not
disguise
from
themselves
the
extreme
gravity
of
the
situation
.

CHAPTER
V.
 
STATE
OF
SIEGE
DECLARED
.
  
<EOS>
That
our
fleet
had
been
taken
unawares
was
apparent
.
<EOS>
There
were
all
sorts
of
vague
rumours
of
a
sudden
attack
upon
the
North
Sea
Fleet
at
Rosyth
,
and
a
fierce
cruiser
battle
,
in
which
we
had
been
badly
beaten
by
Germany
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
however
,
the
land
campaign
which
we
have
here
to
record
.
 
<EOS>
The
authentic
account
of
a
further
landing
in
Essex
--
somewhere
near
Maldon
--
was
now
published
.
<EOS>
The
statement
had
been
dictated
by
Mr.
Henry
Alexander
,
J.P.,--the
Mayor
of
Maldon
,
who
had
succeeded
in
escaping
from
the
town,--to
Captain
Wilfred
Quare
,
of
the
Intelligence
Department
of
the
War
Office
.
<EOS>
This
Department
had
,
in
turn
,
given
it
to
the
newspapers
for
publication
.
 
<EOS>
It
read
as
follows:--
 
<EOS>
"
On
Sunday
morning
,
September
2
,
I
had
arranged
to
play
a
round
of
golf
with
my
friend
Somers
,
of
Beeleigh
,
before
church
.
<EOS>
I
met
him
at
the
Golf
Hut
about
8.30
.
<EOS>
We
played
one
round
,
and
were
at
the
last
hole
but
three
in
a
second
round
when
we
both
thought
we
heard
the
sound
of
shots
fired
somewhere
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
We
could
n't
make
anything
at
all
of
it
,
and
as
we
had
so
nearly
finished
the
round
,
we
thought
we
would
do
so
before
going
to
inquire
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
was
making
my
approach
to
the
final
hole
when
an
exclamation
from
Somers
spoilt
my
stroke
.
<EOS>
I
felt
annoyed
,
but
as
I
looked
around
--
doubtless
somewhat
irritably
--
my
eyes
turned
in
the
direction
in
which
I
now
saw
my
friend
was
pointing
with
every
expression
of
astonishment
in
his
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Who
on
earth
are
those
fellows
?
'
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
was
too
dumbfounded
to
reply
.
<EOS>
Galloping
over
the
links
from
the
direction
of
the
town
came
three
men
in
uniform
--
soldiers
,
evidently
.
<EOS>
I
had
often
been
in
Germany
,
and
recognised
the
squat
pickelhaubes
and
general
get
-
up
of
the
rapidly
approaching
horsemen
at
a
glance
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
upon
us
almost
as
he
spoke
,
pulling
up
their
horses
with
a
great
spattering
up
of
grass
and
mud
,
quite
ruining
one
of
our
best
greens
.
<EOS>
All
three
of
them
pointed
big
,
ugly
repeating
pistols
at
us
,
and
the
leader
,
a
conceited
-
looking
ass
in
staff
uniform
,
required
us
to
'
surrender
'
in
quite
a
pompous
manner
,
but
in
very
good
English
.

"
'
<EOS>
Do
we
look
so
very
dangerous
,
Herr
Lieutenant
?
'
<EOS>
inquired
I
in
German
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
dropped
a
little
of
his
frills
when
he
heard
me
speak
in
his
native
language
,
asked
which
of
us
was
the
Mayor
,
and
condescended
to
explain
that
I
was
required
in
Maldon
by
the
officer
at
present
in
command
of
his
Imperial
Majesty
<EOS>
the
Kaiser
's
forces
occupying
that
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
looked
at
my
captor
in
complete
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
Could
he
be
some
fellow
trying
to
take
a
rise
out
of
me
by
masquerading
as
a
German
officer
?
<EOS>
But
no
,
I
recognised
at
once
that
he
was
the
genuine
article
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
demanded
my
parole
,
which
I
made
no
difficulty
about
giving
,
since
I
did
not
see
any
way
of
escape
,
and
in
any
case
was
only
too
anxious
to
get
back
to
town
to
see
how
things
were
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
But
you
do
n't
want
my
friend
,
do
you
--
he
lives
out
the
other
way
?
'
<EOS>
I
queried
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
I
do
n't
want
him
,
but
he
will
have
to
come
all
the
same
,
'
rejoined
the
German
.
'
<EOS>
It
is
n't
likely
we
're
going
to
let
him
get
away
to
give
the
alarm
in
Colchester
,
is
it
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
Obviously
it
was
not
,
and
without
more
ado
we
started
off
at
a
sharp
walk
,
holding
on
to
the
stirrup
leathers
of
the
horsemen
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
we
entered
the
town
there
was
on
the
bridge
over
the
river
,
a
small
picket
of
blue
-
coated
German
infantry
.
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
was
a
perfect
nightmare
.
<EOS>
It
was
past
belief
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
How
on
earth
did
you
get
here
?
'
<EOS>
I
could
n't
help
asking
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
By
water
,
'
he
answered
shortly
,
pointing
down
the
river
as
he
spoke
,
where
I
was
still
further
astonished
--
if
it
were
possible
after
such
a
morning
--
to
see
several
steam
pinnaces
and
boats
flying
the
black
and
white
German
ensign
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
conducted
straight
to
the
Moot
Hall
.
<EOS>
There
I
found
a
grizzled
veteran
waiting
on
the
steps
,
who
turned
round
and
entered
the
building
as
we
came
up
.
<EOS>
We
followed
him
inside
,
and
I
was
introduced
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
be
a
truculent
old
ruffian
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Well
,
Mr.
Mayor
,
'
he
said
,
pulling
viciously
at
his
white
moustache
,
'
do
you
know
that
I
've
a
great
mind
to
take
you
out
into
the
street
and
have
you
shot
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
be
browbeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Indeed
,
Herr
Hauptman
?
'
<EOS>
I
answered
.
'
<EOS>
And
may
I
inquire
in
what
way
I
have
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
Hochwohlgeboren
officer
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
Do
n't
trifle
with
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
allow
your
miserable
Volunteers
to
come
out
and
shoot
my
men
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
My
Volunteers
?
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
do
n't
understand
what
you
mean
,
'
I
said
.
<EOS>
'
I
'm
not
a
Volunteer
officer
.
<EOS>
Even
if
I
were
,
I
should
have
no
cognisance
of
anything
that
has
happened
within
the
last
two
hours
,
as
I
have
been
down
on
the
golf
course
.
<EOS>
This
officer
will
bear
me
out
,
'
I
added
,
turning
to
my
captor
.
<EOS>
He
admitted
that
he
had
found
me
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
But
,
anyway
,
you
are
the
Mayor
,
'
persisted
my
interrogator
.
'
<EOS>
Why
did
you
allow
the
Volunteers
to
come
out
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
If
you
had
been
good
enough
to
inform
us
of
your
visit
,
we
might
have
made
better
arrangements
.
'
<EOS>
I
answered
;
'
but
in
any
case
you
must
understand
that
a
mayor
has
little
or
no
authority
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
His
job
is
to
head
subscription
-
lists
,
eat
a
dinner
or
two
,
and
make
speeches
on
public
occasions
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
He
seemed
to
have
some
difficulty
in
swallowing
this
,
but
as
another
officer
who
was
there
,
writing
at
a
table
,
and
who
,
it
appears
,
had
lived
at
some
period
in
England
,
corroborated
my
statement
,
the
choleric
colonel
seemed
to
be
a
little
mollified
,
and
contented
himself
with
demanding
my
parole
not
to
leave
Maldon
until
he
had
reported
the
matter
to
the
General
for
decision
.
<EOS>
I
gave
it
without
more
ado
,
and
then
asked
if
he
would
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
From
what
he
told
me
,
and
what
I
heard
afterwards
,
it
seems
that
the
Germans
must
have
landed
a
few
of
their
men
about
half
an
hour
before
I
left
home
,
down
near
the
Marine
Lake
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
entered
the
town
at
once
,
as
their
object
was
to
work
round
outside
and
occupy
all
entrances
,
to
prevent
anyone
getting
away
with
the
news
of
their
presence
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
noticed
the
little
lane
leading
to
the
golf
course
,
and
so
I
had
gone
down
without
meeting
any
of
them
,
although
they
had
actually
got
a
picket
just
beyond
the
railway
arch
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
They
had
completed
their
cordon
before
there
was
any
general
alarm
in
the
town
,
but
at
the
first
reliable
rumour
it
seems
that
young
Shand
,
of
the
Essex
Volunteers
,
had
contrived
to
get
together
twenty
or
thirty
of
his
men
in
their
uniforms
and
foolishly
opened
fire
on
a
German
picket
down
by
St.
Mary
's
Church
.
<EOS>
They
fell
back
,
but
were
almost
instantly
reinforced
by
a
whole
company
that
had
just
landed
,
and
our
men
,
rushing
forward
,
had
been
ridden
into
by
some
cavalry
that
came
up
a
side
street
.
<EOS>
They
were
dispersed
,
a
couple
of
them
were
killed
,
and
several
wounded
,
among
them
poor
Shand
,
who
was
hit
in
the
right
lung
.
<EOS>
They
had
bagged
four
Germans
,
however
,
and
their
commanding
officer
was
furious
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
that
it
happened
,
as
it
could
not
possibly
have
been
of
any
use
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
that
Shand
had
no
idea
that
it
was
more
than
a
very
small
detachment
that
had
landed
from
a
gun
-
boat
that
some
one
said
they
had
seen
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
Volunteers
were
captured
afterwards
and
sent
off
as
prisoners
,
and
the
Germans
posted
up
a
notice
that
all
Volunteers
were
forthwith
to
surrender
either
themselves
or
their
arms
and
uniforms
,
under
pain
of
death
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
did
the
latter
.
<EOS>
They
could
do
nothing
after
it
was
found
that
the
Germans
had
a
perfect
army
somewhere
between
Maldon
and
the
sea
,
and
were
pouring
troops
into
the
town
as
fast
as
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
very
morning
a
Saxon
rifle
battalion
arrived
from
the
direction
of
Mundon
,
and
just
afterwards
a
lot
spike
-
helmeted
gentlemen
came
in
by
train
from
Wickford
way
.
<EOS>
So
it
went
on
all
day
,
until
the
whole
town
was
in
a
perfect
uproar
.
<EOS>
The
infantry
were
billeted
in
the
town
,
but
the
cavalry
and
guns
crossed
the
river
and
canal
at
Heybridge
,
and
went
off
in
the
direction
of
Witham
.
 
<EOS>
"
Maldon
is
built
on
a
hill
that
slopes
gradually
towards
the
east
and
south
,
but
rises
somewhat
abruptly
on
the
west
and
north
,
humping
up
a
shoulder
,
as
it
were
,
to
the
north
-
west
.
<EOS>
At
this
corner
they
started
to
dig
entrenchments
just
after
one
o'clock
,
and
soon
officers
and
orderlies
were
busy
all
round
the
town
,
plotting
,
measuring
,
and
setting
up
marks
of
one
kind
and
another
.
<EOS>
Other
troops
appeared
to
be
busy
down
in
Heybridge
,
but
what
they
were
doing
I
could
not
tell
,
as
no
one
was
allowed
to
cross
the
bridge
over
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
German
officer
who
had
surprised
me
down
on
the
golf
course
did
not
turn
out
to
be
a
bad
kind
of
youth
on
further
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
Captain
von
Hildebrandt
,
of
the
Guard
Fusilier
Regiment
,
who
was
employed
on
the
Staff
,
though
in
what
capacity
he
did
not
say
.
<EOS>
Thinking
it
was
just
as
well
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
,
I
invited
him
to
lunch
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
had
to
be
off
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
introduced
me
to
three
friends
of
his
in
the
101st
Grenadiers
,
who
,
he
suggested
,
should
be
billeted
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
the
idea
a
fairly
good
one
,
and
Von
Hildebrandt
,
having
apparently
arranged
this
with
the
billeting
officer
without
any
difficulty
,
I
took
them
home
with
me
to
lunch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
found
my
wife
and
family
in
a
great
state
of
mind
,
both
on
account
of
the
untoward
happenings
of
the
morning
and
my
non
-
return
from
golf
at
the
expected
time
.
<EOS>
They
had
imagined
all
sorts
of
things
which
might
have
befallen
me
,
but
luckily
seemed
not
to
have
heard
of
my
adventure
with
the
choleric
colonel
.
<EOS>
Our
three
foreigners
soon
made
themselves
very
much
at
home
,
but
as
they
were
undeniably
gentlemen
,
they
contrived
to
be
about
as
agreeable
as
could
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
their
presence
was
to
a
great
extent
a
safeguard
against
annoyance
,
as
the
stable
and
back
premises
were
stuffed
full
of
soldiers
,
who
might
have
been
very
troublesome
<EOS>
had
they
not
been
there
to
keep
them
in
order
.
 
<EOS>
"
Of
what
was
happening
up
in
London
we
knew
nothing
.
<EOS>
Being
Sunday
,
all
the
shops
were
shut
;
but
I
went
out
and
contrived
to
lay
in
a
considerable
stock
of
provisions
one
way
and
another
,
and
it
was
just
as
well
<EOS>
I
did
,
for
I
only
just
anticipated
the
Germans
,
who
commandeered
everything
in
the
town
,
and
put
everybody
on
an
allowance
of
rations
.
<EOS>
They
paid
for
them
with
bills
on
the
British
Government
,
which
were
by
no
means
acceptable
to
the
shopkeepers
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
'
<EOS>
Hobson
's
choice'--that
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
soothed
them
by
saying
that
the
British
Army
would
be
smashed
in
a
couple
of
weeks
,
and
the
defrayment
of
such
bills
would
be
among
the
conditions
of
peace
.
<EOS>
The
troops
generally
seemed
to
be
well
-
behaved
,
and
treated
those
inhabitants
with
whom
they
came
in
contact
in
an
unexceptionable
manner
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
see
very
much
of
them
,
however
,
as
they
were
kept
hard
at
work
all
day
with
their
entrenchments
and
were
not
allowed
out
of
their
billets
after
eight
o'clock
that
evening
.
<EOS>
No
one
,
in
fact
,
was
allowed
to
be
about
the
streets
after
that
hour
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
people
were
shot
by
the
sentries
as
they
tried
to
break
out
in
one
direction
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
These
affairs
produced
a
feeling
of
horror
and
indignation
in
the
town
,
as
Englishmen
,
having
such
a
long
experience
of
peace
in
their
own
country
,
have
always
refused
to
realise
what
war
really
means
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
German
fortifications
went
on
at
a
rapid
rate
.
<EOS>
Trenches
were
dug
all
round
the
northern
and
western
sides
of
the
town
before
dark
on
the
first
evening
,
and
<EOS>
the
following
morning
I
woke
up
to
find
three
huge
gun
-
pits
yawning
in
my
garden
,
which
looked
to
the
northward
.
<EOS>
During
breakfast
there
was
a
great
rattling
and
rumbling
in
the
street
without
,
and
presently
three
big
field
howitzers
were
dragged
in
and
planted
in
the
pits
.
<EOS>
There
they
stood
,
their
ugly
snouts
pointing
skyward
in
the
midst
of
the
wreck
of
flowers
and
fruit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Afterwards
I
went
out
and
found
that
other
guns
and
howitzers
were
being
put
in
position
all
along
the
north
side
of
Beeleigh
Road
,
and
round
the
corner
by
the
Old
Barracks
.
<EOS>
The
high
tower
of
the
disused
Church
of
St.
Peter
's
,
now
utilised
for
the
safe
custody
of
Dr.
Plume
's
library
,
had
been
equipped
as
a
lookout
and
signal
station
.
"
 
<EOS>
Such
was
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
town
of
Maldon
on
Monday
morning

The
excitement
in
London
,
and
indeed
all
over
the
country
,
on
Tuesday
night
was
intense
.
<EOS>
Scotney
's
story
of
the
landing
at
Weybourne
was
eagerly
read
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
sun
sank
blood
-
red
into
the
smoke
haze
behind
Nelson
's
Monument
in
Trafalgar
Square
,
it
was
an
ominous
sign
to
the
panic
-
stricken
crowds
that
day
and
night
were
now
assembled
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
bronze
lions
facing
the
four
points
of
the
compass
were
now
mere
mocking
emblems
of
England
's
departed
greatness
.
<EOS>
The
mobilisation
muddle
was
known
;
for
,
according
to
the
papers
,
hardly
any
troops
had
as
yet
assembled
at
their
places
of
concentration
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
east
of
England
was
helplessly
in
the
invader
's
hands
.
<EOS>
From
Newcastle
had
come
terrible
reports
of
the
bombardment
.
<EOS>
Half
the
city
was
in
flames
,
the
Elswick
works
were
held
by
the
enemy
,
and
whole
streets
in
Newcastle
,
Gateshead
,
Sunderland
,
and
Tynemouth
were
still
burning
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tynemouth
fort
had
proved
of
little
or
no
use
against
the
enemy
's
guns
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
had
,
it
appeared
,
used
petrol
bombs
with
appalling
results
,
spreading
fire
,
disaster
,
and
death
everywhere
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
,
compelled
to
fly
with
only
the
clothes
they
wore
,
had
scattered
all
over
Northumberland
and
Durham
,
while
the
enemy
had
seized
a
quantity
of
valuable
shipping
that
had
been
in
the
Tyne
,
hoisted
the
German
flag
,
and
converted
the
vessels
to
their
own
uses
.
 
<EOS>
Many
had
already
been
sent
across
to
Wilhelmshaven
,
Emden
,
Bremerhaven
,
and
other
places
to
act
as
transports
,
while
the
Elswick
works
--
which
surely
ought
to
have
been
properly
protected
--
supplied
the
Germans
with
quantities
of
valuable
material
.
 
<EOS>
Panic
and
confusion
were
everywhere
.
<EOS>
All
over
the
country
the
railway
system
was
utterly
disorganised
,
business
everywhere
was
at
a
complete
deadlock
,
for
in
every
town
and
city
all
over
the
kingdom
the
banks
were
closed
.
 
<EOS>
Lombard
Street
,
Lothbury
,
and
other
banking
centres
in
the
City
<EOS>
had
all
day
on
Monday
been
the
scene
of
absolute
panic
.
<EOS>
There
,
as
well
as
at
every
branch
bank
all
over
the
metropolis
,
had
occurred
a
wild
rush
to
withdraw
deposits
by
people
who
foresaw
disaster
.
<EOS>
Many
,
indeed
,
intended
to
fly
with
their
families
away
from
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
price
of
the
necessities
of
life
had
risen
further
,
and
in
the
East
End
and
poorer
districts
of
Southwark
the
whole
population
were
already
in
a
state
of
semi
-
starvation
.
<EOS>
But
worst
of
all
,
the
awful
truth
with
which
London
was
now
face
to
face
<EOS>
was
that
the
metropolis
was
absolutely
defenceless
.
 
<EOS>
Every
hour
the
papers
were
appearing
with
fresh
details
of
the
invasion
,
for
reports
were
so
rapidly
coming
in
from
every
hand
that
the
Press
had
difficulty
in
dealing
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Hull
and
Goole
were
known
to
be
in
the
hands
of
the
invaders
,
and
Grimsby
,
where
the
Mayor
had
been
unable
to
pay
the
indemnity
demanded
,
had
been
sacked
.
<EOS>
But
details
were
not
yet
forthcoming
.
 
<EOS>
Londoners
,
however
,
learnt
late
that
night
more
authentic
news
from
the
invaded
zone
,
of
which
Beccles
was
the
centre
,
and
it
was
to
the
effect
that
those
who
had
landed
at
Lowestoft
were
the
IXth
German
Army
Corps
,
with
General
von
Kronhelm
,
the
Generalissimo
of
the
German
Army
.
<EOS>
This
Army
Corps
,
consisting
of
about
40,000
men
,
was
divided
into
the
17th
Division
,
commanded
by
Lieutenant

General
Hocker
,
and
the
18th
by
Lieutenant

<EOS>
According
to
official
information
which
had
reached
the
War
Office
and
been
given
to
the
Press
,
the
17th
Division
was
made
up
of
the
Bremen
and
Hamburg
Infantry
Regiments
,
the
Grand
Duke
of
Mecklenburg
's
Grenadiers
,
the
Grand
Duke
's
Fusiliers
,
the
Luebeck
Regiment
No
.
162
,
the
Schleswig
-
Holstein
Regiment
No
.
163
,
while
the
cavalry
brigade
consisted
of
the
17th
and
18th
Grand
Duke
of
Mecklenburg
's
Dragoons
.
 
<EOS>
The
18th
Division
consisted
of
the
Schleswig
Regiment
No
.
84
and
the
Schleswig
Fusiliers
No
.
86
,
the
Thuringen
Regiment
,
and
the
Duke
of
Holstein
's
Regiment
,
the
two
latter
regiments
being
billeted
in
Lowestoft
,
while
the
cavalry
brigade
forming
the
screen
across
from
Leiston
by
Wilby
to
Castle
Hill
were
Queen
Wilhelmina
's
Hanover
Hussars
and
the
Emperor
of
Austria
's
Schleswig
-
Holstein
Hussars
No
.
16
.
<EOS>
These
,
with
the
smart
motor
infantry
,
held
every
communication
in
the
direction
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
As
far
as
could
be
gathered
,
the
German
commander
had
established
his
headquarters
in
Beccles
,
and
had
not
moved
.
<EOS>
It
now
became
apparent
that
the
telegraph
cables
between
the
East
coast
and
Holland
and
Germany
,
already
described
in
the
first
chapter
,
had
never
been
cut
at
all
.
<EOS>
They
had
simply
been
held
by
the
enemy
's
advance
agents
until
the
landing
had
been
effected
.
<EOS>
And
now
Von
Kronhelm
had
actually
established
direct
communication
between
Beccles
and
Emden
,
and
on
to
Berlin
.
 
<EOS>
Reports
from
the
North
Sea
spoke
of
the
enemy
's
transports
returning
to
the
German
coast
,
escorted
by
cruisers
;
therefore
the
plan
was
undoubtedly
not
to
move
until
a
very
much
larger
force
had
been
landed
.
 
<EOS>
Could
England
regain
her
command
of
the
sea
in
time
to
prevent
the
completion
of
the
blow
?
 
<EOS>
That
night
the
London
streets
presented
a
scene
of
panic
indescribable
.
<EOS>
The
theatres
opened
,
but
closed
their
doors
again
,
as
nobody
would
see
plays
while
in
that
excited
state
.
<EOS>
Every
shop
was
closed
,
and
every
railway
station
was
filled

overflowing
with
the
exodus
of
terrified
people
fleeing
to
the
country
westward
,
or
reserves
on
their
way
to
join
the
colours
.
 
<EOS>
The
incredulous
manner
in
which
the
country
first
received
the
news
had
now
been
succeeded
by
wild
terror
and
despair
.
<EOS>
On
that
bright
Sunday
afternoon
they
laughed
at
the
report
as
a
mere
journalistic
sensation
,
but
ere
the
sun
set
<EOS>
the
hard
,
terrible
truth
was
forced
upon
them
,
and
now
,
on
Tuesday
night
,
the
whole
country
,
from
Brighton
to
Carlisle
,
from
Yarmouth
to
Aberystwyth
,
was
utterly
disorganised
and
in
a
state
of
terrified
anxiety
.
 
<EOS>
The
eastern
counties
were
already
beneath
the
iron
heel
of
the
invader
,
whose
objective
was
the
world
's
great
capital
--
London
.
 
<EOS>
Would
they
reach
it
?
<EOS>
That
was
the
serious
question
upon
every
one
's
tongue
that
fevered
,
breathless
night

CHAPTER

<EOS>
HOW
THE
ENEMY
DEALT
THE
BLOW
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
at
the
regimental
depots
feverish
excitement
prevailed
on
Wednesday
,
September
5
,
now
that
every
man
was
ordered
on
active
service
.
<EOS>
All
officers
and
men
who
had
been
on
leave
were
recalled
,
and
medical
inspection
of
all
ranks
at
once
commenced
.
<EOS>
Rations
and
bedding
,
stores
and
equipment
were
drawn
,
but
there
was
a
great
lack
of
uniforms
.
<EOS>
Unlike
the
German
Army
,
where
every
soldier
's
equipment
is
complete
even
to
the
last
button
on
the
proverbial
gaiter
,
and
stowed
away
where
the
owner
knows
where
to
obtain
it
,
our
officers
commanding
depots
commenced
indenting
for
clothing
on
the
Royal
Army
Clothing
Department
and
the
Army
Corps
Clothing
Department
.
 
<EOS>
A
large
percentage
of
men
were
,
of
course
,
found
medically
unfit
to
serve
,
and
were
discharged
to
swell
the
mobs
of
hungry
idlers
.
<EOS>
The
plain
clothes
of
the
reservists
coming
in
were
disposed
of
,
no
man
daring
to
appear
in
the
ranks
unless
in
uniform
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
's
proclamation
having
forbidden
the
tactics
of
the
Boers
of
putting
mere
armed
citizens
into
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
Horse
-
collecting
parties
went
out
all
over
the
country
,
taking
with
them
head
-
collars
,
head
-
ropes
,
bits
,
reins
,
surcingles
,
numnahs
,
horse
-
blankets
,
and
nose
-
bags
.
<EOS>
These
scoured
every
county
in
search
of
likely
animals
,
every
farm
,
every
livery
stable
,
every
hunting
-
box
,
all
hound
-
kennels
and
private
stables
were
visited
,
and
a
choice
made
.
<EOS>
All
this
,
however
,
took
time
.
<EOS>
Precious
hours
were
thus
being
wasted
while
the
enemy
were
calmly
completing
their
arrangements
for
the
long
-
contemplated
blow
at
the
heart
of
the
British
Empire
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
War
Office
refused
any
information
,
special
editions
of
the
papers
during
Wednesday
printed
sensational
reports
of
the
ruthless
completion
of
the
impenetrable
screen
covering
the
operations
of
the
enemy
on
the
whole
of
the
East
Coast
.
 
<EOS>
News
had
,
by
some
means
,
filtered
through
from
Yarmouth
that
a
similar
landing
to
those
at
Lowestoft
and
Weybourne
had
been
effected
.
<EOS>
Protected
as
such
an
operation
was
by
its
flanks
being
supported
by
the
IVth
and
IXth
Army
Corps
landing
on
either
side
,
the
Xth
Army
Corps
,
under
General
von
Wilburg
,
had
seized
Yarmouth
,
with
its
many
miles
of
wharves
and
docks
,
which
were
now
crowded
by
the
lighters
'
craft
of
flotilla
from
the
Frisian
Islands
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
the
landing
had
been
effected
simultaneously
with
that
at
Lowestoft
.
<EOS>
The
large
number
of
cranes
at
the
fish
-
docks
were
of
invaluable
use
to
the
enemy
,
for
there
they
landed
guns
,
animals
,
and
stores
,
while
the
provisions
they
found
at
the
various
ship
's
chandlers
,
and
in
such
shops
as
Blagg
's
,
and
the
International
Stores
in
King
Street
,
Peter
Brown
's
,
Doughty
's
,
Lipton
's
,
Penny
's
and
Barnes
's
,
were
at
once
commandeered
.
<EOS>
Great
stores
of
flour
were
seized
in
Clarke
's
and
Press
's
mills
,
while
the
horse
-
provender
mills
in
the
vicinity
supplied
them
with
valuable
forage
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
these
few
details
,
as
far
as
regarded
the
fate
of
Yarmouth
,
nothing
further
was
at
present
known
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
division
at
Colchester
,
which
comprised
all
the
regular
troops
north
of
the
Thames
in
the
eastern
command
,
was
,
no
doubt
,
in
a
critical
position
,
threatened
so
closely
north
and
south
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
regiments
--
the
Norfolks
,
the
Leicestershire
,
and
the
King
's
Own
Scottish
Borderers
of
the
11th
Infantry
Brigade
--
were
up
to
their
strength
.
<EOS>
The
12th
Infantry
Brigade
,
which
also
belonged
to
the
division
,
possessed
only
skeleton
regiments
stationed
at
Hounslow
and
Warley
.
<EOS>
Of
the
4th
Cavalry
Brigade
,
some
were
at
Norwich
,
the
21st
Lancers
were
at
Hounslow
,
while
only
the
16th
Lancers
were
at
Colchester
.
<EOS>
Other
cavalry
regiments
were
as
far
away
as
Canterbury
,
Shorncliffe
,
and
Brighton
,
and
although
there
were
three
batteries
of
artillery
at
Colchester
,
some
were
at
Ipswich
,
others
at
Shorncliffe
,
and
others
at
Woolwich
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
it
was
quite
evident
to
the
authorities
in
London
that
unless
both
Colchester
and
Norwich
were
instantly
strongly
supported
,
they
would
soon
be
simply
swept
out
of
existence
by
the
enormous
masses
of
German
troops
now
dominating
the
whole
eastern
coast
,
bent
upon
occupying
London
.
 
<EOS>
Helpless
though
they
felt
themselves
to
be
,
the
garrison
at
Colchester
did
all
they
could
.
<EOS>
All
available
cavalry
had
been
pushed
out
past
Ipswich
,
north
to
Wickham
Market
,
Stowmarket
,
and
across
to
Bury
St.
Edmunds
,
only
to
find
on
Wednesday
morning
that
they
were
covering
the
hasty
retreat
of
the
small
body
of
cavalry
who
had
been
stationed
at
Norwich
.
<EOS>
They
,
gallantly
led
by
their
officers
,
had
done
everything
possible
to
reconnoitre
and
attempt
to
pierce
the
enemy
's
huge
cavalry
screen
,
but
in
every
instance
entirely
in
vain
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
outnumbered
by
the
squadrons
of
independent
cavalry
operating
in
front
of
the
Germans
,
and
had
,
alas
!
<EOS>
left
numbers
of
their
gallant
comrades
upon
the
roads
,
killed
and
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
Norwich
had
,
therefore
,
on
Wednesday
morning
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
German
cavalry
,
utterly
defenceless
.
<EOS>
From
the
Castle
the
German
flag
was
now
flying
,
the
Britannia
Barracks
were
being
used
by
the
enemy
,
food
had
all
been
seized
,
the
streets
were
in
a
state
of
chaos
,
and
a
complete
reign
of
terror
had
been
created
when
a
company
of
British
Infantry
,
having
fired
at
some
Uhlans
,
were
ruthlessly
shot
down
in
the
street
close
by
the
Maid
's
Head
.
 
<EOS>
In
addition
to
this
,
the
Mayor
of
Norwich
was
taken
prisoner
,
lodged
in
the
Castle
,
and
held
as
surety
for
the
well
-
behaviour
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
Everywhere
Von
Kronhelm
's
famous
proclamation
was
posted
,
and
as
the
invaders
poured
into
the
city
the
inhabitants
looked
on
in
sullen
silence
,
knowing
that
they
were
now
under
German
military
discipline
,
the
most
rigorous
and
drastic
in
the
whole
world
.

A

Shortly
before
five
o'clock
on
Sunday
morning
the
night
operator
of
the
telephone
call
-
office
here
discovered
an
interruption
on
the
trunk
-
line
,
and
on
trying
the
telegraphs
was
surprised
to
find
that
there
was
no
communication
in
any
direction
.
<EOS>
The
railway
station
,
being
rung
up
,
replied
that
their
wires
were
also
down
.
 
<EOS>
"
Almost
immediately
afterwards
<EOS>
a
well
-
known
North
Sea
pilot
rushed
into
the
post
office
and
breathlessly
asked
that
he
might
telephone
to
Lloyd
's
.
<EOS>
When
told
that
all
communication
was
cut
off
he
wildly
shouted
that
a
most
extraordinary
sight
was
to
be
seen
in
the
River
Ouse
,
up
which
was
approaching
a
continuous
procession
of
tugs
,
towing
flats
,
and
barges
filled
with
German
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
was
proved
to
be
an
actual
fact
,
and
the
inhabitants
of
Goole
,
awakened
from
their
Sunday
morning
slumbers
by
the
shouts
of
alarm
in
the
streets
,
found
,
to
their
abject
amazement
,
foreign
soldiers
swarming
everywhere
.
<EOS>
On
the
quay
they
found
activity
everywhere
,
German
being
spoken
on
all
hands
.
<EOS>
They
watched
a
body
of
cavalry
,
consisting
of
the
1st
Westphalian
Hussars
,
the
Westphalian
Cuirassiers
,
land
with
order
and
ease
at
the
Victoria
Pier
,
whence
,
after
being
formed
up
on
the
quay
,
they
advanced
at
a
sharp
trot
up
Victoria
Street
,
Ouse
Street
,
and
North
Street
to
the
railway
stations
,
where
,
as
is
generally
known
,
there
are
large
sidings
of
the
North
-
East
Lancashire
and
Yorkshire
lines
in
direct
communication
both
with
London
and
the
great
cities
of
the
north
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
here
found
great
quantities
of
engines
and
rolling
stock
,
all
of
which
was
at
once
seized
,
together
with
huge
stacks
of
coal
at
the
new
sidings
.
 
<EOS>

Before
long
the
first
of
the
infantry
of
the
13th
Division
,
which
was
commanded
by
Lieutenant
-
General
Doppschutz
,
marched
up
to
the
stations
.
<EOS>
They
consisted
of
the
13th
and
56th
Westphalian
Regiments
,
and
the
cavalry
on
being
relieved
advanced
out
of
the
town
,
crossing
the
Dutch
River
by
the
railway
bridge
,
and
pushed
on
as
far
as
Thorne
and
Hensall
,
near
which
they
at
once
strongly
held
the
several
important
railway
junctions
.

Meanwhile
cavalry
of
the
14th
Brigade
,
consisting
of
Westphalian
Hussars
and
Uhlans
,
were
rapidly
disembarking
at
Old
Goole
,
and
,
advancing
southwards
over
the
open
country
of
Goole
Moors
and
Thorne
Waste
,
occupied
Crowle
.
<EOS>
Both
cavalry
brigades
were
acting
independently
of
the
main
body
,
and
by
their
vigorous
action
both
south

west
they
were
entirely
screening
what
was
happening
in

Through

the
disembarkation
proceeded

the
townsmen
standing
there
helpless
to
lift
a

and
watching
the
enemy
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
The
Victoria
Pleasure
Grounds
were
occupied
by
parked
artillery
,
which
towards
afternoon
began
to
rumble
through
the

The
German
gunners
,
with
folded

sat
unconcernedly
upon
the
ammunition
boxes
as
the
guns
were
drawn
up
to
their
positions

<EOS>
Horses
were
seized
wherever
found
,
the
proclamation
of
Von

was
nailed
upon
the
church
doors
,
and
the
terrified
populace
read
the
grim
threat
of
the
German
field

The
wagons

there
were
hundreds

were
put
ashore

at

others
up

When
the

was
complete
,
as
it
was
soon
after
midday
,
and
when
reports
had
come
in
to
Von
Bistram
that
the
country
was
clear
of

British

the
German
infantry
advance
began

By
nightfall
they

The
sensation
caused
in
Sheffield
when
it
became
known
that
German
cavalry
were
so
close
as
Rotherham
was
enormous
,
and
the
scenes
in
the
streets
soon
approached
a
panic
;
for
it
was
wildly
declared
that
that
night
the
enemy
intended
to
occupy
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
Mayor
telegraphed
to
the
War
Office
,
appealing
for
additional
defensive
force
,
but
no
response
was
received
to
the
telegram
.
<EOS>
The
small
force
of
military
in
the
town
,
which
consisted
of
the
2nd
Battalion
Yorkshire
Light
Infantry
,
some
Royal
Artillery
,
and
the
local
Volunteers
,
were
soon
assembled
,
and
going
out
occupied
the
strong
position
above
Sheffield
between
Catcliffe
and
Tinsley
,
overlooking
the
valley
of
the
Rother
to
the
east
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
expectation
that
the
Germans
intended
an
immediate
descent
on
Sheffield
was
not
realised
,
because
the
German
tactics
were
merely
to
reconnoitre
and
report
on
the
defences
of
Sheffield
,
if
any
existed
.
<EOS>
This
they
did
by
remaining
to
the
eastward
of
the
river
Rother
,
whence
the
high
ground
rising
before
Sheffield
could
be
easily
observed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
dusk
one
or
two
squadrons
of
Cuirassiers
were
seen
to
be
examining
the
river
to
find
fords
and
ascertain
the
capacity
of
the
bridges
,
while
others
appeared
to
be
comparing
the
natural
features
of
the
ground
with
the
maps
with
which
they
all
appeared
to
be
provided
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
night
fell
,
however
,
the
cavalry
retired
towards
Doncaster
,
which
town
was
occupied
,
the
Angel
being
the
cavalry
headquarters
.
<EOS>
The
reason
the
Germans
could
not
advance
at
once
upon
Sheffield
was
that
the
cavalry
was
not
strongly
supported
by
infantry
from
their
base
,
the
distance
from
Goole
being
too
great
to
be
covered
in
a
single
day
.
<EOS>
That
the
arrangements
for
landing
were
in
<EOS>
every
detail
perfect
could
not
be
doubted
,
but
owing
to
the
narrow
channel
of
the
Ouse
time
was
necessary
,
and
it
is
considered
probable
that
fully
three
days
must
elapse
from
Sunday
before
the
Germans
are
absolutely
established
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
attempt
has
been
made
by
the
Yorkshire
Light
Infantry
and
the
York
and
Lancaster
Regiment
,
with
three
battalions
of
Volunteers
stationed
at
Pontefract
,
to
discover
the
enemy
's
strength
and
position
between
Askern
and
Snaith
,
but
so
far
without
avail
,
the
cavalry
screen
across
the
whole
country
being
impenetrable

The
people
of
the
West
Riding
,
and
especially
the
inhabitants
of
Sheffield
,
are
stupefied
that
they
have
received
no
assistance
--
not
even
a
reply
to
the
Mayor
's
telegram
.
<EOS>
This
fact
has
leaked
out
,
and
has
caused
the
greatest
dissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
An
enemy
is
upon
us
,
yet
we
are
in
ignorance
of
what
step
,
if
any
,
the
authorities
are
taking
for
our
protection
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
are
wild
rumours
here
that
the
enemy
have
burned
Grimsby
,
but
these
are
generally
discredited
,
for
telegraphic
and
telephonic
communication
has
been
cut
off
,
and
at
present
we
are
completely
isolated
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
gathered
from
the
invaders
that
the
VIIIth
Army
Corps
of
the
Germans
have
landed
and
seized
Hull
,
but
at
present
this
is
not
confirmed
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
alas
!
<EOS>
no
communication
with
the
place
,
therefore
,
the
report
may
possibly
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dewsbury
,
Huddersfield
,
Wakefield
,
and
Selby
are
all
intensely
excited
over
the
sudden
appearance
of
German
soldiers
,
and
were
at
first
inclined
to
unite
to
stem
their
progress
.
<EOS>
But
the
German
proclamation
,
showing
the
individual
peril
of
any
citizen
taking
arms
against
the
invaders
,
having
been
posted
everywhere
,
has
held
every
one
scared
and
in
silent
inactivity
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Where
is
our
Army
?
'
<EOS>
every
one
is
asking
.
<EOS>
The
whole
country
has
run
riot
in
a
single
hour
,
now
that
the
Germans
are
upon
us
.
<EOS>
On
every
hand
it
is
asked
:
'
What
will
London
do
?
'
"
 
<EOS>
Reports
now
reached
London
that
the
VIIth
German
Army
Corps
had
landed
at
Hull
and
Goole
,
and
taking
possession
of
these
towns
,
were
moving
upon
Sheffield
in
order
to
paralyse
our
trade
in
the
Midlands
.
<EOS>
Hull
had
been
bombarded
,
and
was
in
flames
!
<EOS>
Terrible
scenes
were
taking
place
at
that
port
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
memorable
Sunday
,
when
a
descent
had
been
made
upon
our
shores
,
there
were
in
German
ports
on
the
North
Sea
nearly
a
million
tons
gross
of
German
shipping
.
<EOS>
Normally
,
in
peace
time
,
half
a
million
tons
is
always
to
be
found
there
,
the
second
half
having
been
quietly
collected
by
ships
putting
in
unobserved
into
such
ports
as
Emden
,
Bremen
,
Bremerhaven
,
and
Geestemunde
,
where
there
are
at
least
ten
miles
of
deep
-
sea
wharves
,
with
ample
railway
access
.
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
these
crafts
caused
no
particular
comment
,
but
they
had
already
been
secretly
prepared
for
the
transport
of
men
and
horses
while
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
cover
of
the
Frisian
Islands
,
from
every
canal
,
river
,
and
creek
had
been
assembled
a
huge
multitude
of
flats
and
barges
,
ready
to
be
towed
by
tugs
alongside
the
wharves
and
filled
with
troops
.
<EOS>
Of
a
sudden
,
in
a
single
hour
it
seemed
,
Hamburg
,
Altona
,
Cuxhaven
,
and
Wilhelmshaven
were
in
excited
activity
,
and
almost
before
the
inhabitants
themselves
realised
what
was
really
in
progress
,
the
embarkation
had
well
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
At
Emden
,
with
its
direct
cable
to
the
theatre
of
war
in
England
,
was
concentrated
the
brain
of
the
whole
movement
.
<EOS>
Beneath
the
lee
of
the
covering
screen
of
Frisian
Islands
,
Borkum
,
Juist
,
Norderney
,
Langebog
,
and
the
others
,
the
preparations
for
the
descent
upon
England
rapidly
matured
.
 
<EOS>
Troop
-
trains
from
every
part
of
the
Fatherland
arrived
with
the
punctuality
of
clockwork
.
<EOS>
From
Duesseldorf
came
the
VIIth
Army
Corps
,
the
VIIIth
from
Coblenz
,
the
IXth
were
already
assembled
at
their
headquarters
at
Altona
,
while
many
of
them
being
stationed
at
Bremen
embarked
from
there
;
the
Xth
came
up
from
Hanover
,
the
XIVth
from
Magdeburg
,
and
the
Corps
of
German
Guards
,
the
pride
and
flower
of
the
Kaiser
's
troops
,
arrived
eagerly
at
Hamburg
from
Berlin
and
Potsdam
,
among
the
first
to
embark
.
 
<EOS>
Each
army
corps
consisted
of
about
38,000
officers
and
men
,
11,000
horses
,
144
guns
,
and
about
2,000
motor
-
cars
,
wagons
,
and
carts
.
<EOS>
But
for
this
campaign
--
which
was
more
of
the
nature
of
a
raid
than
of
any
protracted
campaign
--
the
supply
of
wheeled
transport
,
with
the
exception
of
motor
-
cars
,
had
been
somewhat
reduced
.
 
<EOS>
Each
cavalry
brigade
attached
to
an
army
corps
consisted
of
1,400
horses
and
men
,
with
some
thirty
-
five
light
machine
guns
and
wagons
.
<EOS>
The
German
calculation
--
which
proved
pretty
correct
--
was
that
each
army
corps
could
come
over
to
England
in
100,000
tons
gross
of
shipping
,
bringing
with
them
supplies
for
twenty
-
seven
days
in
another
3,000
tons
gross
.
<EOS>
Therefore
about
618,000
tons
gross
conveyed
the
whole
of
the
six
corps
,
leaving
an
ample
margin
still
in
German
ports
for
any
emergencies
.
<EOS>
Half
this
tonnage
consisted
of
about
100
steamers
,
averaging
3,000
tons
each
,
the
remainder
being
the
boats
,
flats
,
lighters
,
barges
,
and
tugs
previously
alluded
to
.

<EOS>
The
Saxons
who
,
disregarding
the
neutrality
of
Belgium
,
had
embarked
at
Antwerp
,
had
seized
the
whole
of
the
flat
-
bottomed
craft
in
the
Scheldt
and
the
numerous
canals
,
as
well
as
the
merchant
ships
in
the
port
,
finding
no
difficulty
in
commandeering
the
amount
of
tonnage
necessary
to
convey
them
to
the
Blackwater
and
the
Crouch
.
 
<EOS>
As
hour
succeeded
hour
the
panic
increased
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
also
known
that
,
in
addition
to
the
various
corps
who
had
effected
a
landing
,
the
German
Guards
had
,
by
a
sudden
swoop
into
the
Wash
,
got
ashore
at
King
's
Lynn
,
seized
the
town
,
and
united
their
forces
with
Von
Kleppen
's
corps
,
who
,
having
landed
at
Weybourne
,
were
now
spread
right
across
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
This
picked
corps
of
Guards
was
under
the
command
of
that
distinguished
officer
,
the
Duke
of
Mannheim
,
while
the
infantry
divisions
were
under
Lieutenant
-
Generals
von
Castein
and
Von
Der
Decken
.
 
<EOS>
The
landing
at
King
's
Lynn
on
Sunday
morning
had
been
quite
a
simple
affair
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
whatever
to
repel
them
,
and
they
disembarked
on
the
quays
and
in
the
docks
,
watched
by
the
astonished
populace
.
<EOS>
All
provisions
were
seized
at
shops
,
while
headquarters
were
established
at
the
municipal
buildings
,
and
the
German
flag
hoisted
upon
the
old
church
,
the
tower
of
which
was
at
once
used
as
a
signal
station
.
 
<EOS>
Old
-
fashioned
people
of
Lynn
peered
out
of
their
quiet
respectable
houses
in
King
Street
in
utter
amazement
;
but
soon
,
when
the
German
proclamation
was
posted
,
the
terrible
truth
was
plain
.
 
<EOS>
In
half
an
hour
,
even
before
they
could
realise
it
,
they
had
been
transferred
from
the
protection
of
the
British
flag
to
the
militarism
of
the
German
.
 
<EOS>
Ere
sundown
on
Sunday
,
stalwart
grey
-
coated
sentries
of
the
Guards
Fusiliers
from
Potsdam
,
and
the
Grenadiers
from
Berlin
were
holding
the
roads
at
Gayton
,
East
Walton
,
Narborough
,
Markham
,
Fincham
,
Stradsett

from
Spalding
on
the
east
,
Peterborough
,
Chatteris

Littleport
,
Thetford
,
Diss

were
faced
by
a
huge
cavalry

protecting
the
landing
and
repose
of
the
great
German
Army
behind
it

Slowly

London
was
at
a
standstill

Trade
was
entirely
stopped
.
<EOS>
Shopkeepers
feared
to
open
their
doors
on
account
of
the
fierce
,
hungry
mobs
parading
the
street
.
<EOS>
Orators
were
haranguing
the
crowds
in
almost
every
open
space
.
<EOS>
The
police
were
either
powerless
,
or
feared
to
come
into
collision
with
the
assembled
populace
.
<EOS>
Terror
and
blank
despair
were
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
unrest
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
The
banks
,
head
offices
,
and
branches
,
unable
to
withstand
the
run
upon
them
when
every
one
demanded
to
be
paid
in
gold
,
had
,
by
mutual
arrangement
,
shut
their
doors
,
leaving
excited
and
furious
crowds
of
customers
outside
unpaid
.
<EOS>
Financial
ruin
stared
every
one
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
Those
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
realise
their
securities
on
Monday
were
fleeing
from
London
south
and
westward
.
<EOS>
Day
and
night
the
most
extraordinary
scenes
of
frantic
fear
were
witnessed
at
Paddington
,
Victoria
,
Waterloo
,
and
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
The
southern
railways
were
badly
disorganised
by
the
cutting
of
the
lines
by
the
enemy
,
but
the
Great
Western
system
was
,
up
to
the
present
,
intact
,
and
carried
thousands
upon
thousands
to
Wales
,
to
Devonshire
,
and
to
Cornwall
.
 
<EOS>
In
those
three
hot
,
breathless
days
the
Red
Hand
of
Ruin
spread
out
upon
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
starving
East
met
the
terrified
West
,
but
in
those
moments
the
bonds
of
terror
united
class
with
mass
.
<EOS>
Restaurants
and
theatres
were
closed
;
there
was
but
little
vehicular
traffic
in
the
streets
,
for
of
horses
there
were
none
,
while
the
majority
of
the
motor
'
buses
had
been
requisitioned
,
and
the
transit
of
goods
had
been
abandoned
.

The
City
,
"
that
great
army
of
daily
workers
,
both
male
and
female

was
out
of
employment
,
and
swelled
the
idlers
and
gossips
,
whose
temper
and
opinion
were
swayed
each
half
-
hour
by
the
papers
now
constantly
appearing
night
and
day
without
cessation
.
 
<EOS>
Cabinet
Councils
had
been
held
every
day
,
but
their
decisions
,
of
course
,
never
leaked
out
to
the
public
.
<EOS>
The
King
also
held
Privy
Councils
,
and
various
measures
were
decided
upon
.
<EOS>
Parliament
,
which
had
been
hurriedly
summoned
,
was
due
to
meet

speculated

at
which
resolutions
were
passed
condemning
the
Administration
and
eulogising
those
who
,
at
the
first
alarm
,
had
so
gallantly
died
in
defence
of
their
country
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
declared
that
by
the
culpable
negligence
of
the
War
Office
and
the
National
Defence
Committee
we
had
laid
ourselves
open
to
complete
ruin
,
both
financially
and
as
a
nation
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
-
in
-
the
-
street
already
felt
the
strain
,
for
the
lack
of
employment
and
the
sudden
rise
in
the
price
of
everything
had
brought
him
up
short
.
<EOS>
Wives
and
families
were
crying
for
food
,
and
those
without
savings
and
with
only
a
few
pounds
put
by
looked
grimly
into
the
future
and
at
the
mystery
it
presented
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
the
papers
published
the
continuation
of
the
important
story
of
Mr.
Alexander
,
the
Mayor
of
Maldon
,
which
revealed
the
extent
of
the
enemy
's
operations
in
Essex
and
the
strong
position
they
occupied
.
 
<EOS>
It
ran
as
below
:
 
<EOS>
"
Of
the
events
of
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
I
have
no
very
clear
recollection
.
<EOS>
I
was
bewildered
,
staggered
,
dumbfounded
by
the
sights
and
sounds
which
beset
me
.
<EOS>
Of
what
modern
war
meant
I
had
till
then
truly
but
a
very
faint
idea
.
<EOS>
To
witness
its
horrid
realities
enacted
in
this
quiet
,
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
spot
where
I
had
pitched
my
tent
for
so
many
years
,
brought
them
home
to
me
literally
as
well
as
metaphorically
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
had
run
down
Cromwell
Hill
,
and
seeing
the
flames
of
Heybridge
,
was
impelled
to
get
nearer
,
if
possible
,
to
discover
more
particularly
the
state
of
affairs
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
reckoning
without
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
When
I
got
to
the
bridge
over
the
river
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
the
officer
in
charge
there
absolutely
prevented
my
crossing
.
<EOS>
Beyond
the
soldiers
standing
or
kneeling
behind
whatever
cover
was
offered
by
the
walls
and
buildings
abutting
on
the
riverside
,
and
a
couple
of
machine
guns
placed
so
as
to
command
the
bridge
and
the
road
beyond
,
there
was
nothing
much
to
see
.
<EOS>
A
number
of
Germans
were
,
however
,
very
busy
in
the
big
mill
just
across
the
river
,
but
what
they
were
doing
I
could
not
make
out
.
<EOS>
As
I
turned
to
retrace
my
step
the
glare
of
the
conflagration
grew
suddenly
more
and
more
intense
.
<EOS>
A
mass
of
dark
figures
came
running
down
the
brightly
illuminated
road
towards
the
bridge
,
while
the
rifle
fire
became
louder
,
nearer
,
and
heavier
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Every
now
and
again
the
air
became
alive
with
,
as
it
were
,
the
hiss
and
buzz
of
flying
insects
.
<EOS>
The
English
must
have
fought
their
way
through
Heybridge
,
and
these
must
be
the
bullets
from
their
rifles
.
<EOS>
It
was
dangerous
to
stay
down
there
any
longer
,
so
I
took
to
my
heels
.
<EOS>
As
I
ran
I
heard
a
thundering
explosion
behind
me
,
the
shock
of
which
nearly
threw
me
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Looking
over
my
shoulder
,
I
saw
that
the
Germans
had
blown
up
the
mill
at
the
farther
end
of
the
bridge
,
and
were
now
pushing
carts
from
either
side
in
order
to
barricade
it
.
<EOS>
The
two
Maxims
,
too
,
began
to
pump
lead
with
their
hammering
reports
,
and
the
men
near
them
commenced
to
fall
in
twos
and
threes
.
<EOS>
I
made
off
to
the
left
,
and
passed
into
High
Street
by
the
end
of
St.
Peter
's
Church
,
now
disused
.
<EOS>
At
the
corner
I
ran
against
Mr.
Clydesdale
,
the
optician
,
who
looks
after
the
library
which
now
occupies
the
old
building
.
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
the
tower
,
which
stood
darkly
up
against
the
blood
-
red
sky
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Look
at
those
infernal
Germans
!
'
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
'
They
ca
n't
even
keep
out
of
that
old
place
.
<EOS>
I
wish
we
could
have
got
the
books
out
before
they
came
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
see
any
of
our
invaders
where
he
was
pointing
,
but
presently
I
became
aware
of
a
little
winking
,
blinking
light
at
the
very
summit
of
the
tower
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
That
's
them
,
'
said
Clydesdale
.
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
They
're
making
signals
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
My
boy
says
he
saw
the
same
thing
on
Purleigh
Church
tower
last
night
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
would
come
down
with
them
,
that
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
's
pretty
shaky
,
anyway
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
The
street
was
fairly
full
of
people
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
,
it
is
true
,
had
ordered
that
no
one
should
be
out
of
doors
between
eight
in
the
evening
and
six
in
the
morning
;
but
just
now
they
appeared
to
have
their
hands
pretty
full
elsewhere
,
and
if
any
of
the
few
soldiers
that
were
about
knew
of
or
thought
anything
of
the
interdiction
,
they
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
crash
of
a
salvo
of
heavy
guns
from
the
direction
of
my
own
house
interrupted
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
That
'll
be
the
guns
in
my
garden
,
'
I
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Yes
,
sir
,
and
they
've
got
three
monstrous
great
ones
in
the
opening
between
the
houses
just
behind
the
church
there
,
'
said
Clydesdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
he
spoke
,
the
guns
in
question
bellowed
out
,
one
after
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Look
--
look
at
the
tower
!
'
<EOS>
I
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
light
at
the
top
had
disappeared
and
the
lofty
edifice
was
swaying
slowly
,
slowly
,
over
to
the
left
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
She
's
gone
at
last
!
'
<EOS>
exclaimed
Clydesdale
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
true
.
<EOS>
Down
came
the
old
steeple
that
had
pointed
heavenward
for
so
many
generations
,
with
a
mighty
crash
and
concussion
that
swallowed
up
even
the
noise
of
the
battle
,
though
cannon
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
were
now
joining
in
the
hellish
concert
,
and
shell
from
the
English
batteries
began
to
roar
over
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
vibration
and
shock
of
the
heavy
guns
had
been
too
much
for
the
old
tower
,
which
,
for
years
in
a
tottery
condition
,
had
been
patched
up
so
often
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
the
cloud
of
dust
cleared
off
we
ran
towards
the
huge
pile
of
debris
that
filled
the
little
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Several
other
people
followed
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
dark
down
there
,
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
houses
,
despite
the
fire
-
light
overhead
,
and
we
began
striking
matches
as
we
looked
about
among
the
heaps
of
bricks
and
beams
to
see
if
there
were
any
of
the
German
signal
party
among
them
.
<EOS>
Why
we
should
have
taken
the
trouble
under
the
circumstances
I
do
not
quite
know
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
instinctive
movement
of
humanity
on
my
part
,
and
that
of
most
of
the
others
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
caught
sight
of
an
arm
in
a
light
blue
sleeve
protruding
from
the
debris
,
and
took
hold
of
it
in
a
futile
attempt
to
remove
some
of
the
bricks
and
rubbish
which
I
thought
were
covering
the
body
of
its
owner
.
<EOS>
To
my
horror
,
it
came
away
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
The
body
to
which
it
belonged
might
be
buried
yards
away
in
the
immense
heap
of
ruins
.
<EOS>
I
dropped
it
with
a
cry
,
and
fled
from
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dawn
was
now
breaking
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
exactly
remember
where
I
wandered
to
after
the
fall
of
St.
Peter
's
Tower
,
but
it
must
have
been
between
half
-
past
five
and
six
when
I
found
myself
on
the
high
ground
at
the
north
-
western
corner
of
the
town
,
overlooking
the
golf
links
,
where
I
had
spent
so
many
pleasant
hours
in
that
recent
past
that
now
seemed
so
far
away
.
<EOS>
All
around
me
were
batteries
,
trenches
,
and
gun
-
pits
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
firing
was
still
going
on
somewhere
away
to
the
right
,
where
Heybridge
poured
black
smoke
skyward
like
a
volcano
,
gun
and
howitzer
were
silent
,
and
their
attendant
artillerymen
,
instead
of
being
in
cover
behind
their
earthen
parapets
,
were
clustered
on
the
top
,
watching
intently
something
that
was
passing
in
the
valley
below
them
.
<EOS>
So
absorbed
were
they
that
I
was
able
to
creep
up
behind
them
,
and
also
get
a
sight
of
what
was
taking
place
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
what
I
saw
:
 
"
Over
the
railway
bridge
which
spanned
the
river
a
little
to
the
left
were
hurrying
battalion
after
battalion
of
green
and
blue
clad
German
infantry
.
<EOS>
They
moved
down
the
embankment
after
crossing
,
and
continued
their
march
behind
it
.
<EOS>
Where
the
railway
curved
to
the
right
and
left
,
about
half
a
mile
beyond
the
bridge
,
the
top
of
the
embankment
was
lined
with
dark
figures
lying
down
and
apparently
firing
,
while
over
the
golf
course
from
the
direction
of
Beeleigh
trotted
squadron
after
squadron
of
sky
-
blue
riders
,
their
green
and
white
lance
pennons
fluttering
in
the
breeze
.
<EOS>
They
crossed
the
Blackwater
and
Chelmer
Canal
,
and
cantered
off
in
the
direction
of
Langford
Rectory
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
the
same
time
I
saw
line
after
line
of
the
Germans
massed
behind
the
embankment
spring
over
it
and
advance
rapidly
towards
the
lower
portion
of
the
town
,
just
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
fell
under
the
fire
from
the
houses
,
which
must
have
been
full
of
Englishmen
,
but
one
line
after
another
reached
the
buildings
.
<EOS>
The
firing
was
now
heavier
than
ever
--
absolutely
incessant
and
continuous
--
though
,
except
for
an
occasional
discharge
from
beyond
Heybridge
,
the
artillery
was
silent
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
but
<EOS>
little
knowledge
of
military
matters
,
but
it
was
abundantly
evident
,
even
to
me
,
that
what
I
had
just
seen
was
a
very
formidable
counter
-
attack
on
the
part
of
the
Germans
,
who
had
brought
up
fresh
troops
either
from
the
rear
of
the
town
or
from
farther
inland
,
and
launched
them
against
the
English
under
cover
of
the
railway
embankment
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
able
to
see
the
end
of
the
encounter
,
but
bad
news
flies
apace
,
and
it
soon
became
common
knowledge
in
the
town
that
our
troops
from
Colchester
had
not
only
failed
to
cross
the
river
at
any
point
,
but
had
been
driven
helter
-
skelter
out
of
the
lower
town
near
the
station
and
from
the
smoking
ruins
of
Heybridge
with
great
loss
,
and
were
now
in
full
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
some
hundreds
of
our
khaki
-
clad
fellow
-
countrymen
were
marched
through
the
town
an
hour
or
two
later
as
prisoners
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
numbers
of
wounded
,
who
,
together
with
those
belonging
to
the
Germans
,
soon
began
to
crowd
every
available
building
suitable
for
use
as
an
hospital
.
<EOS>
The
wounded
prisoners
with
their
escort
went
off
towards
Mundon
,
and
are
reported
to
have
gone
in
the
direction
of
Steeple
.
<EOS>
It
was
altogether
a
disastrous
day
,
and
our
hopes
,
which
had
begun
to
rise
when
the
British
had
penetrated
into
the
northern
part
of
the
town
,
now
fell
below
zero
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
black
day
for
us
,
and
for
England
.
<EOS>
During
the
morning
the
same
officer
who
had
captured
me
on
the
golf
course
came
whirling
into
Maldon
on
a
24-h.p
.
<EOS>
Mercedes
car
.
<EOS>
He
drove
straight
up
to
my
house
,
and
informed
me
that
he
had
orders
to
conduct
me
to
Prince
Henry
,
who
was
to
be
at
Purleigh
early
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Was
it
in
connection
with
the
skirmish
with
the
Volunteers
?
'
<EOS>
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
I
do
n't
know
,
'
was
the
reply
.
'
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
fancy
so
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
could
I
write
here
for
an
hour
or
two
?
'
<EOS>
he
asked
politely
.
'
<EOS>
I
have
much
to
write
to
my
friends
in
Germany
,
and
have
not
had
a
minute
up
to
now
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
very
glad
to
be
able
to
oblige
the
young
man
in
such
a
small
way
,
and
left
him
in
my
study
till
midday
,
very
busy
with
pens
,
ink
,
and
paper
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
a
makeshift
of
a
lunch
,
the
car
came
round
,
and
we
got
into
the
back
seat
.
<EOS>
In
front
sat
his
orderly
and
the
chauffeur
,
a
fierce
-
looking
personage
in
a
semi
-
military
uniform
.
<EOS>
We
ran
swiftly
down
the
High
Street
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
spinning
along
the
Purleigh
Road
,
where
I
saw
much
that
amazed
me
.
<EOS>
I
then
for
the
first
time
realised
how
absolutely
complete
were
the
German
plans
.

TUESDAY
,
_
September
4
_
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
six
o'clock
this
morning
I
awoke
rather
suddenly
.
<EOS>
The
wind
had
gone
round
to
the
northward
,
and
I
was
certain
that
heavy
firing
was
going
on
somewhere
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
I
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
.
<EOS>
The
'
thud
'
and
rumble
of
a
cannonade
,
with
the
accompaniment
of
an
occasional
burst
of
musketry
,
came
clearly
and
loudly
on
the
wind
from
the
hills
by
Wickham
Bishops
village
.
<EOS>
The
church
spire
was
in
plain
view
,
and
little
faint
puffs
and
rings
of
grey
smoke
were
just
visible
in
its
vicinity
every
now
and
again
,
sometimes
high
up
in
the
air
,
at
others
among
the
trees
at
its
base
.
<EOS>
They
were
exploding
shells
;
I
had
no
doubt
of
that
.
<EOS>
What
was
going
on
it
was
impossible
to
say
,
but
I
conjectured
that
some
of
our
troops
from
Colchester
had
come
into
collision
with
the
Germans
,
who
had
gone
out
in
that
direction
the
day
of
their
arrival
.
<EOS>
The
firing
continued
for
about
an
hour
,
and
then
died
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Soon
after
eight
,
Count
von
Ohrendorff
,
the
general
officer
commanding
the
32nd
Division
,
who
appeared
to
be
the
supreme
authority
here
,
sent
for
me
,
and
suggested
that
I
should
take
steps
to
arrange
for
the
manufacture
of
lint
and
bandages
by
the
ladies
living
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
no
reason
for
objecting
to
this
,
and
so
promised
to
carry
out
his
suggestion
.
<EOS>
I
set
about
the
matter
at
once
,
and
,
with
the
assistance
of
my
wife
,
soon
had
a
couple
of
score
of
more
or
less
willing
workers
busily
engaged
in
the
National
Schoolroom
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
roll
of
a
terrible
cannonade
had
burst
forth
again
from
Wickham
Bishops
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
louder
and
more
insistent
than
ever
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
got
away
from
the
schools
I
hurried
home
and
climbed
out
on
the
roof
.
<EOS>
The
top
of
the
Moot
Hall
and
other
coigns
of
vantage
had
all
been
occupied
by
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
However
,
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
field
-
glasses
<EOS>
I
was
able
to
see
a
good
bit
.
<EOS>
Black
smoke
was
now
pouring
from
Wickham
Bishops
in
clouds
,
and
every
now
and
again
I
fancied
I
could
see
the
forked
tongues
of
flame
shooting
up
above
the
surrounding
trees
.
<EOS>
A
series
of
scattered
black
dots
now
came
out
on
the
open
ground
to
the
south
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
The
trees
of
Eastland
Wood
soon
hid
them
from
my
sight
,
but
others
followed
,
mingled
with
little
moving
black
blocks
which
I
took
to
be
formed
bodies
of
troops
.
<EOS>
After
them
came
four
or
five
guns
,
driven
at
breakneck
pace
towards
the
road
that
passes
between
Eastland
and
Captain
's
Woods
,
then
more
black
dots
,
also
in
a
desperate
hurry
.
<EOS>
Several
of
these
last
tumbled
,
and
lay
still
here
<EOS>
and
there
all
over
the
slope
.
 
<EOS>
"
Other
dots
followed
at
their
heels
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
quite
so
distinct
.
<EOS>
I
looked
harder
.
<EOS>
Hurrah
!
<EOS>
They
were
men
in
khaki
.
<EOS>
We
were
hustling
these
Germans
at
last
.
<EOS>
They
also
disappeared
behind
the
woods
.
<EOS>
Then
from
the
fringe
of
trees
about
Wickham
half
a
dozen
big
brilliant
flashes
,
followed
after
an
interval
by
the
loud
detonation
of
heavy
cannon
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
distinguish
much
more
,
though
the
rattle
of
battle
went
on
for
some
time
longer
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
eleven
four
German
guns
galloped
in
from
Heybridge
.
<EOS>
These
were
followed
by
a
procession
of
maimed
and
limping
humanity
.
<EOS>
Some
managed
to
get
along
unaided
,
though
with
considerable
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Others
were
supported
by
a
comrade
,
some
carried
between
two
men
,
and
others
borne
along
on
stretchers
.
<EOS>
A
couple
of
ambulance
carts
trotted
out
and
picked
up
more
wounded
.
<EOS>
Our
bandages
and
lint
had
not
long
to
wait
before
being
required
.
<EOS>
After
this
there
was
a
cessation
of
firing
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
one
o'clock
the
German
general
sent
word
to
me
that
he
thought
an
attack
quite
possible
during
the
afternoon
,
and
that
he
strongly
advised
me
to
get
all
the
women
and
children
out
of
the
town
--
for
the
time
being
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
This
was
evidently
well
meant
,
but
it
was
a
pretty
difficult
matter
to
arrange
for
,
to
say
nothing
of
raising
a
panic
among
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
However
,
in
an
hour
and
a
half
's
time
I
had
contrived
to
marshal
several
hundred
of
them
together
,
and
to
get
them
out
on
the
road
to
Mundon
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
warm
for
the
time
of
the
year
,
and
I
thought
,
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
,
they
could
spend
the
night
in
the
old
church
.
<EOS>
I
left
the
sad
little
column
of
exiles
--
old
,
bent
women
helped
along
by
their
daughters
,
tiny
children
dragged
along
through
the
dust
,
clutching
their
mothers
'
skirts
;
infants
in
arms
;
and
other
older
and
sturdier
children
staggering
beneath
the
weight
of
the
most
precious
home
adornments
--
and
made
the
best
of
my
way
back
to
arrange
for
the
forwarding
to
them
of
their
rations
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
every
step
on
my
homeward
way
I
expected
to
hear
the
cannonade
begin
again
.
<EOS>
But
beyond
the
twittering
of
the
birds
in
the
trees
and
hedgerows
,
the
creak
and
rumble
of
a
passing
cart
,
and
the
rush
of
a
train
along
the
railway
on
my
left
--
just
the
usual
sounds
of
the
countryside
--
nothing
broke
the
stillness
.
<EOS>
As
I
stepped
out
on
the
familiar
highway
,
I
could
almost
bring
myself
to
believe
that
the
events
of
the
past
twenty
-
four
hours
were
but
the
phantasmagoria
of
a
dream
.
<EOS>
After
interviewing
some
of
the
town
councillors
who
were
going
to
undertake
the
transport
of
provisions
to
the
women
and
children
at
Mundon
,
I
walked
round
to
my
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
wife
and
family
had
driven
over
to
Purleigh
on
the
first
alarm
,
and
had
arranged
to
stay
the
night
with
some
friends
,
on
whatever
shake
-
downs
could
be
improvised
,
since
every
house
in
the
peninsula
harboured
some
of
the
ubiquitous
German
officers
and
men
.
<EOS>
I
wandered
through
the
familiar
rooms
,
and
came
out
into
the
garden
,
or
rather
,
what
had
been
the
garden
.
<EOS>
There
I
saw
that
the
Saxon
gunners
were
all
standing
to
their
pieces
,
and
one
of
my
none
too
welcome
<EOS>
guests
accosted
me
as
I
left
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
If
you
'll
take
my
advice
,
sare
,
you
'll
get
away
out
of
this
,
'
he
said
in
broken
English
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
What
!
<EOS>
are
you
going
to
fire
?
'
<EOS>
I
asked
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
I
do
n't
fancy
so
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
hurt
you
if
we
were
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
your
English
friends
from
Colchester
are
about
to
see
if
they
can
draw
us
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
As
he
spoke
I
became
aware
of
a
sharp
,
hissing
noise
like
a
train
letting
off
steam
.
<EOS>
It
grew
louder
and
nearer
,
passed
over
our
heads
,
and
was
almost
instantly
followed
by
a
terrible
crash
somewhere
behind
the
house
.
<EOS>
A
deeper
and
more
muffled
report
came
up
from
the
valley
beyond
Heybridge
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Well
,
they
've
begun
now
,
and
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
get
down
into
that
gun
epaulment
there
,
'
said
the
German
officer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
his
advice
was
good
,
and
I
lost
no
time
in
following
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Here
comes
another
!
'
<EOS>
cried
he
,
as
he
jumped
down
into
the
pit
beside
me
.
'
<EOS>
We
'll
have
plenty
of
them
now
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
So
we
did
.
<EOS>
Shell
after
shell
came
hissing
and
screaming
at
us
over
the
tree
-
tops
in
the
gardens
lower
down
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Each
one
of
them
sounded
to
me
as
if
it
were
coming
directly
at
my
head
,
but
one
after
another
passed
over
us
to
burst
beyond
.
<EOS>
The
gunners
all
crouched
close
to
the
earthen
parapet
--
and
so
did
I.
<EOS>
I
am
not
ashamed
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
My
German
officer
,
however
,
occasionally
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
embankment
and
studied
the
prospect
through
his
field
-
glasses
.
<EOS>
At
length
there
was
a
loud
detonation
,
and
a
column
of
dirt
and
smoke
in
the
garden
next
below
us
.
<EOS>
Then
two
shells
struck
the
parapet
of
the
gun
-
pit
on
our
left
almost
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
Their
explosion
was
deafening
,
and
we
were
covered
with
the
dust
and
stones
they
threw
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Immediately
afterwards
another
shell
passed
so
close
over
our
heads
that
I
felt
my
hair
lift
.
<EOS>
It
just
cleared
the
parapet
and
plunged
into
the
side
of
my
house
.
<EOS>
A
big
hole
appeared
just
to
the
right
of
the
dining
-
room
window
,
and
through
it
came
instantaneously
the
loud
bang
of
the
explosion
.
<EOS>
The
glass
was
shattered
in
all
the
windows
,
and
thick
smoke
,
white
and
black
,
came
curling
from
every
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
The
house
is
on
fire
!
'
<EOS>
I
shouted
,
and
sprang
madly
from
the
pit
.
<EOS>
Heedless
of
the
bombardment
,
I
rushed
into
the
building
.
<EOS>
Another
crash
sounded
overhead
as
I
entered
,
and
a
blaze
of
light
shone
down
the
stairway
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Another
projectile
had
found
a
billet
in
my
home
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
make
my
way
to
my
study
,
but
found
the
passage
blocked
with
fallen
beams
and
ceiling
.
<EOS>
What
with
the
smoke
and
dust
,
and
the
blocking
of
some
of
the
windows
,
it
was
very
dark
in
the
hall
,
and
I
got
quite
a
shock
when
,
as
I
looked
about
me
to
find
my
way
,
I
saw
two
red
,
glittering
specks
shining
over
the
top
of
a
heap
of
debris
.
<EOS>
But
the
howl
that
followed
told
me
that
they
were
nothing
but
the
eyes
of
miserable
Tim
,
the
cat
,
who
,
left
behind
,
had
been
nearly
frightened
out
of
his
senses
by
the
noise
and
concussion
of
the
bursting
shell
.
<EOS>
As
I
gazed
at
him
another
projectile
struck
the
house
quite
close
to
us
.
<EOS>
Tim
was
simply
smashed
by
a
flying
fragment
.
<EOS>
I
was
thrown
down
,
and
half
-
buried
under
a
shower
of
bricks
and
mortar
.
<EOS>
I
think
that
I
must
have
lost
consciousness
for
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
next
thing
I
recollect
was
being
dragged
out
into
the
garden
by
a
couple
of
Saxons
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
splitting
headache
,
and
was
very
glad
of
a
glass
of
water
that
one
of
them
handed
to
me
.
<EOS>
Their
officer
,
who
appeared
to
be
quite
a
decent
fellow
,
offered
me
his
flask
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
The
house
is
all
right
,
'
he
said
,
with
his
strong
accent
.
'
<EOS>
It
caught
fire
once
,
but
we
managed
to
get
it
under
.
<EOS>
Your
friends
have
cleared
off
--
at
any
rate
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
They
got
too
bold
at
last
,
and
pushed
their
guns
down
till
they
got
taken
in
the
flank
by
the
warship
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
They
had
two
of
their
pieces
knocked
to
bits
,
and
then
cleared
out
.
<EOS>
Best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
do
the
same
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
two
minds
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
save
the
house
by
staying
,
and
might
just
as
well
join
my
people
at
Purleigh
Rectory
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
I
felt
that
it
would
better
become
me
,
as
Mayor
,
to
stick
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
Duty
triumphed
,
and
I
decided
to
remain
where
I
was
--
at
least
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
All
was
now
quiet
,
and
after
an
early
supper
I
turned
in
,
and
,
despite
the
excitement
of
the
day
and
my
aching
head
,
was
asleep
the
moment
I
touched
the
pillow
.
"
     
<EOS>
"
WEDNESDAY
,
_
September
5
<EOS>
_
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
have
been
about
three
in
the
morning
when
I
awoke
.
<EOS>
My
head
was
much
better
,
and
for
a
minute
or
two
I
lay
comfortably
in
the
darkness
,
without
any
recollection
of
the
events
of
the
preceding
day
.
<EOS>
Then
I
saw
a
bright
reflection
pass
rapidly
over
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
vaguely
what
it
was
.
<EOS>
Presently
it
came
back
again
,
paused
a
moment
,
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
I
was
wide
awake
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
dark
,
but
from
somewhere
over
beyond
Heybridge
a
long
white
ray
was
sweeping
all
along
this
side
of
Maldon
.
<EOS>
Now
the
foliage
of
a
tree
in
the
garden
below
would
stand
out
in
pale
green
radiance
against
the
blackness
;
now
the
wall
of
a
house
half
a
mile
away
would
reflect
back
the
moving
beam
,
shining
white
as
a
sheet
of
notepaper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Presently
another
ray
shone
out
,
and
the
two
of
them
,
moving
backwards
and
forwards
,
made
the
whole
of
our
hillside
caper
in
a
dizzy
dance
.
<EOS>
From
somewhere
far
away
to
my
right
<EOS>
another
stronger
beam
now
streamed
through
the
obscurity
,
directed
apparently
at
the
sources
of
the
other
two
,
and
almost
simultaneously
came
the
crack
of
a
rifle
from
the
direction
of
Heybridge
,
sharp
and
ominous
in
the
quiet
darkness
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Half
a
dozen
scattered
shots
followed
;
then
a
faint
cheer
.
<EOS>
More
and
more
rifles
joined
in
,
and
presently
the
burring
tap
-
tap
-
tap
of
a
Maxim
.
<EOS>
I
hurried
on
my
clothes
.
<EOS>
The
firing
increased
in
volume
and
rapidity
;
bugles
rang
out
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
through
the
sleeping
town
,
and
above
the
rolling
,
rattling
clamour
of
the
drums
I
could
distinguish
the
hurried
tramp
of
hundreds
of
feet
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
cast
one
glance
from
the
window
as
I
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
electric
searchlights
had
increased
to
at
least
half
a
dozen
.
<EOS>
Some
reached
out
long
,
steady
fingers
into
the
vague
spaces
of
the
night
,
while
others
wandered
restlessly
up
and
down
,
hither
and
thither
.
<EOS>
Low
down
over
the
trees
of
the
garden
a
dull
red
glare
slowly
increased
in
extent
and
intensity
.
<EOS>
The
rattle
of
musketry
was
now
absolutely
continuous
.
<EOS>
As
I
ran
out
of
the
house
into
the
street
,
I
was
nearly
carried
off
my
feet
by
the
rush
of
a
battalion
that
was
pouring
down
Cromwell
Hill
at
the
double
.
<EOS>
Hardly
knowing
what
I
did
,
I
followed
in
their
wake
.
<EOS>
The
glare
in
front
got
brighter
and
brighter
.
<EOS>
A
few
steps
,
and
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
Heybridge
appeared
to
be
on
fire
,
the
flames
roaring
skywards
from
a
dozen
different
conflagrations
.
"
 
<EOS>
England
halted
breathless
.
<EOS>
Fighting
had
commenced
in
real
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
The
greatest
consternation
was
caused
by
the
publication
in
the
"
Times
"
of
the
description
of
the
operations
in
Essex
,
written
by
Mr.
Henry
Bentley
,
the
distinguished
war
correspondent
,
who
had
served
that
journal
in
every
campaign
since
Kitchener
had
entered
Khartum
.
 
<EOS>
All
other
papers
,
without
exception
,
contained
various
accounts
of
the
British
defence
at
the
point
nearest
London
,
but
they
were
mostly
of
the
scrappy
and
sensational
order
,
based
more
on
report
than
upon
actual
fact
.
<EOS>
The
"
Times
"
account
,
however
,
had
been
written
with
calm
impartiality
by
one

Whether
he
had
been
afforded
any
special
facilities
was
not
apparent
,
but
,
in
any
case
,
it
was
the
most
complete
and
truthful
account
of
the
gallant
attempt
on
the
part
of
our
soldiers
to
check
the
advance
from
Essex
westward

<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
that
hot
,
stifling
day
it
was
known
that
a
battle
was
raging
,
and
the
excitement
everywhere
was
intense
.
 
<EOS>
The
public
were
in
anxious
terror
as
the
hours
crept
by
,
until
the
first
authentic
news

was
printed

"
To
-
day
has
been
a
momentous
one
for
England
.
<EOS>
The
great
battle
has
raged
since
dawn
,
and
though
just
at
present
there
seems
to
be
a
lull
,
during
which
the
opposing
forces
are
,
so
to
speak
,
regaining
their
breath
,
it
can
be
by
no
means
over
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dead
and
living
alike
will
lie
out
on
the
battlefield
the
whole
night
through
,
for
we
must
hold
on
to
the
positions
so
hardly
won
,
and
be
ready
to
press
forward
at
the
first
glimmer
of
daylight
.
<EOS>
Our
gallant
troops
,
Regular
and
Volunteers
alike
,
have
nobly
vindicated
the
traditions
of
our
race
,
and
have
fought
as
desperately
as
ever
did
their
forebears
at
Agincourt
,
Albuera
,
or
Waterloo
.
<EOS>
But
while
a
considerable
success
--
paid
for
,
alas
!
<EOS>
by
the
loss
of
thousands
of
gallant
lives
--
has
been
achieved
,
it
will
take
at
least
another
day
's
hard
fighting
before
victory
is
in
our
grasp
.
<EOS>
Nowadays
a
soldier
need
not
expect
to
be
either
victorious
or
finally
defeated
by
nightfall
,
and
although
this
battle
,
fought
as
it
is
between
much
smaller
forces
,
and
extending
over
a
much
more
limited
area
,
than
the
great
engagement
between
the
Russians
and
Japanese
at
Liaoyang
,
will
not
take
quite
so
long
a
time
to
decide
<EOS>
,
the
end
is
not
yet
in
sight
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
this
after
a
hard
day
's
travelling
backwards
and
forwards
behind
our
advancing
line
of
battle
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
took
my
cycle
with
me
in
my
motor
-
car
,
and
whenever
opportunity
offered
mounted
it
,
and
pushed
forward
as
near
to
the
fighting
as
I
could
get
.
<EOS>
Frequently
I
had
to
leave
the
cycle
also
,
and
crawl
forward
on
hands
and
knees
,
sheltering
in
some
depression
in
the
ground
,
while
the
enemy
's
bullets
whined
and
whistled
overhead
.
<EOS>
As
reported
in
a
previous
issue
,
the
Army
which
had
assembled
at
Brentwood
moved
forward
on
the
5th
.
 
<EOS>
"
During
the
afternoon
the
advanced
troops
succeeded
in
driving
the
enemy
out
of
South
Hanningfield
,
and
before
sundown
they
were
also
in
full
retreat
from
the
positions
they
had
held
at
East
Hanningfield
and
Danbury
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
stiff
fighting
at
the
latter
place
,
but
after
a
pounding
from
the
artillery
,
who
brought
several
batteries
into
action
on
the
high
ground
north
-
west
of
East
Hanningfield
,
the
Germans
were
unable
to
withstand
the
attack
of
the
Argyll
and
Sutherlands
and
the
London
Scottish
,
who
worked
their
way
through
Danbury
Park
and
Hall
Wood
<EOS>
right
into
their
position
,
driving
them
from
their
entrenchments
by
a
dashing
bayonet
charge
.
<EOS>
Everything
north
and
east
of
the
enemy
's
main
position
,
which
is
now
known
to
lie
north
and
south
,
between
Maldon
and
the
river
Crouch
,
was
now
in
our
hands
,
but
his
troops
still
showed
a
stout
front
at
Wickford
,
and
were
also
reported
to
be
at
Rayleigh
,
Hockley
,
and
Canewdon
,
several
miles
to
the
eastward
.
<EOS>
All
preparations
were
made
to
assault
the
German
position
at
Wickford
at
daybreak
to
-
day
,
but
our
scouts
found
that
the
place
had
been
evacuated
.
<EOS>
The
news
that
Rayleigh
and
Hockley
had
also
been
abandoned
by
the
enemy
came
in
shortly
afterwards
.
<EOS>
The
German
invaders
had
evidently
completed
their
arrangements
for
the
defence
of
their
main
position
,
and
now
said
,
in
effect
,
'
Come
on
,
and
turn
us
out
if
you
can
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
no
easy
task
that
lay
before
our
gallant
defenders
.
<EOS>
Maldon
,
perched
on
a
high
knoll
,
with
a
network
of
river
and
canal
protecting
it
from
assault
from
the
northward
,
fairly
bristles
with
guns
,
many
of
them
heavy
field
howitzers
,
and
has
,
as
we
know
to
our
cost
,
already
repulsed
one
attack
by
our
troops
.
<EOS>
Farther
south
there
are
said
to
be
many
guns
on
the
knolls
about
Purleigh
.
<EOS>
Great
Canney
Hill
,
standing
boldly
up
like
an
immense
redoubt
,
is
reported
to
be
seamed
with
entrenchments
mounting
many
heavy
guns
.
<EOS>
The
railway
embankment
south
of
Maldon
forms
a
perfect
natural
rampart
along
part
of
the
enemy
's
position
,
while
the
woods
and
enclosures
south
-
west
of
Great
Canney
conceal
thousands
of
sharpshooters
.
<EOS>
A
sort
of
advanced
position
was
occupied
by
the
enemy
at
Edwin
Hall
,
a
mile
east
of
Woodham
Ferrers
,
where
a
pair
of
high
kopjes
a
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
offered
command
and
cover
to
some
of
their
field
batteries
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
scouts
have
discovered
also
that
an
elaborate
system
of
wire
entanglements
and
other
military
obstacles
protects
almost
the
whole
front
of
the
somewhat
extensive
German
position
.
<EOS>
On
its
extreme
left
their
line
is
said
to
be
thrown
back
at
an
angle
,
so
that
any
attempt
to
outflank
it
would
not
only
entail
crossing
the
river
Crouch
,
but
would
come
under
the
fire
of
batteries
placed
on
the
high
ground
overlooking
it
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
it
is
a
very
tough
nut
to
crack
,
and
the
force
at
our
disposal
none
too
strong
for
the
work
that
lies
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Further
detail
regarding
our
strength
would
be
inadvisable
for
obvious
reasons
,
but
when
I
point
out
that
the
Germans
are
supposed
to
be
between
thirty
and
forty
thousand
strong
,
and
that
it
is
laid
down
by
competent
military
authorities
that
to
attack
troops
in
an
entrenched
position
a
superiority
of
six
to
one
is
advisable
,
my
readers
can
draw
their
own
conclusions
.

The
repairs
to
the
railway
line
between
Brentwood
and
Chelmsford
,
that
had
been
damaged
by
the
enemy
's
cavalry
on
their
first
landing
,
were
completed
yesterday
,
and
all
night
reinforcements
had
been
coming
in
by
way
of
Chelmsford
and
Billericay
.
<EOS>
The
general
headquarters
had
been
established
at
Danbury
,
and
,
thither
I
made
my
way
as
fast
as
my
car
could
get
along
the
roads
,
blocked
as
they
were
by
marching
horse
,
foot
,
and
artillery
.
<EOS>
I
had
spent
the
night
at
South
Hanningfield
,
so
as
to
be
on
the
spot
for
the
expected
attack
on
Wickford
;
but
as
soon
as
I
found
it
was
not
to
come
off
,
I
considered
that
at
Danbury
would
be
the
best
chance
of
finding
out
what
our
next
move
was
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nor
was
I
mistaken
.
<EOS>
As
I
ran
up
to
the
village
I
found
the
roads
full
of
troops
under
arms
,
and
everything
denoted
action
of
some
kind
.
<EOS>
I
was
lucky
enough
to
come
across
a
friend
of
mine
on
the
staff
--
<EOS>
Captain
B----
,
I
will
call
him
--
who
spared
a
moment
to
give
me
the
tip
that
a
general
move
forward
was
commencing
,
and
that
a
big
battle
was
imminent
.
<EOS>
Danbury
is
situated
on
the
highest
ground
for
many
miles
round
,
and
as
it
bid
fair
to
be
a
fine
,
clear
day
,
I
thought
I
could
not
do
better
than
try
and
get
a
general
look
round
from
the
summit
of
the
church
tower
before
proceeding
farther
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
informed
that
the
General
was
up
there
with
some
of
his
staff
and
a
signalling
party
,
so
that
I
could
not
ascend
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
pass
,
however
,
eventually
procured
me
admission
to
the
little
platform
,
which
,
by
the
way
,
the
General
left
a
moment
after
my
arrival
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
eight
o'clock
,
the
sun
was
fairly
high
in
the
heavens
,
and
the
light
mists
that
hung
about
the
low
ground
in
the
vicinity
of
Maldon
were
fast
fading
into
nothingness
.
<EOS>
The
old
town
was
plainly
distinguishable
as
a
dark
silhouette
against
the
morning
light
,
<EOS>
which
,
while
it
illumined
the
panorama
spread
out
before
me
,
yet
rendered
observation
somewhat
difficult
,
since
it
shone
almost
directly
into
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
However
,
by
the
aid
of
my
glasses
I
was
able
to
see
something
of
the
first
moves
on
the
fatal
chess
-
board
where
so
many
thousands
of
lives
are
staked
on
the
bloody
game
of
war
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
noticed
among
other
things
that
the
lessons
of
the
recent
war
in
the
East
had
not
passed
unobserved
,
for
in
all
the
open
spaces
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
hill
,
where
the
roads
were
not
screened
by
trees
or
coppices
,
lofty
erections
of
hurdles
and
greenery
had
been
placed
overnight
to
hide
the
preliminary
movements
of
our
troops
from
the
glasses
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Under
cover
of
these
,
regiment
after
regiment
of
khaki
-
clad
soldiers
,
batteries
of
artillery
and
ammunition
carts
,
were
proceeding
to
their
allotted
posts
down
the
network
of
roads
and
lanes
leading
to
the
lower
ground
towards
the
south
-
east
.
<EOS>
Two
battalions
stood
in
quarter
column
behind
Thrift
Wood
.
<EOS>
They
were
kilted
corps
,
probably
the
Argylls
and
the
London
Scottish
.
<EOS>
Several
field
batteries
moved
off
to
the
left
towards
Woodham
Walter
.
<EOS>
Other
battalions
took
up
their
position
behind
Hyde
Woods
,
farther
away
to
the
right
,
the
last
of
them
,
the
Grenadier
Guards
,
I
fancy
,
passing
behind
them
and
marching
still
farther
southward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Finally
,
two
strong
battalions
,
easily
recognised
as
marines
by
their
blue
war
-
kit
,
marched
rapidly
down
the
main
road
and
halted
presently
behind
Woodham
Mortimer
Place
.
<EOS>
All
this
time
there
was
neither
sight
nor
sound
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
birds
carolled
gaily
in
the
old
elms
round
my
eyrie
,
the
sparrows
and
martins
piped
and
twittered
in
the
eaves
of
the
old
church
,
and
the
sun
shone
genially
on
hill
and
valley
,
field
and
wood
.
<EOS>
To
all
appearance
,
peace
reigned
over
the
countryside
,
though
the
dun
masses
of
troops
in
the
shadows
of
the
woodlands
were
suggestive
of
the
autumn
manoeuvres
.
<EOS>
But
for
all
this
the
'
Real
Thing
'
was
upon
us
.
<EOS>
As
I
looked
,
first
one
,
then
another
long
and
widely
scattered
line
of
crouching
men
in
khaki
issued
from
the
cover
of
Hyde
Woods
and
began
slowly
to
move
away
towards
the
east
.
<EOS>
Then
,
and
not
till
then
,
a
vivid
violet
-
white
flash
blazed
out
on
the
dim
grey
upland
five
miles
away
to
the
south
-
east
,
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
me
as
Great
Canney
,
and
almost
at
once
a
spout
of
earth
and
smoke
sprang
up
a
little
way
ahead
of
the
advancing
British
.
<EOS>
A
dull
boom
floated
up
on
the
breeze
,
but
was
drowned
in
an
ear
-
splitting
crash
somewhere
close
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
felt
the
old
tower
rock
under
the
concussion
,
which
I
presently
discovered
came
from
a
battery
of
at
least
six
big
4.7
guns
established
just
outside
the
churchyard
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
manned
by
a
party
of
bluejackets
,
who
had
brought
them
over
from
Chatham
.
<EOS>
The
movement
I
saw
developing
below
me
was
the
first
step
towards
what
I
eventually
discovered
was
our
main
objective
--
Purleigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Could
we
succeed
in
establishing
ourselves
there
,
we
should
be
beyond
effective
range
from
Maldon
,
and
should
also
take
Great
Canney
in
reverse
,
as
well
as
the
positions
on
the
refused
left
flank
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Maldon
,
too
,
would
be
isolated
.
<EOS>
Purleigh
,
therefore
,
was
the
key
of
the
position
.
<EOS>
Our
first
move
was
in
this
direction
.
<EOS>
The
scouts
were
picked
men
from
the
Line
battalions
,
but
the
firing
lines
were
composed
of
Volunteers
and
,
in
some
cases
,
Militiamen
.
<EOS>
It
was
considered
more
politic
to
reserve
the
Regulars
for
the
later
stages
of
the
attack
.
<EOS>
The
firing
from
Canney
,
and
afterwards
from
Purleigh
,
was
at
first
at
rather
too
long
a
range
to
be
effective
,
even
from
the
heavy
guns
that
were
in
use
,
and
later
on
the
heavy
long
-
range
fire
from
'
Bloody
Mary
'
and
her
sisters
at
Danbury
,
and
other
heavy
guns
and
howitzers
in
the
neighbourhood
of
East
Hanningfield
,
kept
it
down
considerably
,
although
the
big
,
high
-
explosive
shells
were
now
and
again
most
terribly
destructive
to
the
advancing
British
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
,
however
,
the
firing
line
--
which
as
yet
had
not
been
near
enough
to
fire
a
shot
in
reply
--
arrived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Loddard
's
Hill
,
its
left
came
under
a
terrible
rifle
fire
from
Hazeleigh
Wood
,
while
its
right
and
centre
were
all
but
destroyed
by
a
tornado
of
shrapnel
from
some
German
field
batteries
to
the
north
of
Purleigh
.
<EOS>
Though
dazed
and
staggered
under
the
appalling
sleet
of
projectiles
,
the
Volunteers
stuck
doggedly
to
their
ground
,
though
unable
to
advance
.
<EOS>
Line
after
line
was
pushed
forward
,
the
men
stumbling
and
falling
over
the
thickly
-
scattered
bodies
of
their
fallen
comrades
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
perfect
holocaust
.
<EOS>
Some
other
card
must
be
played
at
once
,
or
the
attack
must
fail
.

The

When

it
was

very

the

distinctly

with
which
to
commence
the
difficult
and
unpleasant
task
of
chronicling
the
downfall
of
all
our
high
hopes
,
the
repulse
--
ay
,
and
the
defeat
<EOS>
--
it
is
no
use
mincing
matters
--
of
our
heroic
and
sorely
tried
Army
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
our
gallant
soldiers
have
sustained
a
reverse
which
,
but
for
their
stubborn
fighting
qualities
and
a
somewhat
inexplicable
holding
back
on
the
part
of
the
Germans
,
might
very
easily
have
culminated
in
disaster
.
<EOS>
Defeat
<EOS>
although
it
undoubtedly
is
,
the
darkness
of
the
gloomy
outlook
is
illuminated
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
conduct
of
our
troops
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
General
down
to
the
youngest
Volunteer
drummer
boy
,
our
brave
soldiers
did
all
,
and
more
,
than
could
be
humanly
expected
of
them
,
and
on
none
of
them
can
be
laid
the
blame
of
our
ill
-
success
.
<EOS>
The
plan
of
attack
is
agreed
on
all
hands
to
have
been
as
good
<EOS>
a
one
as
could
have
been
evolved
;
the
officers
led
well
,
their
men
fought
well
,
and
there
was
no
running
short
of
ammunition
at
any
period
of
the
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Who
,
then
,
was
responsible
?
'
<EOS>
it
may
well
be
asked
.
<EOS>
The
answer
is
simple
.
<EOS>
The
British
public
,
which
,
in
its
apathetic
attitude
towards
military
efficiency
,
aided
and
abetted
by
the
soothing
theories
of
the
extremists
of
the
'
Blue
Water
'
school
,
had
,
as
usual
,
neglected
to
provide
an
Army
fitted
to
cope
in
numbers
and
efficiency
with
those
of
our
Continental
neighbours
.
<EOS>
Had
we
had
a
sufficiency
of
troops
,
more
especially
of
regular
troops
,
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
victory
would
have
been
ours
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
our
General
was
obliged
to
attack
the
enemy
's
position
with
a
force
whose
numbers
,
even
if
they
had
been
all
regular
soldiers
,
were
below
those
judged
necessary
by
military
experts
for
the
task
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Having
broken
through
the
German
lines
,
success
was
in
his
grasp
had
he
had
sufficient
reinforcements
to
have
established
him
in
the
position
he
had
won
,
and
to
beat
back
the
inevitable
counter
-
attack
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
best
that
I
should
continue
my
account
of
the
fighting
from
the
point
at
which
I
closed
my
letter
of
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
had
arrived
at
the
checking
of
our
advance
near
Loddard
's
Hill
by
the
blast
of
shrapnel
from
the
German
field
batteries
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
that
the
Volunteer
Brigade
,
though
it
held
its
ground
,
could
not
advance
farther
.
<EOS>
But
,
unnoticed
by
them
,
the
General
had
been
preparing
for
this
eventuality
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
the
left
the
two
battalions
of
Marines
that
I
noticed
drawn
up
behind
Woodham
Mortimer
Place
suddenly
debouched
on
Loddard
's
Hill
,
and
,
carrying
forward
with
them
the
debris
of
the
Volunteer
firing
line
,
hurled
themselves
into
Hazeleigh
Wood
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
sanguinary
hand
-
to
-
hand
struggle
on
the
wire
-
entangled
border
,
but
the
newcomers
were
not
to
be
denied
,
and
,
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
desperate
melee
,
which
filled
the
sylvan
glades
with
moaning
and
writhing
wounded
and
stark
dead
bodies
,
we
remained
masters
of
the
wood
,
and
even
obtained
a
footing
on
the
railway
line
where
it
adjoins
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Simultaneously
a
long
line
of
our
field
batteries
came
into
action
near
Woodham
Mortimer
,
some
trying
to
beat
down
the
fire
of
the
German
guns
opposite
,
while
others
replied
to
a
battery
which
had
been
established
near
West
Maldon
Station
to
flank
the
railway
,
and
which
was
now
beginning
to
open
on
Hazeleigh
Wood
.
<EOS>
The
latter
were
assisted
by
a
battery
of
4.7
guns
manned
by
Volunteers
,
which
took
up
a
position
behind
Woodham
Walter
.
<EOS>
The
firing
on
Great
Canney
from
our
batteries
at
East
Hanningfield
redoubled
,
the
whole
summit
of
the
hill
being
at
times
obscured
by
the
clouds
of
smoke
and
debris
from
the
explosions
of
the
big
,
high
-
explosive
projectiles
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
main
firing
line
,
continually
fed
from
the
rear
,
now
began
slowly
to
gain
ground
,
and
when
the
Grenadiers
and
the
Irish
Guards
,
who
had
managed
to
work
up
through
the
series
of
plantations
that
run
eastwards
for
nearly
two
miles
from
Woodham
Hall
without
drawing
any
particular
attention
from
the
busily
engaged
enemy
,
came
into
action
on
the
right
,
there
was
a
distinct
move
forward
.
<EOS>
But
the
defence
was
too
stubborn
,
and
about
midday
the
whole
line
again
came
to
a
standstill
,
its
left
still
in
Hazeleigh
Wood
,
its
right
at
Prentice
Farm
.
<EOS>
Orders
were
passed
that
the
men
should
try
to
entrench
themselves
as
best
they
could
,
and
spades
and
other
tools
were
sent
forward
to
those
corps
who
were
not
provided
with
them
already
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
we
must
leave
the
main
attack
to
notice
what
was
going
on
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
On
the
north
the
Colchester
Garrison
again
brought
their
heavy
artillery
into
action
on
the
slopes
south
of
Wickham
Bishops
,
while
others
of
our
troops
made
a
show
of
advancing
against
Maldon
from
the
west
.
<EOS>
These
movements
were
,
however
,
merely
intended
to
keep
the
German
garrison
occupied
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
right
a
rather
important
flanking
movement
was
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
a
considerable
body
of
troops
at
East
Hanningfield
,
which
lies
in
a
hollow
between
two
little
ridges
,
both
running
from
south
-
west
to
north
-
east
,
and
about
a
mile
apart
.
<EOS>
The
most
easterly
ridge
is
very
narrow
for
the
most
part
,
and
behind
it
were
stationed
several
batteries
of
our
field
howitzers
,
which
fired
over
it
at
Great
Canney
at
a
range
of
about
5,000
yards
.
<EOS>
A
number
of
4.7-inch
guns
,
scattered
over
the
western
hill
,
were
also
concentrated
on
the
same
target
.
<EOS>
Although
the
range
was
an
extremely
long
one
,
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
made
a
certain
number
of
effective
hits
,
since
Great
Canney
offered
a
conspicuous
and
considerable
target
.
<EOS>
But
beyond
this
the
flashes
of
their
discharges
drew
off
all
attention
from
the
howitzer
batteries
in
front
of
them
,
and
served
to
conceal
their
presence
from
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
although
invisible
,
their
presence
would
have
been
guessed
at
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
not
a
single
German
projectile
came
anywhere
near
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
the
fighting
began
,
those
troops
who
were
not
intended
to
be
held
in
reserve
or
to
co
-
operate
with
the
right
of
the
main
attack
moved
off
in
the
direction
of
Woodham
Ferrers
,
and
made
a
feint
of
attacking
the
German
position
astride
the
two
kopjes
at
Edwin
's
Hall
,
their
field
guns
coming
into
action
on
the
high
ground
north
of
Rettendon
,
and
engaging
those
of
the
enemy
at
long
range
.
<EOS>
But
the
real
attack
on
this
salient
of
the
German
position
came
from
a
very
different
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
troops
detailed
for
this
movement
were
those
who
had
advanced
against
Wickford
at
daybreak
,
and
had
found
it
abandoned
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
consisted
of
the
Oxfordshire
Light
Infantry
,
the
Honourable
Artillery
Company
,
and
the
Inns
of
Court
Volunteers
,
together
with
their
own
and
three
or
four
other
machine
-
gun
detachments
,
their
Maxims
being
mounted
on
detachable
legs
instead
of
carriages
.
<EOS>
Co
-
operating
with
them
were
the
Essex
and
the
East
Kent
Yeomanry
,
who
were
scouting
in
the
direction
of
Hockley
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
troops
had
a
long
,
wearisome
march
before
them
,
the
design
being
to
take
advantage
of
the
time
of
low
tide
,
and
to
move
along
out
of
sight
of
the
enemy
behind
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
Crouch
,
as
it
had
been
discovered
that
the
German
line
of
defence
turned
back
to
the
eastward
at
a
mile
or
two
north
of
the
river
at
the
point
aimed
at
.
<EOS>
Its
guns
still
commanded
it
,
and
might
be
trusted
to
render
abortive
any
attempt
to
throw
a
bridge
across
it
.
<EOS>
The
Yeomanry
had
the
task
of
occupying
the
attention
of
the
enemy
at
Canewdon
,
and
of
preventing
the
passage
of
boats
from
the
German
warships
.
<EOS>
This
part
of
our
operations
succeeded
admirably
.
<EOS>
The
long
creeping
lines
of
the
Oxfordshires
and
the
machine
-
gun
detachments
in
their
khaki
uniforms
were
almost
indistinguishable
against
the
steep
mud
banks
at
any
distance
,
and
they
escaped
observation
both
from
the
German
main
lines
and
from
their
outpost
at
Canewdon
until
they
had
reached
the
entrances
of
the
two
branch
creeks
for
which
they
were
making
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
and
not
till
then
,
came
the
sound
of
artillery
from
the
left
rear
of
the
German
position
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
The
Oxford
companies
pushed
forward
at
the
double
.
<EOS>
Five
companies
lined
the
embankments
of
Stow
Creek
,
the
easternmost
of
the
two
,
while
the
remainder
,
ensconced
in
Clementsgreen
Creek
,
aligned
the
whole
of
their
machine
-
guns
on
the
southern
of
the
two
kopjes
against
which
the
manoeuvre
had
been
directed
.
<EOS>
Their
fire
,
which
,
coming
from
a
little
to
the
rear
of
the
left
flank
of
the
southern
kopje
,
completely
enfiladed
it
,
created
such
slaughter
and
confusion
that
the
Honourable
Artillery
Company
and
the
Inns
of
Court
,
who
had
been
working
up
the
railway
line
from
Battle
Bridge
,
had
little
difficulty
in
establishing
themselves
at
Woodham
Ferrers
Station
and
in
an
adjacent
farm
.
<EOS>
Being
almost
immediately
afterwards
reinforced
by
the
arrival
of
two
regular
battalions
who
had
been
pushed
forward
from
Rettendon
,
a
determined
assault
was
made
on
the
southern
kopje
.
<EOS>
Its
defenders
,
demoralised
by
the
pelting
shower
of
lead
from
the
machine
-
gun
battery
,
and
threatened
also
by
the
advance
from
Woodham
Ferrers
village
,
gave
way
,
and
our
people
,
forcing
their
way
over
every
obstacle
,
seized
the
position
amid
frantic
cheering
.
 
<EOS>
"
Meanwhile
the
Oxfordshires
had
been
subjected
to
a
determined
counter
-
attack
from
North
Frambridge
.
<EOS>
Preceded
by
a
pounding
from
the
guns
on
Kit
's
Hill
,
but
aided
by
the
fire
of
the
Yeomanry
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
,
who
galloped
up
and
lined
the
embankment
,
thus
flanking
the
defenders
of
Stow
Creek
,
it
was
beaten
back
with
considerable
loss
.
<EOS>
The
machine
-
guns
were
transferred
to
the
neighbourhood
of
South
Kopje
,
and
used
with
such
effect
that
its
defenders
,
after
repulsing
several
counter
-
attacks
from
the
adjoining
German
entrenchment
,
were
able
to
make
themselves
masters
of
the
North
Kopje
also
.
 
<EOS>
"
Elsewhere
the
fighting
still
continued
strenuous
and
deadly
.
<EOS>
The
main
attack
had
contrived
to
make
some
little
shelter
for
itself
;
but
though
three
several
attempts
were
made
to
advance
from
this
,
all
ended
in
failure
,
one
nearly
in
disaster
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
last
of
the
three
,
when
the
advancing
line
was
charged
by
a
mass
of
cavalry
which
suddenly
appeared
from
behind
Great
Canney
Hill
.
<EOS>
I
myself
was
a
witness
of
this
attack
,
the
most
picturesque
incident
of
the
day
's
fighting
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
watching
the
progress
of
the
engagement
through
my
glasses
from
the
high
ground
about
Wickham
's
Farm
,
when
I
saw
line
after
line
of
the
German
horsemen
in
their
sky
-
blue
tunics
and
glittering
helmets
trot
out
into
the
open
,
canter
,
and
one
after
another
break
into
a
mad
gallop
,
as
they
bore
down
upon
the
advancing
lines
of
our
citizen
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Staunchly
as
these
had
withstood
the
murderous
fire
which
for
hours
had
been
directed
upon
them
,
this
whirlwind
of
lance
and
sabre
,
the
thunder
of
thousands
of
hoofs
,
and
the
hoarse
cries
of
the
riders
,
were
rather
more
than
such
partially
trained
soldiers
could
stand
.
<EOS>
A
scattering
discharge
from
their
rifles
was
followed
by
something
very
much
approaching
a
_
sauve
qui
peut
_
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
large
number
of
Volunteers
,
however
,
sought
shelter
among
the
ruined
houses
of
Cock
Clarke
's
hamlet
,
from
whence
they
opened
a
heavy
fire
on
the
adventurous
horsemen
.
<EOS>
The
Argyll
and
Sutherland
Highlanders
,
who
were
by
this
time
in
Mosklyns
Copse
,
and
the
Guards
and
other
troops
on
the
right
,
also
opened
a
rapid
and
sustained
fire
on
the
German
cavalry
,
which
seconded
by
the
shrapnel
from
our
guns
on
Loddard
's
Hill
,
caused
them
to
turn
and
ride
back
for
their
lives
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
tremendous
outburst
of
firing
from
both
sides
after
this
,
followed
by
quite
a
lull
.
<EOS>
One
could
well
imagine
that
all
the
combatants
were
exhausted
by
the
prolonged
effort
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
between
five
and
six
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
this
time
that
the
news
of
the
capture
of
the
two
kopjes
reached
me
,
and
I
made
for
Danbury
to
write
my
despatches
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shortly
after
my
arrival
I
heard
of
the
capture
of
Spar
Hill
,
a
detached
knoll
about
1,200
yards
to
the
north
-
west
of
Purleigh
.
<EOS>
The
Marines
from
Hazeleigh
Wood
and
the
Highlanders
from
Mosklyns
Copse
had
suddenly
and
simultaneously
assaulted
it
from
opposite
sides
,
and
were
now
entrenching
themselves
upon
it
.
<EOS>
What
wonder
,
then
,
that
I
reported
satisfactory
progress
,
and
reckoned
--
too
confidently
,
as
it
proved
--
on
a
victory
for
the
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
spent
a
great
part
of
that
night
under
the
stars
on
the
hilltop
near
East
Hanningfield
,
watching
the
weird
play
of
the
searchlights
which
swept
over
the
country
from
a
score
of
different
positions
,
and
listening
to
the
crash
of
artillery
and
clatter
of
rifle
fire
which
now
and
again
told
of
some
attempted
movement
under
cover
of
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
Just
before
daylight
the
continuous
roar
of
battle
began
again
,
and
when
light
dawned
I
found
that
our
troops
had
cut
right
through
the
German
lines
,
and
had
penetrated
as
far
as
Cop
Kitchen
's
Farm
,
on
the
Maldon
-
Mundon
road
.
<EOS>
Reinforcements
were
being
hurried
up
,
and
an
attack
was
being
pushed
towards
the
rear
of
Purleigh
and
Great
Canney
,
which
was
being
heavily
bombarded
by
some
of
our
large
guns
,
which
had
been
mounted
during
the
night
on
the
two
kopjes
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
reinforcements
were
not
enough
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
held
fast
to
Purleigh
and
to
some
reserve
positions
they
had
established
about
Mundon
.
<EOS>
After
two
or
three
hours
of
desperate
effort
,
costing
the
lives
of
thousands
,
our
attack
was
at
a
standstill
.
<EOS>
At
this
critical
moment
a
powerful
counter
-
attack
was
made
from
Maldon
,
and
,
outnumbered
and
almost
surrounded
,
our
gallant
warriors
had
to
give
ground
.
<EOS>
But
they
fell
back
as
doggedly
as
they
had
advanced
,
the
Argylls
,
Marines
,
and
Grenadiers
covering
the
retreat
on
Danbury
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
guns
at
East
Hanningfield
and
the
two
kopjes
checked
the
pursuit
to
a
great
extent
,
and
the
Germans
seemed
unwilling
to
go
far
from
their
works
.
<EOS>
The
kopjes
had
to
be
abandoned
later
in
the
day
,
and
we
now
occupy
our
former
line
from
Danbury
to
Billericay
,
and
are
busily
engaged
in
entrenching
ourselves
.

CHAPTER

<EOS>
DEFENCE
AT
LAST
.
  
<EOS>
Late
on
Wednesday
night
came
tardy
news
of
the
measures
we
were
taking
to
mobilise
.
 
<EOS>
The
Aldershot
Army
Corps
,
so
complete
in
the
"
Army
List
,
"
<EOS>
consisted
,
as
all
the
world
knew
,
of
three
divisions
,
but
of
these
only
two
existed
,
the
other
being
found
to
be
on
paper
.
<EOS>
The
division
in
question
,
located
at
Bordon
,
was
to
be
formed
on
mobilisation
,
and
this
measure
was
now
being
proceeded
with
.
<EOS>
The
train
service
was
practically
suspended
,
owing
to
the
damage
done
to
the
various
lines
south
of
London
by
the
enemy
's
emissaries
.
<EOS>
Several
of
these
men
had
been
detected
,
and
,
being
in
plain
clothes
,
were
promptly
shot
out
of
hand
.
<EOS>
However
,
their
work
had
,
unfortunately
for
us
,
been
accomplished
,
and
trains
could
only
run
as
far
as
the
destroyed
bridges
,
so
men
on
their
way
to
join
their
respective
corps
were
greatly
delayed
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
All
was
confusion
at
Bordon
,
where
men
were
arriving
in
hundreds
on
foot
and
by
the
service
of
motor
omnibuses
,
which
the
War
Office
had
on
the
day
before
established
between
Charing
Cross
and
Aldershot
.
<EOS>
Perspiring
staff
officers
strove
diligently
,
without
much
avail
,
to
sort
out
into
their
respective
units
this
ever
-
increasing
mass
of
reservists
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
perfect
chaos
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
chief
constituent
parts
of
the
division
--
that
is
to
say
,
regiments
who
were
stationed
elsewhere
--
had
arrived
little
could
be
done
with
the
reservists
.
<EOS>
The
regiments
in
question
were
in
many
cases
stationed
at
considerable
distance
,
and
although
they
had
received
orders
to
start
,
were
prevented
from
arriving
owing
to
the
universal
interruptions
of
the
railway
traffic
south
.
<EOS>
By
this
,
whole
valuable
days
were
lost
--
days
when
at
any
hour
the
invaders
might
make
a
sudden
swoop
on
London
.
 
<EOS>
Reports
were
alarming
and
conflicting
.
<EOS>
Some
said
that
the
enemy
meant
to
strike
a
blow
upon
the
capital
just
as
suddenly
as
they
had
landed
,
while
others
reassured
the
alarmists
that
the
German
plans
were
not
yet
complete
,
and
that
they
had
not
sufficient
stores
to
pursue
the
campaign
.
 
<EOS>
Reservists
,
with
starvation
staring
them
in
the
face
,
went
eagerly
south
to
join
their
regiments
,
knowing
that
at
least
they
would
be
fed
with
regularity
;
while
,
in
addition
,
the
true
patriotic
spirit
of
the
Englishman
had
been
roused
against
the
aggressive
Teuton
,
and
everyone
,
officer
and
man
,
was
eager
to
bear
his
part
in
driving
the
invader
into
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
The
public
were
held
breathless
.
<EOS>
What
would
happen
?
 
<EOS>
Arrivals
at
Aldershot
,
however
,
found
the
whole
arrangements
in
such
a
complete
muddle
that
Army
Service
Corps
men
,
who
ought
to
have
been
at
Woolwich
,
were
presenting
themselves
for
enrolment
at
Bordon
,
and
infantry
of
the
line
were
conducted
into
the
camp
of
the
Dragoons
.
<EOS>
The
Motor
Volunteer
Corps
were
at
this
moment
of
very
great
use
.
<EOS>
The
cars
were
filled
with
staff
officers
and
other
exalted
officials
,
who
were
settling
themselves
in
various
offices
,
and
passing
out
again
to
make
necessary
arrangements
for
dealing
with
such
a
large
influx
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
activity
and
excitement
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Men
were
rapidly
drawing
their
clothing
,
or
as
much
of
it
as
they
could
get
,
and
civilians
were
quickly
becoming
soldiers
on
every
hand
.
<EOS>
Officers
of
the
Reserve
were
driving
up
in
motor
-
cars
and
cabs
,
many
of
them
with
their
old
battered
uniform
cases
,
that
had
seen
service
in
the
field
in
distant
parts
of
the
globe
.
<EOS>
Men
from
the
"
Junior
"
and
the
"
Senior
"
wrung
each
other
's
hands
on
returning
to
active
duty
with
their
old
regiments
,
and
at
once
settled
down
into
the
routine
work
they
knew
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
The
rumour
,
however
,
had
now
got
about
that
a
position
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Cambridge
had
been
selected
by
the
General
Staff
as
being
the
most
suitable
theatre
of
action
where
an
effective
stand
could
,
with
any
hope
of
success
,
be
made
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
the
German
tactics
were
to
strike
a
swift
and
rapid
blow
at
London
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
nothing
at
present
stood
in
their
way
except
the
gallant
little
garrison
at
Colchester
,
who
had
been
so
constantly
driven
back
by
the
enemy
's
cavalry
on
attempting
to
make
any
reconnaissance
,
and
who
might
be
swept
out
of
existence
at
any
hour
.

During
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
large
gangs
of
workmen
had
been
busy
repairing
the
damaged
lines
.
<EOS>
The
first
regiment
complete
for
the
field
was
the
2nd
Battalion
of
the
5th
Fusiliers
,
who
carried
upon
their
colours
the
names
of
a
score
of
battles
,
ranging
from
Corunna
and
Badajoz
,
all
through
the
Peninsula
,
Afghanistan
,
and
Egypt
,
down
to
the
Modder
River
.
<EOS>
This
regiment
left
by
train
for
London
on
Tuesday
evening
,
and
was
that
same
night
followed
by
the
2nd
Battalion
King
's
Liverpool
Regiment
and
the
1st
King
's
Shropshire
Light
Infantry
,
while
the
Manchester
Regiment
got
away
soon
after
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
These
formed
the
second
infantry
brigade
of
the
1st
Division
,
and
were
commanded
by
Brigadier
-
General
Sir
John
Money
.
<EOS>
They
were
several
hours
getting
up
to
London
,
whence
from
Clapham
Junction
their
trains
circled
London
on
to
the
Great
Eastern
system
to
Braintree
,
where
the
Horn
Hotel
was
made
the
headquarters
.
<EOS>
By
other
trains
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
the
last
of
the
Guards
Brigade
under
Colonel
(
temporary
Brigadier
-
General
)
<EOS>
Lord
Wansford
departed
,
and
duly
arrived
at
Saffron
Walden
,
to
join
their
comrades
on
the
line
of
defence
.
 
<EOS>
The
divisional
troops
were
also
on
the
move
early
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
Six
batteries
of
artillery
and
the
field
company
of
Royal
Engineers
left
by
road
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
balloon
section
accompanying
this
,
and
searchlights
,
wireless
instruments
,
and
cables
for
field
-
telegraphy
were
carried
in
the
waggons
.
 
<EOS>
The
2nd
Division
,
under
Lieutenant
-
General
Morgan
,
C.B.
,
was
also
active
.
<EOS>
The
3rd
Infantry
Brigade
,
commanded
by
Major
-
General
Fortescue
,
composed
of
2nd
Battalion
Northamptonshire
Regiment
,
the
2nd
Bedfordshire
,
the
1st
Princess
of
Wales
'
Own
,
and
the
1st
Royal
Welsh
Fusiliers
,
were
preparing
,
but
had
not
yet
moved
.
<EOS>
The
4th
Infantry
Brigade
of
the
same
division
,
consisting
of
the
3rd
and
4th
Battalions
King
's
Royal
Rifle
Corps
,
the
2nd
Sherwood
Foresters
,
and
the
2nd
South
Lancashire
,
with
the
usual
smartness
of
those
distinguished
regiments
,
were
quick
and
ready
,
now
as
ever
,
to
go
to
the
front
.
<EOS>
They
were
entrained
to
Baldock
,
slightly
east
of
Hitchin
,
where
they
marched
out
on
the
Icknield
Way
.
<EOS>
These
were
followed
by
Fortescue
's
Brigade
,
who
were
also
bound
for
Baldock
and
the
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
The
bulk
of
the
cavalry
and
field
artillery
of
both
divisions
,
together
with
the
divisional
troops
,
were
compelled
to
set
out
by
march
-
route
from
Aldershot
for
the
line
of
defences
.
<EOS>
The
single
and
all
-
sufficient
reason
of
this
delay
in
sending
out
the
cavalry
and
artillery
was
owing
to
the
totally
inadequate
accommodation
on
the
railways
for
the
transport
of
so
many
horses
and
guns
.
<EOS>
The
troop
-
trains
,
which
were
of
course
,
necessary
to
transport
the
infantry
,
were
not
forthcoming
in
sufficient
numbers
,
this
owing
to
the
fact
that
at
several
points
the
lines
to
London
were
still
interrupted
.
 
<EOS>
The
orders
to
the
cavalry
who
went
by
march
-
route
were
to
get
up
to
the
line
proposed
to
be
taken
up
by
the
infantry
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
to
operate
in
front
of
it
to
the
east
and
north
-
east
in
screening
and
reconnoitring
duties
.
<EOS>
The
temporary
deficiency
of
cavalry
,
who
ought
,
of
course
,
to
have
been
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
scene
,
was
made
good
as
far
as
possible
by
the
general
employment
of
hordes
of
motor
-
cyclists
,
who
scoured
the
country
in
large
armed
groups
,
in
order
to
ascertain
,
if
possible
,
the
dispositions
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
This
they
did
,
and
very
soon
after
their
arrival
reported
the
result
of
their
investigations
to
the
general
officers
commanding
the
1st
and
2nd
Divisions
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
both
cavalry
and
artillery
in
great
bodies
,
and
strings
of
motor
omnibuses
filled
with
troops
,
were
upon
the
white
,
dusty
roads
passing
through
Staines
to
Hounslow
and
Brentford
,
thence
to
London
,
St.
Albans
,
_
en
route
_
to
their
respective
divisions
.
<EOS>
Roughly
,
the
distance
was
over
fifty
miles
,
therefore
those
marching
were
compelled
to
halt
the
night
on
the
way
,
while
those
in
the
motor
omnibuses
got
through
to
their
destination
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
of
British
troops
hurrying
to
the
front
swelled
the
hearts
of
the
villagers
and
townsfolk
with
renewed
patriotism
,
and
everywhere
,
through
the
blazing
,
dusty
day
,
the
men
were
offered
refreshment
by
even
the
poorest
and
humblest
cottagers
.
<EOS>
In
Bagshot
,
in
Staines
,
and
in
Hounslow
the
people
went
frantic
with
excitement
,
as
squadron
after
squadron
rapidly
passed
along
,
with
its
guns
,
waggons
,
and
ambulances
rumbling
noisily
over
the
stones
in
the
rear
.
 
<EOS>
Following
these
came
pontoon
troops
with
their
long
grey
waggons
and
mysterious
-
looking
bridging
apparatus
,
telegraph
troops
,
balloon
sections
,
supply
columns
,
field
bakery
,
and
field
hospitals
,
the
last
-
named
packed
in
waggons
marked
with
the
well
-
known
red
cross
of
the
Geneva
Convention
.
 
<EOS>
No
sooner
was
Aldershot
denuded
of
its
army
corps
,
however
,
than
battalions
began
to
arrive
from
Portsmouth
on
their
way
north
,
while
troops
from
the
great
camp
on
Salisbury
Plain
were
rapidly
being
pushed
to
the
front
,
which
,
roughly
speaking
,
extended
through
Hitchin
,
Royston
,
to
Saffron
Walden
,
across
to
Braintree
,
and
also
the
high
ground
commanding
the
valley
of
the
Colne
to
Colchester
.
 
<EOS>
The
line
chosen
by
the
General
Staff
was
the
natural
chain
of
hills
which
presented
the
first
obstacle
to
the
enemy
advancing
on
London
from
the
wide
plain
stretching
eastward
beyond
Cambridge
to
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
If
this
could
be
held
strongly
,
as
was
intended
,
by
practically
the
whole
of
the
British
forces
located
in
the
South
of
England
,
including
the
Yeomanry
,
Militia
,
and
Volunteers
--
who
were
now
all
massing
in
every
direction
--
then
the
deadly
peril
threatening
England
might
be
averted
.
 
<EOS>
But
could
it
be
held
?
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
appalling
question
on
every
one
's
tongue
all
over
the
country
,
for
it
now
became
generally
known
that
upon
this
line
of
defence
four
complete
and
perfectly
equipped
German
army
corps
were
ready
to
advance
at
any
moment
,
in
addition
to
the
right
flank
being
exposed
to
the
attack
of
the
XIIth
Saxon
Corps
,
entrenched
on
the
Essex
coast
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
estimated
that
no
fewer
than
two
hundred
thousand
Germans
were
already
upon
English
soil
!
 
<EOS>
The
outlook
grew
blacker
every
hour
.
 
<EOS>
London
was
in
a
state
of
absolute
stagnation
and
chaos
.
<EOS>
In
the
City
,
business
was
now
at
an
entire
standstill
.
<EOS>
The
credit
system
had
received
a
fatal
blow
,
and
nobody
wanted
to
buy
securities
.
<EOS>
Had
people
kept
level
heads
in
the
crisis
there
would
have
been
a
moratorium
,
but
,
as
it
was
,
a
panic
had
been
created
that
nothing
could
allay
.
<EOS>
Even
Consols
were
now
unsaleable
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
smaller
banks
were
known
to
have
failed
,
and
traders
and
manufacturers
all
over
the
country
had
been
ruined
on
account
of
credit
,
the
foundation
of
all
trade
,
having
been
swept
away
.
<EOS>
Only
persons
of
the
highest
financial
standing
could
have
dealt
with
the
banks
,
even
if
they
had
remained
open
.
 
<EOS>
The
opinion
held
in
banking
circles
was
that
if
the
invasion
should
unfortunately
prove
disastrous
to
England
,
and
Germany
demand
a
huge
indemnity
,
there
was
still
hope
,
however
small
.
<EOS>
The
experience
of
the
Franco
-
German
war
had
proved
that
,
though
in
such
circumstances
the
Bank
,
for
a
considerable
period
,
might
not
be
able
to
resume
cash
payments
,
yet
,
with
sound
finance
,
there
was
no
reason
that
the
currency
should
greatly
depreciate
.
<EOS>
During
the
period
of
suspension
of
cash
payments
by
the
Bank
of
France
,
the
premium
on
gold
never
went
above
1.5
per
cent
.
,
and
during
most
of
the
period
was
5
,
4
,
or
even
less
per
mille
.
<EOS>
Therefore
what
the
French
by
sound
banking
had
been
able
to
do
,
there
was
no
reason
why
English
bankers
could
not
also
do
.
      
<EOS>
WE
,
WILHELM
,
     
GIVE
NOTICE
to
the
inhabitants
of
those
provinces
occupied
by
    
the
German
Imperial
Army
,
that--
     
<EOS>
I
MAKE
WAR
upon
the
soldiers
,
and
not
upon
English
citizens
.
    
<EOS>
Consequently
,
it
is
my
wish
to
give
the
latter
and
their
    
property
entire
security
,
and
as
long
as
they
do
not
embark
upon
    
hostile
enterprise
against
the
German
troops
they
have
a
right
    
to
my
protection
.
     
<EOS>
GENERALS
COMMANDING
the
various
corps
in
the
various
districts
    
in
England
are
ordered
to
place
before
the

At
the
outbreak
of
the
war
of
1870
,
on
August
1
,
French
Three
per
Cent
.
<EOS>
Rentes
were
at
60.85
,
and
Four
and
a
Half
per
Cent
.
<EOS>
at
98
.
<EOS>
On
the
memorable
day
of
Sedan
,
September
2
,
they
were
at
50.80
and
88.50
respectively
,
and
on
January
2
,
1871
,
Three
per
Cents
.
<EOS>
were
down
to
50.95
.
<EOS>
At
the
commencement
of
the
Commune
,
on
March
18
,
they
were
at
51.50
and
76.25
,
and
on
the
30th
of
that
month
down
to
50.60
and
76.25
respectively
.
 
<EOS>
With
so
little
money
in
England
as
there
now
was
,
securities
had
fallen
to
the
value
at
which
holders
would
as
soon
not
sell
as
sell
at
such
a
great
discount
.
<EOS>
High
rates
and
the
heavy
fall
in
the
value
of
securities
had
brought
business
in
every
quarter
all
over
London
to
a
standstill
.
<EOS>
Firms
all
over
the
country
were
now
hard
put
to
in
order
to
find
the
necessary
money
to
carry
on
their
various
trades
.
<EOS>
Instantly
after
the
report
of
the
reverse
at
Sheffield
,
there
was
a
wild
rush
to
obtain
gold
,
and
securities
dropped
even
a
few
more
points
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
there
was
little
or
nothing
for
the
banks
to
do
,
and
Lombard
Street
,
Lothbury
,
and
the
other
banking
centres
were
closed
,
as
though
it
had
been
Sunday
or
Bank
Holiday
.
<EOS>
Despair
was
,
alas
!
<EOS>
everywhere
,
and
the
streets
presented
strange
scenes
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
the
motor
omnibuses
had
been
taken
off
the
road
and
pressed
into
the
service
of
the
military
.
<EOS>
The
walls
bore
a
dozen
different
broadsides
and
proclamations
,
which
were
read
by
the
gaping
,
hungry
crowds
.
 
<EOS>
The
Royal
Standard
was
flying
from
St.
Stephen
's
Tower
,
for
Parliament
had
now
met
,
and
all
members
who
were
not
abroad
for
their
summer
vacation
had
taken
their
places
at
the
heated
debates
now
hourly
in
progress
.
<EOS>
Over
Buckingham
Palace
the
Royal
Standard
also
flew
proudly
,
while
upon
every
public
building
was
displayed
a
Union
Jack
or
a
white
ensign
,
many
of
which
had
done
duty
at
the
coronation
of
His
Majesty
King
Edward
.
<EOS>
The
Admiralty
flew
its
own
flag
,
and
upon
the
War
Office
,
the
India
Office
,
the
Foreign
Office
,
and
all
the
dark
,
sombre
Government
buildings
in
Whitehall
was
bunting
displayed
.
 
<EOS>
The
wild
enthusiasm
of
Sunday
and
Monday
,
however
,
had
given
place
to
a
dark
,
hopeless
apprehension
.
<EOS>
The
great
mobs
now
thronging
all
the
principal
thoroughfares
in
London
were
already
half
-
famished
.
<EOS>
Food
was
daily
rising
in
price
,
and
the
East
End
was
already
starving
.
<EOS>
Bands
of
lawless
men
and
women
from
the
slums
of
Whitechapel
were
parading
the
West
End
streets
and
squares
,
and
were
camping
out
in
Hyde
Park
and
St.
James
's
Park
.
 
<EOS>
The
days
were
stifling
,
for
it
was
an
unusually
hot
September
<EOS>
following
upon
a
blazing
August
,
and
as
each
breathless
evening
the
sun
sank
,
it
shed
its
blood
-
red
afterglow
over
the
giant
metropolis
,
grimly
precursory
of
the
ruin
so
surely
imminent
.
 
<EOS>
Supplies
were
still
reaching
London
from
the
country
,
but
there
had
been
immediate
panic
in
the
corn
and
provision
markets
,
with
the
result
that
prices
had
instantly
jumped
up
beyond
the
means
of
the
average
Londoner
.
<EOS>
The
poorer
ones
were
eagerly
collecting
the
refuse
in
Covent
Garden
Market
and
boiling
it
down
to
make
soup
in
lieu
of
anything
else
,
while
wise
fathers
of
families
went
to
the
shops
themselves
and
made
meagre
purchases
daily
of
just
sufficient
food
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
present
there
was
no
fear
of
London
being
absolutely
starved
,
at
least
the
middle
class
and
wealthier
portion
of
it
.
<EOS>
At
present
it
was
the
poor
--
the
toiling
millions
now
unemployed
--
who
were
the
first
to
feel
the
pinch
of
hunger
and
its
consequent
despair
.
<EOS>
They
filled
the
main
arteries
of
London
--
Holborn
,
Oxford
Street
,
the
Strand
,
Regent
Street
,
Piccadilly
,
the
Haymarket
,
St.
James
's
Street
,
Park
Lane
,
Victoria
Street
,
and
Knightsbridge
,
overflowing
northward
into
Grosvenor
,
Berkeley
,
Portman
,
and
Cavendish
Squares
,
Portland
Place
,
and
to
the
terraces
around
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
The
centre
of
London
became
congested
.
<EOS>
Day
and
night
it
was
the
same
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
sleep
.
<EOS>
From
across
the
river
and
from
the
East
End
the
famished
poor
came
in
their
bewildering
thousands
,
the
majority
of
them
honest
workers
,
indignant
that
by
the
foolish
policy
of
the
Government
they
now
found
themselves
breadless
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
Houses
of
Parliament
,
before
the
fine
new
War
Office
and
the
Admiralty
,
before
Downing
Street
,
and
before
the
houses
of
known
members
of
the
Government
,
constant
demonstrations
were
being
made
,
the
hungry
crowds
groaning
at
the
authorities
,
and
singing
"
God
Save
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Though
starving
and
in
despair
,
they
were
nevertheless
loyal
,
still
confident
that
by
the
personal
effort
of
His
Majesty
some
amicable
arrangement
would
be
arrived
at
.
<EOS>
The
French
_
entente
cordiale
_
was
remembered
,
and
our
Sovereign
had
long
ago
been
declared
to
be
the
first
diplomat
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
Every
Londoner
believed
in
him
,
and
loved
him
.
 
<EOS>
Many
houses
of
the
wealthy
,
especially
those
of
foreigners
,
had
their
windows
broken
.
<EOS>
In
Park
Lane
,
in
Piccadilly
,
and
in
Grosvenor
Square
more
particularly
,
the
houses
seemed
to
excite
the
ire
of
the
crowds
,
who
,
notwithstanding
special
constables
having
been
sworn
in
,
were
now
quite
beyond
the
control
of
the
police
.
<EOS>
The
German
Ambassador
had
presented
his
letters
of
recall
on
Sunday
evening
,
and
together
with
the
whole
staff
had
been
accorded
a
safe
conduct
to
Dover
,
whence
they
had
left
for
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
The
Embassy
in
Carlton
House
Terrace
,
and
also
the
Consulate
-
General
in
Finsbury
Square
,
had
,
however
,
suffered
severely
at
the
hands
of
the
angry
crowd
,
notwithstanding
that
both
premises
were
under
police
protection
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
German
waiters
employed
at
the
Cecil
,
the
Savoy
,
the
Carlton
,
the
Metropole
,
the
Victoria
,
the
Grand
,
and
the
other
big
London
hotels
,
had
already
fled
for
their
lives
out
into
the
country
,
anywhere
from
the
vengeance
of
the
London
mob
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
them
were
trying
to
make
their
way
within
the
German
lines
in
Essex
and
Suffolk
,
and
it
was
believed
that
many
had
succeeded
--
those
,
most
probably
,
who
had
previously
acted
as
spies
.
<EOS>
Others
,
it
was
reported
,
had
been
set
upon
by
the
excited
populace
,
and
more
than
one
had
lost
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
Pandemonium
reigned
in
London
.
<EOS>
Every
class
and
every
person
in
every
walk
of
life
was
affected
.
<EOS>
German
interests
were
being
looked
after
by
the
Russian
Ambassador
,
and
this
very
fact
caused
a
serious
demonstration
before
Chesham
House
,
the
big
mansion
where
lives
the
representative
of
the
Czar
.
<EOS>
Audacious
spies
had
,
in
secret
,
in
the
night
actually
posted
copies
of
Von
Kronhelm
's
proclamation
upon
the
Griffin
at
Temple
Bar
,
upon
the
Marble
Arch
,
and
upon
the
Mansion
House
.
<EOS>
But
these
had
been
quickly
torn
down
,
and
if
the
hand
that
had
placed
them
there
had
been
known
,
it
would
certainly
have
meant
death
to
the
one
who
had
thus
insulted
the
citizens
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
truth
was
,
alas
!
<EOS>
too
plain
.
<EOS>
Spread
out
across
Essex
and
Suffolk
,
making
leisurely
preparations
and
laughing
at
our
futile
defence
,
lay
over
one
hundred
thousand
well
-
equipped
,
well
-
fed
Germans
,
ready
,
when
their
plans
were
completed
,
to
advance
upon
and
crush
the
complex
city
which
is
the
pride
and
home
of
every
Englishman
--
London
.
 
<EOS>
On
Friday
night
an
official
communication
from
the
War
Office
was
issued
to
the
Press
,
showing
the
exact
position
of
the
invaders
.
<EOS>
It
was
roughly
this
:
 
"
The
IXth
German
Corps
,
which
had
effected
a
landing
at
Lowestoft
,
<EOS>
had
,
after
moving
along
the
most
easterly
route
,
including
the
road
through
Saxmundham
and
Ipswich
,
at
length
arrived
at
a
position
where
their
infantry
outposts
had
occupied
the
higher
slopes
of
the
rising
ground
overlooking
the
river
Stour
,
near
Manningtree
,
which
town
,
as
well
as
Ipswich
,
was
held
by
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
left
flank
of
this
corps
rested
on
the
river
Stour
itself
,
so
that
it
was
secure
from
any
turning
movement
.
<EOS>
Its
front
was
opposed
to
and
directly
threatened
Colchester
,
while
its
outposts
,
to
say
nothing
of
its
independent
cavalry
,
reached
out
in
a
northerly
direction
towards
Stowmarket
,
where
they
joined
hands
with
the
left
flank
of
the
Xth
Corps
--
those
under
Von
Wilburg
,
who
had
landed
at
Yarmouth
--
whose
headquarters
were
now
at
Bury
St.
Edmunds
,
their
outposts
being
disposed
south
,
overlooking
the
valley
of
the
upper
reaches
of
the
Stour
.
"
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
all
.
<EOS>
From
Newmarket
there
came
information
<EOS>
that
the
enemy
who
had
landed
at
Weybourne
and
Cromer
--
viz
.
,
the
IVth
Corps
under
Von
Kleppen
--
were
now
encamping
on
the
racecourse
and
being
billeted
in
the
town
and
villages
about
,
including
Exning
,
Ashley
,
Moulton
,
and
Kentford
.
<EOS>
Froelich
's
cavalry
brigade
had
penetrated
south
,
covering
the
advance
,
and
had
now
scoured
the
country
,
sweeping
away
the
futile
resistance
of
the
British
Yeomanry
,
and
scattering
cavalry
squadrons
which
they
found
opposed
to
them
,
all
the
time
maintaining
communication
with
the
Xth
Corps
on
their
left
,
and
the
flower
of
the
German
Army
,
the
Guards
Corps
,
from
King
's
Lynn
,
on
their
right
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
advance
from
Holt
,
Von
Dorndorf
's
motorists
had
been
of
the
greatest
utility
.
<EOS>
They
had
taken
constantly
companies
of
infantry
hither
and
thither
.
<EOS>
At
any
threatened
point
,
so
soon
as
the
sound
of
firing
was
heard
in
any
cavalry
skirmish
or
little
engagement
of
outposts
,
the
smart
motor
infantry
were
on
the
spot
with
the
promptness
of
a
fire
brigade
proceeding
to
a
call
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
the
field
artillery
,
who
were
largely
armed
with
quick
-
firing
guns
,
capable
of
pouring
in
a
hail
of
shrapnel
on
any
exposed
point
,
were
enabled
to
push
on
much
further
than
would
have
been
otherwise
possible
.
<EOS>
They
were
always
adequately
supported
by
a
sufficient
escort
of
these
up
-
to
-
date
troops
,
who
,
although
infantry
,
moved
with
greater
rapidity
than
cavalry
itself
,
and
who
,
moreover
,
brought
with
them
their
Maxims
,
which
dealt
havoc
far
and
near
.
 
<EOS>
The
magnificent
troops
of
the
Duke
of
Mannheim
,
in
their
service
uniforms
,
who
had
landed
at
King
's
Lynn
,
had
come
across
the
wide
,
level
roads
,
some
by
way
of
Downham
Market
,
Littleport
,
and
Ely
,
and
arrived
at
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
The
2nd
Division
,
under
Lieutenant
-
General
von
Kasten
,
protecting
the
exposed
flanks
,
had
marched
_
via
_
Wisbech
,
March
,
Chatteris
,
and
St.
Ives
,
while
the
masses
of
the
cavalry
of
the
Guard
,
including
the
famous
White
Cuirassiers
,
had
been
acting
independently
around
the
flat
fen
country
,
Spalding
and
Peterborough
,
and
away
to
quaint
old
Huntingdon
,
striking
terror
into
the
inhabitants
,
and
effectively
checking
any
possible
offensive
movement
of
the
British
that
might
have
been
directed
upon
the
great
German
Army
during
its
ruthless
advance
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
this
,
worse
remained
.
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
the
VIIth
Corps
,
under
Von
Bristram
,
had
landed
at
Goole
,
and
that
General
Graf
Haeseler
had
landed
at
Hull
,
New
Holland
,
and
Grimsby
.
<EOS>
This
revealed
what
the
real
strategy
of
the
Generalissimo
had
been
.
<EOS>
Their
function
seemed
twofold
.
<EOS>
First
and
foremost
their
presence
,
as
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
,
effectually
prevented
any
attack
from
the
British
troops
gathered
from
the
north
and
elsewhere
,
and
who
were
,
as
shown
,
concentrated
near
Sheffield
and
Birmingham
,
until
these
two
corps
had
themselves
been
attacked
and
repulsed
,
which
we
were
,
alas
!
<EOS>
utterly
unable
to
accomplish
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
two
fine
German
army
corps
,
complete
to
the
proverbial
last
button
,
splendidly
equipped
,
well
fed
,
and
led
by
officers
who
had
had
life
-
long
training
and
were
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
every
mile
of
the
country
they
occupied
,
by
reason
of
years
of
careful
study
given
to
maps
of
England
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
entirely
plain
that
the
function
of
these
two
corps
was
to
paralyse
our
trade
in
Yorkshire
and
Lancashire
,
to
commit
havoc
in
the
big
cities
,
to
terrify
the
people
,
and
to
strike
a
crushing
blow
at
our
industrial
centres
,
leaving
the
siege
of
London
to
the
four
other
corps
now
so
rapidly
advancing
upon
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
Events
meanwhile
were
marching
quickly
in
the
North
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
of
Sheffield
throughout
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
was
the
scene
of
the
greatest
activity
.
<EOS>
Day
and
night
the
streets
were
filled
with
an
excited
populace
,
and
hour
by
hour
the
terror
increased
.
 
<EOS>
Every
train
arriving
from
the
North
was
crowded
with
Volunteers
and
troops
of
the
line
from
all
stations
in
the
Northern
Command
.
<EOS>
The
1st
Battalion
West
Riding
Regiment
had
joined
the
Yorkshire
Light
Infantry
,
who
were
already
stationed
in
Sheffield
,
as
had
also
the
19th
Hussars
,
and
from
every
regimental
district
and
depot
came
battalions
of
Militia
and
Volunteers
.
<EOS>
From
Carlisle
came
the
Reservists
of
the
Border
Regiment
,
from
Richmond
those
of
the
Yorkshire
Regiment
,
from
Newcastle
came
what
was
left
of
the
Reservists
of
the
Durham
Light
Infantry
,
and
the
Northumberland
Fusiliers
,
from
Lancaster
the
Royal
Lancashires
,
while
field
artillery
came
from
Seaforth
and
Preston
,
and
small
bodies
of
Reservists
of
the
Liverpool
and
the
South
Lancashire
Regiments
came
from
Warrington
.
<EOS>
Contingents
of
the
East
and
North
Lancashire
Regiments
arrived
from
Preston
.
<EOS>
The
Militia
,
including
battalions
of
the
Liverpool
Regiment
,
the
South
Lancashire
Regiment
,
the
Lancashire
Fusiliers
,
and
other
regiments
in
the
command
,
were
hurried
to
the
scene
of
action
outside
Sheffield
.
<EOS>
From
every
big
town
in
the
whole
of
the
North
of
England
and
South
of
Scotland
came
straggling
units
of
Volunteers
.
<EOS>
The
mounted
troops
were
almost
entirely
Yeomanry
,
and
included
the
Duke
of
Lancaster
's
Own
Imperial
Yeomanry
,
the
East
Riding
of
Yorks
,
the
Lancashire
Hussars
,
Northumberland
Yeomanry
,
Westmorland
and
Cumberland
Yeomanry
,
the
Queen
's
Own
Yorkshire
Dragoons
,
and
the
York
Hussars
.
 
<EOS>
These
troops
,
with
their
ambulances
,
their
baggage
,
and
all
their
impedimenta
,
created
the
utmost
confusion
at
both
railway
stations
.
<EOS>
The
great
concourse
of
idlers
cheered
and
cheered
again
,
the
utmost
enthusiasm
being
displayed
when
each
battalion
forming
up
was
marched
away
out
of
the
town
to
the
position
chosen
for
the
defence
,
which
now
reached
from
Woodhouse
on
the
south
,
overlooking
and
commanding
the
whole
valley
of
the
river
Rother
,
through
Catcliffe
,
Brinsworth
,
and
Tinsley
,
previously
alluded
to
,
skirting
Greasborough
to
the
high
ground
north
of
Wentworth
,
also
commanding
the
river
Don
and
all
approaches
to
it
through
Mexborough
,
and
over
the
various
bridges
which
spanned
this
stream
--
a
total
of
about
eight
miles
.
 
<EOS>
The
south
flank
was
thrown
back
another
four
miles
to
Norton
,
in
an
endeavour
to
prevent
the
whole
position
being
turned
,
should
the
Germans
elect
to
deliver
their
threatened
blow
from
a
more
southerly
point
than
was
anticipated
.
 
<EOS>
The
total
line
,
then
,
to
be
occupied
by
the
defenders
was
about
twelve
miles
,
and
into
this
front
was
crowded
the
heterogeneous
mass
of
troops
of
all
arms
.
<EOS>
The
post
of
honour
was
at
Catcliffe
,
the
dominating
key
to
the
whole
position
,
which
was
occupied
by
the
sturdy
soldiers
of
the
1st
Battalion
West
Riding
Regiment
and
the
2nd
Battalion
Yorkshire
Light
Infantry
,
while
commanding
every
bridge
crossing
the
rivers
which
lay
between
Sheffield
and
the
invaders
were
concentrated
the
guns
of
the
7th
Brigade
Royal
Horse
Artillery
,
and
of
the
Field
Artillery
,
the
2nd
,
the
30th
,
the
37th
,
and
38th
Brigades
,
the
latter
having
hurriedly
arrived
from
Bradford
.
 
<EOS>
All
along
the
crests
of
these
slopes
which
formed
the
defence
of
Sheffield
,
rising
steeply
from
the
river
at
times
up
to
five
hundred
feet
,
were
assembled
the
Volunteers
,
all
now
by
daybreak
on
Thursday
morning
busily
engaged
in
throwing
up
shelter
-
trenches
and
making
hasty
earthwork
defences
for
the
guns
.
<EOS>
The
superintendence
of
this
force
had
merged
itself
into
that
of
the
Northern
Command
,
which
nominally
had
its
headquarters
in
York
,
but
which
had
now
been
transferred
to
Sheffield
itself
,
for
the
best
of
reasons
--
that
it
was
of
no
value
at
York
,
and
was
badly
wanted
farther
south
.
<EOS>
General
Sir
George
Woolmer
,
who
so
distinguished
himself
in
South
Africa
,
had
therefore
shifted
his
headquarters
to
the
Town
Hall
in
Sheffield
,
but
as
soon
as
he
had
begun
to
get
the
line
of
defence
completed
,
he
,
with
his
staff
,
moved
on
to
Handsworth
,
which
was
centrally
situated
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
command
were
to
be
found
roughly
twenty
-
three
battalions
of
Militia
and
forty
-
eight
of
Volunteers
;
but
,
owing
to
the
supineness
and
neglect
of
the
Government
,
the
former
regiments
now
found
themselves
,
at
the
moment
when
wanted
,
greatly
denuded
of
officers
,
and
,
owing
to
any
lack
of
encouragement
to
enlist
,
largely
depleted
in
men
.
<EOS>
As
regards
the
Volunteers
,
matters
were
even
worse
,
only
about
fifteen
thousand
having
responded
to
the
call
to
arms
.
<EOS>
And
upon
these
heroic
men
,
utterly
insufficient
in
point
of
numbers
,
Sheffield
had
to
rely
for
its
defence
.
 
<EOS>
Away
to
the
eastward
of
Sheffield
--
exactly
where
was
yet
unknown
--
sixty
thousand
perfectly
equipped
and
thoroughly
trained
German
horse
,
foot
,
and
artillery
,
were
ready
at
any
moment
to
advance
westward
into
our
manufacturing
districts
!

CHAPTER

.
 
<EOS>
BRITISH
SUCCESS
AT
ROYSTON
.
  
<EOS>
Arrests
of
alleged
spies
were
reported
from
Manchester
and
other
large
towns
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
prisoners
were
,
however
,
able
to
prove
themselves
naturalised
British
subjects
;
but
several
were
detained
pending
investigation
and
examination
of
correspondence
found
at
their
homes
.
<EOS>
In
Manchester
,
where
there
are
always
a
number
of
Germans
,
it
is
known
that
many
slipped
away
on
Sunday
night
after
the
publication
of
the
news
of
the
invasion
.
 
<EOS>
In
most
of
the
larger
Midland
towns
notices
had
been
issued
by
the
mayors
deprecating
hostility
towards
residents
of
foreign
origin
,
and
stating
that
all
suspicious
cases
were
already
receiving
the
attention
of
the
police
.
 
<EOS>
In
Stafford
the
boot
factories
were
idle
.
<EOS>
In
the
Potteries
all
work
was
at
a
standstill
.
<EOS>
At
Stoke
-
on
-
Trent
,
at
Hanley
,
at
Burslem
,
Tunstall
,
and
Congleton
all
was
chaos
,
and
thousands
upon
thousands
were
already
wanting
bread
.
<EOS>
The
silk
-
thread
industry
at
Leek
was
ruined
,
so
was
the
silk
industry
at
Macclesfield
;
the
great
breweries
at
Burton
were
idle
,
while
the
hosiery
factories
of
Leicester
and
the
boot
factories
of
Northampton
were
all
shut
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
German
troops
threatening
Sheffield
,
Nottingham
was
in
a
state
of
intense
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
lace
and
hosiery
factories
had
with
one
accord
closed
on
Tuesday
,
and
the
great
Market
Place
was
now
filled
day
and
night
by
thousands
upon
thousands
of
unemployed
mill
-
hands
of
both
sexes
.
<EOS>
On
Friday
,
however
,
came
the
news
of
how
Sheffield
had
built
barricades
against
the
enemy
,
and
there
ensued
a
frantic
attempt
at
defence
on
the
part
of
thousands
of
terrified
and
hungry
men
and
women
.
<EOS>
In
their
frenzy
they
sacked
houses
in
order
to
obtain
material
to
construct
the
barricades
,
which
were
,
however
,
built
just
where
the
fancy
took
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
The
white
,
interminable
North
Road
,
that
runs
so
straight
from
London
through
York
and
Berwick
to
Edinburgh
,
was
,
with
its
by
-
roads
in
the
Midlands
,
now
being
patrolled
by
British
cavalry
,
and
<EOS>
here
and
there
telegraphists
around
a
telegraph
post
showed
that
those
many
wires
at
the
roadside
were
being
used
for
military
communication
.
 
<EOS>
At
several
points
along
the
road
between
Wansford
Bridge
and
Retford
the
wires
had
been
cut
and
tangled
by
the
enemy
's
agents
,
but
by
Friday
all
had
been
restored
again
.
<EOS>
In
one
spot
,
between
Weston
and
Sutton
-
on
-
Trent
,
eight
miles
south
of
Newark
,
a
trench
had
actually
been
dug
during
the
night
,
the
tube
containing
the
subterranean
telegraph
lines
discovered
,
and
the
whole
system
to
the
North
disorganised
.
<EOS>
Similar
damage
had
been
done
by
German
spies
to
the
line
between
London
and
Birmingham
,
two
miles
south
of
Shipston
-
on
-
Stour
;
and
again
the
line
between
Loughborough
and
Nottingham
had
been
similarly
destroyed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Post
Office
linesmen
had
,
however
,
quickly
made
good
the
damage
everywhere
in
the
country
not
already
occupied
by
the
enemy
,
and
telegraph
and
telephone
communication
North
and
South
was
now
practically
again
in
its
normal
state
.
 
<EOS>
Through
Lincolnshire
the
enemy
's
advance
patrols
had
spread
South
over
every
road
between
the
Humber
and
the
Wash
,
and
in
the
city
of
Lincoln
itself
a
tremendous
sensation
was
caused
when
on
Wednesday
,
market
-
day
,
several
bodies
of
German
motor
-
cyclists
swept
into
the
Stonebow
and
dismounted
at
the
Saracen
's
Head
,
amid
the
crowd
of
farmers
and
dealers
who
had
assembled
there
,
not
,
alas
!
<EOS>
to
do
business
,
but
to
discuss
the
situation
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
the
city
was
panic
-
stricken
.
<EOS>
From
mouth
to
mouth
the
dread
truth
spread
,
that
the
Germans
were
upon
them
,
and
people
ran
indoors
and
barricaded
themselves
within
their
houses
.
 
<EOS>
A
body
of
Uhlans
came
galloping
proudly
through
the
Stonebow
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
,
and
halted
in
High
Street
as
though
awaiting
orders
.
<EOS>
Then
in
rapid
succession
troops
seemed
to
arrive
from
all
quarters
,
many
halting
in
the
Cathedral
Close
and
by
Exchequer
Gate
,
and
others
riding
through
the
streets
in
order
to
terrify
the
inhabitants
.
 
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
's
famous
proclamation
was
posted
by
German
soldiers
upon
the
police
station
,
upon
the
Stonebow
,
and
upon
the
door
of
the
grand
old
Cathedral
itself
,
and
before
noon
a
German
officer
accompanied
by
his
staff
called
upon
the
Mayor
,
and
warned
him
that
Lincoln
was
occupied
by
the
German
troops
,
and
that
any
armed
resistance
would
be
punished
by
death
,
as
the
Generalissimo
's
proclamation
stated
.
<EOS>
An
indemnity
was
demanded
,
and
then
the
powerless
people
saw
upon
the
Cathedral
and
upon
several
of
the
public
buildings
the
German
flag
rise
and
float
out
upon
the
summer
wind
.
 
<EOS>
Boston
was
full
of
German
infantry
,
and
officers
had
taken
up
temporary
quarters
in
the
Peacock
and
other
hotels
in
the
market
-
place
,
while
upon
the
"
Stump
"
the
enemy
's
colours
were
flying
.
 
<EOS>
No
news
came
from
London
.
<EOS>
People
in
Norwich
,
Ipswich
,
Yarmouth
,
and
other
places
heard
vaguely
of
the
invasion
in
the
North
,
and
of
fighting
in
which
the
Germans
were
careful
to
report
that
they
were
always
successful
.
<EOS>
They
saw
the
magnificently
equipped
army
of
the
Kaiser
,
and
,
comparing
it
with
our
mere
apology
for
military
force
,
regarded
the
issue
as
hopeless
from
the
very
first
.
<EOS>
In
every
town
the
German
colours
were
displayed
,
and
all
kinds
of
placards
in
German
and
in
English
made
their
appearance
.

Victory
at
last
.
<EOS>
A
victory
due
not
only
to
the
bravery
and
exertion
of
our
troops
,
regular
and
auxiliary
,
but
also
to
the
genius
of
Field
-
Marshal
Lord
Byfield
,
our
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
,
ably
seconded
by
the
energy
and
resource
with
which
Sir
William
Packington
,
in
command
of
the
IVth
Army
Corps
at
Baldock
,
carried
out
that
part
of
the
programme
entrusted
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
though
in
this
success
we
may
hope
that
we
are
seeing
the
first
glimmerings
of
dawn
--
of
deliverance
from
the
nightmare
of
German
invasion
that
is
now
oppressing
our
dear
old
England
<EOS>
--
we
must
not
be
led
into
foolishly
sanguine
hopes
.
<EOS>
The
snake
has
been
scotched
,
and
pretty
badly
into
the
bargain
,
but
he
is
far
from
being
killed
.
<EOS>
The
German
IVth
Army
Corps
,
under
the
famous
General
Von
Kleppen
,
their
magnificent
Garde
Corps
commanded
by
the
Duke
of
Mannheim
,
and
Froelich
's
fine
Cavalry
Division
,
have
been
repulsed
in
their
attack
on
our
positions
near
Royston
and
Saffron
Walden
,
and
driven
back
with
great
loss
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
too
weak
to
follow
up
our
victory
as
it
should
be
followed
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
menace
of
the
IXth
and
Xth
Corps
on
our
right
flank
ties
us
to
our
selected
position
,
and
the
bulk
of
our
forces
being
composed
of
indifferently
trained
Volunteers
and
Militia
,
is
much
more
formidable
behind
entrenchments
than
when
attempting
to
manoeuvre
in
a
difficult
and
intricate
country
such
as
it
is
about
here
.
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
we
have
given
pause
to
the
invaders
,
and
have
certainly
gained
a
few
days
'
time
,
which
will
be
invaluable
to
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
able
to
get
on
with
the
line
of
fortifications
that
are
being
constructed
to
bar
the
approaches
to
London
,
and
behind
which
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
make
our
final
stand
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
conceive
that
it
is
possible
for
such
an
agglomeration
of
amateur
troops
as
ours
are
in
the
main
to
defeat
in
the
open
field
such
formidable
and
well
-
trained
forces
as
the
Germans
have
succeeded
in
throwing
into
this
country
.
<EOS>
But
when
our
Navy
has
regained
command
of
the
sea
,
we
hope
that
we
may
,
before
very
long
,
place
our
unwelcome
visitors
'
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea'--the
part
of
the
devil
being
played
by
our
brave
troops
finally
concentrated
behind
the
strong
defences
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
that
the
Germans
may
run
out
of
ammunition
and
provisions
.
<EOS>
For
if
communication
with
the
Fatherland
is
effectively
cut
,
they
must
starve
,
unless
they
have
previously
compelled
our
submission
;
for
it
is
impossible
for
an
army
of
the
size
that
has
invaded
us
to
live
on
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
hundreds
,
nay
thousands
,
of
our
non
-
militant
countrymen
--
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
women
and
children
--
will
starve
before
the
German
troops
are
conquered
by
famine
,
that
most
terrible
of
enemies
;
but
this
issue
seems
to
be
the
only
possible
one
that
will
save
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
enough
of
these
considerations
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
It
is
time
that
I
should
relate
what
I
can
of
the
glorious
victory
which
our
gallant
defenders
have
torn
from
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
that
I
am
giving
any
information
away
if
I
state
that
the
British
position
lay
mainly
between
Saffron
Walden
and
Royston
,
the
headquarters
respectively
of
the
IInd
and
IIIrd
Army
Corps
.
<EOS>
The
IVth
Corps
was
at
Baldock
,
thrown
back
to
cover
the
left
flank
and
protect
our
communications
by
the
Great
Northern
Railway
.
<EOS>
A
detached
force
,
from
what
command
supplied
it
is
not
necessary
or
advisable
to
say
,
was
strongly
entrenched
on
the
high
ground
north
-
west
of
Helions
Bumpstead
,
serving
to
strengthen
our
right
.
<EOS>
Our
main
line
of
defence
--
very
thinly
held
in
some
parts
--
began
a
little
to
the
south
-
east
of
Saffron
Walden
,
and
ran
westwards
along
a
range
of
high
ground
through
Elmdon
and
Chrishall
to
Heydon
.
<EOS>
Here
it
turned
south
through
Great
Chrishall
to
Little
Chrishall
,
where
it
again
turned
west
,
and
occupied
the
high
range
south
of
Royston
on
which
stands
the
village
of
Therfield
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
night
before
the
battle
we
knew
that
the
greater
portion
of
the
German
IVth
and
Garde
Corps
were
concentrated
,
the
former
at
Newmarket
,
the
1st
Division
of
the
latter
at
Cambridge
,
the
2nd
on
this
side
of
St.
Ives
,
while
Froelich
's
Cavalry
Division
had
been
in
constant
contact
with
our
outposts
the
greater
part
of
the
day
previous
.
<EOS>
The
Garde
Cavalry
Brigade
was
reported
to
be
well
away
to
the
westward
towards
Kettering
,
as
we
suppose
,
on
account
of
the
reports
which
have
been
going
about
of
a
concentration
of
Yeomanry
and
Militia
in
the
hilly
country
near
Northampton
.
<EOS>
Our
Intelligence
Department
,
which
appears
to
have
been
very
well
served
by
its
spies
,
obtained
early
knowledge
of
the
intention
of
the
Germans
to
make
an
attack
on
our
position
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
they
talked
openly
of
it
,
and
stated
at
Cambridge
and
Newmarket
that
they
would
not
manoeuvre
at
all
,
and
only
hoped
that
we
should
hold
on
long
enough
to
our
position
to
enable
them
to
smash
up
our
IInd
and
IIIrd
Corps
by
a
frontal
attack
,
and
so
clear
the
road
to
London
.
<EOS>
The
main
roads
lent
themselves
admirably
to
such
strategy
,
which
rendered
the
reports
of
their
intentions
the
more
probable
,
for
they
all
converged
on
our
position
from
their
main
points
of
concentration
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
letter
'
W
'
will
exactly
serve
to
show
the
positions
of
the
contending
forces
.
<EOS>
St.
Ives
is
at
the
top
of
the
first
stroke
,
Cambridge
at
the
junction
of
the
two
shorter
centre
ones
,
Newmarket
at
the
top
of
the
last
stroke
,
while
the
British
positions
at
Royston
and
Saffron
Walden
are
at
the
junctions
of
all
four
strokes
at
the
bottom
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
The
strokes
also
represent
the
roads
,
except
that
from
Cambridge
three
good
roads
lead
towards
each
of
the
British
positions
.
<EOS>
The
prisoners
taken
from
the
Germans
in
the
various
preliminary
skirmishes
also
made
no
bones
of
boasting
that
a
direct
attack
was
imminent
,
and
our
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
eventually
,
and
rightly
as
it
proved
,
determined
to
take
the
risk
of
all
this
information
having
been
specially
promulgated
by
the
German
Staff
to
cover
totally
different
intentions
,
as
was
indeed
quite
probable
,
and
to
accept
it
as
true
.
<EOS>
Having
made
up
his
mind
,
he
lost
no
time
in
taking
action
.
<EOS>
He
ordered
the
IVth
Corps
under
Sir
William
Packington
to
move
on
Potton
,
twelve
miles
to
the
north
-
west
,
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
.
<EOS>
As
many
cavalry
and
mounted
infantry
as
could
possibly
be
spared
from
Royston
were
placed
at
his
disposal
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
ought
to
be
stated
that
while
the
auxiliary
troops
had
been
busily
employed
ever
since
their
arrival
in
entrenching
the
British
position
,
the
greater
part
of
the
regular
troops
had
been
occupying
an
advanced
line
two
or
three
miles
to
the
northward
on
the
lower
spurs
of
the
hills
,
and
every
possible
indication
of
a
determination
to
hold
this
as
long
as
possible
was
afforded
to
the
German
reconnoitrers
.
<EOS>
During
the
night
these
troops
fell
back
to
the
position
which
had
been
prepared
,
the
outposts
following
just
before
daylight
.
<EOS>
About
6
a.m.
the
enemy
were
reported
to
be
advancing
in
force
along
the
Icknield
Way
from
Newmarket
,
and
also
by
the
roads
running
on
either
bank
of
the
river
<EOS>
Cam
.
<EOS>
Twenty
minutes
later
considerable
bodies
of
German
troops
were
reported
at
Fowlmere
and
Melbourn
on
the
two
parallel
Royston
-
Cambridge
roads
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
followed
very
close
on
the
heels
of
our
retiring
outposts
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
misty
morning
--
down
in
the
low
ground
over
which
the
enemy
were
advancing
especially
so
--
but
about
seven
a
gust
of
wind
from
the
westward
dispelled
the
white
fog
-
wreaths
that
hung
about
our
left
front
,
and
enabled
our
lookouts
to
get
a
glimpse
along
the
famous
Ermine
Street
,
which
runs
straight
as
an
arrow
from
Royston
for
twenty
or
thirty
miles
to
the
N.N.W.
 
<EOS>
"
Along
this
ancient
Roman
way
,
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
poured
a
steady
stream
of
marching
men
,
horse
,
foot
,
and
artillery
.
<EOS>
The
wind
dropped
,
the
mists
gathered
again
,
and
once
more
enveloped
the
invaders
in
an
impenetrable
screen
.
<EOS>
But
by
this
time
the
whole
British
line
was
on
the
_
qui
vive
_
.
<EOS>
Regulars
,
Militia
,
and
Volunteers
were
marching
down
to
their
chin
-
deep
trenches
,
while
those
who
were
already
there
busied
themselves
in
improving
their
loopholes
and
strengthening
their
head
cover
.
<EOS>
Behind
the
ridges
of
the
hills
the
gunners
stood
grouped
about
their
'
Long
Toms
'
and
heavy
howitzers
,
while
the
field
batteries
waited
,
ready
horsed
,
for
orders
to
gallop
under
cover
of
the
ridge
to
whichever
set
of
emplacements
should
first
require
to
be
manned
and
armed
.
<EOS>
We
had
not
enough
to
distribute
before
the
movements
of
the
enemy
should
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
show
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
seven
o'clock
<EOS>
a
series
of
crackling
reports
from
the
outskirts
of
Royston
announced
that
the
detachment
of
Mounted
Infantry
,
who
now
alone
held
it
,
was
exchanging
shots
with
the
advancing
enemy
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
,
as
the
morning
mistiness
cleared
off
,
the
General
and
his
staff
,
who
were
established
at
the
northern
edge
of
the
village
of
Therfield
,
three
or
four
hundred
feet
higher
up
than
the
German
skirmishers
,
were
able
to
see
the
opening
of
the
battle
spread
like
a
panorama
before
them
.
<EOS>
A
thick
firing
line
of
drab
-
costumed
Germans
extended
right
across
from
Holland
Hall
to
the
Coach
and
Horses
on
the
Fowlmere
Road
.
<EOS>
On
their
left
moved
two
or
three
compact
masses
of
cavalry
,
while
the
infantry
reserves
were
easily
apparent
in
front
of
the
village
of
Melbourn
.
<EOS>
Our
Mounted
Infantry
in
the
village
were
indistinguishable
,
but
away
on
the
spur
to
the
north
-
east
of
Royston
a
couple
of
batteries
of
Horse
Artillery
were
unlimbered
and
were
pushing
their
guns
up
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
by
hand
.
<EOS>
In
two
minutes
they
were
in
action
,
and
hard
at
work
.
 
<EOS>
"
Through
the
glasses
the
shrapnel
could
be
seen
bursting
,
half
a
dozen
together
,
in
front
of
the
advancing
Germans
,
who
began
to
fall
fast
.
<EOS>
But
almost
at
once
came
an
overwhelming
reply
from
somewhere
out
of
sight
behind
Melbourn
.
<EOS>
The
whole
hilltop
around
our
guns
was
like
a
spouting
volcano
.
<EOS>
Evidently
big
high
-
explosive
shells
were
being
fired
from
the
German
field
-
howitzers
.
<EOS>
In
accordance
with
previous
orders
,
our
horse
-
gunners
at
once
ran
down
their
guns
,
limbered
up
,
and
started
to
gallop
back
towards
our
main
position
.
<EOS>
Simultaneously
a
mass
of
German
cavalry
deployed
into
attack
formation
near
the
Coach
and
Horses
,
and
swept
down
in
their
direction
with
the
evident
intention
of
cutting
off
and
capturing
them
.
<EOS>
But
they
reckoned
without
their
escort
of
Mounted
Infantry
,
who
had
been
lying
low
behind
the
long
,
narrow
line
of
copse
north
of
Lowerfield
Farm
.
<EOS>
Safely
ensconced
behind
this
--
to
cavalry
--
impassable
barrier
,
the
company
,
all
good
shots
,
opened
a
terrible
magazine
fire
on
the
charging
squadrons
as
they
passed
at
close
range
.
<EOS>
A
Maxim
they
had
with
them
also
swept
horses
and
men
away
in
swathes
.
<EOS>
The
charge
was
checked
,
and
the
guns
saved
,
but
we
had
not
finished
with
the
German
reiters
.
<EOS>
Away
to
the
north
-
east
a
battery
of
our
4.7
guns
opened
on
the
disorganised
cavalry
,
firing
at
a
range
of
four
thousand
yards
.
<EOS>
Their
big
shells
turned
the
momentary
check
into
a
rout
,
both
the
attacking
cavalry
and
their
supports
galloping
towards
Fowlmere
to
get
out
of
range
.
<EOS>
We
had
scored
the
first
trick
!
 
<EOS>
"
The
attacking
lines
of
German
Infantry
still
pressed
on
,
however
,
and
after
a
final
discharge
the
Mounted
Infantry
in
Royston
sprang
on
their
horses
and
galloped
back
over
Whitely
Hill
,
leaving
the
town
to
be
occupied
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
To
the
eastward
the
thunder
of
heavy
cannon
,
gradually
growing
in
intensity
,
proclaimed
that
the
IInd
Corps
was
heavily
attacked
.
<EOS>
Covered
by
a
long
strip
of
plantation
,
the
German
IVth
Corps
contrived
to
mass
an
enormous
number
of
guns
on
a
hill
about
two
miles
north
of
the
village
of
Elmdon
,
and
a
terrific
artillery
duel
began
between
them
and
our
artillery
entrenched
along
the
Elmdon
-
Heydon
ridge
.
<EOS>
Under
cover
of
this
the
enemy
began
to
work
his
infantry
up
towards
Elmdon
,
obtaining
a
certain
amount
of
shelter
from
the
spurs
which
ran
out
towards
the
north
-
east
of
our
line
.
<EOS>
Other
German
troops
with
guns
put
in
an
appearance
on
the
high
ground
to
the
north
-
east
of
Saffron
Walden
,
near
Chesterton
Park
.

To
describe
the
fortunes
of
this
fiercely
contested
battle
,
which
spread
along
a
front
of
nearly
twenty
miles
,
counting
from
the
detached
garrison
of
the
hill
at
Helions
Bumpstead
--
which
,
by
the
way
,
succeeded
in
holding
its
ground
all
day
,
despite
two
or
three
most
determined
assaults
by
the
enemy
--
to
Kelshall
on
the
left
of
the
British
position
,
would
be
an
impossibility
in
the
space
at
my
disposal
.
<EOS>
The
whole
morning
it
raged
all
along
the
northern
slopes
of
the
upland
held
by
our
gallant
troops
.
<EOS>
The
fiercest
fighting
was
,
perhaps
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Elmdon
,
where
our
trenches
were
more
than
once
captured
by
the
Magdeburg
battalions
,
only
to
be
themselves
hurled
out
again
by
the
rush
of
the
1st
Coldstream
Guards
,
who
had
been
held
in
reserve
near
the
threatened
point
.
<EOS>
By
noon
the
magnificent
old
palace
at
Audley
End
was
in
flames
.
<EOS>
Art
treasures
which
were
of
inestimable
value
and
absolutely
unreplaceable
perished
in
this
shocking
conflagration
.
<EOS>
Desperate
fighting
was
going
on
in
the
streets
of
the
little
town
of
Saffron
Walden
,
where
a
mingled
mass
of
Volunteers
and
Militia
strove
hard
to
arrest
the
advance
of
a
portion
of
the
German
Army
which
was
endeavouring
to
work
round
the
right
of
our
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
our
left
the
Foot
Guards
and
Fusiliers
of
the
1st
German
Guard
Division
,
after
receiving
a
terrible
pounding
from
our
guns
when
they
poured
into
Royston
at
the
heels
of
our
Mounted
Infantry
,
had
fought
their
way
up
the
heights
to
within
fifteen
hundred
yards
of
our
trenches
on
the
upper
slopes
of
the
ridge
.
<EOS>
Farther
than
that
they
had
been
unable
to
advance
.
<EOS>
Their
close
formations
offered
an
excellent
target
to
the
rifles
of
the
Volunteers
and
Militia
lining
our
entrenchments
.
<EOS>
The
attackers
had
lost
men
in
thousands
,
and
were
now
endeavouring
to
dig
themselves
in
as
best
they
could
under
the
hail
of
projectiles
that
continually
swept
the
hillside
.
<EOS>
About
noon
,
too
,
the
2nd
Division
of
the
Garde
Corps
,
after
some
skirmishing
with
the
Mounted
Infantry
away
on
our
left
front
,
got
into
attack
formation
along
the
line
of
the
Hitchin
and
Cambridge
Railway
,
and
after
pouring
a
deluge
of
projectiles
from
field
guns
and
howitzers
upon
our
position
,
advanced
upon
Therfield
with
the
greatest
bravery
and
determination
.
<EOS>
They
had
succeeded
by
2
p.m.
in
driving
our
men
from
the
end
of
the
spur
running
northward
near
Therfield
Heath
,
and
managed
to
get
a
number
of
their
howitzers
up
there
,
and
at
once
opened
fire
from
the
cover
afforded
by
several
copses
out
of
which
our
men
had
been
driven
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
things
were
beginning
to
look
very
bad
for
Old
England
,
and
the
watchers
on
the
Therfield
heights
turned
their
glasses
anxiously
northward
in
search
of
General
Sir
William
Packington
's
force
from
Potton
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
long
to
wait
.
<EOS>
At
2.15
the
winking
flash
of
a
heliograph
away
near
Wendy
Place
,
about
eight
miles
up
Ermine
Street
,
announced
that
the
advance
guard
,
consisting
of
the
1st
Royal
Welsh
Fusiliers
,
was
already
at
Bassingbourn
,
and
that
the
main
body
was
close
behind
,
having
escaped
detection
by
all
the
enemy
's
patrols
and
flank
guards
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
directly
in
the
rear
of
the
right
of
the
German
reserves
,
who
had
been
pushed
forward
into
the
neighbourhood
of
Royston
to
support
the
attack
of
their
main
body
on
the
British
position
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
later
it
was
evident
that
the
enemy
had
also
become
aware
of
their
advent
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
regiments
hurriedly
issued
from
Royston
and
deployed
to
the
north
-
west
.
<EOS>
But
the
guns
of
the
Baldock
Corps
turned
such
a
'
rafale
'
fire
upon
them
that
they
hesitated
and
were
lost
.
 
<EOS>
"
Every
long
-
range
gun
in
the
British
entrenchments
that
would
bear
was
also
turned
upon
them
,
leaving
the
infantry
and
field
guns
to
deal
with
the
troops
assaulting
their
position
.
<EOS>
The
three
battalions
,
as
well
as
a
fourth
that
was
sent
to
their
assistance
,
were
simply
swept
out
of
existence
by
this
terrible
cross
-
fire
.
<EOS>
Their
remnants
streamed
away
,
a
disorganised
crowd
of
scattered
stragglers
,
towards
Melbourn
;
while
,
still
holding
on
to
Bassingbourn
,
the
Baldock
force
moved
down
on
Royston
,
driving
everything
before
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
most
advanced
German
troops
made
a
final
effort
to
capture
our
position
when
they
saw
what
was
going
on
behind
them
,
but
it
was
half
-
hearted
;
they
were
brought
to
a
standstill
,
and
our
men
,
fixing
bayonets
,
sprang
from
their
trenches
and
charged
down
upon
them
with
cheers
,
which
were
taken
up
all
along
the
line
for
miles
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
here
and
there
made
a
partial
stand
,
but
in
half
an
hour
they
were
down
on
the
low
ground
,
falling
back
towards
the
north

east
in
the
greatest
confusion
,
losing
men
in
thousands
from
the
converging
fire
of
our
guns
.
<EOS>
Their
cavalry
made
a
gallant
attempt
to
save
the
day
by
charging
our
troops
to
the
north
of
Royston
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
magnificent
sight
to
see
their
enormous
masses
sweeping
over
the
ground
with
an
impetus
which
looked
capable
of
carrying
everything
before
it
,
but
our
men
,
clustering
behind
the
hedges
of
Ermine
Street
,
mowed
them
down
squadrons
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
them
reached
the
roadway
.
<EOS>
The
magnificent
Garde
Corps
was
routed

CHAPTER

BRITISH
ABANDON
COLCHESTER
.
  
<EOS>
On
Tuesday
,
10th
September
,
the
"
Daily
News
"
published
the
following
telegram
from
its
war
correspondent
,
Mr.
Edgar
Hamilton
:
     
"
CHELMSFORD

<EOS>
"
I
sit
down
,
after
a
sleepless
night
,
to
indite
the
account
of
our
latest
move
.
<EOS>
We
hear
that
Sheffield
has
fallen
,
and
our
troops
are
in
flight
.
<EOS>
As
,
by
the
time
this
appears
in
print
,
the
enemy
will
of
necessity
be
aware
of
our
abandonment
of
Colchester
,
the
censor
will
not
,
I
imagine
,
prevent
the
despatch
of
my
letter
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
our
move
has
been
made
one
of
a
retrograde
nature
,
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
cavalry
of
the
German
IXth
Corps
are
close
behind
us
and
in
touch
with
our
own
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
,
in
using
the
word
'
retrograde
,
'
be
supposed
to
criticise
in
any
way
the
strategy
of
our
generals
.
<EOS>
For
every
one
here
is
,
I
am
sure
,
fully
persuaded
of
the
wisdom
of
the
step
.
<EOS>
Colchester
,
with
its
plucky
little
garrison
,
was
altogether
too
much
'
in
the
air
,
'
and
stood
a
great
risk
of
being
isolated
by
a
converging
advance
of
the
IXth
and
Xth
Corps
of
the
German
invaders
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
XIIth
(
Saxon
)
Corps
at
Maldon
,
which
since
the
unfortunate
battle
of
Purleigh
has
shown
itself
very
active
to
the
north
and
east
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Saxons
have
refrained
from
attacking
our
Vth
Corps
since
its
repulse
,
and
it
has
been
left
almost
in
peace
to
entrench
its
position
from
Danbury
to
the
southward
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
while
not
neglecting
to
further
strengthen
their
already
formidable
defences
between
the
Blackwater
and
the
Crouch
,
their
cavalry
have
scoured
the
country
up
to
the
very
gates
of
Colchester
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
morning
the
16th
Lancers
and
the
17th
Hussars
--
who
had
fallen
back
from
Norwich
--
together
with
some
of
the
local
Yeomanry
,
moved
out
by
the
Tolleshunt
d'Arcy
and
Great
Totham
roads
,
and
drove
in
their
patrols
with
some
loss
.
<EOS>
At
Tiptree
Heath
there
was
a
sharp
cavalry
engagement
between
our
red
Lancers
and
several
squadrons
of
a
sky
-
blue
hussar
regiment
.
<EOS>
Our
people
routed
them
,
but
in
the
pursuit
that
followed
would
have
fared
badly
,
as
they
fell
in
with
the
four
remaining
squadrons
supported
by
another
complete
regiment
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
opportune
arrival
of
the
Household
Cavalry
Brigade
,
which
had
moved
north
-
east
from
Danbury
to
co
-
operate
.
<EOS>
This
completely
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
were
soundly
beaten
,
with
the
loss
of
a
large
number
of
prisoners
,
and
galloped
back
to
Maldon
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
the
2nd
King
's
Own
Royal
Lancaster
Regiment
and
the
5th
Battery
R.F.
Artillery
had
been
sent
down
to
Witham
by
train
,
whence
they
marched
up
to
the
high
ground
near
Wickham
Bishops
.
<EOS>
They
and
the
Yeomanry
were
left
there
in
a
position
to
cover
the
main
London
Road
and
the
Great
Eastern
Railway
,
and
at
the
same
time
threaten
any
movement
of
the
enemy
by
the
Great
Totham
Road
.
<EOS>
When
the
news
of
our
success
reached
Colchester
,
soon
after
midday
,
we
were
all
very
jubilant
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
fear
that
a
great
many
people
spent
the
afternoon
in
a
species
of
fool
's
paradise
.
<EOS>
And
when
towards
the
evening
the
announcement
of
our
splendid
victory
at
Royston
was
posted
up
on
the
red
walls
of
the
fine
town
hall
,
and
outside
the
Cups
,
there
was
an
incipient
outbreak
of
that
un
-
English
excitement
known
as
'
Mafficking
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
But
this
exultation
was
fated
to
be
but
short
-
lived
,
even
though
the
Mayor
appeared
on
the
balcony
of
the
Town
Hall
and
addressed
the
crowd
,
while
the
latest
news
was
posted
outside
the
offices
of
the
'
Essex
Telegraph
,
'
opposite
the
post
office
.
<EOS>
The
wind
was
in
the
north
,
and
about
5.45
in
the
afternoon
the
sound
of
a
heavy
explosion
was
heard
from
the
direction
of
Manningtree
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
Cups
Hotel
at
the
time
arranging
for
an
early
dinner
,
and
ran
out
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
As
I
emerged
from
the
archway
of
the
hotel
I
distinctly
heard
a
second
detonation
from
the
same
direction
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
silence
,
ominous
and
unnatural
,
seemed
to
fall
on
the
yelping
jingoes
in
the
street
,
in
the
midst
of
which
the
rumble
of
yet
another
explosion
rolled
down
on
the
wind
,
this
time
from
a
more
westerly
direction
.
<EOS>
Men
asked
their
neighbours
breathlessly
as
to
what
all
this
portended
.
<EOS>
I
myself
knew
no
more
than
the
most
ignorant
of
the
crowd
,
till
in
an
officer
who
rushed
hastily
by
me
in
Head
Street
,
on
his
way
into
the
hotel
,
I
recognised
my
friend
Captain
Burton
,
of
the
Artillery
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
buttonholed
him
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Do
I
know
what
those
explosions
were
?
'
repeated
he
in
answer
to
my
inquiry
.
'
<EOS>
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
but
I
'm
open
to
bet
you
five
to
one
that
it
's
the
sappers
blowing
up
the
bridges
over
the
Stour
at
Manningtree
and
Stratford
St.
Mary
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
Then
the
Germans
will
have
arrived
there
?
'
<EOS>
I
queried
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Most
probably
.
<EOS>
And
look
here
,
'
he
continued
,
taking
me
aside
by
the
arm
,
and
lowering
his
voice
,
'
you
take
my
tip
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
out
of
this
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
So
you
'd
best
pack
up
your
traps
and
get
into
marching
order
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
Do
you
know
this
?
'
<EOS>
said
I.
 
"
'
Not
officially
,
or
<EOS>
I
should
n't
tell
you
anything
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
put
two
and
two
together
.
<EOS>
We
all
knew
that
the
General
would
n't
be
fool
enough
to
try
and
defend
an
open
town
of
this
size
with
such
a
small
garrison
against
a
whole
army
corps
,
or
perhaps
more
.
<EOS>
It
would
serve
no
good
purpose
,
and
expose
the
place
to
destruction
and
bring
all
sorts
of
disaster
on
the
civil
population
.
<EOS>
You
could
have
seen
that
for
yourself
,
for
no
attempt
whatever
has
been
made
to
erect
defences
of
any
kind
,
neither
have
we
received
any
reinforcements
at
all
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
meant
to
defend
it
they
could
certainly
have
contrived
to
send
us
some
Volunteers
and
guns
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
No
,
the
few
troops
we
have
here
have
done
their
best
in
assisting
the
Danbury
Force
against
the
Saxons
,
and
are
much
too
valuable
to
be
left
here
to
be
cut
off
without
being
able
to
do
much
to
check
the
advance
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
If
we
had
been
going
to
try
anything
of
that
kind
,
we
should
have
now
been
holding
the
line
of
the
river
Stour
;
but
I
know
we
have
only
small
detachments
at
the
various
bridges
,
sufficient
only
to
drive
off
the
enemy
's
cavalry
patrols
.
<EOS>
By
now
,
having
blown
up
the
bridges
,
I
expect
they
are
falling
back
as
fast
as
they
can
get
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
look
here
,
'
he
added
,
'
what
do
you
think
that
battalion
was
sent
to
Wickham
Bishops
for
this
morning
?
'
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
my
theories
as
set
forth
above
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Oh
,
yes
,
that
's
all
right
,
'
he
answered
.
'
<EOS>
But
you
may
bet
your
boots
that
there
's
more
in
it
than
that
.
<EOS>
In
my
opinion
,
the
General
has
had
orders
to
clear
out
as
soon
as
the
enemy
are
preparing
to
cross
the
Stour
,
and
the
Lancasters
are
planted
there
to
protect
our
left
flank
from
an
attack
from
Maldon
while
we
are
retreating
on
Chelmsford
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
But
we
might
fall
back
on
Braintree
?
'
<EOS>
I
hazarded
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Do
n't
you
believe
it
.
<EOS>
We
're
not
wanted
there
--
at
least
,
I
mean
,
not
so
much
as
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Where
we
shall
come
in
is
to
help
to
fill
the
gap
between
Braintree
and
Danbury
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
myself
,
we
might
just
as
well
have
done
it
before
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
sending
back
stores
by
rail
for
the
last
two
days
.
<EOS>
Well
,
good
-
bye
,
'
he
said
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
'
<EOS>
Keep
all
this
to
yourself
,
and
mark
my
words
,
we
'll
be
off
at
dusk
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
Away
he
went
,
and
convinced
that
his
prognostications
were
correct
--
as
,
indeed
,
in
the
main
they
proved
--
I
hastened
to
eat
my
dinner
,
pay
my
bill
,
and
get
my
portmanteau
packed
and
stowed
away
in
my
motor
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
evening
began
to
close
in
I
started
and
made
for
the
barracks
,
going
easy
.
<EOS>
The
streets
were
still
full
of
people
,
but
they
were
very
quiet
,
and
mostly
talking
together
in
scattered
groups
.
<EOS>
A
shadow
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
the
jubilant
crowd
of
the
afternoon
,
though
,
as
far
as
I
could
ascertain
,
there
were
no
definite
rumours
of
the
departure
of
the
troops
and
the
close
advent
of
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
arrived
at
the
barracks
,
I
saw
at
once
that
there
was
something
in
the
wind
,
and
pulled
up
alongside
the
barrack
railings
,
determined
to
watch
the
progress
of
events
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
long
to
wait
.
<EOS>
In
about
ten
minutes
a
bugle
sounded
,
and
the
scattered
assemblage
of
men
on
the
barrack
-
square
closed
together
and
solidified
into
a
series
of
quarter
columns
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
Volunteer
battalion
moved
across
from
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
joined
the
Regular
troops
.
<EOS>
I
heard
a
sharp
clatter
and
jingling
behind
me
,
and
,
looking
round
,
saw
the
General
and
his
staff
with
a
squad
of
cavalry
canter
up
the
road
.
<EOS>
They
turned
into
the
barrack
gate
,
greeted
by
a
sharp
word
of
command
and
the
rattle
of
arms
from
the
assembled
battalions
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
could
make
out
,
the
General
made
them
some
kind
of
address
,
after
which
I
heard
another
word
of
command
,
upon
which
the
regiment
nearest
to
the
gate
formed
fours
and
marched
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
2nd
Dorsetshire
.
<EOS>
I
watched
anxiously
to
see
which
way
they
turned
.
<EOS>
As
I
more
than
expected
,
they
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
London
Road
.
<EOS>
My
friend
had
been
right
so
far
,
but
till
the
troops
arrived
at
Mark
's
Tey
,
where
the
road
forked
,
I
could
not
be
certain
whether
they
were
going
towards
Braintree
or
Chelmsford
.
<EOS>
The
Volunteers
followed
;
then
the
Leicestershires
,
then
a
long
train
of
artillery
,
field
batteries
,
big
4.7
guns
,
and
howitzers
.
<EOS>
The
King
's
Own
Scottish
Borderers
formed
the
rearguard
.
<EOS>
With
them
marched
the
General
and
his
staff
;
I
saw
no
cavalry
.
<EOS>
I
discovered
afterwards
that
the
General
,
foreseeing
that
a
retirement
was
imminent
,
had
ordered
the
16th
Lancers
and
the
7th
Hussars
,
after
their
successful
morning
performance
,
to
remain
till
further
orders
at
Kelvedon
and
Tiptree
respectively
,
so
that
their
horses
were
resting
during
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
"
During
the
night
march
the
former
came
back
and
formed
a
screen
behind
the
retiring
column
,
while
the
latter
were
in
a
position
to
observe
and
check
any
movement
northwards
that
might
be
made
by
the
Saxons
,
at
the
same
time
protecting
its
flank
and
rear
from
a
possible
advance
by
the
cavalry
of
Von
Kronhelm
's
Army
,
should
they
succeed
in
crossing
the
river
Stour
soon
enough
to
be
able
to
press
after
us
in
pursuit
by
either
of
the
two
eastern
roads
leading
from
Colchester
to
Maldon
.
<EOS>
After
the
last
of
the
departing
soldiers
had
tramped
away
into
the
gathering
darkness
through
the
mud
,
which
after
yesterday
's
downpour
still
lay
thick
upon
the
roads
,
I
bethought
me
that
I
might
as
well
run
down
to
the
railway
station
to
see
if
anything
was
going
on
there
.
<EOS>
I
was
just
in
time
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
electric
light
disclosed
a
bustling
scene
as
the
last
of
the
ammunition
and
a
certain
proportion
of
stores
were
being
hurried
into
a
long
train
that
stood
with
steam
up
ready
to
be
off
.
<EOS>
The
police
allowed
none
of
the
general
public
to
enter
the
station
,
but
my
correspondent
's
pass
obtained
me
admission
to
the
departure
platform
.
<EOS>
There
I
saw
several
detachments
of
the
Royal
Engineers
,
the
Mounted
Infantry
--
minus
their
horses
,
which
had
been
already
sent
on
--
and
some
of
the
Leicestershire
Regiment
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
men
had
their
arms
,
legs
,
or
heads
bandaged
,
and
bore
evident
traces
of
having
been
in
action
.
<EOS>
I
got
into
conversation
with
a
colour
-
sergeant
of
the
Engineers
,
and
learned
these
were
the
detachments
who
had
been
stationed
at
the
bridges
over
the
Stour
.
<EOS>
It
appears
there
was
some
sharp
skirmishing
with
the
German
advance
troops
before
the
officers
in
command
had
decided
that
they
were
in
sufficient
force
to
justify
them
in
blowing
up
the
bridges
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
at
the
one
at
which
my
informant
was
stationed
,
and
that
the
most
important
one
of
all
,
over
which
the
main
road
from
Ipswich
passed
at
Stratford
St.
Mary
,
the
officer
in
charge
delayed
just
too
long
,
so
that
a
party
of
the
enemy
's
cavalry
actually
secured
the
bridge
,
and
succeeded
in
cutting
the
wires
leading
to
the
charges
which
had
been
placed
in
readiness
to
blow
it
up
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
the
various
detachments
present
rose
like
one
man
to
the
occasion
,
and
,
despite
a
heavy
fire
,
hurled
themselves
upon
the
intruders
with
the
bayonet
with
such
determination
and
impetus
,
that
the
bridge
was
swept
clear
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
The
wires
were
reconnected
,
and
the
bridge
cleared
of
our
men
just
as
the
Germans
,
reinforced
by
several
of
their
supporting
squadrons
,
who
had
come
up
at
a
gallop
,
dashed
upon
it
in
pursuit
.
<EOS>
The
firing
key
was
pressed
at
this
critical
moment
,
and
,
with
a
stunning
report
,
a
whole
troop
was
blown
into
the
air
,
the
remaining
horses
,
mad
with
fright
,
stampeding
despite
all
that
their
riders
could
do
.
<EOS>
The
road
was
cut
,
and
the
German
advance
temporarily
checked
,
while
the
British
detachment
made
off
as
fast
as
it
could
for
Colchester
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
asked
the
sergeant
how
long
he
thought
it
would
be
before
the
Germans
succeeded
in
crossing
it
.
'
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
expect
they
're
over
by
now
,
'
he
answered
.
'
They
would
be
sure
to
have
their
bridging
companies
somewhere
close
up
,
and
it
would
not
take
them
more
than
an
hour
or
two
to
throw
a
bridge
over
that
place
.
'
<EOS>
The
bridges
at
Boxted
Mill
and
Nayland
had
been
destroyed
previously
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
railway
bridge
and
the
other
one
at
Manningtree
were
blown
up
before
the
Germans
could
get
a
footing
,
and
their
defenders
had
come
in
by
rail
.
<EOS>
But
my
conversation
was
cut
short
,
the
whistle
sounded
,
the
men
were
hustled
on
board
the
train
,
and
it
moved
slowly
out
of
the
station
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
hurried
out
to
my
car
,
and
,
putting
on
speed
,
was
soon
clear
of
the
town
,
and
spinning
along
for
Mark
's
Tey
.
<EOS>
It
is
about
five
miles
,
and
shortly
before
I
got
there
I
overtook
the
marching
column
.
<EOS>
The
men
were
halted
,
and
in
the
act
of
putting
on
their
greatcoats
.
<EOS>
I
was
stopped
here
by
the
rearguard
,
who
took
charge
of
me
,
and
would
not
let
me
proceed
until
permission
was
obtained
from
the
General
.
 
<EOS>
"
Eventually
this
officer
ordered
me
to
be
brought
to
him
<EOS>
,
I
presented
my
pass
;
but
he
said
,
'
I
am
afraid
that
I
shall
have
to
ask
you
either
to
turn
back
or
to
slow
down
and
keep
pace
with
us
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
you
had
better
do
the
latter
.
<EOS>
I
might
,
indeed
,
have
to
exercise
my
powers
and
impress
your
motor
,
should
the
exigencies
of
the
Service
require
it
.
'
<EOS>
I
saw
that
it
was
best
to
make
virtue
of
necessity
,
and
replied
that
it
was
very
much
at
his
service
,
and
that
I
was
very
well
content
to
accompany
the
column
.
<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
,
the
latter
was
strictly
true
,
for
I
wanted
to
see
what
was
to
be
seen
,
and
there
were
no
points
about
going
along
with
no
definite
idea
of
where
I
wanted
to
get
to
,
with
a
possible
chance
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
Saxons
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
So
a
Staff
officer
,
who
was
suffering
from
a
slight
wound
,
was
placed
alongside
me
,
and
the
column
,
having
muffled
itself
in
its
greatcoats
,
once
more
began
to
plug
along
through
the
thickening
mire
.
<EOS>
My
position
was
just
in
front
of
the
guns
,
which
kept
up
a
monotonous
rumble
behind
me
.
<EOS>
My
companion
was
talkative
,
and
afforded
me
a
good
deal
of
incidental
and
welcome
information
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
just
after
we
started
,
and
were
turning
to
the
left
at
Mark
's
Tey
,
a
bright
glare
followed
by
a
loudish
report
came
from
the
right
of
the
road
.
'
<EOS>
What
's
that
?
'
<EOS>
I
naturally
ejaculated
.
'
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
will
be
the
sappers
destroying
the
junction
with
the
Sudbury
line
,
'
he
replied
.
'
<EOS>
There
's
the
train
waiting
for
them
just
beyond
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
So
it
was
.
<EOS>
The
train
that
I
had
seen
leaving
had
evidently
stopped
after
passing
the
junction
,
while
the
line
was
broken
behind
it
.
'
<EOS>
They
will
do
the
same
after
passing
the
cross
line
at
Witham
,
'
volunteered
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
mile
or
two
further
on
we
passed
between
two
lines
of
horsemen
,
their
faces
set
northwards
and
muffled
to
the
eyes
in
their
long
cloaks
.
'
<EOS>
That
's
some
of
the
16th
,
'
he
said
,
'
going
to
cover
our
rear
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
So
we
moved
on
all
night
through
the
darkness
and
rain
,
and
with
the
first
glimmer
of
dawn
halted
at
Witham
.
<EOS>
We
had
about
nine
miles
still
to
go
to
reach
Chelmsford
,
which
I
learned
was
our
immediate
destination
,
and
it
was
decided
to
rest
here
for
an
hour
,
while
the
men
made
the
best
breakfast
they
could
from
the
contents
of
their
haversacks
.
<EOS>
But
the
villagers
brought
out
hot
tea
and
coffee
,
and
did
the
best
they
could
for
us
,
so
we
did
not
fare
so
badly
after
all
.
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
got
permission
to
go
on
,
taking
with
me
my
friend
the
Staff
officer
,
who
had
despatches
to
forward
from
Chelmsford
.
<EOS>
I
pushed
on
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
We
were
there
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
,
and
during
the
morning
I
learned
that
the
Braintree
Army
was
falling
back
on
Dunmow
,
and
that
the
Colchester
garrison
was
to
assist
in
holding
the
line
of
the
river
Chelmer
.

CHAPTER

<EOS>
FIERCE
FIGHTING
AT
CHELMSFORD
.
  
<EOS>
A
despatch
from
Mr.
Edgar
Hamilton
to
the
"
Daily
News
,
"
as
follows
,
was
published
on
Saturday
,
15th
September
:
 
<EOS>
"
At
Little
Waltham
I
found
myself
close
to
the
scene
of
action
.
<EOS>
About
a
mile
ahead
of
me
the
hamlet
of
Howe
Street
was
in
flames
and
burning
furiously
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
shells
bursting
in
and
all
over
it
in
perfect
coveys
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
make
out
where
they
were
coming
from
,
but
an
officer
I
met
said
he
thought
the
enemy
must
have
several
batteries
in
action
on
the
high
ground
about
Littley
Green
,
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
north
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
crossed
over
myself
,
and
got
up
on
the
knoll
where
the
Leicestershires
and
Dorsets
had
been
stationed
,
together
with
a
number
of
the
4.7-inch
guns
brought
from
Colchester
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
piece
of
elevated
ground
is
about
two
miles
long
,
running
almost
north
and
south
,
and
at
the
top
of
it
I
got
an
extensive
view
to
the
eastward
right
away
to
beyond
Witham
,
as
the
ground
fell
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
The
country
was
well
wooded
,
and
a
perfect
maze
of
trees
and
hedgerows
.
<EOS>
If
there
were
any
Germans
down
there
in
this
plain
they
were
lying
very
low
indeed
,
for
my
glasses
did
not
discover
the
least
indication
of
their
presence
.
<EOS>
Due
east
my
view
was
bounded
by
the
high
wooded
ground
about
Wickham
Bishops
and
Tiptree
Heath
,
which
lay
a
long
blue
hummock
on
the
horizon
,
while
to
the
south
-
east
Danbury
Hill
,
with
our
big
war
-
balloon
floating
overhead
,
was
plainly
discernible
.
 
<EOS>
"
While
I
gazed
on
the
apparently
peaceful
landscape
I
was
startled
by
a
nasty
,
sharp
hissing
sound
,
which
came
momentarily
nearer
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
pass
over
my
head
,
and
was
followed
by
a
loud
bang
in
the
air
,
where
now
hung
a
ring
of
white
smoke
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
shell
from
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Just
ahead
of
me
was
a
somewhat
extensive
wood
;
and
,
urged
by
some
insane
impulse
of
seeking
shelter
<EOS>
,
I
left
the
car
,
which
I
ordered
my
chauffeur
to
take
back
for
a
mile
and
wait
,
and
made
for
the
close
-
standing
trees
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
stopped
to
think
I
should
have
realised
that
the
wood
gave
me
actually
no
protection
whatever
,
and
I
had
not
gone
far
when
the
crashing
of
timber
and
noise
of
the
bursting
projectiles
overhead
and
in
the
undergrowth
around
made
me
understand
clearly
that
the
Germans
were
making
a
special
target
of
the
wood
,
which
,
I
imagine
,
they
thought
might
conceal
some
of
our
troops
.
<EOS>
I
wished
heartily
that
I
was
seated
beside
my
chauffeur
in
his
fast
-
receding
car
.
 
<EOS>
"
However
,
my
first
object
was
to
get
clear
of
the
wood
again
,
and
after
some
little
time
I
emerged
on
the
west
side
,
right
in
the
middle
of
a
dressing
station
for
the
wounded
,
which
had
been
established
in
a
little
hollow
.
<EOS>
Two
surgeons
,
with
their
assistants
,
were
already
busily
engaged
with
a
number
of
wounded
men
,
most
of
whom
were
badly
hit
by
shrapnel
bullets
about
the
upper
part
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
I
gathered
from
one
or
two
of
the
few
most
slightly
wounded
men
that
our
people
had
been
,
and
were
,
very
hardly
put
to
it
to
hold
their
own
.
'
<EOS>
I
reckon
,
'
said
one
of
them
,
a
bombardier
of
artillery
,
'
that
the
enemy
must
have
got
more
than
a
hundred
guns
firing
at
us
,
and
at
Howe
Street
village
.
<EOS>
If
we
could
only
make
out
where
the
foreign
devils
were
,
'
continued
my
informant
,
'
our
chaps
could
have
knocked
a
good
many
of
them
out
with
our
four
-
point
-
sevens
,
especially
if
we
could
have
got
a
go
at
them
before
they
got
within
range
themselves
.
<EOS>
But
they
must
have
somehow
contrived
to
get
them
into
position
during
the
night
,
for
we
saw
nothing
of
them
coming
up
.
<EOS>
They
are
somewhere
about
Chatley
,
Fairstead
Lodge
,
and
Little
Leighs
,
but
as
we
ca
n't
locate
them
exactly
,
and
only
have
ten
guns
up
here
,
it
do
n't
give
us
much
chance
,
does
it
?
'
<EOS>
Later
I
saw
an
officer
of
the
Dorsets
,
who
confirmed
the
gunner
's
story
,
but
added
that
our
people
were
well
entrenched
and
the
guns
well
concealed
,
so
that
none
of
the
latter
had
been
put
out
of
action
,
and
he
thought
we
should
be
able
to
hold
on
to
the
hill
all
right
.
<EOS>
I
regained
my
car
without
further
adventure
,
bar
several
narrow
escapes
from
stray
shell
,
and
made
my
way
back
as
quickly
as
possible
to
Chelmsford
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
firing
went
on
all
day
,
not
only
to
the
northward
,
but
also
away
to
the
southward
,
where
the
Saxons
,
while
not
making
any
determined
attack
,
kept
the
Vth
Corps
continually
on
the
alert
,
and
there
was
an
almost
continuous
duel
between
the
heavy
pieces
.
<EOS>
As
it
appeared
certain
that
the
knoll
I
had
visited
in
the
forenoon
was
the
main
objective
of
the
enemy
's
attack
,
reinforcements
had
been
more
than
once
sent
up
there
,
but
the
German
shell
fire
was
so
heavy
that
they
found
it
almost
impossible
to
construct
the
additional
cover
required
.
<EOS>
Several
batteries
of
artillery
were
despatched
to
Pleshy
and
Rolphy
Green
to
keep
down
,
if
possible
,
the
fire
of
the
Germans
,
but
it
seemed
to
increase
rather
than
diminish
.
<EOS>
They
must
have
had
more
guns
in
action
than
they
had
at
first
.
<EOS>
Just
at
dusk
their
infantry
had
made
the
first
openly
offensive
movement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Several
lines
of
skirmishers
suddenly
appeared
in
the
valley
between
Little
Leighs
and
Chatley
,
and
advanced
towards
Lyonshall
Wood
,
at
the
north
end
of
the
knoll
east
of
Little
Waltham
.
<EOS>
They
were
at
first
invisible
from
the
British
gun
positions
on
the
other
side
of
the
Chelmer
,
and
when
they
cleared
the
spur
on
which
Hyde
Hall
stands
they
were
hardly
discernible
in
the
gathering
darkness
.
<EOS>
The
Dorsetshire
and
the
other
battalions
garrisoning
the
knoll
manned
their
breastworks
as
they
got
within
rifle
range
,
and
opened
fire
,
but
they
were
still
subjected
to
the
infernal
rafale
from
the
Hanoverian
guns
on
the
hills
to
the
northward
,
and
to
make
matters
worse
at
this
critical
moment
<EOS>
the
Xth
Corps
brought
a
long
line
of
guns
into
action
between
Flacks
Green
and
Great
Leighs
Wood
,
in
which
position
none
of
the
British
guns
except
a
few
on
the
knoll
itself
could
reach
them
.
<EOS>
Under
this
cross
hurricane
of
projectiles
the
British
fire
was
quite
beaten
down
,
and
the
Germans
followed
up
their
skirmishers
by
almost
solid
masses
,
which
advanced
with
all
but
impunity
save
for
the
fire
of
the
few
British
long
-
range
guns
at
Pleshy
Mount
.
<EOS>
There
they
were
firing
almost
at
random
,
as
the
gunners
could
not
be
certain
of
the
exact
whereabouts
of
their
objectives
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
searchlight
on
the
knoll
,
but
at
the
first
sweep
of
its
ray
it
was
absolutely
demolished
by
a
blizzard
of
shrapnel
.
<EOS>
Every
German
gun
was
turned
upon
it
.
<EOS>
The
Hanoverian
battalions
now
swarmed
to
the
assault
,
disregarding
the
gaps
made
in
their
ranks
by
the
magazine
fire
of
the
defenders
as
soon
as
their
close
advance
masked
the
fire
of
their
own
cannon
.

Evening

<EOS>
"
The
British
fought
desperately
.
<EOS>
Three
several
times
they
hurled
back
at
the
attackers
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
we
were
overborne
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
.
<EOS>
Reinforcements
summoned
by
telephone
,
as
soon
as
the
determined
nature
of
the
attack
was
apparent
,
were
hurried
up
from
every
available
source
,
but
they
only
arrived
in
time
to
be
carried
down
the
hill
again
in
the
rush
of
its
defeated
defenders
,
and
to
share
with
them
the
storm
of
projectiles
from
the
quick
-
firers
of
General
von
Kronhelm
's
artillery
,
which
had
been
pushed
forward
during
the
assault
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
the
shattered
and
disorganised
troops
were
got
over
the
river
at
Little
Waltham
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
hundreds
were
drowned
in
the
little
stream
,
and
hundreds
of
others
killed
and
wounded
by
the
fire
of
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
They
had
won
the
first
trick
.
<EOS>
This
was
indisputable
,
and
as
ill
news
travels
apace
,
a
feeling
of
gloom
fell
upon
our
whole
force
,
for
it
was
realised
that
the
possession
of
the
captured
knoll
would
enable
the
enemy
to
mass
troops
almost
within
effective
rifle
range
of
our
river
line
of
defence
.
<EOS>
I
believe
that
it
was
proposed
by
some
officers
on
the
staff
that
we
should
wheel
back
our
left
and
take
up
a
fresh
position
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
This
was
overruled
,
as
it
was
recognised
that
to
do
so
would
enable
the
enemy
to
push
in
between
the
Dunmow
force
and
our
own
,
and
so
cut
our
general
line
in
half
.
<EOS>
All
that
could
be
done
was
to
get
up
every
available
gun
and
bombard
the
hill
during
the
night
in
order
to
hamper
the
enemy
in
his
preparations
for
further
forward
movement
and
in
his
entrenching
operations
.
 
<EOS>
"
Had
we
more
men
at
our
disposal
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
is
little
doubt
that
a
strong
counter
-
attack
would
have
been
made
on
the
knoll
almost
immediately
;
but
in
the
face
of
the
enormous
numbers
opposed
to
us
,
I
imagine
that
General
Blennerhasset
did
not
feel
justified
in
denuding
any
portion
of
our
position
of
its
defenders
.
<EOS>
So
all
through
the
dark
hours
the
thunder
of
the
great
guns
went
on
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
the
cannonade
the
Germans
turned
on
no
less
than
three
searchlights
from
the
southern
end
of
the
knoll
about
midnight
.
<EOS>
Two
were
at
once
put
out
by
our
fire
,
but
the
third
managed
to
exist
for
over
half
an
hour
,
and
enabled
the
Germans
to
see
how
hard
we
were
working
to
improve
our
defences
along
the
river
bank
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
that
they
were
by
this
means
able
to
make
themselves
acquainted
with
the
positions
of
a
great
number
of
our
trenches
.
<EOS>
During
the
night
our
patrols
reported
being
unable
to
penetrate
beyond
Pratt
's
Farm
,
Mount
Maskell
,
and
Porter
's
Farm
on
the
Colchester
Road
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
they
were
forced
back
by
superior
numbers
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
were
fast
closing
in
upon
us
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
terrible
night
in
Chelmsford
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
panic
on
every
hand
.
<EOS>
A
man
mounted
the
Tindal
statue
and
harangued
the
crowd
,
urging
the
people
to
rise
and
compel
the
Government
to
stop
the
war
.
<EOS>
A
few
young
men
endeavoured
to
load
the
old
Crimean
cannon
in
front
of
the
Shire
Hall
,
but
found
it
clogged
with
rust
and
useless
.
<EOS>
People
fled
from
the
villa
residences
in
Brentwood
Road
into
the
town
for
safety
,
now
that
the
enemy
were
upon
them
.
<EOS>
The
banks
in
High
Street
were
being
barricaded
,
and
the
stores
still
remaining
in
the
various
grocers
'
shops
,
Luckin
Smith
's
,
Martin
's
,
Cramphorn
's
,
and
Pearke
's
,
were
rapidly
being
concealed
from
the
invaders
.
<EOS>
All
the
ambulance
waggons
entering
the
town
were
filled
with
wounded
,
although
as
many
as
possible
were
sent
south
by
train
.
<EOS>
By
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
however
,
most
of
the
civilian
inhabitants
had
fled
.
<EOS>
The
streets
were
empty
,
but
for
the
bivouacking
troops
and
the
never
-
ending
procession
of
wounded
men
.
<EOS>
The
General
and
his
staff
were
deliberating
to
a
late
hour
in
the
Shire
Hall
,
at
which
he
had
established
his
headquarters
.
<EOS>
The
booming
of
the
guns
waxed
and
waned
till
dawn
,
when
a
furious
outburst
announced
that
the
second
act
of
the

"
I
had
betaken
myself
at
once
to
the
round
tower
of
the
church
,
next
the
Stone
Bridge
,
from
which
I
had
an
excellent
view
<EOS>
both
east
and
north
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
that
attracted
my
eye
was
the
myriad
flashings
of
rifle
fire
in
the
dimness
of
the
breaking
day
.
<EOS>
They
reached
in
a
continuous
line
of
coruscations
from
Boreham
Hall
,
opposite
my
right
hand
,
to
the
knoll
by
Little
Waltham
,
a
distance
of
three
or
four
miles
,
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
were
driving
in
all
our
outlying
and
advanced
troops
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
.
<EOS>
Presently
the
heavy
batteries
at
Danbury
began
pitching
shell
over
in
the
direction
of
the
firing
,
but
as
the
German
line
still
advanced
,
it
had
not
apparently
any
very
great
effect
.
<EOS>
The
next
thing
that
happened
was
a
determined
attack
on
the
village
of
Howe
Street
made
from
the
direction
of
Hyde
Hall
.
<EOS>
This
is
about
two
miles
north
of
Little
Waltham
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
our
incessant
fire
,
the
Germans
had
contrived
to
mass
a
tremendous
number
of
guns
and
howitzers
on
and
behind
the
knoll
they
captured
last
night
,
and
there
was
any
quantity
more
on
the
ridge
above
Hyde
Hall
.
<EOS>
All
these
terrible
weapons
concentrated
their
fire
for
a
few
moments
on
the
blackened
ruins
of
Howe
Street
.
<EOS>
Not
a
mouse
could
have
lived
there
.
<EOS>
The
little
place
was
simply
pulverised
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
guns
at
Pleshy
Mount
and
Rolphy
Green
,
aided
by
a
number
of
field
batteries
,
in
vain
endeavoured
to
make
head
against
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
outnumbered
by
six
to
one
.
<EOS>
Under
cover
of
this
tornado
of
iron
and
fire
,
the
enemy
pushed
several
battalions
over
the
river
,
making
use
of
the
ruins
of
the
many
bridges
about
there
which
had
been
hastily
destroyed
,
and
which
they
repaired
with
planks
and
other
materials
they
brought
along
with
them
.
<EOS>
They
lost
a
large
number
of
men
in
the
process
,
but
they
persevered
,
and
by
ten
o'clock
were
in
complete
possession
of
Howe
Street
,
Langley
's
Park
,
and
Great
Waltham
,
and
moving
in
fighting
formation
against
Pleshy
Mount
and
Rolphy

their
guns
covering
their
advance
with
a

awful
discharge
of
shrapnel
.
<EOS>
Our
cannon
on
the
ridge
at
Partridge
Green
took
the
attackers
in
flank
,
and
for
a
time
checked
their
advance
,
but
,
drawing
upon
themselves
the
attention
of
the
German
artillery
,
on
the
south
end
of
the
knoll
,
were
all
but
silenced
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
this
was
effected
another
strong
column
of
Germans
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
the
first
,
and
deploying
to
the
left
,
secured
the
bridge
at
Little
Waltham
,
and
advanced
against
the
gun
positions
on
Partridge
Green
.
<EOS>
This
move
turned
all
our
river
bank
entrenchments
right
down
to
Chelmsford
.
<EOS>
Their
defenders
were
now
treated
to
the
enfilade
fire
of
a
number
of
Hanoverian
batteries
that
galloped
down
to
Little
Waltham
.
<EOS>
They
stuck
to
their
trenches
gallantly
,
but
presently
when
the
enemy
obtained
a
footing
on
Partridge
Green
they
were
taken
in
reverse
,
and
compelled
to
fall
back
,
suffering
terrible
losses
as
they
did
so
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
infantry
of
the
Xth
Corps
,
supported
--
as
we
understand
--
by
a
division
which
had
joined
them
from
Maldon
,
now
moved
down
on
Chelmsford
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
there
was
a
general
advance
of
the
three
combined
armies
stretching
from
Partridge
Green
on
the
west
to
the
railway
line
on
the
east
.
<EOS>
The
defenders
of
the
trenches
facing
east
were
hastily
withdrawn
,
and
thrown
back
on
Writtle
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
followed
closely
with
both
infantry
and
guns
,
though
they
were
for
a
time
checked
near
Scot
's
Green
by
a
dashing
charge
of
our
cavalry
brigade
,
consisting
of
the
16th
Lancers
and
the
7th
,
14th
,
and
20th
Hussars
,
and
the
Essex
and
Middlesex
Yeomanry
.
<EOS>
We
saw
nothing
of
their
cavalry
,
for
a
reason
that
will
be
apparent
later
.
<EOS>
By
one
o'clock
fierce
fighting
was
going
on
all
round
the
town
,
the
German
hordes
enveloping
it
on
all
sides
but
one
.
<EOS>
We
had
lost
a
great
number
of
our
guns
,
or
at
any
rate
had
been
cut
off
from
them
by
the
German
successes
around
Pleshy
Mount
,
and
in
all
their
assaults
on
the
town
they
had
been
careful
to
keep
out
of
effective
range
of
the
heavy
batteries
on
Danbury
Hill
.
<EOS>
These
,
by
the
way
,
had
their
own
work
cut
out
for
them
,
as
the
Saxon
artillery
were
heavily
bombarding
the
hill
with
their
howitzers
.
<EOS>
The
British
forces
were
in
a
critical
situation
.
<EOS>
Reinforcements
--
such
as
could
be
spared
--
were
hurried
up
from
the
Vth
Army
Corps
,
but
they
were
not
very
many
in
numbers
,
as
it
was
necessary
to
provide
against
an
attack
by
the
Saxon
Corps
.
<EOS>
By
three
o'clock
the
greater
part
of
the
town
was
in
the
hands
of
the
Germans
,
despite
the
gallant
way
in
which
our
men
fought
them
from
street
to
street
,
and
house
to
house
.
<EOS>
A
dozen
fires
were
spreading
in
every
direction
,
and
fierce
fighting
was
going
on
at
Writtle
.
<EOS>
The
overpowering
numbers
of
the
Germans
,
combined
with
their
better
organisation
,
and
the
number
of
properly
trained
officers
at
their
disposal
,
bore
the
British
mixed
Regular
and
Irregular
forces
back
,
and
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fearful
of
being
cut
off
from
his
line
of
retreat
,
General
Blennerhasset
,
on
hearing
from
Writtle
soon
after
three
that
the
Hanoverians
were
pressing
his
left
very
hard
,
and
endeavouring
to
work
round
it
,
reluctantly
gave
orders
for
the
troops
in
Chelmsford
to
fall
back
on
Widford
and
Moulsham
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
lull
in
the
fighting
for
about
half
an
hour
,
though
firing
was
going
on
both
at
Writtle
and
Danbury
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
four
a
terrible
rumour
spread
consternation
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
According
to
this
,
an
enormous
force
of
cavalry
and
motor
infantry
was
about
to
attack
us
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
What
had
actually
happened
was
not
quite
so
bad
as
this
,
but
quite
bad
enough
.
<EOS>
It
seems
,
according
to
our
latest
information
,
that
almost
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
belonging
to
the
three
German
Army
Corps
with
whom
we
were
engaged
--
something
like
a
dozen
regiments
,
with
a
proportion
of
horse
artillery
and
all
available
motorists
,
having
with
them
several
of
the
new
armoured
motors
carrying
light
,
quick
-
firing
and
machine
guns
--
had
been
massed
during
the
last
thirty
-
six
hours
behind
the
Saxon
lines
extending
from
Maldon
to
the
River
Crouch
.
<EOS>
During
the
day
they
had
worked
round
to
the
southward
,
and
at
the
time
the
rumour
reached
us
were
actually
attacking
Billericay
,
which
was
held
by
a
portion
of
the
reserves
of
our
Vth
Corps
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
this
news
was
confirmed
the
Germans
were
assaulting
Great
Baddow
,
and
moving
on
Danbury
from
east
,
north
,
and
west
,
at
the
same
time
resuming
the
offensive
all
along
the
line
.
<EOS>
The
troops
at
Danbury
must
be
withdrawn
or
they
would
be
isolated
.
<EOS>
This
difficult
manoeuvre
was
executed
by
way
of
West
Hanningfield
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
Vth
Corps
conformed
to
the
movement
,
the
Guards
Brigade
at
East
Hanningfield
forming
the
rearguard
,
and
fighting
fiercely
all
night
through
with
the
Saxon
troops
,
who
moved
out
on
the
left
flank
of
our
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
wreck
of
the
first
Corps
and
the
Colchester
garrison
was
now
also
in
full
retirement
.
<EOS>
Ten
miles
lay
between
it
and
the
lines
at
Brentwood
,
and
had
the
Germans
been
able
to
employ
cavalry
in
pursuit
,
this
retreat
would
have
been
even
more
like
a
rout
than
it
was
.
<EOS>
Luckily
for
us
the
Billericay
troops
mauled
the
German
cavalry
pretty
severely
,
and
they
were
beset
in
the
close
country
in
that
neighbourhood
by
Volunteers
,
motorists
,
and
every
one
that
the
officer
commanding
at
Brentwood
could
get
together
in
this
emergency
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
of
them
actually
got
upon
our
line
of
retreat
,
but
were
driven
off
by
our
advance
guard
;
others
came
across
the
head
of
the
retiring
Vth
Corps
,
but
the
terrain
was
all
against
cavalry
,
and
after
nightfall
most
of
them
had
lost
their
way
in
the
maze
of
lanes
and
hedgerows
that
covered
the
countryside
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
this
we
should
probably
have
been
absolutely
smashed
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
rather
more
than
half
our
original
numbers
of
men
and
guns
crawled
into
Brentwood
in
the
early
morning
,
worn
out
and
dead
-
beat
.

Reports
from
Sheffield
also
showed
the
position
to
be

THE
SIEGE
OF
LONDON
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
I.
 
<EOS>
THE
LINES
OF
LONDON
.
  
<EOS>
The
German
successes
were
continued
in
the
North
and
Midlands
,
and
notwithstanding
the
gallant
defence
of
Sir
George
Woolmer
before
Manchester
and
Sir
Henry
Hibbard
before
Birmingham
,
both
cities
were
captured
and
occupied
by
the
enemy
after
terrible
losses
.
<EOS>
London
,
however
,
was
the
chief
objective
of
Von
Kronhelm
,
and
towards
the
Metropolis
he
now
turned
his
attention
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
defeat
of
the
British
at
Chelmsford
on
that
fateful
Wednesday
,
Lord
Byfield
decided
to
evacuate
his
position
at
Royston
and
fall
back
on
the
northern
section
of
the
London
defence
line
,
which
had
been
under
construction
for
the
last
ten
days
.
<EOS>
These
hasty
entrenchments
,
which
would
have
been
impossible
to
construct
but
for
the
ready
assistance
of
thousands
of
all
classes
of
the
citizens
of
London
and
the
suburbs
,
extended
from
Tilbury
on
the
east
to
Bushey
on
the
west
,
passing
by
the
Laindon
Hills
,
Brentwood
,
Kelvedon
,
North
Weald
,
Epping
,
Waltham
Abbey
,
Cheshunt
,
Enfield
Chase
,
Chipping
Barnet
,
and
Elstree
.
<EOS>
They
were
more
or
less
continuous
,
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
trenches
for
infantry
,
generally
following
the
lines
of
existing
hedgerows
or
banks
,
which
often
required
but
little
improvement
to
transform
them
into
well
-
protected
and
formidable
cover
for
the
defending
troops
.
<EOS>
Where
it
was
necessary
to
cross
open
ground
they
were
dug
deep
and
winding
,
after
the
fashion
adopted
by
the
Boers
in
the
South
African
War
,
so
that
it
would
be
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
enfilade
them
.
 
<EOS>
Special
bomb
-
proof
covers
for
the
local
reserves
were
also
constructed
at
various
points
,
and
the
ground
in
front
ruthlessly
cleared
of
houses
,
barns
,
trees
,
hedges
,
and
everything
that
might
afford
shelter
to
an
advancing
enemy
.
<EOS>
Every
possible
military
obstacle
was
placed
in
front
of
the
lines
that
time
permitted
,
abattis
,
military
pits
,
wire
entanglements
,
and
small
ground
mines
.
<EOS>
At
the
more
important
points
along
the
fifty
miles
of
entrenchments
,
field
works
and
redoubts
for
infantry
were
built
,
most
of
them
being
armed
with
4.7
or
even
6
and
7.5
in
.
<EOS>
guns
,
which
had
been
brought
from
Woolwich
,
Chatham
,
Portsmouth
,
and
Devonport
,
and
mounted
on
whatever
carriages
could
be
adapted
or
improvised
for
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
The
preparation
of
the
London
lines
was
a
stupendous
undertaking
,
but
the
growing
scarceness
and
dearness
of
provisions
assisted
in
a
degree
,
as
no
free
rations
were
issued
to
any
able
-
bodied
man
unless
he
went
out
to
work
at
the
fortifications
.
<EOS>
All
workers
were
placed
under
military
law
.
<EOS>
There
were
any
number
of
willing
workers
who
proffered
their
services
in
this
time
of
peril
.
<EOS>
Thousands
of
men
came
forward
asking
to
be
enlisted
and
armed
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
was
to
find
enough
weapons
and
ammunition
for
them
,
to
say
nothing
of
the
question
of
uniform
and
equipment
,
which
loomed
very
large
indeed
.
<EOS>
The
attitude
of
the
Germans
,
as
set
forth
in
Von
Kronhelm
's
proclamations
,
precluded
the
employment
of
fighting
men
dressed
in
civilian
garb
,
and
their
attitude
was
a
perfectly
natural
and
justifiable
one
by
all
the
laws
and
customs
of
war
.
 
<EOS>
It
became
necessary
,
therefore
,
that
all
men
sent
to
the
front
should
be
dressed
as
soldiers
in
some
way
or
another
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
that
splendid
corps
,
the
Legion
of
Frontiersmen
,
many
new
armed
organisations
had
sprung
into
being
,
some
bearing
the
most
fantastic
names
,
such
as
the
"
Whitechapel
War
-
to
-
the
-
Knives
,
"
the
"
Kensington
Cowboys
,
"
the
"
Bayswater
Braves
,
"
and
the
"
Southwark
Scalphunters
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
available
khaki
and
blue
serge
was
used
up
in
no
time
;
even
though
those
who
were
already
in
possession
of
ordinary
lounge
suits
of
the
latter
material
were
encouraged
to
have
them
altered
into
uniforms
by
the
addition
of
stand
-
up
collars
and
facings
of
various
colours
,
according
to
their
regiments
and
corps
.
 
<EOS>
Only
the
time
during
which
these
men
were
waiting
for
their
uniforms
was
spent
in
drill
in
the
open
spaces
of
the
Metropolis
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
clothed
,
they
were
despatched
to
that
portion
of
the
entrenchments
to
which
their
corps
had
been
allocated
,
and
there
,
in
the
intervals
of
their
clearing
and
digging
operations
,
they
were
hustled
through
a
brief
musketry
course
,
which
consisted
for
the
most
part
in
firing
.
<EOS>
The
question
of
the
provision
of
officers
and
N.C.O.
's
was
an
almost
insuperable
one
.
<EOS>
Retired
men
came
forward
on
every
side
,
but
the
supply
was
by
no
means
equal
to
the
demand
,
and
they
themselves
in
many
instances
were
absolutely
out
of
date
as
far
as
knowledge
of
modern
arms
and
conditions
were
concerned
.
<EOS>
However
,
every
one
,
with
but
very
few
exceptions
,
did
his
utmost
,
and
by
the
11th
or
12th
of
the
month
the
entrenchments
were
practically
completed
,
and
manned
by
upwards
of
150,000
"
men
with
muskets
"
of
stout
heart
and
full
of
patriotism
,
but
in
reality
nothing
but
an
army
_
pour
rire
_
so
far
as
efficiency
was
concerned
.
 
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
the
guns
were
also
placed
in
position
,
especially
on
the
north
and
eastern
portions
of
the
lines
,
and
the
remainder
were
being
mounted
as
fast
as
it
was
practicable
.
<EOS>
They
were
well
manned
by
Volunteer
and
Militia
Artillerymen
,
drawn
from
every
district
which
the
invaders
had
left
accessible
.
<EOS>
By
the
13th
the
eastern
section
of
the
fortifications
was
strengthened
by
the
arrival
of
the
remnants
of
the
Ist
and
Vth
Army
Corps
,
which
had
been
so
badly
defeated
at
Chelmsford
,
and
no
time
was
lost
in
reorganising
them
and
distributing
them
along
the
lines
,
thereby
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
leavening
the
unbaked
mass
of
their
improvised
defenders
.
<EOS>
It
was
generally
expected
that
the
enemy
would
follow
up
the
success
by
an
immediate
attack
on
Brentwood
,
the
main
barrier
between
Von
Kronhelm
and
his
objective
--
our
great
Metropolis
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
it
turned
out
,
he
had
a
totally
different
scheme
in
hand
.
<EOS>
The
orders
to
Lord
Byfield
to
evacuate
the
position
he
had
maintained
with
such
credit
against
the
German
Garde
and
IVth
Corps
have
already
been
referred
to
.
<EOS>
Their
reason
was
obvious
.
<EOS>
Now
that
there
was
no
organised
resistance
on
his
right
<EOS>
,
he
stood
in
danger
of
being
cut
off
from
London
,
the
defences
of
which
were
now
in
pressing
need
of
his
men
.
<EOS>
A
large
amount
of
rolling
stock
was
at
once
despatched
to
Saffron
Walden
and
Buntingford
by
the
G.E.R.
and
to
Baldock
by
the
G.N.R.
,
to
facilitate
the
withdrawal
of
his
troops
and
stores
,
and
he
was
given
an
absolutely
free
hand
as
to
how
these
were
to
be
used
,
all
lines
being
kept
clear
and
additional
trains
kept
at
his
disposal
at
their
London
termini
.

September
13
proved
a
memorable
date
in
the
history
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
evacuation
of
the
Baldock
-
Saffron
Walden
position
could
not
possibly
have
been
carried
out
in
good
order
on
such
short
notice
,
had
not
Lord
Byfield
previously
worked
the
whole
thing
out
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
feeling
that
,
despite
his
glorious
victory
on
the
ninth
,
a
turn
of
Fortune
's
wheel
might
necessitate
a
retirement
on
London
sooner
or
later
,
and
,
like
the
good
General
that
he
was
,
he
made
every
preparation
both
for
this
,
and
other
eventualities
.
<EOS>
Among
other
details
,
he
had
arranged
that
the
mounted
infantry
should
be
provided
with
plenty
of
strong
light
wire
.
<EOS>
This
was
intended
for
the
express
benefit
of
Froelich
's
formidable
cavalry
brigade
,
which
he
foresaw
would
be
most
dangerous
to
his
command
in
the
event
of
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
As
soon
,
therefore
,
as
the
retrograde
movement
commenced
,
the
mounted
infantry
began
to
stretch
their
wires
across
every
road
,
lane
and
byway
leading
to
the
north
and
north
-
east
.
<EOS>
Some
wires
were
laid
low
,
within
a
foot
of
the
ground
,
others
high
up
,
where
they
could
catch
a
rider
about
the
neck
or
breast
.
<EOS>
This
operation
they
carried
out
again
and
again
,
after
the
troops
had
passed
,
at
various
points
on
the
route
of
the
retreat
.
<EOS>
Thanks
to
the
darkness
,
this
device
well
fulfilled
its
purpose
.
<EOS>
Froelich
's
brigade
was
on
the
heels
of
the
retreating
British
soon
after
midnight
,
but
as
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
move
over
the
enclosed
country
at
night
,
his
riders
were
confined
to
the
roads
,
and
the
accidents
and
delays
occasioned
by
the
wires
were
so
numerous
and
disconcerting
that
their
advance
had
to
be
conducted
with
such
caution
that
as
a
pursuit
it
was
of
no
use
at
all
.
<EOS>
Even
the
infantry
and
heavy
guns
of
the
retiring
British
got
over
the
ground
nearly
twice
as
fast
.
<EOS>
After
two
or
three
hours
of
this
,
only
varied
by
occasional
volleys
from
detachments
of
our
mounted
infantry
,
who
sometimes
waited
in
rear
of
their
snares
to
let
fly
at
the
German
cavalry
before
galloping
back
to
lay
others
,
the
enemy
recognised
the
fact
,
and
,
withdrawing
their
cavalry
till
daylight
,
replaced
them
by
infantry
,
but
so
much
time
had
been
lost
,
that
the
British
had
got
several
miles
'
start
.
 
<EOS>
As
has
been
elsewhere
chronicled
,
the
brigade
of
four
regular
battalions
with
their
guns
,
and
a
company
of
Engineers
which
were
to
secure
the
passage
of
the
Stort
and
protect
the
left
flank
of
the
retirement
,
left
Saffron
Walden
somewhere
<EOS>
about
10.30
p.m.
<EOS>
The
line
was
clear
,
and
they
arrived
at
Sawbridgeworth
in
four
long
trains
in
a
little
under
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Their
advent
did
not
arouse
the
sleeping
village
,
as
the
station
lies
nearly
three
-
quarters
of
a
mile
distant
on
the
further
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
noted
in
passing
that
while
the
Stort
is
but
a
small
stream
,
easily
fordable
in
most
places
,
yet
it
was
important
,
if
possible
,
to
secure
the
bridges
to
prevent
delay
in
getting
over
the
heavy
guns
and
waggons
of
the
retiring
British
.
<EOS>
A
delay
and
congestion
at
the
points
selected
for
passage
might
,
with
a
close
pursuit
,
easily
lead
to
disaster
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
the
Great
Eastern
Railway
crossed
the
river
by
a
wooden
bridge
just
north
of
the
village
of
Sawbridgeworth
,
and
it
was
necessary
to
ensure
the
safe
passage
of
the
last
trains
over
it
before
destroying
it
to
preclude
the
use
of
the
railway
by
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
road
bridges
on
the
Great
Eastern
Railway
near
the
village
of
Sawbridgeworth
,
which
might
be
required
by
the
Dunmow
force
,
which
was
detailed
to
protect
the
same
flank
rather
more
to
the
northward
.
<EOS>
The
most
important
bridge
,
that
over
which
the
main
body
of
the
Saffron
Walden
force
was
to
retire
,
with
all
the
impedimenta
it
had
had
time
to
bring
away
with
it
,
was
between
Sawbridgeworth
and
Harlow
,
about
a
mile
north
of
the
latter
village
,
but
much
nearer
its
station
.
<EOS>
Thither
,
then
,
proceeded
the
leading
train
with
the
Grenadiers
,
four
4.7
guns
,
and
half
a
company
of
Royal
Engineers
with
bridging
materials
.
<EOS>
Their
task
was
to
construct
a
second
bridge
to
relieve
the
traffic
over
the
permanent
one
.
<EOS>
The
Grenadiers
left
one
company
at
the
railway
station
,
two
in
Harlow
village
,
which
they
at
once
commenced
to
place
in
a
state
of
defence
,
much
to
the
consternation
of
the
villagers
,
who
had
not
realised
how
close
to
them
were
trending
the
red
footsteps
of
war
.
<EOS>
The
remaining
five
companies
with
the
other
four
guns
turned
northward
,
and
after
marching
another
mile
or
so
occupied
the
enclosures
round
Durrington
House
and
the
higher
ground
to
its
north
.
<EOS>
Here
the
guns
were
halted
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
dark
to
select
the
best
position
for
them
,
for
it
was
now
only
about
half
an
hour
after
midnight
.
<EOS>
The
three
other
regiments
which
detrained
at
Sawbridgeworth
were
disposed
as
follows
,
continuing
the
line
of
the
Grenadiers
to
the
northward
.
<EOS>
The
Rifles
occupied
Hyde
Hall
,
formerly
the
seat
of
the
Earls
of
Roden
,
covering
the
operations
of
the
Engineers
,
who
were
preparing
the
railway
bridge
for
destruction
,
and
the
copses
about
Little
Hyde
Hall
on
the
higher
ground
to
the
eastward
.
 
<EOS>
The
Scots
Guards
with
four
guns
were
between
them
and
the
Grenadiers
,
and
distributed
between
Sheering
village
and
Gladwyns
House
,
from
the
neighbourhood
of
which
it
was
expected
that
the
guns
would
be
able
to
command
the
Chelmsford
Road
for
a
considerable
distance
.
<EOS>
The
Seaforth
Highlanders
for
the
time
being
were
stationed
on
a
road
running
parallel
to
the
railway
,
from
which
branch
roads
led
to
both
the
right
,
left
,
and
centre
of
the
position
.
<EOS>
An
advanced
party
of
the
Rifle
Brigade
was
pushed
forward
to
Hatfield
Heath
with
instructions
to
patrol
towards
the
front
and
flanks
,
and
,
if
possible
,
establish
communication
with
the
troops
expected
from
Dunmow
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
all
this
was
completed
it
was
getting
on
for
3
a.m.
on
the
13th
.
<EOS>
At
this
hour
the
advanced
guard
of
the
Germans
coming
from
Chelmsford
was
midway
between
Leaden
Roding
and
White
Roding
,
while
the
main
body
was
crossing
the
small
River
Roding
by
the
shallow
ford
near
the
latter
village
.
<EOS>
Their
few
cavalry
scouts
were
,
however
,
exploring
the
roads
and
lanes
some
little
way
ahead
.
<EOS>
A
collision
was
imminent
.
<EOS>
The
Dunmow
force
had
not
been
able
to
move
before
midnight
,
and
,
with
the
exception
of
one
regular
battalion
,
the
1st
Leinsters
,
which
was
left
behind
to
the
last
and
crowded
into
the
only
train
available
,
had
only
just
arrived
at
the
northern
edge
of
Hatfield
Forest
,
some
four
miles
directly
north
of
Hatfield
Heath
.
<EOS>
The
Leinsters
,
who
left
Dunmow
by
train
half
an
hour
later
,
had
detrained
at
this
point
at
one
o'clock
,
and
just
about
three
had
met
the
patrols
of
the
Rifles
.
<EOS>
A
Yeomanry
corps
from
Dunmow
was
also
not
far
off
,
as
it
turned
to
its
left
at
the
cross
-
roads
east
of
Takely
,
and
was
by
this
time
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Hatfield
Broad
Oak
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
all
three
forces
were
converging
,
but
the
bulk
of
the
Dunmow
force
was
four
miles
away
from
the
point
of
convergence
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
still
profoundly
dark
when
the
Rifles
at
Hatfield
Heath
heard
a
dozen
shots
cracking
through
the
darkness
to
their
left
front
.
<EOS>
Almost
immediately
other
reports
resounded
from
due
east
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
seen
beyond
a
very
few
yards
,
and
the
men
of
the
advanced
company
drawn
up
at
the
cross
-
roads
in
front
of
the
village
inn
fancied
they
now
and
again
saw
figures
dodging
about
in
obscurity
,
but
were
cautioned
not
to
fire
till
their
patrols
had
come
in
,
for
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
friend
from
foe
.
<EOS>
Shots
still
rattled
out
here
and
there
to
the
front
.
<EOS>
About
ten
minutes
later
the
captain
in
command
,
having
got
in
his
patrols
,
gave
the
order
to
fire
at
a
black
blur
that
seemed
to
be
moving
towards
them
on
the
Chelmsford
Road
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
mistake
this
time
.
<EOS>
The
momentary
glare
of
the
discharge
flashed
on
the
shiny
"
pickel
-
haubes
"
of
a
detachment
of
German
infantry
,
who
charged
forward
with
a
loud
"
Hoch
!
"
<EOS>
The
Riflemen
,
who
already
had
their
bayonets
fixed
,
rushed
to
meet
them
,
and
for
a
few
moments
there
was
a
fierce
stabbing
affray
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
,
who
were
but
few
in
number
,
were
overpowered
,
and
beat
a
retreat
,
having
lost
several
of
their
men
.
<EOS>
The
Rifles
,
according
to
their
orders
,
having
made
sure
of
the
immediate
proximity
of
the
enemy
,
now
fell
back
to
the
rest
of
their
battalion
at
Little
Hyde
Hall
,
and
all
along
the
banks
and
hedges
which
covered
the
British
front
,
our
men
,
rifle
in
hand
,
peered
eagerly
into
the
darkness
ahead
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
happened
for
quite
half
an
hour
,
and
the
anxious
watchers
were
losing
some
of
their
alertness
,
when
a
heavy
outburst
of
firing
re
-
echoed
from
Hatfield
Heath
.
<EOS>
To
explain
this
we
must
return
to
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
,
on
obtaining
touch
with
the
British
,
at
once
reinforced
his
advanced
troops
,
and
they
,
a
whole
battalion
strong
,
advanced
into
the
hamlet
meeting
with
no
resistance
.
<EOS>
Almost
simultaneously
two
companies
of
the
Leinsters
entered
it
from
the
northward
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
sudden
and
unexpected
collision
on
the
open
green
,
and
a
terrible
fire
was
exchanged
at
close
quarters
,
both
sides
losing
very
heavily
.
<EOS>
The
British
,
however
,
were
borne
back
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
,
and
,
through
one
of
those
unfortunate
mistakes
that
insist
on
occurring
in
warfare
,
were
charged
as
they
fell
back
by
the
leading
squadrons
of
the
Yeomanry
who
were
coming
up
from
Hatfield
Broad
Oak
.
<EOS>
The
officer
commanding
the
Leinsters
decided
to
wait
till
it
was
a
little
lighter
before
again
attacking
the
village
.
<EOS>
He
considered
that
,
as
he
had
no
idea
of
the
strength
of
the
enemy
,
he
had
best
wait
till
the
arrival
of
the
troops
now
marching
through
Hatfield
Forest
.
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
,
on
his
part
,
mindful
of
his
instructions
,
determined
to
try
to
hold
the
few
scattered
houses
on
the
north
side
of
the
heath
which
constituted
the
village
,
with
the
battalion
already
in
it
,
and
push
forward
with
the
remainder
of
his
force
towards
Harlow
.
<EOS>
His
first
essay
along
the
direct
road
_
via
_
Sheering
was
repulsed
by
the
fire
of
the
Scots
Guards
lining
the
copses
about
Gladwyns
.
<EOS>
He
now
began
to
have
some
idea
of
the
British
position
,
and
made
his
preparations
to
assault
it
at
daybreak
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
end
he
sent
forward
two
of
his
batteries
into
Hatfield
Heath
,
cautiously
moved
the
rest
of
his
force
away
to
the
left
,
arranged
his
battalions
in
the
valley
of
the
Pincey
Brook
ready
for
attacking
Sheering
and
Gladwyns
,
placed
one
battalion
in
reserve
at
Down
Hall
,
and
stationed
his
remaining
battery
near
Newman
's
End
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
there
was
beginning
to
be
a
faint
glimmer
of
daylight
in
the
east
,
and
,
as
the
growing
dawn
began
to
render
vague
outlines
of
the
nearer
objects
dimly
discernible
,
hell
broke
loose
along
the
peaceful
countryside
.
<EOS>
A
star
shell
fired
from
the
battery
at
Newman
's
End
burst
and
hung
out
a
brilliant
white
blaze
that
fell
slowly
over
Sheering
village
,
lighting
up
its
walls
and
roofs
and
the
hedges
along
which
lay
its
defenders
,
was
the
signal
for
the
Devil
's
Dance
to
begin
.
<EOS>
Twelve
guns
opened
with
a
crash
from
Hatfield
Heath
,
raking
the
Gladwyns
enclosures
and
the
end
of
Sheering
village
with
a
deluge
of
shrapnel
,
whilst
an
almost
solid
firing
line
advanced
rapidly
against
it
,
firing
heavily
.

BATTLE
OF
HARLOW
1^{ST
}
PHASE
about

a

Sept
13^{th
}
]
 
<EOS>
The
British
replied
lustily
with
gun
,
rifle
,
and
maxim
,
the
big
high
-
explosive
shells
bursting
amid
the
advancing
Germans
and
among
the
houses
of
Hatfield
Heath
with
telling
effect
.
<EOS>
But
the
German
assaulting
lines
had
but
six
or
seven
hundred
yards
to
go
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
trained
above
all
things
to
ignore
losses
and
to
push
on
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
The
necessity
for
this
had
not
been
confused
in
their
minds
by
maxims
about
the
importance
of
cover
,
so
the
south
side
of
the
village
street
was
taken
at
a
rush
.
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
continued
to
pile
on
his
men
,
and
,
fighting
desperately
,
the
Guardsmen
were
driven
from
house
to
house
and
from
fence
to
fence
.
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
German
battery
at
Newman
's
End
continued
to
fire
star
shells
with
rhythmical
regularity
,
lighting
up
the
inflamed
countenances
of
the
living
combatants
,
and
the
pale
up
-
turned
<EOS>
faces
of
the
dead
turned
to
heaven
as
if
calling
for
vengeance
on
their
slayers
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
desperate
fighting
the
Leinsters
,
supported
by
a
Volunteer
and
a
Militia
regiment
,
which
had
just
come
up
,
assaulted
Hatfield
Heath
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
were
driven
out
of
it
with
the
loss
of
a
couple
of
their
guns
,
but
hung
on
to
the
little
church
,
around
which
such
a
desperate
conflict
was
waged
that
the
dead
above
ground
in
that
diminutive
God
's
acre
outnumbered
the
"
rude
forefathers
of
the
hamlet
"
who
slept
below
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
past
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
by
this
time
strong
reinforcements
might
have
been
expected
from
Dunmow
,
but
,
with
the
exception
of
the
Militia
and
Volunteer
battalions
just
referred
to
,
who
had
pushed
on
at
the
sound
of
the
firing
,
none
were
seen
coming
up
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
that
they
had
been
told
off
to
certain
positions
in
the
line
of
defence
they
had
been
ordered
to
take
up
,
and
had
been
slowly
and
carefully
installing
themselves
therein
.
<EOS>
Their
commanding
officer
,
Sir
Jacob
Stellenbosch
,
thought
that
he
must
carry
out
the
exact
letter
of
the
orders
he
had
received
from
Lord
Byfield
,
and
paid
little
attention
to
the
firing
except
to
hustle
his
battalion
commanders
,
to
try
to
get
them
into
their
places
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
pig
-
headed
man
into
the
bargain
,
and
would
listen
to
no
remonstrance
.
<EOS>
The
two
battalions
which
had
arrived
so
opportunely
had
been
at
the
head
of
the
column
,
and
had
pushed
forward
"
on
their
own
"
before
he
could
prevent
them
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
position
was
as
follows
:
One
German
battalion
was
hanging
obstinately
on
to
the
outskirts
of
Hatfield
Heath
;
two
were
in
possession
of
the
copses
about
Gladwyns
;
two
were
in
Sheering
village
,
or
close
up
to
it
,
and
the
sixth
was
still
in
reserve
at
Down
Hall
.
<EOS>
On
the
British
side
the
Rifles
were
in
their
original
position
at
Little
Hyde
Hall
where
also
were
three
guns
,
which
had
been
got
away
from
Gladwyns
.
<EOS>
The
Seaforths
had
come
up
,
and
were
now
firing
from
about
Quickbury
,
while
the
Scots
Guards
,
after
suffering
fearful
losses
,
were
scattered
,
some
with
the
Highlanders
,
others
with
the
five
companies
of
the
Grenadiers
,
who
with
their
four
guns
still
fought
gallantly
on
between
Sheering
and
Durrington
House
.

CHAPTER
II
.
 
<EOS>
REPULSE
OF
THE
GERMANS
.
  
<EOS>
The
terrible
fire
of
the
swarms
of
Germans
who
now
lined
the
edges
of
Sheering
village
became
too
much
for
the
four
4.7
guns
on
the
open
ground
to
the
south
.
 
<EOS>
Their
gunners
were
shot
down
as
fast
as
they
touched
their
weapons
,
and
when
the
German
field
battery
at
Newman
's
End
,
which
had
been
advanced
several
hundred
yards
,
suddenly
opened
a
flanking
fire
of
shrapnel
upon
them
,
it
was
found
absolutely
impossible
to
serve
them
.
<EOS>
A
gallant
attempt
was
made
to
withdraw
them
by
the
Harlow
Road
,
but
their
teams
were
shot
down
as
soon
as
they
appeared
.
<EOS>
This
enfilade
fire
,
too
,
decimated
the
Grenadiers
and
the
remnant
of
the
Scots
,
though
they
fought
on
to
the
death
,
and
a
converging
attack
of
a
battalion
from
Down
Hall
and
another
from
Sheering
drove
them
down
into
the
grounds
of
Durrington
House
,
where
fighting
still
went
on
savagely
for
some
time
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
had
all
but
attained
a
portion
of
his
object
,
which
was
to
establish
his
guns
in
such
a
position
that
they
could
fire
on
the
main
body
of
the
British
troops
when
they
entered
Sawbridgeworth
by
the
Cambridge
Road
.
<EOS>
The
place
where
the
four
guns
with
the
Grenadiers
had
been
stationed
was
within
3,000
yards
of
any
part
of
that
road
between
Harlow
and
Sawbridgeworth
.
<EOS>
But
this
spot
was
still
exposed
to
the
rifle
fire
of
the
Seaforths
who
held
Quickbury
.
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
therefore
determined
to
swing
forward
his
left
,
and
either
drive
them
back
down
the
hill
towards
the
river
,
or
at
least
to
so
occupy
them
that
he
could
bring
up
his
field
-
guns
to
their
chosen
position
without
losing
too
many
of
his
gunners
.
 
<EOS>
By
six
o'clock
,
thanks
to
his
enormous
local
superiority
in
numbers
,
he
had
contrived
to
do
this
,
and
now
the
opposing
forces
with
the
exception
of
the
British
Grenadiers
,
who
still
fought
with
a
German
battalion
between
Durrington
House
and
Harlow
,
faced
each
other
north
and
south
,
instead
of
east
and
west
,
as
they
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
fight
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
-
General
Lane
-
Edgeworth
,
who
was
in
command
of
the
British
,
had
been
sending
urgent
messages
for
reinforcements
to
the
Dunmow
Force
,
but
when
its
commanding
officer
finally
decided
to
turn
his
full
strength
in
the
direction
of
the
firing
,
it
took
so
long
to
assemble
and
form
up
the
Volunteer
regiments
who
composed
the
bulk
of
his
command
,
that
it
was
past
seven
before
the
leading
battalion
had
deployed
to
assist
in
the
attack
which
it
was
decided
to
make
against
the
German
right
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
other
important
events
had
transpired
.
 
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
had
found
that
the
battalion
which
was
engaged
with
the
Grenadiers
could
not
get
near
Harlow
village
,
or
either
the
river
or
railway
bridge
at
that
place
,
both
of
which
he
wished
to
destroy
.
<EOS>
But
his
scouts
had
reported
a
lock
and
wooden
footbridge
immediately
to
the
westward
between
Harlow
and
Sawbridgeworth
,
just
abreast
of
the
large
wooded
park
surrounding
Pishobury
House
on
the
farther
side
.
<EOS>
He
determined
to
send
two
companies
over
by
this
,
their
movements
being
hidden
from
the
English
by
the
trees
.
<EOS>
After
crossing
,
they
found
themselves
confronted
by
a
backwater
,
but
,
trained
in
crossing
rivers
,
they
managed
to
ford
and
swim
over
,
and
advanced
through
the
park
towards
Harlow
Bridge
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
in
progress
,
a
large
force
was
reported
marching
south
on
the
Cambridge
Road
.
 
<EOS>
While
Von
der
Rudesheim
,
who
was
at
the
western
end
of
Sheering
hamlet
,
was
looking
through
his
glasses
at
the
new
arrivals
on
the
scene
of
action
--
who
were
without
doubt
the
main
body
of
the
Royston
command
,
which
was
retiring
under
the
personal
supervision
of
Lord
Byfield
--
a
puff
of
white
smoke
rose
above
the
trees
about
Hyde
Hall
,
and
at
top
speed
four
heavily
loaded
trains
shot
into
sight
going
south
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
same
ones
that
had
brought
down
the
Regular
British
troops
,
with
whom
he
was
now
engaged
.
<EOS>
They
had
gone
north
again
,
and
picked
up
a
number
of
Volunteer
battalions
belonging
to
the
retreating
force
just
beyond
Bishop
's
Stortford
.
<EOS>
But
so
long
a
time
had
been
taken
in
entraining
the
troops
in
the
darkness
and
confusion
of
the
retreat
,
that
their
comrades
who
had
kept
to
the
road
,
arrived
almost
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
Von
der
Rudesheim
signalled
,
and
sent
urgent
orders
for
his
guns
to
be
brought
up
to
open
fire
on
them
,
but
by
the
time
the
first
team
had
reached
him
the
last
of
the
trains
had
disappeared
from
sight
into
the
cutting
at
Harlow
Station
.
<EOS>
But
even
now
it
was
not
too
late
to
open
fire
on
the
troops
entering
Sawbridgeworth
.
 
<EOS>
Things
were
beginning
to
look
somewhat
bad
for
Von
der
Rudesheim
's
little
force
.
<EOS>
The
pressure
from
the
north
was
increasing
every
moment
,
his
attack
on
the
retreating
troops
had
failed
,
he
had
not
so
far
been
able
to
destroy
the
bridges
at
Harlow
,
and
every
minute
the
likelihood
of
his
being
able
to
do
so
grew
more
remote
.
<EOS>
To
crown
all
,
word
was
brought
him
that
the
trains
which
had
just
slipped
by
were
disgorging
men
in
hundreds
along
the
railway
west
of
Harlow
Station
,
and
that
these
troops
were
beginning
to
move
forward
as
if
to
support
the
British
Grenadiers
,
who
had
been
driven
back
towards
Harlow
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
saw
that
there
was
even
a
possibility
of
his
being
surrounded
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
intention
of
discontinuing
the
fight
.
<EOS>
He
knew
he
could
rely
on
the
discipline
and
mobility
of
his
well
-
trained
men
under
almost
any
conditions
,
and
he
trusted
,
moreover
,
that
the
promised
reinforcements
would
not
be
very
long
in
turning
up
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
hold
on
just
where
he
was
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
,
by
various
adroit
manoeuvres
,
threw
back
his
right
to
Down
Hall
,
whose
copses
and
plantations
afforded
a
good
deal
of
cover
,
and
,
using
this
as
a
pivot
,
gradually
wheeled
back
his
left
till
he
had
taken
up
a
position
running
north
and
south
from
Down
Hall
to
Matching
Tye
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
effected
this
difficult
manoeuvre
without
considerable
loss
,
but
he
experienced
less
difficulty
in
extricating
his
left
than
he
had
anticipated
,
since
the
newly
arrived
British
troops
at
Harlow
,
instead
of
pressing
forward
against
him
,
had
been
engaged
in
moving
into
a
position
between
Harlow
and
the
hamlet
of
Foster
Street
,
on
the
somewhat
elevated
ground
to
the
south
of
Matching
,
which
would
enable
them
to
cover
the
further
march
of
the
main
body
of
the
retreating
troops
to
Epping
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
totally
lost
the
two
companies
he
had
sent
across
the
river
to
attack
Harlow
Bridge
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
for
them
,
their
arrival
on
the
Harlow
-
Sawbridgeworth
Road
synchronised
with
that
of
the
advanced
guard
of
Lord
Byfield
's
command
.
<EOS>
Some
hot
skirmishing
took
place
in
and
out
among
the
trees
of
Pishobury
,
and
finally
the
Germans
were
driven
to
earth
in
the
big
square
block
of
the
red
-
brick
mansion
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
made
a
desperate
stand
,
fighting
hard
as
they
were
driven
from
one
storey
to
another
.
<EOS>
The
staircases
ran
with
blood
,
the
woodwork
smouldered
and
threatened
to
burst
into
flame
in
a
dozen
places
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
arrival
of
a
battery
of
field
guns
,
which
unlimbered
at
close
range
,
induced
the
survivors
to
surrender
,
and
they
were
disarmed
and
carried
off
as
prisoners
with
the
retreating
army
.

By
the
time
Von
der
Rudesheim
had
succeeded
in
taking
up
his
new
position
<EOS>
it
was
past
ten
o'clock
,
and
he
had
been
informed
by
despatches
carried
by
motor
-
cyclists
that
he
might
expect
assistance
in
another
hour
and
a
half
.
 
<EOS>
The
right
column
,
consisting
of
the
39th
Infantry
Brigade
of
five
battalions
,
six
batteries
,
and
a
squadron
of
Dragoons
,
came
into
collision
with
the
left
flank
of
the
Dunmow
force
,
which
was
engaged
in
attacking
Von
der
Rudesheim
's
right
at
Down
Hall
,
and
endeavouring
to
surround
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Jacob
Stellenbosch
,
who
was
in
command
,
in
vain
tried
to
change
front
to
meet
the
advancing
enemy
.
<EOS>
His
troops
were
nearly
all
Volunteers
,
who
were
incapable
of
quickly
manoeuvring
under
difficult
circumstances
;
they
were
crumpled
up
and
driven
back
in
confusion
towards
Hatfield
Heath
.
<EOS>
Had
Von
Kronhelm
been
able
to
get
in
the
bulk
of
his
cavalry
from
their
luckless
pursuit
of
the
Ist
and
Vth
British
Army
Corps
,
who
had
been
driven
back
on
Brentwood
the
evening
previous
,
and
so
send
a
proportion
with
the
20th
Division
,
few
would
have
escaped
to
tell
the
tale
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
the
unfortunate
volunteers
were
shot
down
in
scores
by
the
"
feu
d'enfer
"
with
which
the
artillery
followed
them
up
,
and
lay
in
twos
and
threes
and
larger
groups
all
over
the
fields
,
victims
of
a
selfish
nation
that
accepted
these
poor
fellows
'
gratuitous
services
merely
in
order
that
its
citizens
should
not
be
obliged
to
carry
out
what
in
every
other
European
country
was
regarded
as
the
first
duty
of
citizenship
--
that
of
learning
to
bear
arms
in
the
defence
of
the
Fatherland
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
greater
portion
of
the
retreating
British
Army
,
with
all
its
baggage
,
guns
and
impedimenta
,
was
crawling
slowly
along
the
road
from
Harlow
to
Epping
.
<EOS>
Unaccustomed
as
they
were
to
marching
,
the
poor
Volunteers
who
had
already
covered
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
of
road
,
were
now
toiling
slowly
and
painfully
along
the
highway
.
<EOS>
The
regular
troops
,
who
had
been
engaged
since
early
morning
,
and
who
were
now
mostly
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Moor
Hall
,
east
of
Harlow
,
firing
at
long
ranges
on
Von
der
Rudesheim
's
men
to
keep
them
in
their
places
while
Sir
Jacob
Stellenbosch
attacked
their
right
,
were
now
hurriedly
withdrawn
and
started
to
march
south
by
a
track
running
parallel
to
the
main
Epping
Road
,
between
it
and
that
along
which
the
covering
force
of
Volunteers
,
who
had
come
in
by
train
,
were
now
established
in
position
.
<EOS>
The
1st
and
2nd
Coldstreamers
,
who
had
formed
Lord
Byfield
's
rearguard
during
the
night
,
were
halted
in
Harlow
village
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
upon
the
success
obtained
by
his
right
column
,
General
Richel
von
Sieberg
,
who
commanded
the
20th
Hanoverian
Division

ordered
his
two
centre
and
left
columns
,
consisting
respectively
of
the
three
battalions
77th
Infantry
and
two
batteries
of
Horse

at

and
five
batteries
Field

,
then
between
High

to
turn
to
their
left
and
advance
in
fighting
formation

south

the
object

The

is
best
told
in
the
words
of
the
special
war
correspondent
of
the

who
arrived
on
the
scene
at
about
one
o'clock

Thanks
to
the
secrecy
preserved
by
the
military
authorities
,
it
was
not
known
that
Lord
Byfield
was
falling
back
from
the
Royston
-
Saffron
Walden
position
till
seven
this
morning
.
<EOS>
By
eight
,
I
was
off
in
my
car
for
the
scene
of
action
,
for
rumours
of
fighting
near
Harlow
had
already
begun
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
I
started
out
by
way
of
Tottenham
and
Edmonton
,
expecting
to
reach
Harlow
by
9.30
or
10
.
<EOS>
But
I
reckoned
without
the
numerous
military
officials
with
whom
I
came
in
contact
,
who
constantly
stopped
me
and
sent
me
out
of
my
way
on
one
pretext
or
another
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
hope
that
the
nation
has
benefited
by
their
proceedings
.
<EOS>
In
the
end
it
was
close
on
one
before
I
pulled
up
at
the
Cock
Inn
,
Epping
,
in
search
of
additional
information
,
because
for
some
time
I
had
been
aware
of
the
rumbling
growl
of
heavy
artillery
from
the
eastward
,
and
wondered
what
it
might
portend
.
<EOS>
I
found
that
General
Sir
Stapleton
Forsyth
,
who
commanded
the
Northern
section
of
the
defences
,
had
made
the
inn
his
headquarters
,
and
there
was
a
constant
coming
and
going
of
orderlies
and
staff
-
officers
at
its
portals
.
<EOS>
Opposite
,
the
men
of
one
of
the
new
irregular
corps
,
dressed
in
dark
green
corduroy
,
blue
flannel
cricketing
caps
,
and
red
cummerbunds
,
sat
or
reclined
in
two
long
lines
on
either
side
of
their
piled
arms
on
the
left
of
the
wide
street
.
<EOS>
On
inquiry
I
heard
that
the
enemy
were
said
to
be
bombarding
Kelvedon
Hatch
,
and
also
that
the
head
of
our
retreating
columns
was
only
three
or
four
miles
distant
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
pushed
on
,
and
,
after
the
usual
interrogations
from
an
officer
in
charge
of
a
picket
,
where
the
road
ran
through
the
entrenchments
about
a
mile
farther
on
,
found
myself
spinning
along
through
the
country
in
the
direction
of
Harlow
.
<EOS>
As
I
began
to
ascend
the
rising
ground
towards
Potter
Street
<EOS>
I
could
hear
a
continuous
roll
of
artillery
away
to
my
right
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
distinguish
anything
except
the
smoke
of
shells
bursting
here
and
there
in
the
distance
,
on
account
of
the
scattered
trees
which
lined
the
maze
of
hedgerows
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
Close
to
Potter
Street
I
met
the
head
of
the
retreating
army
.
<EOS>
Very
tired
,
heated
and
footsore
looked
the
hundreds
of
poor
fellows
as
they
dragged
themselves
along
through
the
heat
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sultry
afternoon
,
and
the
roads
inches
deep
in
dust
.
 
<EOS>
"
Turning
to
the
right
of
Harlow
Common
,
I
met
another
column
of
men
.
<EOS>
I
noticed
that
these
were
all
Regulars
,
Grenadiers
,
Scots
Guards
,
a
battalion
of
Highlanders
,
another
of
Riflemen
,
and
,
lastly
,
two
battalions
of
the
Coldstreamers
.
<EOS>
These
troops
stepped
along
with
rather
more
life
than
the
citizen
soldiers
I
had
met
previously
,
but
still
showed
traces
of
their
hard
marching
and
fighting
.
<EOS>
Many
of
them
were
wearing
bandages
,
but
all
the
more
seriously
wounded
had
been
left
behind
to
be
looked
after
by
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
firing
was
still
resounding
heavy
and
constant
from
the
north
-
east
,
and
from
one
person
and
another
whom
I
questioned
<EOS>
I
ascertained
that
the
enemy
were
advancing
upon
us
from
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Half
a
mile
farther
on
<EOS>
I
ran
into
the
middle
of
the
fighting
.
<EOS>
The
road
ran
along
the
top
of
a
kind
of
flat
ridge
or
upland
,
whence
<EOS>
I
could
see
to
a
considerable
distance
on
either
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Partially
sheltered
from
the
view
by
its
hedges
and
the
scattered
cottages
forming
the
hamlet
of
Foster
Street
was
a
long
,
irregular
line
of
guns
facing
nearly
east
.
<EOS>
Beyond
them
were
yet
others
directed
north
.
<EOS>
There
were
field
batteries
and
big
4.7
's
.
<EOS>
All
were
hard
at
work
,
their
gunners
working
like
men
possessed
,
and
the
crash
of
their
constant
discharge
was
ear
-
splitting
.
<EOS>
I
had
hardly
taken
this
in
when
'
Bang
!
<EOS>
Bang
!
<EOS>
Bang
!
<EOS>
Bang!'--four
dazzling
flashes
opened
in
the
air
overhead
,
and
shrapnel
bullets
rattled
on
earth
,
walls
,
and
roofs
with
a
sound
as
of
handfuls
of
pebbles
thrown
on
a
marble
pavement
.
<EOS>
But
the
hardness
with
which
they
struck
was
beyond
anything
in
my
experience
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
pleasant
to
be
here
,
but
I
ran
my
car
behind
a
little
public
-
house
that
stood
by
the
wayside
,
and
,
dismounting
,
unslung
my
glasses
and
determined
to
get
what
view
of
the
proceedings
I
could
from
the
corner
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
All
around
khaki
-
clad
Volunteers
lined
every
hedge
and
sheltered
behind
every
cottage
,
while
farther
off
,
in
the
lower
ground
,
from
a
mile
to
a
mile
and
a
half
away
<EOS>
I
could
distinguish
the
closely
-
packed
firing
lines
of
the
Germans
advancing
slowly
but
steadily
,
despite
the
gaps
made
in
their
ranks
by
the
fire
of
our
guns
.
<EOS>
Their
own
guns
,
I
fancied
,
I
could
make
out
near
Tilegate
Green
to
the
north
-
east
.
<EOS>
Neither
side
had
as
yet
opened
rifle
fire
.
<EOS>
Getting
into
my
car
I
motored
back
to
the
main
road
,
but
it
was
so
blocked
by
the
procession
of
waggons
and
troops
of
the
retreating
army
that
I
could
not
turn
into
it
.
<EOS>
Wheeling
round
I
made
my
way
back
to
a
parallel
lane
I
had
noticed
,
and
turning
to
the
left
again
at
a
smithy
,
found
myself
in
a
road
bordered
by
cottages
and
enclosures
.
<EOS>
Here
I
found
the
Regular
troops
I
had
lately
met
lining
every
hedgerow
and
fence
,
while
I
could
see
others
on
a
knoll
further
to
their
left
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
church
here
,
and
,
mounting
to
the
roof
,
I
got
a
comparatively
extensive
view
.
<EOS>
To
my
right
the
long
dusty
column
of
men
and
waggons
still
toiled
along
the
Epping
Road
.
<EOS>
In
front
,
nearly
three
miles
off
,
an
apparently
solid
line
of
woods
stretched
along
the
horizon
,
surmounting
a
long
,
gradual
and
open
slope
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
position
of
our
lines
near
Epping
,
and
the
haven
for
which
Lord
Byfield
's
tired
soldiery
were
making
.
<EOS>
To
the
left
the
serried
masses
of
drab
-
clad
German
infantry
still
pushed
aggressively
forward
,
their
guns
firing
heavily
over
their
heads
.
 
<EOS>
[

BATTLE
OF
HARLOW
FINAL
PHASE

<EOS>
"
As
I
watched
them
three
tremendous
explosions
took
place
in
their
midst
,
killing
dozens
of
them
.
<EOS>
Fire
,
smoke
,
and
dust
rose
up
twenty
feet
in
the
air
,
while
three
ear
-
splitting
reports
rose
even
above
the
rolling
thunder
of
the
gunfire
.
<EOS>
More
followed
.
<EOS>
I
looked
again
towards
the
woodland
.
<EOS>
Here
I
saw
blaze
after
blaze
of
fire
among
the
dark
masses
of
trees
.
<EOS>
Our
big
guns
in
the
fortifications
had
got
to
work
,
and
were
punishing
the
Germans
most
severely
,
taking
their
attack
in
flank
with
the
big
6-inch
and
7.5-inch
projectiles
.
<EOS>
Cheers
arose
all
along
our
lines
,
as
shell
after
shell
,
fired
by
gunners
who
knew
to
an
inch
the
distances
to
every
house
and
conspicuous
tree
,
burst
among
the
German
ranks
,
killing
and
maiming
the
invaders
by
hundreds
.
<EOS>
The
advance
paused
,
faltered
and
,
being
hurriedly
reinforced
from
the
rear
,
once
more
went
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
big
high
explosive
projectiles
continued
to
fall
with
such
accuracy
and
persistence
that
the
attackers
fell
sullenly
back
,
losing
heavily
as
they
did
so
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
artillery
now
came
in
for
attention
,
and
also
was
driven
out
of
range
with
loss
.
<EOS>
The
last
stage
in
the
retreat
of
Lord
Byfield
's
command
was
now
secured
.
<EOS>
The
extended
troops
and
guns
gradually
drew
off
from
their
positions
,
still
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
the
foe
,
and
by
4.30
all
were
within
the
Epping
entrenchments
.
<EOS>
All
,
that
is
to
say
,
but
the
numerous
killed
and
wounded
during
the
running
fight
that
had
extended
along
the
last
seven
or
eight
miles
of
the
retreat
,
and
the
bulk
of
the
Dunmow
force
under
Sir
Jacob
Stellenbosch
,
which
with
its
commander
,
had
,
it
was
believed
,
been
made
prisoners
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
caught
between
the
39th
German
Infantry
Brigade
and
several
regiments
of
cavalry
,
that
it
was
said
had
arrived
from
the
northward
soon
after
they
were
beaten
at
Hatfield
Heath
.
<EOS>
Probably
these
were
the
advanced
troops
of
General
Froelich
's
Cavalry
Brigade

<EOS>
"
I
have
spent
a
busy
day
,
but
have
no
very
important
news
to
record
.
<EOS>
After
the
repulse
of
the
German
troops
attacking
Lord
Byfield
's
retreating
army
and
the
arrival
of
our
sorely
harassed
troops
behind
the
Epping
entrenchments
,
we
saw
no
more
of
the
enemy
that
evening
.
<EOS>
All
through
the
night
,
however
,
there
was
the
sound
of
occasional
heavy
gun
firing
from
the
eastward
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
up
my
quarters
at
the
Bell
,
an
inn
at
the
south
end
of
the
village
,
from
the
back
of
which
I
can
get
a
good
view
to
the
north
-
west
for
from
two
to
four
miles
.
<EOS>
Beyond
that
distance
the
high
ridge
known
as
Epping
Upland
limits
the
prospect
.
<EOS>
The
whole
terrain
is
cut
up
into
fields
of
various
sizes
and
dotted
all
over
with
trees
.
<EOS>
Close
by
is
a
lofty
red
brick
water
-
tower
,
which
has
been
utilised
by
Sir
Stapleton
Forsyth
as
a
signal
station
.
<EOS>
Away
about
a
mile
to
my
left
front
as
I
look
from
the
back
of
the
Bell
a
big
block
of
buildings
stands
prominently
out
on
a
grassy
spur
of
high
ground
.
<EOS>
This
is
Copped
Hall
and
Little
Copped
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
"
Both
mansions
have
been
transformed
into
fortresses
,
which
,
while
offering
little
or
no
resistance
to
artillery
fire
,
will
yet
form
a
tough
nut
for
the
Germans
to
crack
,
should
they
succeed
in
getting
through
our
entrenchments
at
that
point
.
<EOS>
Beyond
,
I
can
just
see
a
corner
of
a
big
earthwork
that
has
been
built
to
strengthen
the
defence
line
,
and
which
has
been
christened
Fort
Obelisk
from
a
farm
of
that
name
,
near
which
it
is
situated
.
<EOS>
There
is
another
smaller
redoubt
on
the
slope
just
below
this
hostelry
,
and
I
can
see
the
gunners
busy
about
the
three
big
khaki
-
painted
guns
which
are
mounted
in
it
.
<EOS>
There
are
a
6-inch
and
two
4.7-inch
guns
I
believe
.
<EOS>
This
morning
our
cavalry
,
consisting
of
a
regiment
of
yeomanry
and
some
mounted
infantry
,
who
had
formed
a
portion
of
Lord
Byfield
's
force
,
went
out
to
reconnoitre
towards
the
north
and
east
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
away
long
,
as
they
were
driven
back
in
every
direction
in
which
they
attempted
to
advance
,
by
superior
forces
of
the
enemy
's
cavalry
,
who
seemed
to
swarm
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
"
Later
on
,
I
believe
,
some
of
the
German
reiters
became
so
venturesome
that
several
squadrons
exposed
themselves
to
the
fire
of
the
big
guns
in
the
fort
at
Skip
's
Corner
,
and
suffered
pretty
severely
for
their
temerity
.
<EOS>
The
firing
continued
throughout
the
morning
away
to
eastward
.
<EOS>
At
noon
I
thought
I
would
run
down
and
see
if
I
could
find
anything
out
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
mounted
my
car
and
ran
off
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
I
found
that
there
was
a
regular
duel
going
on
between
our
guns
at
Kelvedon
Hatch
and
some
heavy
siege
guns
or
howitzers
that
the
enemy
had
got
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
high
ground
about
Norton
Heath
,
only
about
3,000
yards
distant
from
our
entrenchments
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
appear
to
have
done
us
much
damage
,
but
neither
,
in
all
probability
,
did
we
hurt
them
very
much
,
since
our
gunners
were
unable
to
exactly
locate
the
hostile
guns
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
got
back
to
Epping
,
about
three
o'clock
,
I
found
the
wide
single
street
full
of
troops
.
<EOS>
They
were
those
who
had
come
in
the
previous
afternoon
with
Lord
Byfield
,
and
who
,
having
been
allowed
to
rest
till
midday
after
their
long
fighting
march
,
were
now
being
told
off
to
their
various
sections
of
the
defence
line
.
<EOS>
The
Guard
regiments
were
allocated
to
the
northernmost
position
between
Fort
Royston
and
Fort
Skips
.
<EOS>
The
rifles
were
to
go
to
Copped
Hall
,
and
the
Seaforths
to
form
the
nucleus
of
a
central
reserve
of
Militia
and
Volunteers
,
which
was
being
established
just
north
of
Gaynes
Park
.
<EOS>
Epping
itself
and
the
contiguous
entrenchments
were
confided
to
the
Leinster
Regiment
,
which
alone
of
Sir
Jacob
Stellenbosch
's
brigade
had
escaped
capture
,
supported
by
two
Militia
battalions
.
<EOS>
The
field
batteries
were
distributed
under
shelter
of
the
woods
on
the
south
,
east
,
and
north
-
east
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
"
During
the
afternoon
the
welcome
news
arrived
that
the
remainder
of
Lord
Byfield
's
command
from
Baldock
,
Royston
,
and
Elmdon
had
safely
arrived
within
our
entrenchments
at
Enfield
and
New
Barnet
.
<EOS>
We
may
now
hope
that
what
with
Regulars
,
Militia
,
Volunteers
,
and
the
new
levies
,
our
lines
are
fully
and
effectively
manned
,
and
will
suffice
to
stay
the
further
advance
of
even
such
a
formidable
host
as
is
that
at
the
disposal
of
the
renowned
Von
Kronhelm
.
<EOS>
It
is
reported
too
,
from
Brentwood
,
that
great
progress
has
already
been
made
in
reorganising
and
distributing
the
broken
remnants
of
the
1st
and
5th
Armies
that
got
back
to
that
town
after
the
great
and
disastrous
battle
of
Chelmsford
.
<EOS>
Victorious
as
they
were
,
the
Germans
must
also
have
suffered
severely
,
which
may
give
us
some
breathing
time
before
their
next
onslaught
.

The
following
are
extracts
from
the
diary
picked
up
by
a
"
Daily
Telegraph
"
correspondent
,
lying
near
the
body
of
a
German
officer
after
the
fighting
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Enfield
Chase
.
<EOS>
It
is
presumed
that
the
officer
in
question
was
Major
Splittberger
,
of
the
Kaiser
Franz
Garde
Grenadier
Regiment
,
since
that
was
the
name
written
inside
the
cover
of
the
diary
.
 
<EOS>
From
enquiries
that
have
since
been
instituted
,
it
is
probable
that
the
deceased
officer
was
employed
on
the
staff
of
the
General
commanding
the
IVth
Corps
of
the
invading
Army
,
though
it
would
seem
from
the
contents
of
his
diary
that
he
saw
also
a
good
deal
of
the
operations
of
the
Xth
Corps
.
<EOS>
Our
readers
will
be
able
to
gather
from
it
the
general
course
of
the
enemy
's
strategy
and
tactics
during
the
time
immediately
preceding
the
most
recent
disasters
which
have
befallen
our
brave
defenders
.
<EOS>
The
first
extract
is
dated
September
15
,
and
was
written
somewhere
north
of
Epping
:
 
<EOS>
"
_
Sept
.
15._--So
far
<EOS>
the
bold
strategy
of
our
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
,
in
pushing
the
greater
part
of
the
Xth
Corps
directly
to
the
west
immediately
after
our
victory
at
Chelmsford
,
has
been
amply
justified
by
results
.
<EOS>
Although
we
just
missed
cutting
off
Lord
Byfield
and
a
large
portion
of
his
command
at
Harlow
,
we
gained
a
good
foothold
inside
the
British
defences
north
of
Epping
,
and
I
do
n't
think
it
will
be
long
before
we
have
very
much
improved
our
position
here
.
<EOS>
The
IVth
Corps
arrived
at
Harlow
about
midday
yesterday
in
splendid
condition
,
after
their
long
march
from
Newmarket
,
and
the
residue
of
the
Xth
joined
us
at
about
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
As
there
is
nothing
like
keeping
the
enemy
on
the
move
,
no
time
was
lost
in
preparing
to
attack
him
at
the
very
earliest
opportunity
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
it
was
dark
the
IVth
Corps
got
its
heavy
guns
and
howitzers
into
position
along
the
ridge
above
Epping
Upland
,
and
sent
the
greater
portion
of
its
field
batteries
forward
to
a
position
from
which
they
were
within

"
The
IXth
Corps
,
which
had
arrived
from
Chelmsford
that
evening
,
also
placed
its
field
artillery
in
a
similar
position
,
from
which
its
fire
crossed
that
of
the
IVth
Corps
.
<EOS>
This
Corps
also
provided
the
assaulting
troops
.
<EOS>
The
Xth
Corps
,
which
had
been
engaged
all
day
on
Thursday
,
was
held
in
reserve
.
<EOS>
The
howitzers
on
Epping
Upland
opened
fire
with
petrol
shell
on
the
belt
of
woods
that
lies
immediately
in
rear
of
the
position
to
be
attacked
,
and
with
the
assistance
of
a
strong
westerly
wind
succeeded
in
setting
them
on
fire
and
cutting
off
the
most
northerly
section
of
the
British
defences
from
reinforcement
.
<EOS>
This
was
soon
after
midnight
.
<EOS>
The
conflagration
not
only
did
us
this
service
,
but
it
is
supposed
so
attracted
the
attention
of
the
partially
-
trained
soldiers
of
the
enemy
that
they
did
not
observe
the
IXth
Corps
massing
for
the
assault
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
then
plastered
their
trenches
with
shrapnel
to
such
an
extent
that
they
did
not
dare
to
show
a
finger
above
them
,
and
finally
carried
the
northern
corner
by
assault
.
<EOS>
To
give
the
enemy
their
due
,
they
fought
well
,
but
we
outnumbered
them
five
to
one
,
and
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
resist
the
onslaught
of
our
well
-
trained
soldiers
.
<EOS>
News
came
to
-
day
that
the
Saxons
have
been
making
a
demonstration
before
Brentwood
with
a
view
of
keeping
the
British
employed
down
there
so
that
they
can
not
send
any
reinforcements
up
here
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
they
have
been
steadily
bombarding
Kelvedon
Hatch
from
Norton
Heath
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
hear
,
too
,
that
the
Garde
Corps
have
got
down
south
,
and
that
their
front
stretches
from
Broxbourne
to
Little
Berkhamsted
,
while
Froelich
's
Cavalry
Division
is
in
front
of
them
,
spread
all
over
the
country
,
from
the
River
Lea
away
to
the
westward
,
having
driven
the
whole
of
the
British
outlying
troops
and
patrols
under
the
shelter
of
their
entrenchments
.
<EOS>
Once
we
succeed
in
rolling
up
the
enemy
's
troops
in
this
quarter
,
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
are
entering
London
.

_
Sept
.
16._--Fighting
went
on
all
yesterday
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Skip
's
Corner
.
<EOS>
We
have
taken
the
redoubt
at
North
Weald
Basset
and
driven
the
English
back
into
the
belt
of
burnt
woodland
,
which
they
now
hold
along
its
northern
edge
.
<EOS>
All
day
long
,
too
,
our
big
guns
,
hidden
away
behind
the
groves
and
woods
above
Epping
Upland
,
poured
their
heavy
projectiles
on
Epping
and
its
defences
.
<EOS>
We
set
the
village
on
fire
three
times
,
but
the
British
contrived
to
extinguish
the
blaze
on
each
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
Epping
itself
will
be
our
next
point
of
attack
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
_
Sept
.
17._--We
are
still
progressing
,
fighting
is
now
all
but
continuous
.
<EOS>
How
long
it
may
last
I
have
no
idea
.
<EOS>
Probably
there
will
be
no
suspension
of
the
struggle
until
we
are
actually
masters
of
the
Metropolis
.
<EOS>
We
took
advantage
of
the
darkness
to
push
forward
our
men
to
within
three
thousand
yards
of
the
enemy
's
line
,
placing
them
as
far
as
possible
under
cover
of
the
numerous
copses
,
plantations
,
and
hedgerows
which
cover
the
face
of
this
fertile
country
.
<EOS>
At
4
a.m.
the
General
ordered
his
staff
to
assemble
at
Latton
Park
,
where
he
had
established
his
headquarters
.
<EOS>
He
unfolded
to
us
the
general
outline
of
the
attack
,
which
,
he
now
announced
,
was
to
commence
at
six
precisely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
myself
that
it
was
a
somewhat
inopportune
time
,
as
we
should
have
the
rising
sun
right
in
our
eyes
;
but
I
imagine
that
the
idea
was
to
have
as
much
daylight
as
possible
before
us
.
<EOS>
For
although
we
had
employed
a
night
attack
against
Skip
's
Corner
,
and
successfully
too
,
yet
the
general
feeling
in
our
Army
has
always
been
opposed
to
operations
of
this
kind
.
<EOS>
The
possible
gain
is
,
I
think
,
in
no
way
commensurable
with
the
probable
risks
of
panic
and
disorder
.
<EOS>
The
principal
objective
was
the
village
of
Epping
itself
;
but
simultaneous
attacks
were
to
be
carried
out
against
Copped
Hall
,
Fort
Obelisk
,
to
the
west
of
it
,
and
Fort
Royston
,
about
a
mile
north
of
the
village
.
<EOS>
The
IXth
Corps
was
to
co
-
operate
by
a
determined
attempt
to
break
through
the
English
lining
the
burnt
strip
of
woodland
and
to
assault
the
latter
fort
in
rear
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
to
carry
out
both
these
flanking
attacks
in
order
to
prevent
the
main
attack
from
being
enfiladed
from
right
and
left
.
<EOS>
At
5.30
we
mounted
,
and
rode
off
to
Rye
Hill
about
a
couple
of
miles
distant
,
from
which
the
General
intended
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
operations
.
<EOS>
The
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
were
filling
the
eastern
sky
with
a
pale
light
as
we
cantered
off
,
the
long
wooded
ridge
on
which
the
enemy
had
his
position
standing
up
in
a
misty
silhouette
against
the
growing
day
.

"
As
we
topped
Rye
Hill
I
could
see
the
thickly
-
massed
lines
of
our
infantry
crouching
behind
every
hedge
,
bank
,
or
ridge
,
their
rifle
-
barrels
here
and
there
twinkling
in
the
feeble
rays
of
the
early
sun
,
their
shadows
long
and
attenuated
behind
them
.
<EOS>
Epping
with
its
lofty
red
water
-
tower
was
distinctly
visible
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
,
and
it
is
probable
that
the
movement
of
the
General
's
cavalcade
of
officers
,
with
the
escort
,
attracted
the
attention
of
the
enemy
's
lookouts
,
for
half
-
way
down
the
hillside
on
their
side
of
the
valley
a
blinding
violet
-
white
flash
blazed
out
,
and
a
big
shell
came
screaming
along
just
over
our
heads
,
the
loud
boom
of
a
heavy
gun
following
fast
on
its
heels
.
<EOS>
Almost
simultaneously
another
big
projectile
hurtled
up
from
the
direction
of
Fort
Obelisk
,
and
burst
among
our
escort
of
Uhlans
with
a
deluge
of
livid
flame
and
thick
volumes
of
greenish
brown
smoke
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
telling
shot
,
for
no
fewer
than
six
horses
and
their
riders
lay
in
a
shattered
heap
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
six
precisely
our
guns
fired
a
salvo
directed
on
Epping
village
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
preconcerted
signal
for
attack
,
and
before
the
echoes
of
the
thunderous
discharge
had
finished
reverberating
over
the
hills
and
forest
,
our
front
lines
had
sprung
to
their
feet
and
were
moving
at
a
racing
pace
towards
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
the
British
seemed
stupefied
by
the
suddenness
of
the
advance
.
<EOS>
A
few
rifle
shots
crackled
out
here
and
there
,
but
our
men
had
thrown
themselves
to
the
ground
after
their
first
rush
before
the
enemy
seemed
to
wake
up
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
when
they
did
.
<EOS>
Seldom
have
I
seen
such
a
concentrated
fire
.
<EOS>
Gun
,
pom
-
pom
,
machine
gun
,
and
rifle
blazed
out
from
right
to
left
along
more
than
three
miles
of
entrenchments
.
<EOS>
A
continuous
lightning
-
like
line
of
fire
poured
forth
from
the
British
trenches
,
which
still
lay
in
shadow
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
bullets
raising
perfect
sand
-
storms
in
places
,
the
little
pom
-
pom
shells
sparkling
about
all
over
our
prostrate
men
,
and
the
shrapnel
bursting
all
along
their
front
,
producing
perfect
swathes
of
white
smoke
,
which
hung
low
down
in
the
still
air
in
the
valley
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
our
artillery
was
not
idle
.
<EOS>
The
field
guns
,
pushed
well
forward
,
showered
shrapnel
upon
the
British
position
,
the
howitzer
shells
hurtled
over
our
heads
on
their
way
to
the
enemy
in
constantly
increasing
numbers
as
the
ranges
were
verified
by
the
trial
shots
,
while
a
terrible
and
unceasing
reverberation
from
the
north
-
east
told
of
the
supporting
attack
made
by
the
IXth
and
Xth
Corps
upon
the
blackened
woods
held
by
the
English
.
<EOS>
The
concussion
of
the
terrific
cannonade
that
now
resounded
from
every
quarter
was
deafening
;
the
air
seemed
to
pulse
within
one
's
ears
,
and
it
was
difficult
to
hear
one
's
nearest
neighbour
speak
.
<EOS>
Down
in
the
valley
our
men
appeared
to
be
suffering
severely
.
<EOS>
Every
forward
move
of
the
attacking
lines
left
a
perfect
litter
of
prostrate
forms
behind
it
,
and
for
some
time
I
felt
very
doubtful
in
my
own
mind
if
the
attack
would
succeed
.
<EOS>
Glancing
to
the
right
,
however
,
I
was
encouraged
to
see
the
progress
that
had
been
made
by
the
troops
detailed
for
the
assault
on
Copped
Hall
and
Obelisk
Fort
,
and
seeing
this
,
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
not
intended
to
push
the
central
attack
on
Epping
home
before
its
flank
had
been
secured
from
molestation
from
this
direction
.
<EOS>
Copped
Hall
itself
stood
out
on
a
bare
down
almost
like
some
mediaeval
castle
,
backed
by
the
dark
masses
of
forest
,
while
to
the
west
of
it
<EOS>
the
slopes
of
Fort
Obelisk
could
barely
be
distinguished
,
so
flat
were
they
and
so
well
screened
by
greenery
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
its
position
was
clearly
defined
by
the
clouds
of
dust
,
smoke
,
and
debris
constantly
thrown
up
by
our
heavy
high
-
explosive
shells
,
while
ever
and
anon
<EOS>
there
came
a
dazzling
flash
from
it
,
followed
by
a
detonation
that
made
itself
heard
even
above
the
rolling
of
the
cannonade
,
as
one
of
its
big
7.5
guns
was
discharged
.
<EOS>
The
roar
of
their
huge
projectiles
,
too
,
as
they
tore
through
the
air
,
was
easily
distinguishable
.
<EOS>
None
of
our
epaulments
were
proof
against
them
,
and
they
did
our
heavy
batteries
<EOS>
a
great
deal
of
damage
before
they
could
be
silenced
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
cut
a
long
story
short
,
we
captured
Epping
after
a
tough
fight
,
and
by
noon
were
in
possession
of
everything
north
of
the
Forest
,
including
the
war
-
scarred
ruins
that
now
represented
the
mansion
of
Copped
Hall
,
and
from
which
our
pom
-
poms
and
machine
guns
were
firing
into
Fort
Obelisk
.
<EOS>
But
our
losses
had
been
awful
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
enemy
,
they
could
hardly
have
suffered
less
severely
,
for
though
partially
protected
by
their
entrenchments
,
our
artillery
fire
must
have
been
utterly
annihilating
.

_
Sept
.
18._--Fighting
went
on
all
last
night
,
the
English
holding
desperately
on
to
the
edge
of
the
Forest
,
our
people
pressing
them
close
,
and
working
round
their
right
flank
.
<EOS>
When
day
broke
the
general
situation
was
pretty
much
like
this
.
<EOS>
On
our
left
the
IXth
Corps
were
in
possession
of
the
Fort
at
Toothill
,
and
a
redoubt
that
lay
between
it
and
Skip
's
Fort
.
<EOS>
Two
batteries
were
bombarding
a
redoubt
lower
down
in
the
direction
of
Stanford
Rivers
,
which
was
also
subjected
to
a
cross
fire
from
their
howitzers
near
Ongar
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
for
the
English
,
their
position
was
an
unenviable
one
.
<EOS>
From
Copped
Hall
--
as
soon
as
we
have
cleared
the
edge
of
the
Forest
of
the
enemy
's
sharpshooters
--
we
shall
be
able
to
take
their
entrenchments
in
reverse
all
the
way
to
Waltham
Abbey
.
<EOS>
They
have
,
on
the
other
hand
,
an
outlying
fort
about
a
mile
or
two
north
of
the
latter
place
,
which
gave
us
some
trouble
with
its
heavy
guns
yesterday
,
and
which
it
is
most
important
that
we
should
gain
possession
of
before
we
advance
further
.
<EOS>
The
Garde
Corps
on
the
western
side
of
the
River
Lea
is
now
,
I
hear
,
in
sight
of
the
enemy
's
lines
,
and
is
keeping
them
busily
employed
,
though
without
pushing
its
attack
home
for
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
daybreak
this
morning
I
was
in
Epping
and
saw
the
beginning
of
the
attack
on
the
Forest
.
<EOS>
It
is
rumoured
that
large
reinforcements
have
reached
the
enemy
from
London
,
but
as
these
must
be
merely
scratch
soldiers
they
will
do
them
more
harm
than
good
in
their
cramped
position
.
<EOS>
The
Xth
Corps
had
got
a
dozen
batteries
in
position
a
little
to
the
eastward
of
the
village
,
and
at
six
o'clock
these
guns
opened
a
tremendous
fire
upon
the
north
-
east
corner
of
the
Forest
,
under
cover
of
which
their
infantry
deployed
down
in
the
low
ground
about
Coopersale
,
and
advanced
to
the
attack
.
<EOS>
Petrol
shells
were
not
used
against
the
Forest
,
as
Von
Kronhelm
had
given
orders
that
it
was
not
to
be
burned
if
it
could
possibly
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
The
shrapnel
was
very
successful
in
keeping
down
the
fire
from
the
edge
of
the
trees
,
but
our
troops
received
a
good
deal
of
damage
from
infantry
and
guns
that
were
posted
to
the
east
of
the
Forest
on
a
hill
near
Theydon
Bois
.
<EOS>
But
about
seven
o'clock
these
troops
were
driven
from
their
position
by
a
sudden
flank
attack
made
by
the
IXth
Corps
from
Theydon
Mount
.
<EOS>
Von
Kleppen
followed
this
up
by
putting
some
of
his
own
guns
up
there
,
which
were
able
to
fire
on
the
edge
of
the
Forest
after
those
of
the
Xth
Corps
had
been
masked
by
the
close
advance
of
their
infantry
.
<EOS>
To
make
a
long
story
short
,
by
ten
the
whole
of
the
Forest
,
east
of
the
London
Road
,
as
far
south
as
the
cross
roads
near
Jack
's
Hill
,
was
in
our
hands
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
IVth
Corps
had
made
itself
master
of
Fort
Obelisk
,
and
our
gunners
were
hard
at
work
mounting
guns
in
it
with
which
to
fire
on
the
outlying
fort
at
Monkham
's
Hall
.
<EOS>
Von
Kleppen
was
at
Copped
Hall
about
this
time
,
and
with
him
I
found
General
Von
Wilberg
,
commanding
the
Xth
Corps
,
in
close
consultation
.
<EOS>
The
once
fine
mansion
had
been
almost
completely
shot
away
down
to
its
lower
storey
.
<EOS>
A
large
portion
of
this
,
however
,
was
still
fairly
intact
,
having
been
protected
to
a
certain
extent
by
the
masses
of
masonry
that
had
fallen
all
around
it
,
and
also
by
the
thick
ramparts
of
earth
that
the
English
had
built
up
against
its
exposed
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
men
were
still
firing
from
its
loopholes
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
,
which
were
only
about
1,200
yards
distant
,
and
from
which
bullets
were
continually
whistling
in
by
every
window
.
<EOS>
Two
of
our
battalions
had
dug
themselves
in
in
the
wooded
park
surrounding
the
house
,
and
were
also
exchanging
fire
with
the
English
at
comparatively
close
ranges
.
<EOS>
They
had
,
I
was
told
,
made
more
than
one
attempt
to
rush
the
edge
of
the
Forest
,
but
had
been
repulsed
by
rifle
fire
on
each
occasion
.
<EOS>
Away
to
the
west
I
could
see
for
miles
,
and
even
distinguish
our
shells
bursting
all
over
the
enemy
's
fort
at
Monkham
's
Hall
,
which
was
being
subjected
to
a
heavy
bombardment
by
our
guns
on
the
high
ground
to
the
north
of
it
.
<EOS>
About
eleven
Froelich
's
Cavalry
Brigade
,
whose
presence
was
no
longer
required
in
front
of
the
Garde
Corps
,
passed
through
Epping
,
going
south
-
east
.
<EOS>
It
is
generally
supposed
that
it
is
either
to
attack
the
British
at
Brentwood
in
the
rear
,
or
,
which
I
think
is
more
probable
,
to
intimidate
the
raw
levies
by
its
presence
between
them
and
London
,
and
to
attack
them
in
flank
<EOS>
should
they
attempt
to
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
after
eleven
another
battalion
arrived
at
Copped
Hall
from
Epping
,
and
orders
were
given
that
the
English
position
along
the
edge
of
the
Forest
was
to
be
taken
at
all
cost
.
<EOS>
Just
before
the
attack
began
there
was
a
great
deal
of
firing
somewhere
in
the
interior
of
the
Forest
,
presumably
between
the
British
and
the
advanced
troops
of
the
Xth
Corps
.
<EOS>
However
this
may
have
been
,
it
was
evident
that
the
enemy
were
holding
our
part
of
the
Forest
much
less
strongly
and
our
assault
was
entirely
successful
,
with
but
small
loss
of
men
.
<EOS>
Once
in
the
woods
,
the
superior
training
and
discipline
of
our
men
told
heavily
in
their
favour
.
<EOS>
While
the
mingled
mass
of
Volunteers
and
raw
free
-
shooters
,
of
which
the
bulk
of
their
garrison
was
composed
,
got
utterly
disorganised
and
out
of
hand
under
the
severe
strain
on
them
that
was
imposed
by
the
difficulties
of
wood
fighting
,
and
hindered
and
broke
up
the
regular
units
,
our
people
were
easily
kept
well
in
hand
,
and
drove
the
enemy
steadily
before
them
without
a
single
check
.
<EOS>
The
rattle
of
rifle
and
machine
gun
was
continuous
through
all
the
leafy
dells
and
glades
of
the
wood
,
but
by
two
o'clock
practically
the
whole
Forest
was
in
the
hands
of
our
Xth
Corps
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
the
turn
of
the
IVth
Corps
,
who
in
the
meantime
,
far
from
being
idle
,
had
massed
a
large
number
of
their
guns
at
Copped
Hall
,
from
which
,
aided
by
the
fire
from
Fort
Obelisk
,
the
enemy
's
lines
were
subjected
to
a
bombardment
that
rendered
them
absolutely
untenable
,
and
we
could
see
company
after
company
making
their
way
to
Waltham
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
three
the
order
for
a
general
advance
on
Waltham
Abbey
was
issued
.
<EOS>
As
the
enemy
seemed
to
have
few
,
if
any
,
guns
at
this
place
,
it
was
determined
to
make
use
of
some
of
the
new
armoured
motors
that
accompanied
the
Army
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
,
who
was
personally
directing
the
operations
from
Copped
Hall
,
had
caused
each
Corps
to
send
its
own
motors
to
Epping
,
so
that
we
had
something
like
thirty
at
our
disposal
.
<EOS>
These
quaint
,
grey
monsters
came
down
through
the
Forest
and
advanced
on
Epping
by
two
parallel
roads
,
one
passing
by
the
south
of
Warlies
Park
,
the
other
being
the
main
road
from
Epping
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
weird
sight
to
see
these
shore
-
going
armour
-
clads
flying
down
upon
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
got
within
800
yards
of
the
houses
,
but
the
enemy
contrived
to
block
their
further
advance
by
various
obstacles
which
they
placed
on
the
roads
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
about
an
hour
's
desperate
fighting
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
The
old
Abbey
Church
was
set
on
fire
by
a
stray
shell
,
the
conflagration
spreading
to
the
neighbouring
houses
,
and
both
British
and
Germans
being
too
busy
killing
each
other
to
put
it
out
,
the
whole
village
was
shortly
in
flames
.
<EOS>
The
British
were
finally
driven
out
of
it
,
and
across
the
river
by
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
every
heavy
gun
that
could
be
got
to
bear
was
directed
on
the
fort
at
Monkham
's
Hall
,
which
,
during
the
afternoon
,
was
also
made
the
target
for
the
guns
of
the
Garde
Corps
,
which
co
-
operated
with
us
by
attacking
the
lines
at
Cheshunt
,
and
assisting
us
with
its
artillery
fire
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
By
nightfall
the
fort
was
a
mass
of
smoking
earth
,
over
which
fluttered
our
black
cross
flag
,
and
the
front
of
the
IVth
Corps
stretched
from
this
to
Gillwell
Park
,
four
miles
nearer
London
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Xth
Corps
was
in
support
in
the
Forest
behind
us
,
and
forming
also
a
front
to
cover
our
flank
,
reaching
from
Chingford
to
Buckhurst
Hill
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
was
quite
demoralised
in
this
direction
,
and
showed
no
indication
of
resuming
the
engagement
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
IXth
Corps
,
its
advanced
troops
were
at
Lamboume
End
,
in
close
communication
with
General
Froelich
,
who
had
established
his
headquarters
at
Havering
-
atte
-
Bower
.
<EOS>
We
have
driven
a
formidable
wedge
right
into
the
middle
of
the
carefully
elaborated
system
of
defence
arranged
by
the
English
generals
,
and
it
will
now
be
a
miracle
if
they
can
prevent
our
entry
into
the
capital
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
not
,
of
course
,
effected
this
without
great
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
,
but
you
ca
n't
make
puddings
without
breaking
eggs
,
and
in
the
end
a
bold
and
forward
policy
is
more
economical
of
life
and
limb
than
attempting
to
avoid
necessary
losses
,
as
our
present
opponents
did
in
South
Africa
,
thereby
prolonging
the
war
to
an
almost
indefinite
period
,
and
losing
many
more
men
by
sickness
and
in
driblets
than
would
have
been
the
case
if
they
had
followed
a
more
determined
line
in
their
strategy
and
tactics
.
<EOS>
Just
before
the
sun
sank
behind
the
masses
of
new
houses
which
the
monster
city
spreads
out
to
the
northward
I
got
orders
to
carry
a
despatch
to
General
von
Wilberg
,
who
was
stated
to
be
at
Chingford
,
on
our
extreme
left
.
<EOS>
I
went
by
the
Forest
road
,
as
the
parallel
one
near
the
river
was
in
most
parts
under
fire
from
the
opposite
bank
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
had
established
his
headquarters
at
the
Foresters
'
Inn
,
which
stands
high
up
on
a
wooded
mound
,
and
from
which
he
could
see
a
considerable
distance
and
keep
in
touch
with
his
various
signal
stations
.
<EOS>
He
took
my
despatch
,
telling
me
that
I
should
have
a
reply
to
take
back
later
on
.
'
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
'
said
he
,
'
if
you
will
fall
in
with
my
staff
you
will
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
first
shots
fired
into
the
biggest
city
in
the
world
.
'
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
went
out
to
his
horse
,
which
was
waiting
outside
,
and
we
started
off
down
the
hill
with
a
great
clatter
.
<EOS>
After
winding
about
through
a
somewhat
intricate
network
of
roads
and
by
-
lanes
we
arrived
at
Old
Chingford
Church
,
which
stands
upon
a
species
of
headland
,
rising
boldly
up
above
the
flat
and
,
in
some
places
,
marshy
land
to
the
westward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Close
to
the
church
was
a
battery
of
four
big
howitzers
,
the
gunners
grouped
around
them
silhouetted
darkly
against
the
blood
-
red
sky
.
<EOS>
From
up
here
the
vast
city
,
spreading
out
to
the
south
and
west
,
lay
like
a
grey
,
sprawling
octopus
spreading
out
ray
-
like
to
the
northward
,
every
rise
and
ridge
being
topped
with
a
bristle
of
spires
and
chimney
-
pots
.
<EOS>
An
ominous
silence
seemed
to
brood
over
the
teeming
landscape
,
broken
only
at
intervals
by
the
dull
booming
of
guns
from
the
northward
.
<EOS>
Long
swathes
of
cloud
and
smoke
lay
athwart
the
dull
,
furnace
-
like
glow
of
the
sunset
,
and
lights
were
beginning
to
sparkle
out
all
over
the
vast
expanse
which
lay
before
us
mirrored
here
and
there
in
the
canals
and
rivers
that
ran
almost
at
our
feet
.
'
<EOS>
Now
,
'
said
Von
Wilberg
at
length
,
'
commence
fire
.
'
<EOS>
One
of
the
big
guns
gave
tongue
with
a
roar
that
seemed
to
make
the
church
tower
quiver
above
us
.
<EOS>
Another
and
another
followed
in
succession
,
their
big
projectiles
hurtling
and
humming
through
the
quiet
evening
air
on
their
errands
of
death
and
destruction
in
<EOS>
I
know
<EOS>
not
what
quarter
of
the
crowded
suburbs
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
me
a
cruel
and
needless
thing
to
do
,
but
I
am
told
that
it
was
done
with
the
set
purpose
of
arousing
such
a
feeling
of
alarm
and
insecurity
in
the
East
End
that
the
mob
might
try
to
interfere
with
any
further
measures
for
defence
that
the
British
military
authorities
might
undertake
.
<EOS>
I
got
my
despatch
soon
afterwards
and
returned
with
it
to
the
General
,
who
was
spending
the
night
at
Copped
Hall
.
<EOS>
There
,
too
,
I
got
myself
a
shakedown
and
slumbered
soundly
till
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
_
Sept
.
19._--To
-
day
we
have
,
I
think
,
finally
broken
down
all
organised
military
opposition
in
the
field
,
though
we
may
expect
a
considerable
amount
of
street
fighting
before
reaping
the
whole
fruits
of
our
victories
.
<EOS>
At
daybreak
we
began
by
turning
a
heavy
fire
from
every
possible
quarter
on
the
wooded
island
formed
by
the
river
and
various
back
-
waters
just
north
of
Waltham
Abbey
.
<EOS>
The
poplar
-
clad
islet
,
which
was
full
of
the
enemy
's
troops
,
became
absolutely
untenable
under
this
concentrated
fire
,
and
they
were
compelled
to
fall
back
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
Our
Engineers
soon
began
their
bridging
operations
behind
the
wood
,
and
our
infantry
,
crossing
over
,
got
close
up
to
a
redoubt
on
the
further
side
and
took
it
by
storm
.
<EOS>
Again
we
were
able
to
take
a
considerable
section
of
the
enemy
's
lines
in
reverse
,
and
as
they
were
driven
out
by
our
fire
,
against
which
they
had
no
protection
,
the
Garde
Corps
advanced
,
and
by
ten
were
in
possession
of
Cheshunt
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
meanwhile
,
covered
by
the
fire
of
the
guns
belonging
to
the
IXth
and
Xth
Corps
,
other
bridges
had
been
thrown
across
the
Lea
at
various
points
between
Waltham
and
Chingford
,
and
in
another
hour
the
crossing
began
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
had
no
good
positions
for
his
guns
,
and
seemed
to
have
very
few
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
pinned
his
faith
upon
the
big
weapons
he
had
placed
in
his
entrenchments
,
and
those
were
now
of
no
further
use
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
lost
a
number
of
his
field
guns
,
either
from
damage
or
capture
,
and
with
our
more
numerous
artillery
firing
from
the
high
ground
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
we
were
always
able
to
beat
down
any
attempt
he
made
to
reply
to
their
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
a
day
of
fierce
fighting
before
us
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
manoeuvring
.
<EOS>
We
were
in
a
wilderness
of
scattered
houses
and
occasional
streets
,
in
which
the
enemy
contested
our
progress
foot
by
foot
.
<EOS>
Edmonton
,
Enfield
Wash
,
and
Waltham
Cross
were
quickly
captured
;
our
artillery
commanded
them
too
well
to
allow
the
British
to
make
a
successful
defence
;
but
Enfield
itself
,
lying
along
a
steepish
ridge
,
on
which
the
British
had
assembled
what
artillery
they
could
scrape
together
,
cost
us
dearly
.
<EOS>
The
streets
of
this
not
too
lovely
suburban
town
literally
ran
with
blood
when
at
last
we
made
our
way
into
it
.
<EOS>
A
large
part
of
it
was
burnt
to
ashes
,
including
unfortunately
the
ancient
palace
of
Queen
Elizabeth
,
and
the
venerable
and
enormous
cedar
-
tree
that
overhung
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
British
fell
back
to
a
second
position
they
had
apparently
prepared
along
a
parallel
ridge
farther
to
the
westward
,
their
left
being
between
us
and
New
Barnet
and
their
right
at
Southgate
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
did
not
attempt
to
advance
farther
to
-
day
,
but
contented
ourselves
in
reorganising
our
forces
and
preparing
against
a
possible
counter
-
attack
,
by
barricading
and
entrenching
the
farther
edge
of
Enfield
Ridge
.
<EOS>
"
 
"
_
Sept
.
20._--We
are
falling
in
immediately
,
as
it
has
been
decided
to
attack
the
British
position
at
once
.
<EOS>
Already
the
artillery
duel
is
in
progress
.
<EOS>
I
must
continue
to
-
night
,
as
my
horse
is
at
the
door
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
 
<EOS>
BOMBARDMENT
OF
LONDON
.
  
<EOS>
Day
broke
.
<EOS>
The
faint
flush
of
violet
away
eastward
beyond
Temple
Bar
gradually
turned
rose
,
heralding
the
sun
's
coming
,
and
by
degrees
the
streets
,
filled
by
excited
Londoners
,
grew
lighter
with
the
dawn
.
<EOS>
Fevered
night
thus
gave
place
to
day
--
a
day
that
was
,
alas
!
<EOS>
destined
to
be
one
of
bitter
memory
for
the
British
Empire
.
 
<EOS>
Alarming
news
had
spread
that
Uhlans
had
been
seen
reconnoitring
in
Snaresbrook
and
Wanstead
,
had
ridden
along
Forest
Road
and
Ferry
Lane
at
Walthamstow
,
through
Tottenham
High
Cross
,
up
High
Street
,
Hornsey
,
Priory
Road
,
and
Muswell
Hill
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
were
actually
upon
London
!
 
<EOS>
The
northern
suburbs
were
staggered
.
<EOS>
In
Fortis
Green
,
North
End
,
Highgate
,
Crouch
End
,
Hampstead
,
Stamford
Hill
,
and
Leyton
<EOS>
the
quiet
suburban
houses
were
threatened
,
and
many
people
,
in
fear
of
their
lives
,
had
now
fled
southward
into
central
London
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
huge
population
of
greater
London
was
practically
huddled
together
in
the
comparatively
small
area
from
Kensington
to
Fleet
Street
,
and
from
Oxford
Street
to
the
Thames
Embankment
.
 
<EOS>
People
of
Fulham
,
Putney
,
Walham
Green
,
Hammersmith
,
and
Kew
had
,
for
the
most
part
,
fled
away
to
the
open
country
across
Hounslow

while
Tooting
,
Balham
,
Dulwich
,
Streatham
,
Norwood
,
and
Catford
had
retreated
farther
south
into
Surrey
and
Kent
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
past
three
days
thousands
of
willing
helpers
had
followed
the
example
of
Sheffield
and
Birmingham
,
and
constructed
enormous
barricades
,
obstructing
at
various
points
the
chief
roads
leading
from
the
north
and
east
into
London
.
<EOS>
Detachments
of
Engineers
had
blown
up
several
of
the
bridges
carrying
the
main
roads
out
eastwards
--
for
instance
,
the
bridge
at
the
end
of
Commercial
Road
,
East
,
crossing
the
Limehouse
Canal
,
while
the
six
other
smaller
bridges
spanning
the
canal
between
that
point
and
the
Bow
Road
were
also
destroyed
.
<EOS>
The
bridge
at
the
end
of
Bow
Road
itself
was
shattered
,
and
those
over
the
Hackney
Cut
at
Marshall
Hill
and
Hackney
Wick
were
also
rendered
impassable
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
the
bridges
across
the
Regent
's
Canal
were
also
destroyed
,
notably
those
in
Mare
Street
,
Hackney
,
the
Kingsland
Road
,
and
New
North
Road
,
while
a
similar
demolition
took
place
in
Edgware
Road
and
the
Harrow
Road
.
<EOS>
Londoners
were
frantic
,
now
that
the
enemy
were
really
upon
them
.
<EOS>
The
accounts
of
the
battles
in
the
newspapers
had
,
of
course
,
been
merely
fragmentary
,
and
they
had
not
yet
realised
what
war
actually
meant
.
<EOS>
They
knew
that
all
business
was
at
a
standstill
,
that
the
City
was
in
an
uproar
,
that
there
was
no
work
,
and
that
food
was
at
famine
prices
.
<EOS>
But
not
until
German
cavalry
were
actually
seen
scouring
the
northern
suburbs
<EOS>
did
it
become
impressed
upon
them
that
they
were
really
helpless
and
defenceless
.
 
<EOS>
London
was
to
be
besieged
!
 
<EOS>
This
report
having
got
about
,
the
people
began
building
barricades
in
many
of
the
principal
thoroughfares
north
of
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
One
huge
obstruction
,
built
mostly
of
paving
stones
from
the
footways
,
overturned
tramcars
,
waggons
,
railway
trollies
,
and
barbed
wire
,
rose
in
the
Holloway
Road
,
just
beyond
Highbury
Station
.
<EOS>
Another
blocked
the
Caledonian
Road
a
few
yards
north
of
the
police
-
station
,
while
another
very
large
and
strong
pile
of
miscellaneous
goods
,
bales
of
wool
and
cotton
stuffs
,
building
material
,
and
stones
brought
from
the
Great
Northern
Railway
depot
,
obstructed
the
Camden
Road
at
the
south
corner
of
Hilldrop
Crescent
.
<EOS>
Across
High
Street
,
Camden
Town
,
at
the
junction
of
the
Kentish
Town
and
other
roads
,
five
hundred
men
worked
with
a
will
,
piling
together
every
kind
of
ponderous
object
they
could
pillage
from
the
neighbouring
shops
--
pianos
,
iron
bedsteads
,
wardrobes
,
pieces
of
calico
and
flannel
,
dress
stuffs
,
rolls
of
carpets
,
floorboards
,
even
the
very
doors
wrenched
from
their
hinges
--
until
,
when
it
reached
to
the
second
storey
window
and
was
considered
of
sufficient
height
,
a
pole
was
planted
on
top
,
and
from
it
hung
limply
a
small
Union
Jack
.

other

placed
with

from
entering
London

<EOS>
At
a
hundred
other
points
,
in
the
narrower
and
more
obscure
thoroughfares
,
all
along
the
north
of
London
,
busy
workers
were
constructing
similar
defences
,
houses
and
shops
being
ruthlessly
broken
open
and
cleared
of
their
contents
by
the
frantic
and
terrified
populace
.
 
<EOS>
London
was
in
a
ferment
.
<EOS>
Almost
without
exception
the
gunmakers
'
shops
had
been
pillaged
,
and
every
rifle
,
sporting
gun
,
and
revolver
seized
.
<EOS>
The
armouries
at
the
Tower
of
London
,
at
the
various
barracks
,
and
the
factory
out
at
Enfield
had
long
ago
all
been
cleared
of
their
contents
;
for
now
,
in
this
last
stand
,
every
one
was
desperate
,
and
all
who
could
obtain
a
gun
did
so
.
<EOS>
Many
,
however
,
had
guns
but
no
ammunition
;
others
had
sporting
ammunition
for
service
rifles
,
and
others
cartridges
,
but
no
gun
.
 
<EOS>
Those
,
however
,
who
had
guns
and
ammunition
complete
mounted
guard
at
the
barricades
,
being
assisted
at
some
points
by
Volunteers
who
had
been
driven
in
from
Essex
.
<EOS>
Upon
more
than
one
barricade
in
North
London
a
Maxim
had
been
mounted
,
and
was
now
pointed
,
ready
to
sweep
away
the
enemy
should
they
advance
.
 
<EOS>
Other
thoroughfares
barricaded
,
beside
those
mentioned
,
were
the
Stroud
Green

,
where
it
joins
Hanley

the

at

with
West

and
various
roads
around
the
New

reservoirs
,
which
were
believed
to
be
one
of
the
objectives
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
These
latter
were
very
strongly
held
by
thousands
of
brave
and
patriotic
citizens
,
though
the
East
London
reservoirs
across
at
Walthamstow
could
not
be
defended
,
situated
so
openly
as
they
were
.
<EOS>
The
people
of
Leytonstone
threw
up
a
barricade
opposite
the
schools
in
the
High
Road
,
while
in
Wanstead
a
hastily

constructed
,
but
perfectly
useless
,
obstruction
was
piled
across
Cambridge

,
where
it
joins
the
Blake

<EOS>
Of
course
,
all
the
women
and
children
in
the
northern
suburbs
had
now
been
sent
south
.
<EOS>
Half
the
houses
in
those
quiet
,
newly

built
roads
were
locked
up
,
and
their
owners
gone
;
for
as
soon
as
the
report
spread
of
the
result
of
the
final
battle
before
London
,
and
our
crushing

living

Hampstead

,
Hornsey

Tottenham

Finsbury

<EOS>
Think
what
it
meant
to
those
suburban
families
of
City

!
<EOS>
The
ruthless
destruction
of
their
pretty
,
long

cherished
homes
,
flight
into
the
turbulent
,
noisy
,
distracted
,
hungry
city
,
and
the
loss
of
everything
they
possessed
.
<EOS>
In
most
cases
the

was
already
bearing
his
part
in
the
defence
of
the

with
gun
or
with

,
or
helping
to
move
heavy
masses

for

<EOS>
The

so
fondly
called
"

"
lock

join
in
those
long
mournful

moving

Touching

that
day

<EOS>
Homeless
women
,
many
of
them
with
two
or
three
little
ones
,
were
wandering
through
the
less
frequented
streets
,
avoiding
the
main
roads
with
all
their
crush
,
excitement
,
and
barricade
-
building
,
but
making
their
way
westward
,
beyond
Kensington
and
Hammersmith
,
which
was
now
become
the
outlet
of
the
Metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
All
trains
from
Charing
Cross
,
Waterloo
,
London
Bridge
,
Victoria
,
and
Paddington
had
for
the
past
three
days
been
crowded
to
excess
.
<EOS>
Anxious
fathers
struggled
fiercely
to
obtain
places
for
their
wives
,
mothers
,
and
daughters
--
sending
them
away
anywhere
out
of
the
city
which

be
crushed
beneath
the
iron
heel

The
South
Western
and
Great
Western
systems
carried
thousands
upon
thousands
of
the
wealthier
away
to
Devonshire
and
Cornwall
--
as
far
as
possible
from
the
theatre
of
war
;
the
South
Eastern
and
Chatham
took
people
into
the
already
crowded
Kentish
towns
and
villages
,
and
the
Brighton
line
carried
others
into
rural
Sussex
.
<EOS>
London
overflowed
southward
and
westward
until
every
village
and
every
town
within
fifty
miles
was
so
full
that
beds
were
at
a
premium
,
and
in
various
places
,
notably
at
Chartham
,
near
Canterbury
,
at
Willesborough
,
near
Ashford
,
at
Lewes
,
at
Robertsbridge

at
Goodwood

huge

shelter
being
afforded

Every
house
,
every
barn
,
every
school
,
indeed
every
place
where
people
could
obtain
shelter
for
the
night
,
was
crowded
to
excess
,
mostly
by
women
and
children
sent
south
,
away
from
the
horrors
that
it
was
known
must
come
.
 
<EOS>
Central
London
grew
more
turbulent
with
each
hour
that
passed
.
<EOS>
There
were
all
sorts
of
wild
rumours
,
but
,
fortunately
,
the
Press
still
preserved
a
dignified
calm
.
<EOS>
The
Cabinet
were
holding
a
meeting
at
Bristol
,
whither
<EOS>
the
Houses
of
Commons
and
Lords
had
moved
,
and
all
depended
upon
its
issue
.
<EOS>
It
was
said
that
Ministers
were
divided
in
their
opinions
whether
we
should
sue
for
an
ignominious
peace
,
or
whether
the
conflict
should
be
continued
to
the
bitter
end
.
 
<EOS>
Disaster
had
followed
disaster
,
and
iron
-
throated
orators
in
Hyde
and
St.
James
's
Parks
were
now
shouting
"
Stop
the
war
!
<EOS>
Stop
the
war
!
"
<EOS>
The
cry
was
taken
up
but
faintly
,
however
,
for
the
blood
of
Londoners
,
slow
to
rise
,
had
now
been
stirred
by
seeing
their
country
slowly
yet
completely
crushed
by
Germany
.
<EOS>
All
the
patriotism
latent
within
them
was
now
displayed
.
<EOS>
The
national
flag
was
shown
everywhere
,
and
at
every
point
one
heard
"
God
save
the
King
"
sung
lustily
.
 
<EOS>
Two
gunmakers
'
shops
in
the
Strand
,
which
had
hitherto
escaped
notice
,
were
shortly
after
noon
broken
open
,
and
every
available
arm
and
all
the
ammunition
seized
.
<EOS>
One
man
,
unable
to
obtain
a
revolver
,
snatched
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
steel
handcuffs
,
and
cried
with
grim
humour
as
he
held
them
up
:
"
If
I
ca
n't
shoot
any
of
the
sausage

eaters
,
I
can

The
banks
,
the
great
jewellers
,
the
diamond
merchants
,
the
safe
-
deposit
offices
,
and
all
who
had
valuables
in
their
keeping
,
were
extremely
anxious
as
to
what
might
happen
.
<EOS>
Below
those
dark
buildings
in
Lothbury
and
Lombard
Street
,
behind
the
black
walls
of
the
Bank
of
England
,
and
below
every
branch
bank
all
over
London
,
were
millions
in
gold
and
notes
,
the
wealth
of
the
greatest
city
the
world
has
ever
known
.
<EOS>
The
strong
rooms
were
,
for
the
most
part
,
the
strongest
that
modern
engineering
could
devise
,
some
with
various
arrangements
by
which
all
access
was
debarred
by
an
inrush
of
water
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
dynamite
is
a
great
leveller
,
and
it
was
felt
that
not
a
single
strong
room
in
the
whole
of
London
could
withstand
an
organised
attack
by
German
engineers
.
 
<EOS>
A
single
charge
of
dynamite
would
certainly
make
a
breach
in
concrete
upon
which
a
thief
might
hammer
and
chip
day
and
night
for
a
month
without
making
much
impression

Steel
doors
must
give
to
blasting
force

while
the
strongest
and
most
complicated
locks
would
also
fly
to
pieces

<EOS>
The
directors
of
most
of
the
banks
had
met
and
an
endeavour
had
been
made
to
co
-
operate
and
form
a
corps
of
special
guards
for
the
principal
offices
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
a
small
armed
corps
was
formed
,
and
were
on
duty
day
and
night
in
Lothbury
,
Lombard
Street
,
and
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Yet
what
could
they
do
if
the
Germans
swept
into
London
?
<EOS>
There
was
but
little
to
fear
from
the
excited
populace
themselves
,
because
matters
had
assumed
such
a
crisis
that
money
was
of
little
use
,
as
there
was
practically
very
little
to
buy
.
<EOS>
But
little
food
was
reaching
London
from
the
open
ports
on
the
west
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
enemy
that
the
banks
feared
,
for
they
knew
that
the
Germans
intended
to
enter
and
sack
the
Metropolis
,
just
as
they
had
sacked
the
other
towns
that
had
refused
to
pay
the
indemnity
demanded
.
 
<EOS>
Small
jewellers
had
,
days
ago
,
removed
their
stock
from
their
windows
and
carried
it
away
in
unsuspicious
-
looking
bags
to
safe
hiding
in
the
southern
and
western
suburbs
,
where
people
for
the
most
part
hid
their
valuable
plate
,
jewellery
,
etc
.
,
beneath
a
floor
-
board
,
or
buried
them
in
some
marked

small

St.

St.

the

patriotic

were
working
day

in
an
endeavour
to
cope
with
the
ever

arriving
crowd
of
suffering
humanity
.
<EOS>
The
field
hospitals
away
to

<EOS>
were
also
reported
full

<EOS>
The
exact
whereabouts
of
the
enemy
was
not
known
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
it
seemed
,
everywhere
.
<EOS>
They
had
practically
over
-
run
the
whole
country
,
and
the
reports
from
the
Midlands
and
the
North
showed
that
the
majority
of
the
principal
towns
had
now
been
occupied
.
 
<EOS>
The
latest
reverses
outside
London
,
full
and
graphic
details
of
which
were
now
being
published
hourly
by
the
papers
,
had
created
an
immense
sensation
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
people
were
regretting
that
Lord
Roberts
'
solemn
warnings
in
1906
had
been
unheeded
,
for
had
we
adopted
his
scheme
for
universal
service
such
dire
catastrophe
could
never
have
occurred
.
<EOS>
Many
had
,
alas
!
<EOS>
declared
it
to
be
synonymous
with
conscription
,
which
it
certainly
was
not
,
and
by
that
foolish
argument
had
prevented
the
public
at
large
from
accepting
it
as
the
only
means
for
our
salvation
as
a
nation
.
<EOS>
The
repeated
warnings
had
been
disregarded
,
and
we
had
,
unhappily
,
lived
in
a
fool
's
paradise
,
in
the
self
-
satisfied
belief
that
England
could
not
be
successfully
invaded
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
country
had
realised
the
truth
when
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
That
memorable
day
,
September
20
,
witnessed
exasperated
struggles
in
the
northern
suburbs
of
London
,
passionate
and
bloody
collisions
,
an
infantry
fire
of
the
defenders
overwhelming
every
attempted
assault

a
decisive
action
of
the
artillery
,
with
regard
to
which
arm
the
superiority
of
the
Germans
,
due
to
their
perfect
training
,
was
apparent
.
 
<EOS>
A
last
desperate
stand
had
,
it
appears
,
been
made
by
the
defenders
on
the
high
ridge
north
-
west
of
New
Barnet
,
from
Southgate
to
near
Potter
's
Bar
,
where
a
terrible
fight
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
But
from
the
very
first
it
was
utterly
hopeless
.
<EOS>
The
British
had
fought
valiantly
in
defence
of
London
,
but
here
again
they
were
outnumbered
,
and
after
one
of
the
most
desperate
conflicts
in
the
whole
campaign
--
in
which
our
losses
were
terrible
--
the
Germans
at
length
had
succeeded
in
entering
Chipping
Barnet
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
difficult
movement
,
and
a
fierce
contest
,
rendered
the
more
terrible
by
the
burning
houses
,
ensued
in
the
streets
and
away
across
the
low
hills
southward
--
a
struggle
full
of
vicissitudes
and
alternating
successes
,
until
at
last
the
fire
of
the
defenders
was
silenced
,
and
hundreds
of
prisoners
fell
into
the
German
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
last
organised
defence
of
London
had
been
broken
,
and
the
barricades
alone
remained
.
 
<EOS>
The
work
of
the
German
troops
on
the
lines
of
communication
in
Essex
had
for
the
past
week
been
fraught
with
danger
.
<EOS>
Through
want
of
cavalry
the
British
had
been
unable
to
make
cavalry
raids
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
difficulty
was
enhanced
by
the
bands
of
sharpshooters
--
men
of
all
classes
from
London
who
possessed
a
gun
and
who
could
shoot
.
<EOS>
In
one
or
two
of
the
London
clubs
the
suggestion
had
first
been
mooted
a
couple
of
days
after
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
,
and
it
had
been
quickly
taken
up
by
men
who
were
in
the
habit
of
shooting
game
,
but
had
not
had
a
military
training
.
 
<EOS>
Within
three
days
about
two
thousand
men
had
formed
themselves
into
bands
to
take
part
in
the
struggle
and
assist
in
the
defence
of
London
.
<EOS>
They
were
practically
similar
to
the
Francs
-
tireurs
of
the
Franco
-
German
War
,
for
they
went
forth
in
companies
and
waged
a
guerilla
warfare
,
partly
before
the
front
and
at
the
flanks
of
the
different
armies
,
and
partly
at
the
communications
at
the
rear
of
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
Their
position
was
one
of
constant
peril
in
face
of
Von
Kronhelm
's
proclamation
,
yet
the
work
they
did
was
excellent
,
and
only
proved
that
if
Lord
Roberts
'
scheme
for
universal
training
had
been
adopted
the
enemy
would
never
have
reached
the
gates
of
London
with
success
.
 
<EOS>
These
brave
adventurous
spirits
,
together
with
"
The
Legion
of
Frontiersmen
,
"
made
their
attacks
by
surprise
from
hiding
-
places
or
from
ambushes
.
<EOS>
Their
adventures
were
constantly
thrilling
ones
.
<EOS>
Scattered
all
over
the
theatre
of
war
in
Essex
and
Suffolk
,
and
all
along
the
German
lines
of
communication
,
the
"
Frontiersmen
"
rarely
ventured
on
an
open
conflict
,
and
frequently
changed
scene
and
point
of
attack
.
<EOS>
Within
one
week
their
numbers
rose
to
over
8,000
,
and
,
being
well
served
by
the
villagers
,
who
acted
as
scouts
and
spies
for
them
,
the
Germans
found
them
very
difficult
to
get
at
.
<EOS>
Usually
they
kept
their
arms
concealed
in
thickets
and
woods
,
where
they
would
lie
in
wait
for
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
They
never
came
to
close
quarters
,
but
fired
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
Many
a
smart
Uhlan
fell
by
their
bullets
,
and
many
a
sentry
dropped
,
shot
by
an
unknown
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
they
harassed
the
enemy
everywhere
.
<EOS>
At
need
they
concealed
their
arms
and
assumed
the
appearance
of
inoffensive
non
-
combatants
.
<EOS>
But
when
caught
red
-
handed
the
Germans
gave
them
"
short
shrift
,
"
as
the
bodies
now
swinging
from
telegraph
poles
on
various
high
-
roads
in
Essex
testified
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
attempt
to
put
a
stop
to
the
daring
actions
of
the
"
Frontiersmen
,
"
the
German
authorities
and
troops
along
the
lines
of
communication
punished
the
parishes
where
German
soldiers
were
shot
,
or
where
the
destruction
of
railways
and
telegraphs
had
occurred
,
by
levying
money
contributions
,
or
by
burning
the
villages
.
 
<EOS>
The
guerilla
war
was
especially
fierce
along
from
Edgware
up
to
Hertford
,
and
from
Chelmsford
down
to
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
once
commenced
,
it
never
ceased
.
<EOS>
Attacks
were
always
being
made
upon
small
patrols
,
travelling
detachments
,
mails
of
the
field
post
-
office
,
posts
or
patrols
at
stations
on
the
lines
of
communication
,
while
field
-
telegraphs
,
telephones
,
and
railways
were
everywhere
destroyed
.
 
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
the
railway
being
cut
at
Pitsea
,
the
villages
of
Pitsea
,
Bowers
Gifford
,
and
Vange
had
been
burned
.
<EOS>
Because
a
German
patrol
had
been
attacked
and
destroyed
near
Orsett
,
the
parish
was
compelled
to
pay
a
heavy
indemnity
.
<EOS>
Upminster
,
near
Romford
,
Theydon
Bois
,
and
Fyfield
,
near
High
Ongar
,
had
all
been
burned
by
the
Germans
for
the
same
reason
;
while
at
the
Cherrytree
Inn
,
near
Rainham
,
five
"
Frontiersmen
"
being
discovered
by
Uhlans
in
a
hayloft
asleep
,
were
locked
in
and
there
burned
alive
.
<EOS>
Dozens
were
,
of
course
,
shot
at
sight
,
and
dozens
more
hanged
without
trial
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
to
be
deterred
.
<EOS>
They
were
fighting
in
defence
of
London
,
and
around
the
northern
suburbs
the
patriotic
members
of
the
"
Legion
"
were
specially
active
,
though
they
never
showed
themselves
in
large
bands
.
 
<EOS>
Within
London
every
man
who
could
shoot
game
was
now
anxious
to
join
in
the
fray
,
and
on
the
day
that
the
news
of
the
last
disaster
reached
the
Metropolis
,
hundreds
left
for
the
open
country
out
beyond
Hendon
.
 
<EOS>
The
enemy
having
broken
down
the
defence
at
Enfield
and
cleared
the
defenders
out
of
the
fortified
houses
,
had
advanced
and
occupied
the
northern
ridges
of
London
in
a
line
stretching
roughly
from
Pole
Hill
,
a
little
to
the
north
of
Chingford
,
across
Upper
Edmonton
,
through
Tottenham
,
Hornsey
,
Highgate
,
Hampstead
,
and
Willesden
,
to
Twyford
Abbey
.
<EOS>
All
the
positions
had
been
well
reconnoitred
,
for
at
grey
of
dawn
<EOS>
the
rumbling
of
artillery
had
been
heard
in
the
streets
of
those
places
already
mentioned
,
and
soon
after
sunrise
strong
batteries
were
established
upon
all
the
available
points
commanding
London
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
at
Chingford
Green
,
on
the
left
-
hand
side
of
the
road
opposite
the
inn
at
Chingford
;
on
Devonshire
Hill
,
Tottenham
;
on
the
hill
at
Wood
Green
;
in
the
grounds
of
the
Alexandra
Palace
;
on
the
high
ground
about
Churchyard
Bottom
Wood
;
on
the
edge
of
Bishop

Wood
,
Highgate
;
on
Parliament
Hill
,
at
a
spot
close
to
the
Oaks
on
the
Hendon
road
;
at
Dollis
Hill
,
and
at
a
point
a
little
north
of
Wormwood
Scrubs
,
and
at
Neasden
,
near
the
railway
works
.
 
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
chief
object
was
to
establish
their
artillery
as
near
London
as
possible
,
for
it
was
known
that
the
range
of
their
guns
even
from
Hampstead
--
the
highest
point
,
441
feet
above
London
--
would
not
reach
into
the
actual
city
itself
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
at

,
the
German
cavalry

,
with
three
quick

bearing
the

--
advanced
up
the
various
roads
leading
into

from

being
met
,
of

,
with
a
desperate
resistance
at

THE
BOMBARDMENT
and
DEFENCES
of
LONDON
on
Sept.
20^{th

]
 
<EOS>
On
Haverstock
Hill
,
the
three
Maxims
,
mounted
upon
the
huge
construction
across
the
road
,
played
havoc
with
the
Germans
,
who
were
at
once
compelled
to
fall
back
,
leaving
piles
of
dead
and
dying
in
the
roadway
,
for
the
terrible
hail
of
lead
poured
out
upon
the
invaders
could
not
be
withstood
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
German
armoured
motor
-
cars
were
presently
brought
into
action
by
the
Germans
,
who
replied
with
a
rapid
fire
,
this
being
continued
for
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
without
result
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
Then
the
Germans
,
finding
the
defence
too
strong
,
again
retired
into
Hampstead
,
amid
the
ringing
cheers
of
the
valiant
men
holding
that
gate
of
London
.
<EOS>
The
losses
of
the
enemy
had
been
serious
,
for
the
whole
roadway
was
now
strewn
with
dead
;
while
behind
the
huge
wall
of
paving
-
stones
,
overturned
carts
,
and
furniture
,
only
two
men
had
been
killed
and
one
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
Across
in
the
Finchley
Road
a
struggle
<EOS>
equally
as
fierce
was
in
progress
;
but
a
detachment
of
the
enemy
,
evidently
led
by
some
German
who
had
knowledge
of
the
intricate
side
-
roads
,
suddenly
appeared
in
the
rear
of
the
barricade
,
and
a
fierce
and
bloody
hand
-
to
-
hand
conflict
ensued
.
<EOS>
The
defenders
,
however
,
stood
their
ground
,
and
with
the
aid
of
some
petrol
bombs
which
they
held
in
readiness
,
they
destroyed
the
venturesome
detachment
almost
to
a
man
,
though
a
number
of
houses
in
the
vicinity
were
set
on
fire
,
causing
a
huge
conflagration
.
 
<EOS>
In
Highgate
Road
the
attack
was
a
desperate
one
,
the
enraged
Londoners
fighting
valiantly
,
the
men
with
arms
being
assisted
by
the
populace
themselves
.
<EOS>
Here
again
deadly
petrol
bombs
had
been
distributed
,
and
men
and
women
hurled
them
against
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
Petrol
was
actually
poured
from
windows
upon
the
heads
of
the
enemy
,
and
tow
soaked
in
paraffin
and
lit
flung
in
among
them
,
when
in
an
instant
whole
areas
of
the
streets
were
ablaze
,
and
the
soldiers
of
the
Fatherland
perished
in
the
roaring
flames
.
 
<EOS>
Every
device
to
drive
back
the
invader
was
tried
.
<EOS>
Though
thousands
upon
thousands
had
left
the
northern
suburbs
,
many
thousands
still
remained
bent
on
defending
their
homes
as
long
as
they
had
breath
.
<EOS>
The
crackle
of
rifles
was
incessant
,
and
ever
and
anon
the
dull
roar
of
a
heavy
field
gun
and
the
sharp
rattle
of
a
Maxim
mingled
with
the
cheers
,
yells
,
and
shrieks
of
victors
and
vanquished
.
 
<EOS>
The
scene
on
every
side
was
awful
.
<EOS>
Men
were
fighting
for
their
lives
in
desperation
.
 
<EOS>
Around
the
barricade
in
Holloway
Road
the
street
ran
with
blood
;
while
in
Kingsland
,
in
Clapton
,
in
West
Ham
,
and
Canning
Town
the
enemy
were
making
an
equally
desperate
attack
,
and
were
being
repulsed
everywhere
.
<EOS>
London
's
enraged
millions
,
the
Germans
were
well
aware
,
constituted
a
grave
danger
.
<EOS>
Any
detachments
who
carried
a
barricade
by
assault
--
as
,
for
instance
,
they
did
one
in
the
Hornsey
Road
near
the
station
--
were
quickly
set
upon
by
the
angry
mob
and
simply
wiped
out
of
existence
.
 
<EOS>
Until
nearly
noon
desperate
conflicts
at
the
barricades
continued
.
<EOS>
The
defence
was
even
more
effectual
than
was
expected
;
yet
,
had
it
not
been
that
Von
Kronhelm
,
the
German
generalissimo
,
had
given
orders
that
the
troops
were
not
to
attempt
to
advance
into
London
before
the
populace
were
cowed
,
there
was
no
doubt
that
each
barricade
could
have
been
taken
in
the
rear
by
companies
avoiding
the
main
roads
and
proceeding
by
the
side
streets
.
 
<EOS>
Just
before
noon
,
however
,
it
was
apparent
to
Von
Kronhelm
that
to
storm
the
barricades
would
entail
enormous
losses
,
so
strong
were
they
.
<EOS>
The
men
holding
them
had
now
been
reinforced
in
many
cases
by
regular
troops
,
who
had
come
in
in
flight
,
and
a
good
many
guns
were
now
manned
by
artillerymen
.
 
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
had
established
his
headquarters
at
Jack
Straw
's
Castle
,
from
which
he
could
survey
the
giant
city
through
his
field
-
glasses
.
<EOS>
Below
lay
the
great
plain
of
roofs
,
spires
,
and
domes
,
stretching
away
into
the
grey
mystic
distance
,
where
afar
rose
the
twin
towers
and
double
arches
of
the
Crystal
Palace
roof
.
 
<EOS>
London
--
the
great
London
--
the
capital
of
the
world
--
lay
at
his
mercy
at
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
The
tall
,
thin
-
faced
General
,
with
the
grizzled
moustache
and
the
glittering
cross
at
his
throat
,
standing
apart
from
his
staff
,
gazed
away
in
silence
and
in
thought
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
first
sight
of
London
,
and
its
gigantic
proportions
amazed
even
him
.
<EOS>
Again
he
swept
the
horizon
with
his
glass
,
and
knit
his
grey
brows
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
the
parting
words
of
his
Emperor
as
he
backed
out
of
that
plainly
-
furnished
little
private
cabinet
at
Potsdam--
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
bombard
London
and
sack
it
.
<EOS>
The
pride
of
those
English
must
be
broken
at
all
costs
.
<EOS>
Go
,
Kronhelm
--
go
--
and
may
the
best
of
fortune
go
with
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
sun
was
at
the
noon
causing
the
glass
roof
of
the
distant
Crystal
Palace
to
gleam
.
<EOS>
Far
down
in
the
grey
haze
stood
Big
Ben
,
the
Campanile
,
and
a
thousand
church
spires
,
all
tiny
and
,
from
that
distance
,
insignificant
.
<EOS>
From
where
he
stood
the
sound
of
crackling
fire
at
the
barricades
reached
him
,
and
a
little
behind
him
a
member
of
his
staff
was
kneeling
on
the
grass
with
his
ear
bent
to
the
field
telephone
.
<EOS>
Reports
were
coming
in
fast
of
the
desperate
resistance
in
the
streets
,
and
these
were
duly
handed
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
them
,
gave
a
final
look
at
the
outstretched
city
that
was
the
metropolis
of
the
world
,
and
then
gave
rapid
orders
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
troops
from
the
assault
of
the
barricades
,
and
the
bombardment
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
moment
the
field
-
telegraphs
were
clicking
,
the
telephone
bell
was
ringing
,
orders
were
shouted
in
German
in
all
directions
,
and
next
second
,
with
a
deafening
roar
,
one
of
the
howitzers
of
the
battery
in
the
close
vicinity
to
him
gave
tongue
and
threw
its
deadly
shell
somewhere
into
St.
John
's
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
The
rain
of
death
had
opened
!
<EOS>
London
was
surrounded
by
a
semi
-
circle
of
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
gun
was
followed
by
a
hundred
others
as
,
at
all
the
batteries
along
the
northern
heights
,
the
orders
were
received
.
<EOS>
Then
in
a
few
minutes
,
from
the
whole
line
from
Chingford
to
Willesden
,
roughly
about
twelve
miles
,
came
a
hail
of
the
most
deadly
of
modern
projectiles
directed
upon
the
most
populous
parts
of
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
Germans
trained
their
guns
to
carry
as
far
as
was
possible
,
the
zone
of
fire
did
not
at
first
it
seemed
extend
farther
south
than
a
line
roughly
taken
from
Notting
Hill
through
Bayswater
,
past
Paddington
Station
,
along
the
Marylebone
and
Euston
Roads
,
then
up
to
Highbury
,
Stoke
Newington
,
Stamford
Hill
and
Walthamstow
.
 
<EOS>
When
,
however
,
the
great
shells
began
to
burst
in
Holloway
,
Kentish
Town
,
Camden
Town
,
Kilburn
,
Kensal
Green
,
and
other
places
lying
within
the
area
under
fire
,
a
frightful
panic
ensued
.
<EOS>
Whole
streets
were
shattered
by
explosions
,
and
fires
were
breaking
out
,
the
dark
clouds
of
smoke
obscuring
the
sunlit
sky
.
<EOS>
Roaring
flame
shot
up
everywhere
,
unfortunate
men
,
women
,
and
children
were
being
blown
to
atoms
by
the
awful
projectiles
,
while
others
distracted
,
sought
shelter
in
any
cellar
or
underground
place
they
could
find
,
while
their
houses
fell
about
them
like
packs
of
cards
.
 
<EOS>
The
scenes
within
that
zone
of
terror
were
indescribable
.
 
<EOS>
When
Paris
had
been
bombarded
years
ago
,
artillery
was
not
at
the
perfection
it
now
was
,
and
there
had
been
no
such
high
explosive
known
as
in
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
The
great
shells
that
were
falling
everywhere
,
on
bursting
filled
the
air
with
poisonous
fumes
,
as
well
as
with
deadly
fragments
.
<EOS>
One
bursting
in
a
street
would
wreck
the
rows
of
houses
on
either
side
,
and
tear
a
great
hole
in
the
ground
at
the
same
moment
.
<EOS>
The
fronts
of
the
houses
were
torn
out
like
paper
,
the
iron
railings
twisted
as
though
they
were
wire
,
and
paving
-
stones
hurled
into
the
air
like
straws
.
 
<EOS>
Anything
and
everything
offering
a
mark
to
the
enemy
's
guns
was
shattered
.
<EOS>
St.
John
's
Wood
and
the
houses
about
Regent
's
Park
suffered
seriously
.
<EOS>
A
shell
from
Hampstead
,
falling
into
the
roof
of
one
of
the
houses
near
the
centre
of
Sussex
Place
,
burst
and
shattered
nearly
all
the
houses
in
the
row
;
while
another
fell
in
Cumberland
Terrace
and
wrecked
a
dozen
houses
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
In
both
cases
the
houses
were
mostly
empty
,
for
owners
and
servants
had
fled
southward
across
the
river
as
soon
as
it
became
apparent
that
the
Germans
actually
intended
to
bombard
.
 
<EOS>
At
many
parts
in
Maida
Vale
shells
burst
with
appalling
effect
.
<EOS>
Several
of
the
houses
in
Elgin
Avenue
had
their
fronts
torn
out
,
and
in
one
,
a
block
of
flats
,
there
was
considerable
loss
of
life
in
the
fire
that
broke
out
,
escape
being
cut
off
owing
to
the
stairs
having
been
demolished
by
the
explosion
.
<EOS>
Abbey
Road
,
St.
John
's
Wood
Road
,
Acacia
Road
,
and
Wellington
Road
,
were
quickly
wrecked
.
 
<EOS>
In
Chalk
Farm
Road
,
near
the
Adelaide
,
a
terrified
woman
was
dashing
across
the
street
to
seek
shelter
with
a
neighbour
,
when
a
shell
burst
right
in
front
of
her
,
blowing
her
to
fragments
;
while
in
the
early
stage
of
the
bombardment
a
shell
bursting
in
the
Midland
Hotel
at
St.
Pancras
caused
a
fire
which
in
half
an
hour
resulted
in
the
whole
hotel
and
railway
terminus
being
a
veritable
furnace
of
flame
.
<EOS>
Through
the
roof
of
King
's
Cross
Station
several
shells
fell
,
and
burst
close
to
the
departure
platform
.
<EOS>
The
whole
glass
roof
was
shattered
,
but
beyond
that
little
other
material
damage
resulted
.
 
<EOS>
Shots
were
now
falling
everywhere
,
and
Londoners
were
staggered
.
<EOS>
In
dense
,
excited
crowds
they
were
flying
southwards
towards
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
Some
were
caught
in
the
streets
in
their
flight
,
and
were
flung
down
,
maimed
and
dying
.
<EOS>
The
most
awful
sights
were
to
be
witnessed
in
the
open
streets
;
men
and
women
blown
out
of
recognition
,
with
their
clothes
singed
and
torn
to
shreds
,
and
helpless
,
innocent
children
lying
white
and
dead
,
their
limbs
torn
away
and
missing
.
 
<EOS>
Euston
Station
had
shared
the
same
fate
as
St.
Pancras
,
and
was
blazing
furiously
,
sending
up
a
great
column
of
black
smoke
that
could
be
seen
by
all
London
.
<EOS>
So
many
were
the
conflagrations
now
breaking
out
that
it
seemed
as
though
the
enemy
were
sending
into
London
shells
filled
with
petrol
,
in
order
to
set
the
streets
aflame
.
<EOS>
This
,
indeed
,
was
proved
by
an
eye
-
witness
,
who
saw
a
shell
fall
in
Liverpool
Road
,
close
to
the
Angel
.
<EOS>
It
burst
with
a
bright
red
flash
,
and
next
second
the
whole
of
the
roadway
and
neighbouring
houses
were
blazing
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
air
became
black
with
smoke
and
dust
,
and
the
light
of
day
obscured
in
Northern
London
.
<EOS>
And
through
that
obscurity
came
those
whizzing
shells
in
an
incessant
hissing
stream
,
each
one
,
bursting
in
these
narrow
,
thickly
populated
streets
,
causing
havoc
indescribable
,
and
a
loss
of
life
impossible
to
accurately
calculate
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
people
were
blown
to
pieces
in
the
open
but
hundreds
more
were
buried
beneath
the
_
debris
_
of
their
own
cherished
homes
,
now
being
so
ruthlessly
destroyed
and
demolished
.
 
<EOS>
On
every
side
was
heard
the
cry
:
"
Stop
the
war
--
stop
the
war
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
,
alas
!
<EOS>
too
late
--
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
Never
in
the
history
of
the
civilised
world
were
there
such
scenes
of
reckless
slaughter
of
the
innocent
and
peace
-
loving
as
on
that
never
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
day
when
Von
Kronhelm
carried
out
the
orders
of
his
Imperial
master
,
and
struck
terror
into
the
heart
of
London
's
millions

CHAPTER
V.
 
<EOS>
THE
RAIN
OF
DEATH
.
  
<EOS>
Through
the
whole
afternoon
the
heavy
German
artillery
roared
,
belching
forth
their
fiery
vengeance
upon
London
.
 
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
they
pounded
away
,
until
St.
Pancras
Church
was
a
heap
of
ruins
and
the
Foundling
Hospital
<EOS>
a
veritable
furnace
,
as
well
as
the
Parcel
Post
Offices
and
the
University
College
in
Gower
Street
.
<EOS>
In
Hampstead
Road
many
of
the
shops
were
shattered
,
and
in
Tottenham
Court
Road
both
Maple
's
and
Shoolbred
's
suffered
severely
,
for
shells
bursting
in
the
centre
of
the
roadway
had
smashed
every
pane
of
glass
in
the
fronts
of
both
buildings
.
 
<EOS>
The
quiet
squares
of
Bloomsbury
were
in
some
cases
<EOS>
great
yawning
ruins
--
<EOS>
houses
with
their
fronts
torn
out
revealing
the
shattered
furniture
within
.
<EOS>
Streets
were
indeed
,
filled
with
tiles
,
chimney
pots
,
fallen
telegraph
wires
,
and
_
debris
_
of
furniture
,
stone
steps
,
paving
stones
,
and
fallen
masonry
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
thoroughfares
,
such
as
the
Pentonville
Road
,
Copenhagen
Street
,
and
Holloway
Road
,
were
,
at
points
,
quite
impassable
on
account
of
the
ruins
that
blocked
them
.
<EOS>
Into
the
Northern
Hospital
,
in
the
Holloway
Road
,
a
shell
fell
,
shattering
one
of
the
wards
,
and
killing
or
maiming
every
one
of
the
patients
in
the
ward
in
question
,
while
the
church
in
Tufnell
Park
Road
was
burning
fiercely
.
<EOS>
Upper
Holloway
,
Stoke
Newington
,
Highbury
,
Kingsland
,
Dalston
,
Hackney
,
Clapton
,
and
Stamford
Hill
were
being
swept
at
long
range
by
the
guns
on
Muswell
Hill
and
Churchyard
Bottom
Hill
,
and
the
terror
caused
in
those
densely
populated
districts
was
awful
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
upon
hundreds
lost
their
lives
,
or
else
had
a
hand
,
an
arm
,
a
leg
blown
away
,
as
those
fatal
shells
fell
in
never
-
ceasing
monotony
,
especially
in
Stoke
Newington
and
Kingsland
.
<EOS>
The
many
side
roads
lying
between
Holloway
Road
and
Finsbury
Park
,
such
as
Hornsey
Road
,
Tollington
Park
,
Andover
,
Durham
,
Palmerston
,
Campbell
,
and
Forthill
Roads
,
Seven
Sisters
Road
,
and
Isledon
Road
were
all
devastated
,
for
the
guns
for
a
full
hour
<EOS>
seemed
to
be
trained
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
German
gunners
in
all
probability
neither
knew
nor
cared
where
their
shells
fell
.
<EOS>
From
their
position
,
now
that
the
smoke
of
the
hundreds
of
fires
was
now
rising
,
they
could
probably
discern
but
little
.
<EOS>
Therefore
the
batteries
at
Hampstead
Heath
,
Muswell
Hill
,
Wood
Green
,
Cricklewood
,
and
other
places
simply
sent
their
shells
as
far
distant
south
as
possible
into
the
panic
-
stricken
city
below
.
<EOS>
In
Mountgrove
and
Riversdale
Roads
,
Highbury
Vale
,
a
number
of
people
were
killed
,
while
a
frightful
disaster
occurred
in
the
church
at
the
corner
of
Park
Lane
and
Milton
Road
,
Stoke
Newington
.
<EOS>
Here
a
number
of
people
had
entered
,
attending
a
special
service
for
the
success
of
the
British
arms
,
when
a
shell
exploded
on
the
roof
,
bringing
it
down
upon
them
and
killing
over
fifty
of
the
congregation
,
mostly
women
.
 
<EOS>
The
air
,
poisoned
by
the
fumes
of
the
deadly
explosives
and
full
of
smoke
from
the
burning
buildings
,
was
ever
and
anon
rent
by
explosions
as
projectiles
frequently
burst
in
mid
-
air
.
<EOS>
The
distant
roar
was
incessant
,
like
the
noise
of
thunder
,
while
on
every
hand
could
be
heard
the
shrieks
of
defenceless
women
and
children
,
or
the
muttered
curses
of
some
man
who
saw
his
home
and
all
he
possessed
swept
away
with
a
flash
and
a
cloud
of
dust
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
withstand
that
awful
cannonade
.
<EOS>
Walthamstow
had
been
rendered
untenable
in
the
first
half
-
hour
of
the
bombardment
,
while
in
Tottenham
the
loss
of
life
had
been
very
enormous
,
the
German
gunners
at
Wood
Green
having
apparently
turned
their
first
attention
upon
that
place
.
<EOS>
Churches
,
the
larger
buildings
,
the
railway
station
,
in
fact
,
anything
offering
a
mark
,
was
promptly
shattered
,
being
assisted
by
the
converging
fire
from
the
batteries
at
Chingford
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
of
London
,
Notting
Hill
,
Shepherd
's
Bush
,
and
Starch
Green
,
were
being
reduced
to
ruins
by
the
heavy
batteries
above
Park
Royal
Station
,
which
,
firing
across
Wormwood
Scrubs
,
put
their
shots
into
Notting
Hill
,
and
especially
into
Holland
Park
,
where
widespread
damage
was
quickly
wrought
.
 
<EOS>
A
couple
of
shells
falling
into
the
generating
station
of
the
Central
London
Railway
,
or
"
Tube
,
"
as
Londoners
usually
call
it
,
unfortunately
caused
a
disaster
and
loss
of
life
which
were
appalling
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
sign
of
the
bombardment
many
thousands
of
people
descended
into
the
"
Tube
"
as
a
safe
hiding
-
place
from
the
rain
of
shell
.
<EOS>
At
first
the
railway
officials
closed
the
doors
to
prevent
the
inrush
,
but
the
terrified
populace
in
Shepherd
's
Bush
,
Bayswater
,
Oxford
Street
,
and
Holborn
,
in
fact
,
all
along
the
subterranean
line
,
broke
open
the
doors
and
descending
by
the
lifts
and
stairs
found
themselves
in
a
place
which
at
least
gave
them
security
against
the
enemy
's
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
trains
had
long
ago
ceased
running
,
and
every
station
was
crowded
to
excess
,
while
many
were
forced
upon
the
line
itself
,
and
actually
into
the
tunnels
.
<EOS>
For
hours
they
waited
there
in
eager
breathlessness
,
longing
to
be
able
to
ascend
and
find
the
conflict
over
.
<EOS>
Men
and
women
in
all
stations
of
life
were
huddled
together
,
while
children
clung
to
their
parents
in
wonder
;
yet
as
hour
after
hour
went
by
,
the
report
from
above
was
still
the
same
--
the
Germans
had
not
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
Of
a
sudden
,
however
,
the
light
failed
.
<EOS>
The
electric
current
had
been
cut
off
by
the
explosion
of
the
shells
in
the
generating
station
at
Shepherd
's
Bush
,
and
the
lifts
were
useless
!
<EOS>
The
thousands
who
,
in
defiance
of
the
orders
of
the
company
,
had
gone
below
at
Shepherd
's
Bush
for
shelter
,
found
themselves
caught
like
rats
in
a
hole
.
<EOS>
True
,
there
was
the
faint
glimmer
of
an
oil
light
here
and
there
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
that
did
not
prevent
an
awful
panic
.
 
<EOS>
Somebody
shouted
that
the
Germans
were
above
and
had
put
out
the
lights
,
and
when
it
was
found
that
the
lifts
were
useless
a
panic
ensued
that
was
indescribable
.
<EOS>
The
people
could
not
ascend
the
stairs
,
as
they
were
blocked
by
the
dense
crowd
,
therefore
they
pressed
into
the
narrow
semi
-
circular
tunnels
in
an
eager
endeavour
to
reach
the
next
station
,
where
they
hoped
they
might
escape
;
but
once
in
there
women
and
children
were
quickly
crushed
to
death
,
or
thrown
down
and
trampled
upon
by
the
press
behind
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
darkness
they
fought
with
each
other
,
pressing
on
and
becoming
jammed
so
tightly
that
many
were
held
against
the
sloping
walls
until
life
was
extinct
.
<EOS>
Between
Shepherd
's
Bush
and
Holland
Park
Stations
the
loss
of
life
was
worst
,
for
being
within
the
zone
of
the
German
fire
the
people
had
crushed
in
frantically
in
thousands
,
and
with
one
accord
a
move
had
unfortunately
been
made
into
the
tunnels
,
on
account
of
the
foolish
cry
that
the
German
were
waiting
above
.
 
<EOS>
The
railway
officials
were
powerless
.
<EOS>
They
had
done
their
best
to
prevent
any
one
going
below
,
but
the
public
had
insisted
,
therefore
no
blame
could
be
laid
upon
them
for
the
catastrophe
.
 
<EOS>
At
Marble
Arch
,
Oxford
Circus
,
and
Tottenham
Court
Road
Stations
,
a
similar
scene
was
enacted
,
and
dozens
upon
dozens
,
alas
!
<EOS>
lost
their
lives
in
the
panic
.
<EOS>
Ladies
and
gentlemen
from
Park
Lane
,
Grosvenor
Square
,
and
Mayfair
had
sought
shelter
at
the
Marble
Arch
Station
,
rubbing
shoulders
with
labourers
'
wives
and
costerwomen
from
the
back
streets
of
Marylebone
.
<EOS>
When
the
lights
failed
,
a
rush
had
been
made
into
the
tunnel
to
reach
Oxford
Circus
,
all
exit
by
the
stairs
being
blocked
,
as
at
Shepherd
's
Bush
,
on
account
of
the
hundreds
struggling
to
get
down
.
 
<EOS>
As
at
Holland
Park
,
the
terrified
crowd
fighting
with
each
other
became
jammed
and
suffocated
in
the
narrow
space
.
<EOS>
The
catastrophe
was
a
frightful
one
,
for
it
was
afterwards
proved
that
over
four
hundred
and
twenty
persons
,
mostly
weak
women
and
children
,
lost
their
lives
in
those
twenty
minutes
of
darkness
before
the
mains
at
the
generating
station
,
wrecked
by
the
explosions
,
could
be
repaired
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
when
the
current
came
up
again
,
the
lights
revealed
the
frightful
mishap
,
and
people
struggled
to
emerge
from
the
burrows
wherein
they
had
so
narrowly
escaped
death
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
Baker
Street
and
Waterloo
and
other
"
Tubes
,
"
every
station
had
also
been
besieged
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
first
-
mentioned
line
from
north
to
south
was
the
refuge
of
thousands
,
who
saw
in
it
a
safe
place
for
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
tunnels
of
the
District
Railway
,
too
,
were
filled
with
terror
-
stricken
multitudes
,
who
descended
at
every
station
and
walked
away
into
a
subterranean
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
No
trains
had
been
running
for
several
days
,
therefore
there
was
no
danger
from
that
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
bombardment
continued
with
unceasing
activity
.
 
<EOS>
The
Marylebone
Station
of
the
Great
Central
Railway
,
and
the
Great
Central
Hotel
,
which
seemed
to
be
only
just
within
the
line
of
fire
,
were
wrecked
,
and
about
four
o'clock
<EOS>
it
was
seen
that
the
hotel
,
like
that
at
St.
Pancras
,
was
well
alight
,
though
no
effort
could
be
made
to
save
it
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
two
or
three
alarms
of
fire
the
Metropolitan
Fire
Brigade
had
turned
out
,
but
now
that
fresh
alarms
were
reaching
the
chief
station
every
moment
,
the
brigade
saw
themselves
utterly
powerless
to
even
attempt
to
save
the
hundred
buildings
,
great
and
small
,
now
furiously
blazing
.
 
<EOS>
Gasometers
,
especially
those
of
the
Gas
Light
and
Coke
Company
at
Kensal
Green
,
were
marked
by
the
German
gunners
,
who
sent
them
into
the
air
;
while
a
well
-
directed
petrol
bomb
at
Wormwood
Scrubs
Prison
set
one
great
wing
of
the
place
alight
,
and
the
prisoners
were
therefore
released
.
<EOS>
The
rear
of
Kensington
Palace
,
and
the
fronts
of
a
number
of
houses
in
Kensington
Palace
Gardens
were
badly
damaged
,
while
in
the
dome
of
the
Albert
Hall
was
a
great
,
ugly
hole
.
 
<EOS>
Shortly
after
five
o'clock
occurred
a
disaster
which
was
of
national
consequence
.
<EOS>
It
could
only
have
been
a
mishap
on
the
part
of
the
Germans
,
for
they
would
certainly
never
have
done
such
irreparable
damage
willingly
,
as
they
destroyed
what
would
otherwise
have
been
most
valuable
of
loot
.
 
<EOS>
Shots
suddenly
began
to
fall
fast
in
Bloomsbury
,
several
of
them
badly
damaging
the
Hotel
Russell
and
the
houses
near
,
and
it
was
therefore
apparent
that
one
of
the
batteries
which
had
been
firing
from
near
Jack
Straw
's
Castle
had
been
moved
across
to
Parliament
Hill
,
or
even
to
some
point
south
of
it
,
which
gave
a
wider
range
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
a
shell
came
high
through
the
air
and
fell
full
upon
the
British
Museum
,
striking
it
nearly
in
the
centre
of
the
front
,
and
in
exploding
carried
away
the
Grecian
-
Ionic
ornament
,
and
shattered
a
number
of
the
fine
stone
columns
of
the
dark
facade
.
<EOS>
Ere
people
in
the
vicinity
had
realised
that
the
national
collection
of
antiques
was
within
range
of
the
enemy
's
destructive
projectiles
,
a
second
shell
crashed
into
the
rear
of
the
building
,
making
a
great
gap
in
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
though
all
the
guns
of
that
particular
battery
had
converged
in
order
to
destroy
our
treasure
-
house
of
art
and
antiquity
,
shell
after
shell
crashed
into
the
place
in
rapid
succession
.
<EOS>
Before
ten
minutes
had
passed
,
grey
smoke
began
to
roll
out
from
beneath
the
long
colonnade
in
front
,
and
growing
denser
,
told
its
own
tale
.
<EOS>
The
British
Museum
was
on
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
that
all
.
<EOS>
As
though
to
complete
the
disaster
--
although
it
was
certain
that
the
Germans
were
in
ignorance
--
there
came
one
of
those
terrible
shells
filled
with
petrol
,
which
,
bursting
inside
the
manuscript
room
,
set
the
whole
place
ablaze
.
<EOS>
In
a
dozen
different
places
the
building
seemed
to
be
now
alight
,
especially
the
library
,
and
thus
the
finest
collection
of
books
,
manuscripts
,
Greek
and
Roman
and
Egyptian
antiques
,
coins
,
medals
,
and
prehistoric
relics
,
lay
at
the
mercy
of
the
flames
.
 
<EOS>
The
fire
brigade
was
at
once
alarmed
,
and
at
imminent
risk
of
their
lives
,
for
shells
were
still
falling
in
the
vicinity
,
<EOS>
they
,
with
the
Salvage
Corps
and
the
assistance
of
many
willing
helpers
--
some
of
whom
,
unfortunately
,
lost
their
lives
in
the
flames
--
saved
whatever
could
be
saved
,
throwing
the
objects
out
into
the
railed
-
off
quadrangle
in
front
.
 
<EOS>
The
left
wing
of
the
Museum
,
however
,
could
not
be
entered
,
although
,
after
most
valiant
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
firemen
,
the
conflagrations
that
had
broken
out
in
other
parts
of
the
building
were
at
length
subdued
.
<EOS>
The
damage
was
,
however
,
irreparable
,
for
many
unique
collections
,
including
all
the
prints
and
drawings
,
and
many
of
the
mediaeval
and
historic
manuscripts
had
already
been
consumed
.
 
<EOS>
Shots
now
began
to
fall
as
far
south
as
Oxford
Street
,
and
all
along
that
thoroughfare
from
Holborn
as
far
as
Oxford
Circus
,
widespread
havoc
was
being
wrought
.
<EOS>
People
fled
for
their
lives
back
towards
Charing
Cross
and
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
The
Oxford
Music
Hall
was
a
hopeless
ruin
,
while
a
shell
crashing
through
the
roof
of
Frascati
's
restaurant
carried
away
a
portion
of
the
gallery
and
utterly
wrecked
the
whole
place
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
shops
in
Oxford
Street
had
their
roofs
damaged
or
their
fronts
blown
out
,
while
a
huge
block
of
flats
in
Great
Russell
Street
was
practically
demolished
by
three
shells
striking
in
rapid
succession
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
to
the
alarm
of
all
who
realised
it
,
shots
were
seen
to
be
passing
high
over
Bloomsbury
,
south
towards
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
The
range
had
been
increased
,
for
,
as
was
afterwards
known
,
some
heavier
guns
had
now
been
mounted
upon
Muswell
Hill
and
Hampstead
Heath
,
which
,
carrying
to
a
distance
of
from
six
to
seven
miles
,
placed
the
City
,
the
Strand
,
and
Westminster
within
the
zone
of
fire
.
<EOS>
The
zone
in
question
stretched
roughly
from
Victoria
Park
through
Bethnal
Green
and
Whitechapel
,
across
to
Southwark
,
the
Borough
,
Lambeth
,
and
Westminster
to
Kensington
,
and
while
the
fire
upon
the
northern
suburbs
slackened
,
great
shells
now
came
flying
through
the
air
into
the
very
heart
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
German
gunners
at
Muswell
Hill
took
the
dome
of
St.
Paul
's
as
a
mark
,
for
shells
fell
constantly
in
Ludgate
Hill
,
in
Cheapside
,
in
Newgate
Street
,
and
in
the
Churchyard
itself
.
<EOS>
One
falling
upon
the
steps
of
the
Cathedral
tore
out
two
of
the
columns
of
the
front
,
while
another
,
striking
the
clock
tower
just
below
the
face
,
brought
down
much
of
the
masonry
and
one
of
the
huge
bells
,
with
a
deafening
crash
,
blocking
the
road
with
_
debris
_
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
the
great
shells
went
over
the
splendid
Cathedral
,
which
the
enemy
seemed
bent
upon
destroying
,
but
the
dome
remained
uninjured
,
though
about
ten
feet
of
the
top
of
the
second
tower
was
carried
away
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
Cannon
Street
side
of
St.
Paul
's
a
great
block
of
drapery
warehouses
had
caught
fire
,
and
was
burning
fiercely
,
while
the
drapers
and
other
shops
on
the
Paternoster
Row
side
all
had
their
windows
shattered
by
the
constant
detonations
.
<EOS>
Within
the
Cathedral
two
shells
that
had
fallen
through
the
roof
had
wrought
havoc
with
the
beautiful
reredos
and
the
choir
-
stalls
,
many
of
the
fine
windows
being
also
wrecked
by
the
explosions
.
 
<EOS>
Whole
rows
of
houses
in
Cheapside
suffered
,
while
both
the
Mansion
House
,
where
the
London
flag
was
flying
,
and
the
Royal
Exchange
were
severely
damaged
by
a
number
of
shells
which
fell
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
The
equestrian
statue
in
front
of
the
Exchange
had
been
overturned
,
while
the
Exchange
itself
showed
a
great
yawning
hole
in
the
corner
of
the
facade
next
Cornhill
.
<EOS>
At
the
Bank
of
England
a
fire
had
occurred
,
but
had
fortunately
been
extinguished
by
the
strong
force
of
Guards
in
charge
,
though
they
gallantly
risked
their
lives
in
so
doing

<EOS>
Lothbury
,
Gresham
Street
,
Old
Broad
Street
,
Lombard
Street
,
Gracechurch
Street
,
and
Leadenhall
Street
were
all
more
or
less
scenes
of
fire
,
havoc
,
and
destruction
.
<EOS>
The
loss
of
life
was
not
great
in
this
neighbourhood
,
for
most
people
had
crossed
the
river
or
gone
westward
,
but
the
high
explosives
used
by
the
Germans
were
falling
upon
shops
and
warehouses
with
appalling
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Masonry
was
torn
about
like
paper
,
ironwork
twisted
like
wax
,
woodwork
shattered
to
a
thousand
splinters
as
,
time
after
time
,
a
great
projectile
hissed
in
the
air
and
effected
its
errand
of
destruction
.
<EOS>
A
number
of
the
wharves
on
each
side
of
the
river
were
soon
alight
,
and
both
Upper
and
Lower
Thames
Streets
were
soon
impassable
on
account
of
huge
conflagrations
.
<EOS>
A
few
shells
fell
in
Shoreditch
,
Houndsditch
,
and
Whitechapel
,
and
these
,
in
most
cases
,
caused
loss
of
life
in
those
densely
populated
districts
.
 
<EOS>
Westward
,
however
,
as
the
hours
went
on
,
the
howitzers
at
Hampstead
began
to
drop
high
explosive
shells
into
the
Strand
,
around
Charing
Cross
,
and
in
Westminster
.
<EOS>
This
weapon
had
a
calibre
of
4.14
inches
,
and
threw
a
projectile
of
35
lbs
.

The
tower
of
St.
Clement
Dane
's
Church
crashed
to
the
ground
and
blocked
the
roadway
opposite
Milford
Lane
;
the
pointed
roof
of
the
clock
-
tower
of
the
Law
Courts
was
blown
away
,
and
the
granite
fronts
of
the
two
banks
opposite
the
Law
Courts
entrance
were
torn
out
by
a
shell
which
exploded
in
the
footpath
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
Shells
fell
time
after
time
,
in
and
about
the
Law
Courts
themselves
,
committing
immense
damage
to
the
interior
,
while
a
shell
bursting
upon
the
roof
of
Charing
Cross
Station
,
rendered
it
a
ruin
as
picturesque
as
it
had
been
in
December
,
1905

The
National
Liberal

burning
furiously

was
done

The
Garrick

caught
fire

a
shot
carried

the
Shot

beside
the
Thames
crashed
into
the
river

in
Trafalgar
Square
showed

great

a
shell
bursting
at

From
the
number

fell
in
the
vicinity

it
was
apparent

the
German

The

alight

while
the
Westminster
Palace
Hotel
was
severely
damaged

two
shells
falling
into
St.
Thomas

Suddenly
one

the
German
high
explosive

Big

Suddenly

two
great
shells
struck
it
right
in

almost
simultaneously

made
such
a

the
huge

been
rendered
unsafe

<EOS>
Where
would
it
end
?
 
<EOS>
Half
the
population
of
London
had
fled
across
the
bridges
,
and
from
Denmark
Hill
,
Champion
Hill
,
Norwood
,
and
the
Crystal
Palace
they
could
see
the
smoke
issuing
from
the
hundred
fires
.
 
<EOS>
London
was
cowed
.
<EOS>
These
northern
barricades
,
still
held
by
bodies
of
valiant
men
,
were
making
a
last
desperate
stand
,
though
the
streets
ran
with
blood
.
<EOS>
Every
man
fought
well
and
bravely
for
his
country
,
though
he
went
to
his
death
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
acts
of
gallant
heroism
on
the
part
of
Englishmen
were
done
that
day
,
but
alas
!
<EOS>
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
were
at
our
gates
,
and
were
not
to
be
denied
.
 
<EOS>
As
daylight
commenced
to
fade
the
dust
and
smoke
became
suffocating
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
guns
pounded
away
with
a
monotonous
regularity
that
appalled
the
helpless
populace
.
<EOS>
Overhead
there
was
a
quick
whizzing
in
the
air
,
a
deafening
explosion
,
and
as
the
masonry
came
crashing
down
the
atmosphere
was
filled
with
poisonous
fumes
that
half
asphyxiated
all
those
in
the
vicinity
.
 
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
enemy
had
treated
us
,
on
the
whole
,
humanely
,
but
finding
that
desperate
resistance
in
the
northern
suburbs
,
Von
Kronhelm
was
carrying
out
the
Emperor
's
parting
injunction
.
<EOS>
He
was
breaking
the
pride
of
our
own
dear
London
,
even
at
the
sacrifice
of
thousands
of
innocent
lives
.
 
<EOS>
The
scenes
in
the
streets
within
that
zone
of
awful
fire
baffled
description
.
<EOS>
They
were
too
sudden
,
too
dramatic
,
too
appalling
.
<EOS>
Death
and
destruction
were
everywhere
,
and
the
people
of
London
now
realised
for
the
first
time
what
the
horrors
of
war
really
meant
.
 
<EOS>
Dusk
was
falling
.
<EOS>
Above
the
pall
of
smoke
from
burning
buildings
<EOS>
the
sun
was
setting
with
a
blood
-
red
light
.
<EOS>
From
the
London
streets
,
however
,
this
evening
sky
was
darkened
by
the
clouds
of
smoke
and
dust
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
cannonade
continued
,
each
shell
that
came
hurtling
through
the
air
exploding
with
deadly
effect
and
spreading
destruction
on
all
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
barricades
at
the
north
had
not
escaped
Von
Kronhelm
's
attention
.
<EOS>
About
four
o'clock
he
gave
orders
by
field
telegraph
for
certain
batteries
to
move
down
and
attack
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
done
soon
after
five
o'clock
,
and
when
the
German
guns
began
to
pour
their
deadly
rain
of
shell
into
those
hastily
improvised
defences
there
commenced
a
slaughter
of
the
gallant
defenders
that
was
horrible
.
<EOS>
At
each
of
the
barricades
shell
after
shell
was
directed
,
and
very
quickly
breaches
were
made
.
<EOS>
Then
upon
the
defenders
themselves
the
fire
was
directed
--
a
withering
,
awful
fire
from
quick
-
firing
guns
which
none
could
withstand
.
<EOS>
The
streets
,
with
their
barricades
swept
away
,
were
strewn
with
mutilated
corpses
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
upon
hundreds
had
attempted
to
make
a
last
stand
,
rallied
by
the
Union
Jack
they
waved
above
,
but
a
shell
exploding
in
their
midst
had
sent
them
to
instant
eternity
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
gallant
deed
was
done
that
day
by
patriotic
Londoners
in
defence
of
their
homes
and
loved
ones
--
<EOS>
many
a
deed
that
should
have
earned
the
V.C.--but
in
nearly
all
cases
the
patriot
who
had
stood
up
and
faced
the
foe
had
gone
to
straight
and
certain
death
.
 
<EOS>
Till
seven
o'clock
the
dull
roar
of
the
guns
in
the
north
continued
,
and
people
across
the
Thames
knew
that
London
was
still
being
destroyed
,
nay
,
pulverised
.
<EOS>
Then
with
accord
came
a
silence
--
the
first
silence
since
the
hot
noon
.
 
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
's
field
telegraph
at
Jack
Straw
's
Castle
had
ticked
the
order
to
cease
firing
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
barricades
had
been
broken
.
 
<EOS>
London
lay
burning
--
at
the
mercy
of
the
German
eagle
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
darkness
fell
the
German
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
looked
again
through
his
glasses
,
and
saw
the
red
flames
leaping
up
in
dozens
of
places
,
where
whole
blocks
of
shops
and
buildings
,
public
institutions
,
whole
streets
in
some
cases
,
were
being
consumed
.
 
<EOS>
London
--
the
proud
capital
of
the
world
,
the
"
home
"
of
the
Englishman
--
was
at
last
ground
beneath
the
iron
heel
of
Germany
!
 
<EOS>
And
all
,
alas
!
<EOS>
due
to
one
cause
alone
--
the
careless
insular
apathy
of
the
Englishman
himself
!

CHAPTER
VI
.
 
<EOS>
FALL
OF
LONDON
.
  
<EOS>
Outside
London
the
September
night
had
settled
down
on
the
blood
-
stained
field
of
battle
.
<EOS>
With
a
pale
light
the
moon
had
risen
,
partly
hidden
by
chasing
clouds
,
her
white
rays
mingling
with
the
lurid
glare
of
the
fires
down
in
the
great
terrified
Metropolis
below
.
<EOS>
Northward
,
from
Hampstead
across
to
Barnet
--
indeed
,
over
that
wide
district
where
the
final
battle
had
been
so
hotly
fought
--
the
moonbeams
shone
upon
the
pallid
faces
of
the
fallen
.
 
<EOS>
Along
the
German
line
of
investment
there
had
now
followed
upon
the
roar
of
battle
an
uncanny
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Away
to
the
west
,
however
,
there
was
still
heard
the
growling
of
distant
conflict
,
now
mounting
into
a
low
crackling
of
musketry
fire
,
and
again
dying
away
in
muffled
sounds
.
<EOS>
The
last
remnant
of
the
British
Army
was
being
hotly
pursued
in
the
direction
of
Staines
.
 
<EOS>
London
was
invested
and
bombarded
,
but
not
yet
taken
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
the
German
Field
Marshal
had
stood
alone
upon
Hampstead
Heath
apart
from
his
staff
,
watching
the
great
tongues
of
flame
leaping
up
here
<EOS>
and
there
in
the
distant
darkness
.
<EOS>
His
grey
,
shaggy
brows
were
contracted
,
his
thin
aquiline
face
thoughtful
,
his
hard
mouth
twitching
nervously
,
unable
to
fully
conceal
the
strain
of
his
own
feelings
as
conqueror
of
the
English
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
's
taciturnity
had
long
ago
been
proverbial
.
<EOS>
The
Kaiser
had
likened
him
to
Moltke
,
and
had
declared
that
"
he
could
be
silent
in
seven
languages
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
gaze
was
one
of
musing
,
and
yet
he
was
the
most
active
of
men
,
and
perhaps
the
cleverest
strategist
in
all
Europe
.
<EOS>
Often
during
the
campaign
he
had
astonished
his
aides
-
de
-
camp
by
his
untiring
energy
,
for
sometimes
he
would
even
visit
the
outposts
in
person
.
<EOS>
On
many
occasions
he
had
actually
crept
up
to
the
most
advanced
posts
at
great
personal
risk
to
himself
,
so
anxious
had
he
been
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
Such
visits
from
the
Field
Marshal
himself
were
not
always
welcome
to
the
German
outposts
,
who
,
as
soon
as
they
showed
the
least
sign
of
commotion
consequent
upon
the
visit
,
were
at
once
swept
by
a
withering
English
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
now
stood
there
the
conqueror
.
<EOS>
And
while
many
of
his
officers
were
installing
themselves
in
comfortable
quarters
in
houses
about
North
End
,
North
Hill
,
South
Hill
,
Muswell
Hill
,
Roslyn
Hill
,
Fitzjohn
's
Avenue
,
Netherhall
,
and
Maresfield
Gardens
,
and
other
roads
in
that
vicinity
,
the
great
Commander
was
still
alone
upon
the
Heath
,
having
taken
nothing
save
a
nip
from
his
flask
since
his
coffee
at
dawn
.
 
<EOS>
Time
after
time
telegraphic
despatches
were
handed
to
him
from
Germany
,
and
telephonic
reports
from
his
various
positions
around
London
,
but
he
received
them
all
without
comment
.
<EOS>
He
read
,
he
listened
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
full
hour
he
remained
there
,
strolling
up
and
down
alone
in
quick
impatience
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
though
suddenly
making
up
his
mind
,
he
called
three
members
of
his
staff
,
and
gave
orders
for
an
entry
into
London
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
as
he
knew
,
was
the
signal
for
a
terrible
and
bloody
encounter
.
<EOS>
Bugles
sounded
.
<EOS>
Men
and
officers
,
who
had
believed
that
the
storm
and
stress
of
the
day
were
over
,
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
rest
,
found
themselves
called
upon
to
fight
their
way
into
the
city
that
they
knew
would
be
defended
by
an
irate
and
antagonistic
populace
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
the
order
had
been
given
,
and
it
must
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
They
had
expected
that
the
advance
would
be
at
least
made
at
dawn
,
but
evidently
Von
Kronhelm
feared
that
six
hours
'
delay
might
necessitate
more
desperate
fighting
.
<EOS>
He
intended
,
now
that
London
was
cowed
,
that
she
should
be
entirely
crushed
.
<EOS>
The
orders
of
his
master
the
Kaiser
were
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
shortly
before
nine
o'clock
the
first
detachments
of
German
infantry
marched
along
Spaniards
Road
,
and
down
Roslyn
Hill
to
Haverstock
Hill
,
where
they
were
at
once
fired
upon
from
behind
the
_
debris
_
of
the
great
barricade
across
the
junction
of
Prince
of
Wales
Road
and
Haverstock
Hill
.
<EOS>
This
place
was
held
strongly
by
British
Infantry
,
many
members
of
the
Legion
of
Frontiersmen
--
distinguished
only
by
the
little
bronze
badge
in
their
buttonholes
--
and
also
by
hundreds
of
citizens
armed
with
rifles
.
 
<EOS>
Twenty
Germans
dropped
at
the
first
volley
,
and
next
instant
a
Maxim
,
concealed
in
the
first
floor
of
a
neighbouring
house
,
spat
forth
its
fire
upon
the
invaders
with
deadly
effect
.
<EOS>
The
German
bugle
sounded
the
"
Advance
rapidly
,
"
and
the
men
emulously
ran
forward
,
shouting
loud
hurrahs
.
<EOS>
Major
van
Wittich
,
who
had
distinguished
himself
very
conspicuously
in
the
fighting
round
Enfield
Chase
,
fell
,
being
shot
through
the
lung
when
just
within
a
few
yards
of
the
half
-
ruined
barricade
.
<EOS>
Londoners
were
fighting
desperately
,
shouting
and
cheering
.
<EOS>
The
standard
-
bearer
of
the
4th
Battalion
of
the
Brunswick
Infantry
Regiment
,
No
.
92
,
fell
severely
wounded
,
and
the
standard
was
instantly
snatched
from
him
in
the
awful
hand
-
to
-
hand
fighting
which
that
moment
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
Five
minutes
later
the
streets
were
running
with
blood
,
for
hundreds
,
both
Germans
and
British
,
lay
dead
and
dying
.
<EOS>
Every
Londoner
struggled
valiantly
until
shot
down
;
yet
the
enemy
,
always
reinforced
,
pressed
forward
,
until
ten
minutes
later
,
the
defenders
were
driven
out
of
their
position
,
and
the
house
from
which
the
Maxim
was
sending
forth
its
deadly
hail
had
been
entered
and
the
gun
captured
.
<EOS>
Volley
after
volley
was
still
,
however
,
poured
out
on
the
heads
of
the
storming
party
,
but
already
the
pioneers
were
at
work
clearing
a
way
for
the
advance
,
and
very
soon
the
Germans
had
surmounted
the
obstruction
and
were
within
London
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
short
time
the
Germans
halted
,
then
,
at
a
signal
from
their
officers
,
they
moved
along
both
roads
,
again
being
fired
upon
from
every
house
in
the
vicinity
,
many
of
the
defenders
having
retired
to
continue
their
defence
from
the
windows
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
therefore
turned
their
attention
to
these
houses
,
and
after
desperate
struggles
house
after
house
was
taken
,
those
of
the
defenders
not
wearing
uniform
being
shot
down
without
mercy
.
<EOS>
To
such
no
quarter
was
given
.
 
<EOS>
The
contest
now
became
a
most
furious
one
.
<EOS>
Britons
and
Germans
fought
hand
to
hand
.
<EOS>
A
battalion
of
the
Brunswick
Infantry
with
some
riflemen
of
the
Guard
took
several
houses
by
rush
in
Chalk
Farm
Road
;
but
in
many
cases
the
Germans
were
shot
by
their
own
comrades
.
<EOS>
Quite
a
number
of
the
enemy
's
officers
were
picked
off
by
the
Frontiersmen
,
those
brave
fellows
who
had
seen
service
in
every
corner
of
the
world
,
and
who
were
now
in
the
windows
and
upon
roofs
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
furious
fight
from
house
to
house
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
This
exciting
conflict
was
practically
characteristic
of
what
was
at
that
moment
happening
in
fifty
other
spots
along
the
suburbs
of
North
London
.
<EOS>
The
obstinate
resistance
which
we
made
against
the
Germans
was
met
with
equally
obstinate
aggression
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
surrender
.
<EOS>
Londoners
fell
and
died
fighting
to
the
very
last
.
 
<EOS>
Against
those
well
-
trained
Teutons
in
such
overwhelming
masses
we
,
however
,
could
have
no
hope
of
success
.
<EOS>
The
rushes
of
the
infantry
and
rifles
of
the
Guards
were
made
skilfully
,
and
slowly
but
surely
broke
down
all
opposition
.
 
<EOS>
The
barricade
in
the
Kentish
Town
Road
was
defended
with
valiant
heroism
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
were
,
as
in
Chalk
Farm
Road
,
compelled
to
fight
their
way
foot
by
foot
,
losing
heavily
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
But
here
,
at
length
,
as
at
other
points
,
the
barricade
was
taken
,
and
the
defenders
chased
,
and
either
taken
prisoner
or
else
ruthlessly
shot
down
.
<EOS>
A
body
of
citizens
armed
with
rifles
were
,
after
the
storming
of
the
barricades
in
question
,
driven
back
into
Park
Street
,
and
there
,
being
caught
between
two
bodies
of
Germans
,
slaughtered
to
a
man
.
<EOS>
Through
those
unlit
side
streets
between
the
Kentish
Town
and
Camden
Roads
--
namely
,
the
Lawford
,
Bartholomew
,
Rochester
,
Caversham
,
and
Leighton
Roads
--
there
was
much
skirmishing
,
and
many
on
both
sides
fell
in
the
bloody
encounter
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
deeds
of
bravery
were
done
that
night
,
but
were
unrecorded
.
<EOS>
Before
the
barricade
in
Holloway
Road
--
which
had
been
strongly
repaired
after
the
breach
made
in
it
by
the
German
shells
--
the
enemy
lost
very
heavily
,
for
the
three
Maxims
which
had
there
been
mounted
did
awful
execution
.
<EOS>
The
invaders
,
however
,
seeing
the
strong
defence
,
fell
back
for
full
twenty
minutes
,
and
then
,
making
another
rush
,
hurled
petrol
bombs
into
the
midst
of
our
men
.
 
<EOS>
A
frightful
holocaust
was
the
result
.
<EOS>
Fully
a
hundred
of
the
poor
fellows
were
literally
burned
alive
;
while
the
neighbouring
houses
,
being
set
in
flames
,
compelled
the
citizen
free
-
shooters
to
quickly
evacuate
their
position
.
<EOS>
Against
such
terrible
missiles
even
the
best
trained
troops
can
not
stand
,
therefore
no
wonder
that
all
opposition
at
that
point
was
soon
afterwards
swept
away
,
and
the
pioneers
quickly
opened
the
road
for
the
victorious
legions
of
the
Kaiser
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
in
that
prosaic
thoroughfare
,
the
Holloway
Road
,
brave
men
fought
gallantly
and
died
,
while
a
Scotch
piper
paced
the
pavement
sharply
,
backwards
and
forwards
,
with
his
colours
flying
.
<EOS>
Then
,
alas
!
came
the
red
flash
,
the
loud
explosions
in
rapid
succession
,
and
the
next
instant
the
whole
street
burst
into
a
veritable
sea
of
flame
.
 
<EOS>
High
Street
,
Kingsland
,
was
also
the
scene
of
several
fierce
conflicts
;
but
here
the
Germans
decidedly
got
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
whole
infuriated
population
seemed
to
emerge
suddenly
from
the
side
streets
of
the
Kingsland
Road
on
the
appearance
of
the
detachment
of
the
enemy
,
and
the
latter
were
practically
overwhelmed
,
notwithstanding
the
desperate
fight
they
made
.
<EOS>
Then
ringing
cheers
went
up
from
the
defenders
.
 
<EOS>
The
Germans
were
given
no
quarter
by
the
populace
,
all
of
whom
were
armed
with
knives
or
guns
,
the
women
mostly
with
hatchets
,
crowbars
,
or
edged
tools
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
Germans
fled
through
the
side
streets
towards
Mare
Street
,
and
were
hotly
pursued
,
the
majority
of
them
being
done
to
death
by
the
maddened
mob
.
<EOS>
The
streets
in
this
vicinity
were
literally
a
slaughterhouse
.
 
<EOS>
The
barricades
in
Finchley
Road
,
and
in
High
Road
,
Kilburn
,
were
also
very
strongly
held
,
and
at
the
first
-
named
it
was
quite
an
hour
before
the
enemy
's
pioneers
were
able
to
make
a
breach
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
then
only
after
a
most
hotly
contested
conflict
,
in
which
there
were
frightful
losses
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
Petrol
bombs
were
here
also
used
by
the
enemy
with
appalling
effect
,
the
road
being
afterwards
cleared
by
a
couple
of
Maxims
.
 
<EOS>
Farther
towards
Regent
's
Park
<EOS>
the
houses
were
,
however
,
full
of
sharpshooters
,
and
before
these
could
be
dislodged
the
enemy
had
again
suffered
severely
.
<EOS>
The
entry
into
London
was
both
difficult
and
perilous
,
and
the
enemy
suffered
great
losses
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
breaking
down
of
the
defences
in
High
Road
,
Kilburn
,
the
men
who
had
held
them
retired
to
the
Town
Hall
,
opposite
Kilburn
Station
,
and
from
the
windows
fired
at
the
passing
battalions
,
doing
much
execution
.
<EOS>
All
efforts
to
dislodge
them
proved
unavailing
,
until
the
place
was
taken
by
storm
,
and
a
fearful
hand
to
hand
fight
was
the
outcome
.
<EOS>
Eventually
the
Town
Hall
was
taken
,
after
a
most
desperate
resistance
,
and
ten
minutes
later
wilfully
set
fire
to
and
burned
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Harrow
Road
and
those
cross
streets
between
Kensal
Green
and
Maida
Vale
<EOS>
the
advancing
Germans
shared
much
the
same
fate
as
about
Hackney
.
<EOS>
Surrounded
by
the
armed
populace
,
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
them
were
killed
,
struck
down
by
hatchets
,
stabbed
by
knives
,
or
shot
with
revolvers
,
the
crowd
shouting
,
"
Down
with
the
Germans
!
<EOS>
Kill
them
!
<EOS>
Kill
them
!
"
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
London
women
now
became
perfect
furies
.
<EOS>
So
incensed
were
they
at
the
wreck
of
their
homes
and
the
death
of
their
loved
ones
that
they
rushed
wildly
into
the
fray
with
no
thought
of
peril
,
only
of
bitter
revenge
.
<EOS>
A
German
whenever
caught
was
at
once
killed
.
<EOS>
In
those
bloody
street
fights
the
Teutons
got
separated
from
their
comrades
and
were
quickly
surrounded
and
done
to
death
.

LONDON
<EOS>
AFTER
THE
BOMBARDMENT
.
]
 
<EOS>
Across
the
whole
of
the
northern
suburbs
the
scenes
of
bloodshed
that
night
were
full
of
horror
,
as
men
fought
in
the
ruined
streets
,
climbing
over
the
smouldering
_
debris
_
,
over
the
bodies
of
their
comrades
,
and
shooting
from
behind
ruined
walls
.
<EOS>
As
Von
Kronhelm
had
anticipated
,
his
Army
was
compelled
to
fight
its
way
into
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
streets
all
along
the
line
of
the
enemy
's
advance
were
now
strewn
with
dead
and
dying
.
<EOS>
London
was
doomed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Germans
now
coming
on
in
increasing
,
nay
,
unceasing
numbers
,
were
leaving
behind
them
everywhere
the
trail
of
blood
.
<EOS>
Shattered
London
stood
staggered
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
resistance
had
been
long
and
desperate
,
the
enemy
had
again
triumphed
by
reason
of
his
sheer
weight
of
numbers
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
even
though
he
were
actually
in
our
own
dear
London
,
our
people
did
not
mean
that
he
should
establish
himself
without
any
further
opposition
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
though
the
barricades
had
been
taken
,
the
Germans
found
in
every
unexpected
corner
men
who
shot
at
them
,
and
Maxims
which
spat
forth
their
leaden
showers
beneath
which
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
Teutons
fell
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
they
advanced
,
still
fighting
.
<EOS>
The
scenes
of
carnage
were
awful
and
indescribable
,
no
quarter
being
given
to
any
armed
citizens
not
in
uniform
,
be
they
men
,
women
,
or
children
.
 
<EOS>
The
German
Army
was
carrying
out
the
famous
proclamation
of
Field
Marshal
von
Kronhelm
to
the
letter
!
 
<EOS>
They
were
marching
on
to
the
sack
of
the
wealthiest
city
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
wanted
still
an
hour
of
midnight
.
<EOS>
London
was
a
city
of
shadow
,
of
fire
,
of
death
.
<EOS>
The
silent
streets
,
whence
all
the
inhabitants
had
fled
in
panic
,
echoed
to
the
heavy
tread
of
German
infantry
,
the
clank
of
arms
,
and
the
ominous
rumble
of
guns
.
<EOS>
Ever
and
anon
an
order
was
shouted
in
German
as
the
Kaiser
's
legions
went
forward
to
occupy
the
proud
capital
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
plans
appeared
to
have
been
carefully
prepared
.
<EOS>
The
majority
of
the
troops
coming
from
the
direction
of
Hampstead
and
Finchley
entered
Regent
's
Park
,
whence
preparations
were
at
once
commenced
for
encampment
;
while
the
remainder
,
together
with
those
who
came
down
the
Camden
,
Caledonian
,
and
Holloway
Roads
,
turned
along
Euston
Road
and
Oxford
Street
to
Hyde
Park
,
where
a
huge
camp
was
formed
,
stretching
from
the
Marble
Arch
right
along
the
Park
Lane
side
away
to
Knightsbridge
.
 
<EOS>
Officers
were
very
soon
billeted
in
the
best
houses
in
Park
Lane
and
about
Mayfair
--
houses
full
of
works
of
art
and
other
valuables
that
had
<EOS>
only
that
morning
been
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
invaders
.
<EOS>
From
the
windows
and
balconies
of
their
quarters
in
Park
Lane
they
could
overlook
the
encampment
--
a
position
which
had
evidently
been
purposely
chosen
.
 
<EOS>
Other
troops
who
came
in
never
-
ending
procession
by
the
Bow
Road
,
Roman
Road
,
East
India
Dock
Road
,
Victoria
Park
Road
,
Mare
Street
,
and
Kingsland
Road
all
converged
into
the
City
itself
,
except
those
who
had
come
from
Edmonton
down
the
Kingsland
Road
,
and
who
,
passing
along
Old
Street
and
Clerkenwell
,
occupied
the
Charing
Cross
and
Westminster
districts
.
 
<EOS>
At
midnight
a
dramatic
scene
was
enacted
when
,
in
the
blood
-
red
glare
of
some
blazing
buildings
in
the
vicinity
,
a
large
body
of
Prince
Louis
Ferdinand
of
Prussia
's
2nd
Magdeburg
Regiment
suddenly
swept
up
Threadneedle
Street
into
the
great
open
space
before
the
Mansion
House
,
whereon
the
London
flag
was
still
flying
aloft
in
the
smoke
-
laden
air
.
<EOS>
They
halted
across
the
junction
of
Cheapside
with
Queen
Victoria
Street
when
,
at
the
same
moment
,
another
huge
body
of
the
Uhlans
of
Altmark
and
Magdeburg
Hussars
came
clattering
along
Cornhill
,
followed
a
moment
later
by
battalion
after
battalion
of
the
4th
and
8th
Thuringen
Infantry
out
of
Moorgate
Street
,
whose
uniforms
showed
plain
traces
of
the
desperate
encounters
of
the
past
week
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
body
of
Germans
had
halted
before
the
Mansion
House
,
when
General
von
Kleppen
,
the
commander
of
the
IVth
Army
Corps
--
who
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
had
landed
at
Weybourne
--
accompanied
by
Lieutenant
-
General
von
Mirbach
,
of
the
8th
Division
,
and
Froelich
,
commander
of
the
cavalry
brigade
,
ascended
the
steps
of
the
Mansion
House
and
entered
.
 
<EOS>
Within
,
Sir
Claude
Harrison
,
the
Lord
Mayor
,
who
wore
his
robes
and
jewel
of
office
,
received
them
in
that
great
,
sombre
room
wherein
so
many
momentous
questions
concerning
the
welfare
of
the
British
Empire
had
been
discussed
.
<EOS>
The
representative
of
the
City
of
London
,
a
short
,
stout
,
gray
-
haired
man
,
was
pale
and
agitated
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
,
but
he
could
not
speak
.
 
<EOS>
Von
Kleppen
,
however
,
a
smart
,
soldierly
figure
in
his
service
uniform
and
many
ribbons
,
bowed
in
response
,
and
in
very
fair
English
said:--
 
<EOS>
"
I
regret
,
my
Lord
Mayor
,
that
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
thus
disturb
you
,
but
as
you
are
aware
,
the
British
Army
has
been
defeated
,
and
the
German
Army
has
entered
London
.
<EOS>
I
have
orders
from
Field
Marshal
von
Kronhelm
to
place
you
under
arrest
,
and
to
hold
you
as
hostage
for
the
good
behaviour
of
the
City
during
the
progress
of
the
negotiations
for
peace
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Arrest
!
"
gasped
the
Lord
Mayor
.
<EOS>
"
You
intend
to
arrest
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
irksome
,
I
assure
you
,
"
smiled
the
German
commander
grimly
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
we
shall
make
it
as
comfortable
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
shall
place
a
guard
here
,
and
the
only
restriction
I
place
upon
you
is
that
you
shall
neither
go
out
nor
hold
any
communication
with
any
one
outside
these
walls
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
But
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
her
ladyship
is
here
I
would
advise
that
she
leave
the
place
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
that
,
for
the
present
,
she
should
be
out
of
London
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
civic
officials
,
who
had
all
assembled
for
the
dramatic
ceremonial
,
looked
at
each
other
in
blank
amazement
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
Mayor
was
a
prisoner
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
Claude
divested
himself
of
his
jewel
of
office
,
and
handed
it
to
his
servant
to
replace
in
safe
keeping
.
<EOS>
Then
he
took
off
his
robe
,
and
having
done
so
,
advanced
closer
to
the
German
officers
,
who
,
treating
him
with
every
courtesy
,
consulted
with
him
,
expressing
regret
at
the
terrible
loss
of
life
that
had
been
occasioned
by
the
gallant
defence
of
the
barricades
.
 
<EOS>
Von
Kleppen
gave
the
Lord
Mayor
a
message
from
Von
Kronhelm
,
and
urged
him
to
issue
a
proclamation
forbidding
any
further
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
populace
of
London
.
<EOS>
With
the
three
officers
Sir
Claude
talked
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
while
into
the
Mansion
House
there
entered
a
strong
guard
of
men
of
the
2nd
Magdeburg
,
who
quickly
established
themselves
in
the
most
comfortable
quarters
.
<EOS>
German
double
sentries
stood
at
every
exit
and
in
every
corridor
,
and
when
a
few
minutes
later
the
flag
was
hauled
down
and
the
German
Imperial
Standard
run
up
,
wild
shouts
of
triumph
rang
from
every
throat
of
the
densely
packed
body
of
troops
assembled
outside
.
 
<EOS>
The
joyous
"
hurrahs
!
"
reached
the
Lord
Mayor
,
still
in
conversation
with
Von
Kleppen
,
Von
Mirbach
,
and
Froelich
,
and
in
an
instant
he
knew
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
Teutons
were
saluting
their
own
standard
.
<EOS>
The
civic
flag
had
,
either
accidentally
or
purposely
,
been
flung
down
into
the
roadway
below
,
and
was
trampled
in
the
dust
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
enthusiastic
Germans
,
disregarding
the
shouts
of
their
officers
,
fought
for
the
flag
,
and
it
was
instantly
torn
to
shreds
,
and
little
pieces
preserved
as
souvenirs
.
 
<EOS>
Shout
after
shout
in
German
went
up
from
the
wildly
excited
troops
of
the
Kaiser
when
the
light
wind
caused
their
own
flag
to
flutter
out
,
and
then
,
as
with
one
voice
,
the
whole
body
of
troops
united
in
singing
the
German
National
Hymn
.
 
<EOS>
The
scene
was
weird
and
most
impressive
.
<EOS>
London
had
fallen
.
 
<EOS>
Around
were
the
wrecked
buildings
,
some
still
smouldering
,
some
emitting
flame
.
<EOS>
Behind
lay
the
Bank
of
England
with
untold
wealth
locked
within
:
to
the
right
the
damaged
facade
of
the
Royal
Exchange
was
illuminated
by
a
flickering
light
,
which
also
shone
upon
the
piled
arms
of
the
enemy
's
troops
,
causing
them
to
flash
and
gleam
.
 
<EOS>
In
those
silent
,
narrow
City
streets
not
an
Englishman
was
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Every
one
save
the
Lord
Mayor
and
his
official
attendants
had
fled
.
 
<EOS>
The
Government
Offices
in
Whitehall
were
all
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
In
the
Foreign
Office
,
the
India
Office
,
the
War
Office
,
the
Colonial
Office
,
the
Admiralty
,
and
other
minor
offices
were
German
guards
.
<EOS>
Sentries
stood
at
the
shattered
door
of
the
famous
No
.
10
,
Downing
Street
,
and
all
up
Whitehall
was
lined
with
infantry
.
 
<EOS>
German
officers
were
in
charge
of
all
our
public
offices
,
and
all
officials
who
had
remained
on
duty
were
firmly
requested
to
leave
.
<EOS>
Sentries
were
stationed
to
guard
the
archives
of
every
department
,
and
precautions
were
taken
to
guard
against
any
further
outbreaks
of
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Across
at
the
Houses
of
Parliament
,
with
their
damaged
towers
,
the
whole
great
pile
of
buildings
was
surrounded
by
triumphant
troops
,
while
across
at
the
fine
old
Abbey
of
Westminster
was
,
alas
!
<EOS>
a
different
scene
.
<EOS>
The
interior
had
been
turned
into
a
temporary
hospital
,
and
upon
mattresses
placed
upon
the
floor
were
hundreds
of
poor
maimed
creatures
,
some
groaning
,
some
ghastly
pale
in
the
last
moments
of
agony
,
some
silent
,
their
white
lips
moving
in
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
side
in
the
dim
light
lay
the
men
,
some
in
uniform
,
others
inoffensive
citizens
,
who
had
been
struck
by
cruel
shells
or
falling
_
debris
_
;
on
the
other
side
lay
the
women
,
some
mere
girls
,
and
even
children
.
 
<EOS>
Flitting
everywhere
in
the
half
light
were
nurses
,
charitable
ladies
,
and
female
helpers
,
with
numbers
of
doctors
,
all
doing
their
best
to
alleviate
the
terrible
sufferings
of
that
crowded
place
,
the
walls
of
which
showed
plain
traces
of
the
severe
bombardment
.
<EOS>
In
places
the
roof
was
open
to
the
angry
sky
,
while
many
of
the
windows
were
gaunt
and
shattered
.
 
<EOS>
A
clergyman
's
voice
somewhere
was
repeating
a
prayer
in
a
low
,
distinct
voice
,
so
that
all
could
hear
,
yet
above
all
<EOS>
were
the
sighs
and
groans
of
the
sufferers
,
and
as
one
walked
through
that
prostrate
assembly
of
victims
more
than
one
was
seen
to
have
already
gone

<EOS>
The
horrors
of
war
were
never
more
forcibly
illustrated
than
in
Westminster
Abbey
that
night
,
for
the
grim
hand
of
death
was
there
,
and
men
and
women
lying
with
their
faces
to
the
roof
looked
into
Eternity
.
 
<EOS>
Every
hospital
in
London
was
full
,
therefore
the
overflow
had
been
placed
in
the
various
churches
.
<EOS>
From
the
battlefields
along
the
northern
defences
,
Epping
,
Edmonton
,
Barnet

and
other
places
where
the
last
desperate
stand
had
been
made
,
and
from
the
barricades
in
the
northern
suburbs
ambulance
waggons
were
continually
arriving
full
of
wounded
,
all
of
whom
were
placed
in
the
churches
and
in
any
large
public
buildings
which
had
remained
undamaged
by
the
bombardment

<EOS>
St.

Hanover
Square
,
once
the
scene
of
many
smart
weddings
,
was
now
packed
with
unfortunate
wounded
soldiers
,
British
and
German
lying
side
by
side
,
while
in
the
Westminster
Cathedral
and
the
Oratory
at
Brompton
the
Roman
Catholic
priests
made
hundreds
of
poor
fellows
as
comfortable
as
they
could
,
many
members
of

religious
sisterhoods
acting
as
nurses

in

Shoreditch
Church

were
all
improvised
hospitals
,
and
many
grim
and
terrible
scenes
of
agony
were
witnessed
during
that
long
eventful
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
was
dim
everywhere
,
for
there
were
only
paraffin
lamps
,
and
by
their
feeble
illumination
many
a
difficult
operation
had
to
be
performed
by
those
London
surgeons
who
one
and
all
had
come
forward
,
and
were
now
working
unceasingly
.
<EOS>
Renowned
specialists
from
Harley
Street
,
Cavendish
Square
,
Queen
Ann

,
and
the
vicinity
were
directing
the
work
in
all
the

men
whose

famous
kneeling

performing

upon

upon

Of

there
were
hundreds

<EOS>
From

from
Kensington

ladies
had
come

Weird

the

as
,
<EOS>
in
the
half
darkness
with

struggled

London
that

of
shattered

of
shattered

The
silence
of
death
had
fallen
everywhere

The
only
sounds

CHAPTER

<EOS>
GERMANS
SACKING
THE
BANKS
.
  
<EOS>
Day
dawned
dismally
and
wet
on
September
the
21st
.
 
<EOS>
Over
London
the
sky
was
still
obscured
by
the
smoke
-
pall
,
though
as
the
night
passed
many
of
the
raging
fires
had
spent
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Trafalgar
Square
was
filled
with
troops
who
had
piled
arms
and
were
standing
at
their
ease
.
<EOS>
The
men
were
laughing
and
smoking
,
enjoying
a
rest
after
the
last
forward
movement
and
the
street
fighting
of
that
night
of
horrors
.
 
<EOS>
The
losses
on
both
sides
during
the
past
three
days
had
been
enormous
;
of
the
number
of
London
citizens
killed
and
wounded
it
was
impossible
to
calculate
.
<EOS>
There
had
,
in
the
northern
suburbs
,
been
wholesale
butchery
everywhere
,
so
gallantly
had
the
barricades
been
defended
.
 
<EOS>
Great
camps
had
now
been
formed
in
Hyde
Park
,
in
the
Green
Park
between
Constitution
Hill
and
Piccadilly
,
and
in
St.
James
's
Park
.
<EOS>
The
Magdeburg
Fusiliers
were
being
formed
up
on
the
Horse
Guards
Parade
,
and
from
the
flagstaff
there
now
fluttered
the
ensign
of
the
commander
of
an
army
corps
,
in
place
of
the
British
flag
.
<EOS>
A
large
number
of
Uhlans
and
Cuirassiers
were
encamped
at
the
west
end
of
the
Park
,
opposite
Buckingham
Palace
,
and
both
the
Wellington
Barracks
and
the
Cavalry
Barracks
at
Knightsbridge
were
occupied
by
Germans
.
 
<EOS>
Many
officers
were
already
billeted
in
the
Savoy
,
the
Cecil
,
the
Carlton
,
the
Grand
,
and
Victoria
hotels
,
while
the
British
Museum
,
the
National
Gallery
,
the
South
Kensington
Museum
,
the
Tower
,
and
a
number
of
other
collections
of
pictures
and
antiques
were
all
guarded
strongly
by
German
sentries
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
had
thus
seized
our
national
treasures
.
 
<EOS>
London
awoke
to
find
herself
a
German
city
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
streets
lounging
groups
of
travel
-
worn
sons
of
the
Fatherland
were
everywhere
,
and
German
was
heard
on
every
hand
.
<EOS>
Every
ounce
of
foodstuff
was
being
rapidly
commandeered
by
hundreds
of
foraging
parties
,
who
went
to
each
grocer
's
,
baker
's
,
or
provision
shop
in
the
various
districts
,
seized
all
they
could
find
,
valued
it
,
and
gave
official
receipts
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
price
of
food
in
London
that
morning
was
absolutely
prohibitive
,
as
much
as
two
shillings
being
asked
for
a
twopenny
loaf
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
had
,
it
was
afterwards
discovered
,
been
all
the
time
,
since
the
Sunday
when
they
landed
,
running
over
large
cargoes
of
supplies
of
all
sorts
to
the
Essex
,
Lincolnshire
,
and
Norfolk
coasts
,
where
they
had
established
huge
supply
bases
,
well
knowing
that
there
was
not
sufficient
food
in
the
country
to
feed
their
armed
hordes
in
addition
to
the
population
.
 
<EOS>
Shops
in
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
Holborn
,
Edgware
Road
,
Oxford
Street
,
Camden
Road
,
and
Harrow
Road
were
systematically
visited
by
the
foraging
parties
,
who
commenced
their
work
at
dawn
.
<EOS>
Those
places
that
were
closed
and
their
owners
absent
were
at
once
broken
open
,
and
everything
seized
and
carted
to
either
Hyde
Park
or
St.
James
's
Park
,
for
though
Londoners
might
starve
,
the
Kaiser
's
troops
intended
to
be
fed
.
 
<EOS>
In
some
cases
a
patriotic
shopkeeper
attempted
to
resist
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
in
more
than
one
case
a
tradesman
wilfully
set
his
shop
on
fire
rather
than
its
contents
should
fall
into
the
enemy
's
hands
.
<EOS>
In
other
cases
the
tradesmen
who
received
the
official
German
receipts
burned
them
in
contempt
before
the
officer
's
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
guidance
of
these
foraging
parties
was
,
in
very
many
cases
,
in
the
hands
of
Germans
in
civilian
clothes
,
and
it
was
now
seen
how
complete
and
helpful
the
enemy
's
system
of
espionage
had
been
in
London
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
men
were
Germans
who
,
having
served
in
the
army
,
had
come
over
to
England
and
obtained
employment
as
waiters
,
clerks
,
bakers
,
hairdressers
,
and
private
servants
,
and
being
bound
by
their
oath
to
the
Fatherland
had
served
their
country
as
spies
.
<EOS>
Each
man
,
when
obeying
the
Imperial
command
to
join
the
German
arms
,
had
placed
in
the
lapel
of
his
coat
a
button
of
a
peculiar
shape
,
with
which
he
had
long
ago
been
provided
,
and
by
which
he
was
instantly
recognised
as
a
loyal
subject
of
the
Kaiser
.
 
<EOS>
This
huge
body
of
German
soldiers
,
who
for
years
had
passed
in
England
as
civilians
,
was
,
of
course
,
of
enormous
use
to
Von
Kronhelm
,
for
they
acted
as
guides
not
only
on
the
march
and
during
the
entry
to
London
,
but
materially
assisted
in
the
victorious
advance
in
the
Midlands
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
Germans
had
for
years
kept
a
civilian
army
in
England
,
and
yet
we
had
,
ostrich
-
like
,
buried
our
heads
in
the
sand
,
and
refused
to
turn
our
eyes
to
the
grave
peril
that
had
for
so
long
threatened
.
 
<EOS>
Systematically
,
the
Germans
were
visiting
every
shop
and
warehouse
in
the
shopping
districts
,
and
seizing
everything
eatable
they
could
discover
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
were
taking
the
food
from
the
mouths
of
the
poor
in
East
and
South
London
,
and
as
they
went
southward
across
the
river
,
so
the
populace
retired
,
leaving
their
homes
at
the
mercy
of
the
ruthless
invader
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
all
the
bridges
across
the
Thames
stood
German
guards
,
and
none
were
allowed
to
cross
without
permits
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
dawn
Von
Kronhelm
and
his
staff
rode
down
Haverstock
Hill
with
a
large
body
of
cavalry
,
and
made
his
formal
entry
into
London
,
first
having
an
interview
with
the
Lord
Mayor
,
and
an
hour
afterwards
establishing
his
headquarters
at
the
new
War
Office
in
Whitehall
,
over
which
he
hoisted
his
special
flag
as
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
.
<EOS>
It
was
found
that
,
though
a
good
deal
of
damage
had
been
done
externally
to
the
building
,
the
interior
had
practically
escaped
,
save
one
or
two
rooms
.
<EOS>
Therefore
the
Field
Marshal
installed
himself
in
the
private
room
of
the
War
Minister
,
and
telegraphic
and
telephonic
communication
was
quickly
established
,
while
a
wireless
telegraph
apparatus
was
placed
upon
the
ruined
summit
of
Big
Ben
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
with
Germany
,
in
case
the
cables
were
interrupted
by
being
cut
at
sea
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
after
the
landing
a
similar
apparatus
had
been
erected
on
the
Monument
at
Yarmouth
,
and
it
had
been
daily
in
communication
with
the
one
at
Bremen
.
<EOS>
The
German
left
nothing
to
chance
.
 
<EOS>
The
clubs
in
Pall
Mall
were
now
being
used
by
German
officers
,
who
lounged
in
easy
chairs
,
smoking
and
taking
their
ease
,
German
soldiers
being
on
guard
outside
.
<EOS>
North
of
the
Thames
seemed
practically
deserted
,
save
for
the
invaders
who
swarmed
everywhere
.
<EOS>
South
of
the
Thames
the
cowed
and
terrified
populace
were
asking
what
the
end
was
to
be
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
Government
doing
?
<EOS>
It
had
fled
to
Bristol
and
left
London
to
its
fate
,
they
complained
.
 
<EOS>
What
the
German
demands
were
was
not
known
until
the
"
Daily
Telegraph
"
published
an
interview
with
Sir
Claude
Harrison
,
the
Lord
Mayor
,
which
gave
authentic
details
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
as
follows:--
     
<EOS>
1
.
<EOS>
Indemnity
of
L300,000,000

paid
in

<EOS>
The

.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
claim
of
L300,000,000
,
fifty
millions
was
demanded
from
London
,
the
sum
in
question
to
be
paid
within
twelve
hours
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lord
Mayor
had
,
it
appeared
,
sent
his
secretary
to
the
Prime
Minister
at
Bristol
bearing
the
original
document
in
the
handwriting
of
Von
Kronhelm
.
<EOS>
The
Prime
Minister
had
acknowledged
its
receipt
by
telegraph
both
to
the
Lord
Mayor
and
to
the
German
Field
Marshal
,
but
there
the
matter
had
ended
.
 
<EOS>
The
twelve
hours
'
grace
was
nearly
up
,
and
the
German
Commander
,
seated
in
Whitehall
,
had
received
no
reply
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
corner
of
the
large
,
pleasant
,
well
-
carpeted
room
sat
a
German
telegraph
engineer
with
a
portable
instrument
,
in
direct
communication
with
the
Emperor
's
private
cabinet
at
Potsdam
,
and
over
that
wire
messages
were
continually
passing
and
repassing
.
 
<EOS>
The
grizzled
old
soldier
paced
the
room
impatiently
.
<EOS>
His
Emperor
had
only
an
hour
ago
sent
him
a
message
of
warm
congratulation
,
and
had
privately
informed
him
of
the
high
honours
he
intended
to
bestow
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
German
Eagle
was
victorious
,
and
London
--
the
great
unconquerable
London
--
lay
crushed
,
torn
,
and
broken
.
 
<EOS>
The
marble
clock
upon
the
mantelpiece
<EOS>
shelf
chimed
eleven
upon
its
silvery
bells
,
causing
Von
Kronhelm
to
turn
from
the
window
to
glance
at
his
own
watch
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
His
Majesty
that
it
is
eleven
o'clock
,
and
that
there
is
no
reply
to
hand
,
"
he
said
sharply
in
German
to
the
man
in
uniform
seated
at
the
table
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
The
instrument
clicked
rapidly
,
and
a
silence
followed
.
 
<EOS>
The
German
Commander
waited
anxiously
.
<EOS>
He
stood
bending
slightly
over
the
green
tape
in
order
to
read
the
Imperial
order
the
instant
it
flashed
from
beneath
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Five
minutes
--
ten
minutes
passed
.
<EOS>
The
shouting
of
military
commands
in
German
came
up
from
Whitehall
below
.
<EOS>
Nothing
else
broke
the
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
,
his
face
more
furrowed
and
more
serious
,
again
paced
the
carpet
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
little
instrument
whirred
,
and
clicked
as
its
thin
green
tape
rolled
out
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
the
Generalissimo
of
the
Kaiser
's
army
sprang
to
the
telegraphist
's
side
and
read
the
Imperial
command
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
moment
he
held
the
piece
of
tape
between
his
fingers
,
then
crushed
it
in
his
hand
and
stood
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
received
orders
which
,
though
against
his
desire
,
he
was
compelled
to
obey
.
 
<EOS>
Summoning
several
members
of
his
staff
who
had
installed
themselves
in
other
comfortable
rooms
in
the
vicinity
,
he
held
a
long
consultation
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
telegraphic
despatches
were
received
from
Sheffield
,
Manchester
,
Birmingham
,
and
other
German
headquarters
,
all
telling
the
same
story
--
the
complete
investment
and
occupation
of
the
big
cities
and
the
pacification
of
the
inhabitants
.
 
<EOS>
One
hour
's
grace
was
,
however
,
allowed
to
London
--
till
noon
.
 
<EOS>
Then
orders
were
issued
,
bugles
rang
out
across
the
parks
,
and
in
the
main
thoroughfares
,
where
arms
were
piled
,
causing
the
troops
to
fall
in
,
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
large
bodies
of
infantry
and
engineers
were
moving
along
the
Strand
,
in
the
direction
of
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
the
reason
of
all
this
was
a
mystery
,
but
very
shortly
it
was
realised
what
was
intended
when
a
detachment
of
the
5th
Hanover
Regiment
advanced
to
the
gate
of
the
Bank
of
England
opposite
the
Exchange
,
and
,
after
some
difficulty
,
broke
it
open
and
entered
,
followed
by
some
engineers
of
Von
Mirbach
's
Division
.
<EOS>
The
building
was
very
soon
occupied
,
and
,
under
the
direction
of
General
Von
Kleppen
himself
,
an
attempt
was
made
to
open
the
strong
rooms
,
wherein
was
stored
that
vast
hoard
of
England
's
wealth
.
<EOS>
What
actually
occurred
at
that
spot
can
only
be
imagined
,
as
the
commander
of
the
IVth
Army
Corps
and
one
or
two
officers
and
men
were
the
only
persons
present
.
<EOS>
It
is
surmised
,
however
,
that
the
strength
of
the
vaults
was
far
greater
than
they
had
imagined
,
and
that
,
though
they
worked
for
hours
,
all
was
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
in
progress
,
however
,
parties
of
engineers
were
making
organised
raids
upon
the
banks
in
Lombard
Street
,
Lothbury
,
Moorgate
Street
,
and
Broad
Street
,
as
well
as
upon
branch
banks
in
Oxford
Street
,
the
Strand
,
and
other
places
in
the
West
End
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
bank
on
the
left
-
hand
side
of
Lombard
Street
,
dynamite
being
used
to
force
the
strong
room
,
the
first
bullion
was
seized
,
while
at
nearly
all
the
banks
sooner
or
later
the
vaults
were
opened
,
and
great
bags
and
boxes
of
gold
coin
were
taken
out
and
conveyed
in
carefully
guarded
carts
to
the
Bank
of
England
,
now
in
the
possession
of
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
In
some
banks
--
those
of
more
modern
construction
--
the
greatest
resistance
was
offered
by
the
huge
steel
doors
and
concrete
and
steel
walls
and
other
devices
for
security
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
could
,
alas
!
<EOS>
resist
the
high
explosives
used
,
and
in
the
end
breaches
were
made
,
in
all
cases
,
and
wealth
uncounted
and
untold
extracted
and
conveyed
to
Threadneedle
Street
for
safe
keeping
.
 
<EOS>
Engineers
and
infantry
handled
those
heavy
boxes
and
those
big
bundles
of
securities
gleefully
,
officers
carefully
counting
each
box
or
bag
or
packet
as
it
was
taken
out
to
be
carted
or
carried
away
by
hand
.
 
<EOS>
German
soldiers
under
guard
struggled
along
Lothbury
beneath
great
burdens
of
gold
,
and
carts
,
requisitioned
out
of
the
East
End
,
rumbled
heavily
all
the
afternoon
,
escorted
by
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Hammersmith
,
Camberwell
,
Hampstead
,
and
Willesden
yielded
up
their
quota
of
the
great
wealth
of
London
;
but
though
soon
after
four
o'clock
a
breach
was
made
in
the
strong
rooms
of
the
Bank
of
England
by
means
of
explosives
,
nothing
in
the
vaults
was
touched
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
simply
entered
there
and
formally
took
possession
.
 
<EOS>
The
coin
collected
from
other
banks
was
carefully
kept
,
each
separate
from
another
,
and
placed
in
various
rooms
under
strong
guards
,
for
it
seemed
to
be
their
intention
simply
to
hold
London
's
wealth
as
security
.
 
<EOS>
That
afternoon
very
few
banks
--
except
the
German
ones
--
escaped
notice
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
there
were
a
few
small
branches
in
the
suburbs
which
remained
unvisited
,
yet
by
six
o'clock
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
was
in
possession
of
enormous
quantities
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
or
two
quarters
there
had
been
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
armed
guards
established
by
the
banks
at
the
first
news
of
the
invasion
.
<EOS>
But
any
such
resistance
had
,
of
course
,
been
futile
,
and
the
man
who
had
dared
to
fire
upon
the
German
soldiers
had
in
every
case
been
shot
down
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
when
darkness
fell
,
Von
Kronhelm
,
from
the
corner
of
his
room
in
the
War
Office
,
was
able
to
report
to
his
Imperial
Master
that
not
only
had
he
occupied
London
,
but
that
,
receiving
no
reply
to
his
demand
for
indemnity
,
he
had
sacked
it
and
taken
possession
not
only
of
the
Bank
of
England
,
but
of
the
cash
deposits
in
most
of
the
other
banks
in
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
the
evening
papers
described
the
wild
happenings
of
the
afternoon
,
and
London
saw
herself
not
only
shattered
,
but
ruined
.
<EOS>
The
frightened
populace
across
the
river
stood
breathless
.
<EOS>
What
was
now
to
happen
?
 
<EOS>
Though
London
lay
crushed
and
occupied
by
the
enemy
,
though
the
Lord
Mayor
was
a
prisoner
of
war
and
the
banks
in
the
hands
of
the
Germans
,
though
the
metropolis
had
been
wrecked
and
more
than
half
its
inhabitants
had
fled
southward
and
westward
into
the
country
,
yet
the
enemy
received
no
reply
to
their
demand
for
an
indemnity
and
the
cession
of
British
territory
.
 
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
,
ignorant
of
what
had
occurred
in
the
House
of
Commons
at
Bristol
,
sat
in
Whitehall
and
wondered
.
<EOS>
He
knew
well
that
the
English
were
no
fools
,
and
their
silence
,
therefore
,
caused
him
considerable
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
He
had
lost
in
the
various
engagements
over
50,000
men
,
yet
nearly
200,000
still
remained
.
<EOS>
His
army
of
invasion
was
a
no
mean
responsibility
,
especially
when
at
any
moment
the
British
might
regain
command
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
His
supplies
and
reinforcements
would
then
be
at
once
cut
off
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
live
upon
the
country
,
and
his
food
bases
in
Suffolk
and
Essex
were
not
sufficiently
extensive
to
enable
him
to
make
a
prolonged
campaign
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
whole
scheme
of
operations
which
had
been
so
long
discussed
and
perfected
in
secret
in
Berlin
was
more
of
the
nature
of
a
raid
than
a
prolonged
siege
.

VON

'S
PROCLAMATION
TO
THE
    
CITIZENS
OF
LONDON
.
]
  
<EOS>
The
German
Field
Marshal
sat
alone
and
reflected
.
<EOS>
Had
he
been
aware
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
<EOS>
he
would
certainly
have
had
considerable
cause
for
alarm
.
<EOS>
True
,
though
Lord
Byfield
had
made
such
a
magnificent
stand
,
considering
the
weakness
of
the
force
at
his
disposal
,
and
London
was
occupied
,
yet
England
was
not
conquered
.
 
<EOS>
No
news
had
leaked
out
from
Bristol
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Parliament
had
taken
every
precaution
that
its
deliberations
were
in
secret
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
,
however
,
may
be
briefly
related
.
<EOS>
On
the
previous
day
the
House
had
met
at
noon
in
the
Colston
Hall
--
a
memorable
sitting
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
The
Secretary
of
State
for
War
had
,
after
prayers
,
risen
in
the
hall
and
read
an
official
despatch
he
had
just
received
from
Lord
Byfield
,
giving
the
news
of
the
last
stand
made
by
the
British
north
of
Enfield
,
and
the
utter
hopelessness
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
It
was
received
by
the
assembled
House
in
ominous
silence
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
past
week
through
that
great
hall
the
Minister
's
deep
voice
,
shaken
by
emotion
,
had
been
daily
heard
as
he
was
compelled
to
report
defeat
after
defeat
of
the
British
arms
.
<EOS>
Both
sides
of
the
House
had
,
after
the
first
few
days
,
been
forced
to
recognise
Germany
's
superiority
in
numbers
,
in
training
,
in
organisation
--
in
fact
in
everything
appertaining
to
military
power
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
's
strategy
had
been
perfect
.
<EOS>
He
knew
more
of
Eastern
England
than
the
British
Commander
himself
,
and
his
marvellous
system
of
spies
and
advance
agents
--
Germans
who
had
lived
for
years
in
England
--
had
assisted
him
forward
,
until
he
had
now
occupied
London
,
the
city
declared
to
be
impregnable
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
whole
of
September
20
the
Minister
constantly
received
despatches
from
the
British
Field
Marshal
and
from
London
itself
,
yet
each
telegram
communicated
to
the
House
seemed
more
hopeless
than
its
predecessor
.
 
<EOS>
The
debate
,
however
,
proceeded
through
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
Opposition
were
bitterly
attacking
the
Government
and
the
Blue
Water
School
for
its
gross
negligence
in
the
past
,
and
demanding
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
the
remnant
of
the
British
Navy
.
<EOS>
The
First
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
flatly
refused
to
make
any
statement
.
<EOS>
The
whereabouts
of
our
Navy
at
that
moment
was
,
he
said
,
a
secret
,
which
must
,
at
all
hazards
,
be
withheld
from
our
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
Admiralty
were
not
asleep
,
as
the
country
believed
,
but
were
fully
alive
to
the
seriousness
of
the
crisis
.
<EOS>
He
urged
the
House
to
remain
patient
,
saying
that
as
soon
as
he
dared
he
would
make
a
statement
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
greeted
by
loud
jeers
from
the
Opposition
,
from
whose
benches
,
members
,
one
after
another
,
rose
,
and
,
using
hard
epithets
,
blamed
the
Government
for
the
terrible
disaster
.
<EOS>
The
cutting
down
of
our
defences
,
the
meagre
naval
programmes
,
the
discouragement
of
the
Volunteers
and
of
recruiting
,
and
the
disregard
of
Lord
Roberts
'
scheme
in
1906
for
universal
military
training
were
,
they
declared
,
responsible
for
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
Government
had
been
culpably
negligent
,
and
Mr.
Haldane
's
scheme
had
been
all
insufficient
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
had
been
nothing
short
of
criminal
to
mislead
the
Empire
into
a
false
sense
of
security
which
did
not
exist
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
past
three
years
Germany
,
while
sapping
our
industries
,
had
sent
spies
into
our
midst
,
and
laughed
at
us
for
our
foolish
insular
superiority
.
<EOS>
She
had
turned
her
attention
from
France
to
ourselves
,
notwithstanding
the
_
entente
cordiale
_
.
<EOS>
She
remembered
how
the
much
-
talked
-
of
Franco
-
Russian
alliance
had
fallen
to
pieces
,
and
relied
upon
a
similar
outcome
of
the
friendship
between
France
and
Great
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
the
House
,
too
,
was
strange
;
the
Speaker
in
his
robes
looked
out
of
place
in
his
big
uncomfortable
chair
,
and
members
sat
on
cane
-
bottomed
chairs
instead
of
their
comfortable
benches
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
possible
the
usual
arrangement
of
the
House
was
adhered
to
,
except
that
the
Press
were
now
excluded
,
official
reports
being
furnished
to
them
at
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
The
clerks
'
table
was
a
large
plain
one
of
stained
wood
,
but
upon
it
was
the
usual
array
of
despatches
,
while
the
Serjeant
-
at
-
Arms
,
in
his
picturesque
dress
,
was
still
one
of
the
most
prominent
figures
.
<EOS>
The
lack
of
committee
rooms
,
of
an
adequate
lobby
,
and
of
a
refreshment
department
caused
much
inconvenience
,
though
a
temporary
post
and
telegraph
office
had
been
established
within
the
building
,
and
a
separate
line
connected
the
Prime
Minister
's
room
with
Downing
Street
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
Government
were
denounced
in
unmeasured
terms
,
its
defence
was
equally
vigorous
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
through
that
never
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
afternoon
the
sitting
continued
past
the
dinner
hour
on
to
late
in
the
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Time
after
time
the
despatches
from
London
were
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
War
Minister
,
but
,
contrary
to
the
expectation
of
the
House
,
he
vouchsafed
no
further
statement
.
<EOS>
It
was
noticed
that
just
before
ten
o'clock
he
consulted
in
an
earnest
undertone
with
the
Prime
Minister
,
the
First
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
,
and
the
Home
Secretary
,
and
that
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
all
four
went
out
and
were
closeted
in
one
of
the
smaller
rooms
with
other
members
of
the
Cabinet
for
nearly
half
an
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
Secretary
of
State
for
War
re
-
entered
the
House
and
resumed
his
seat
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
afterwards
Mr.
Thomas
Askern
,
member
of
one
of
the
Metropolitan
boroughs
,
and
a
well
-
known
newspaper
proprietor
,
who
had
himself
received
several
private
despatches
,
rose
and
received
leave
to
put
a
question
to
the
War
Minister
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
like
to
ask
the
Right
Honourable
the
Secretary
of
State
for
War
,
"
he
said
,
"
whether
it
is
not
a
fact
that
soon
after
noon
to
-
day
the
enemy
,
having
moved
his
heavy
artillery
to
certain
positions
commanding
North
London
,
and
finding
the
capital
strongly
barricaded
,
proceeded
to
bombard
it
?
<EOS>
Whether
that
bombardment
,
according
to
the
latest
despatches
,
is
not
still
continuing
at
this
moment
;
whether
it
is
not
a
fact
that
enormous
damage
has
already
been
done
to
many
of
the
principal
buildings
of
the
metropolis
,
including
the
Government
Offices
at
Whitehall
,
and
whether
great
loss
of
life
has
not
been
occasioned
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
question
produced
the
utmost
sensation
.
<EOS>
The
House
during
the
whole
afternoon
had
been
in
breathless
anxiety
as
to
what
was
actually
happening
in
London
;
but
the
Government
held
the
telegraphs
and
telephone
,
and
the
only
private
despatches
that
had
come
to
Bristol
were
the
two
received
by
some
roundabout
route
known
only
to
the
ingenious
journalists
who
had
despatched
them
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
despatches
had
been
conveyed
the
greater
portion
of
the
way
by
motor
-
car
.
 
<EOS>
A
complete
silence
fell
.
<EOS>
Every
face
was
turned
towards
the
War
Minister
,
who
,
seated
with
outstretched
legs
,
was
holding
a
fresh
despatch
he
had
just
received
.
 
<EOS>
He
rose
,
and
,
in
his
deep
bass
voice
,
said:--
 
"
In
reply
to
the
honourable
member
for
South
-
East
Brixton
,
the
statement
he
makes
appears
,
from
information
which
has
just
reached
me
,
to
be
correct
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
are
,
unfortunately
,
bombarding
London
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
,
it
is
reported
,
is
at
Hampstead
,
and
the
zone
of
the
enemy
's
artillery
reaches
,
in
some
cases
,
as
far
south
as
the
Thames
itself
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
as
the
honourable
member
asserts
,
an
enormous
amount
of
damage
has
already
been
done
to
various
buildings
,
and
there
has
undoubtedly
been
great
loss
of
life
.
<EOS>
My
latest
information
is
that
the
non
-
combatant
inhabitants
--
old
persons
,
women
,
and
children
--
are
in
flight
across
the
Thames
,
and
that
the
barricades
in
the
principal
roads
leading
in
from
the
north
are
held
strongly
by
the
armed
populace
,
driven
back
into
London
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
sat
down
without
further
word
.
 
<EOS>
A
tall
,
thin
,
white
-
moustached
man
rose
at
that
moment
from
the
Opposition
side
of
the
House
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Farquhar
,
late
of
the
Royal
Marines
,
was
a
well
-
known
military
critic
,
and
represented
West
Bude
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
this
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
the
only
hope
of
England
!
<EOS>
The
defence
of
London
by
an
armed
mob
,
pitted
against
the
most
perfectly
equipped
and
armed
force
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
Londoners
are
patriotic
,
I
grant
.
<EOS>
They
will
die
fighting
for
their
homes
,
as
every
Englishman
will
when
the
moment
comes
;
yet
,
what
can
we
hope
,
when
patriotism
is
ranged
against
modern
military
science
?
<EOS>
There
surely
is
patriotism
in
the
savage
negro
races
of
Central
Africa
,
a
love
of
country
perhaps
as
deep
as
in
the
white
man
's
heart
;
yet
a
little
strategy
,
a
few
Maxims
,
and
all
defence
is
quickly
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
must
inevitably
be
with
London
.
<EOS>
I
contend
,
Mr.
Speaker
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
that
by
the
ill
-
advised
action
of
the
Government
from
the
first
hour
of
their
coming
into
power
,
we
now
find
ourselves
conquered
.
<EOS>
It
only
remains
for
them
now
to
make
terms
of
peace
as
honourable
to
themselves
as
the
unfortunate
circumstances
will
admit
.
<EOS>
Let
the
country
itself
judge
their
actions
in
the
light
of
events
of
to
-
day
,
and
let
the
blood
of
the
poor
murdered
women
and
children
of
London
be
upon
their
heads
.
<EOS>
(
Shame
.
)
<EOS>
To
resist
further
is
useless
.
<EOS>
Our
military
organisation
is
in
chaos
,
our
miserably
weak
army
is
defeated
and
in
flight
.
<EOS>
I
declare
to
this
House
that
we
should
sue
at
this
very
moment
for
peace
--
a
dishonourable
peace
though
it
be
;
but
the
bitter
truth
is
too
plain
--
England
is
conquered
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
sat
down
amid
the
"
hear
,
hears
,
"
and
the
loud
applause
of
the
Opposition
there
rose
a
keen
-
faced
,
dark
-
haired
,
clean
-
shaven
man
of
thirty
-
seven
or
so
.
<EOS>
He
was
Gerald
Graham
,
younger
son
of
an
aristocratic
house
,
the
Yorkshire
Grahams
,
who
sat
for
North
-
East
Rutland
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
brilliant
attainments
at
Oxford
,
a
splendid
orator
,
a
distinguished
writer
and
traveller
,
<EOS>
whose
keen
brown
eye
,
lithe
upright
figure
,
quick
activity
,
and
smart
appearance
,
rendered
him
a
born
leader
of
men
.
<EOS>
For
the
past
five
years
he
had
been
marked
out
as
a
"
coming
man
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
a
soldier
he
had
seen
hard
service
in
the
Boer
War
,
being
mentioned
twice
in
despatches
;
as
an
explorer
he
had
led
a
party
through
the
heart
of
the
Congo
and
fought
his
way
back
to
civilisation
through
an
unexplored
land
with
valiant
bravery
that
had
saved
the
lives
of
his
companions
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
never
sought
notoriety
.
<EOS>
He
hated
to
be
lionised
in
society
,
refused
the
shoals
of
cards
of
invitation
which
poured
in
upon
him
,
and
stuck
to
his
Parliamentary
duties
,
and
keeping
faith
with
his
constituents
to
the
very
letter
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
stood
up
silent
for
a
moment
,
gazing
around
him
fearlessly
,
he
presented
a
striking
figure
and
in
his
navy
serge
suit
he
possessed
the
unmistakable
cut
of
the
smart
,
well
-
groomed
Englishman
who
was
also
a
man
of
note
.
 
<EOS>
The
House
always
listened
to
him
,
for
he
never
spoke
without
he
had
something
of
importance
to
say
.
<EOS>
And
the
instant
he
was
up
a
silence
fell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Speaker
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
clear
,
ringing
voice
,
"
I
entirely
disagree
with
my
honourable
friend
the
member
for
West
Bude
.
<EOS>
England
is
not
conquered
!
<EOS>
She
is
not
beaten
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
great
hall
rang
with
loud
and
vociferous
cheers
.
 
<EOS>
"
London
may
be
invested
and
bombarded
.
<EOS>
She
may
even
be
sacked
,
but
Englishmen
will
still
fight
for
their
homes
and
fight
valiantly
.
<EOS>
If
we
have
a
demand
for
indemnity
let
us
refuse
to
pay
it
.
<EOS>
Let
us
civilians
--
let
the
civilians
in
every
corner
of
England
--
arm
themselves
and
unite
to
drive
out
the
invader
!
<EOS>
(
Loud
cheers
.
)
<EOS>
I
contend
,
Mr.
Speaker
,
that
there
are
millions
of
able
-
bodied
men
in
this
country
who
,
if
properly
organised
,
will
be
able
to
gradually
exterminate
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Organisation
is
all
that
is
required
.
<EOS>
Our
vast
population
will
rise
against
the
Germans
,
and
before
the
tide
of
popular
indignation
and
desperate
resistance
the
power
of
the
invader
must
soon
be
swept
away
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
us
sit
calmly
here
in
security
,
and
acknowledge
that
we
are
beaten
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
we
have
at
this
moment
to
uphold
the
ancient
tradition
of
the
British
race
,
the
honour
of
our
forefathers
,
who
have
never
been
conquered
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
acknowledge
ourselves
conquered
in
this
the
twentieth
century
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
rose
from
hundreds
of
voices
,
for
the
House
was
now
carried
away
by
young
Graham
's
enthusiasm
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
let
us
organise
!
"
<EOS>
he
urged
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
fight
on
.
<EOS>
Let
every
man
who
can
use
a
sword
or
gun
come
forward
,
and
we
will
commence
hostilities
against
the
Kaiser
's
forces
that
shall
either
result
in
their
total
extermination
or
in
the
power
of
England
being
extinguished
.
<EOS>
Englishmen
will
die
hard
.
<EOS>
I
myself
will
,
with
the
consent
of
this
House
,
head
the
movement
,
for
I
know
that
in
the
country
we
have
millions
who
will
follow
me
and
will
be
equally
ready
to
die
for
our
country
if
necessary
.
<EOS>
Let
us
withdraw
this
statement
that
we
are
conquered
.
<EOS>
The
real
,
earnest
fight
is
now
to
commence
,
"
he
shouted
,
his
voice
ringing
clearly
through
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
bear
our
part
,
each
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
If
we
organise
and
unite
,
we
shall
drive
the
Kaiser
's
hordes
into
the
sea
.
<EOS>
They
shall
sue
us
for
peace
,
and
be
made
to
pay
us
an
indemnity
,
instead
of
us
paying
one
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
will
lead
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
;
"
who
will
follow
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
In
London
the
Lord
Mayor
's
patriotic
proclamations
were
now
obliterated
by
a
huge
bill
bearing
the
German
Imperial
arms
,
the
text
of
which
told
its
own
grim
tale
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
news
of
the
fall
of
London
was
being
circulated
by
the
Germans
to
every
town
throughout
the
kingdom
,
their
despatches
being
embellished
by
lurid
descriptions
of
the
appalling
losses
inflicted
upon
the
English
.
<EOS>
In
Manchester
,
a
great
poster
,
headed
by
the
German
Imperial
arms
,
was
posted
up
on
the
Town
Hall
,
the
exchange
,
and
other
places
,
in
which
Von
Kronhelm
announced
the
occupation
of
London
;
while
in
Leeds
,
Bradford
,
Stockport
,
and
Sheffield
similarly
worded
official
announcements
were
also
posted
.
<EOS>
The
Press
in
all
towns
occupied
by
the
Germans
had
been
suppressed
,
papers
only
appearing
in
order
to
publish
the
enemy
's
orders
.
<EOS>
Therefore
this
official
intelligence
was
circulated
by
proclamation
,
calculated
to
impress
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
how
utterly
powerless
they
were
.
     
<EOS>
NOTICE
AND
ADVICE
.
     
<EOS>
TO
THE
CITIZENS
OF
LONDON
.
     
<EOS>
I
ADDRESS
YOU
SERIOUSLY
.
     
<EOS>
We
are
neighbours
,
and
in
time
of
peace
cordial
relations
have
    
always
existed
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
address
you
from
my
heart
    
in
the
cause
of
humanity
.
     
<EOS>
Germany
is
at
war
with
England
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
forced
to
penetrate
    
into
your
country
.
     
<EOS>
But
each
human
life
spared
,
and
all
property
saved
<EOS>
,
we
regard
as
    
in
the
interests
of
both
religion
and
humanity
.
     
<EOS>
We
are
at
war
,
and
both
sides
have
fought
a
loyal
fight
.
     
<EOS>
Our
desire
is
,
however
,
to
spare
disarmed
citizens
and
the
    
inhabitants
of
all
towns
and
villages
.
     
<EOS>
We
maintain
a
severe
discipline
,
and
we
wish
to
have
it
known
    
<EOS>
that
punishment
of
the
severest
character
will
be
inflicted
upon
    
any
who
are
guilty
of
hostility
to
the
Imperial
German
arms
,
    
either
open
or
in
secret
.
     
<EOS>
To
our
regret
any
incitements
,
cruelties
,
or
brutalities
we
must
    
judge
with
equal
severity
.
     
<EOS>
I
therefore
call
upon
all
local
mayors
,
magistrates
,
clergy
,
and
    
schoolmasters
to
urge
upon
the
populace
,
and
upon
the
heads
of
    
families
,
to
urge
upon
those
under
their
protection
,
and
upon
    
their
domestics
,
to
refrain
from
committing
any
act
of
hostility
    
whatsoever
against
my
soldiers
.
     
<EOS>
All
misery
avoided
is
a
good
work
in
the
eye
of
our
Sovereign
    
Judge
,
who
sees
all
men
.
     
<EOS>
I
earnestly
urge
you
to
heed
this
advice
,
and
I
trust
in
you
.

Take

While
Von
Kronhelm
sat
in
that
large
sombre
room
in
the
War
Office
,
with
his
telegraph
instrument
to
Potsdam
ever
ticking
,
and
the
wireless
telegraphy
constantly
in
operation
,
he
wondered
,
and
still
wondered
,
why
the
English
made
no
response
to
his
demands
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
had
carried
out
his
Emperor
's
instructions
to
the
letter

he
had
received
the
Imperial
thanks
,
and
he
held
all
the
gold
coin
he
could
discover
in
London
as
security
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
without
some
reply
from
the
British
Government
,
his
position
was
an
insecure
one
.
<EOS>
Even
his
thousand
and
one
spies
who
had
served
him
so
well
ever
since
he
had
placed
foot
upon
English
soil
could
tell
him
nothing

<EOS>
The
deliberations
of
the
House
of
Commons
at
Bristol
were
a
secret
.
 
<EOS>
In
Bristol
the
hot
,
fevered
night
had
given
place
to
a
gloriously
sunny
morning
with
a
blue
and
cloudless
sky
.
<EOS>
Above
Leigh
Woods
the
lark
rose
high
in
the
sky
,
trilling
his
song

and
the
bells
of
Bristol
rang
out
as
merrily
as
they
ever
did
,
and
above
the
Colston
Hall
still
floated
the
Royal
Standard

a
sign
that
the

had
not
yet
adjourned

While
Von

held
London

Lord
Byfield
and
the
remnant
of
the
British
Army
,
who
had
suffered
such
defeat
in
Essex

north

had
,
four

,
retreated
to
Chichester

Salisbury

Speaking
roughly
,
therefore
,
our
vanquished
troops
were
massing
at
four
points
,
in
an
endeavour
to
make
a
last
attack
upon
the
invader
.
<EOS>
The
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
,
Lord
Byfield
,
was
near
Salisbury
,
and
at
any
hour
he
knew
that
the
German
legions
might
push
westward
from
London
to
meet
him
and
to
complete
the
_
coup
_
.
 
<EOS>
The
League
of
Defenders
formed
by
Gerald
Graham
and
his
friends
was
,
however
,
working
independently
.
<EOS>
The
wealthier
classes
,
who
,
driven
out
of
London
,
were
now
living
in
cottages
and
tents
in
various
parts
of
Berks
,
Wilts
,
and
Hants
,
worked
unceasingly
on
behalf
of
the
League
,
while
into
Plymouth
,
Exmouth
,
Swanage
,
Bristol
,
and
Southampton
more
than
one
ship
had
already
managed
to
enter
laden
with
arms
and
ammunition
of
all
kinds
,
sent
across
by
the
agents
of
the
League
in
France
.
<EOS>
The
cargoes
were
of
a
very
miscellaneous
character
,
from
modern
Maxims
to
old
-
fashioned
rifles
that
had
seen
service
in
the
war
of
1870
.
<EOS>
There
were
hundreds
of
modern
rifles
,
sporting
guns
,
revolvers
,
swords
--
in
fact
,
every
weapon
imaginable
,
modern
and
old
-
fashioned
.
<EOS>
These
were
at
once
taken
charge
of
by
the
local
branches
of
the
League
,
and
to
those
men
who
presented
their
tickets
of
identification
the
arms
were
served
out
,
and
practice
conducted
in
the
open
fields
.
<EOS>
Three
shiploads
of
rifles
were
known
to
have
been
captured
by
German
warships
,
one
off
Start
Point
,
another
a
few
miles
outside
Padstow
,
and
a
third
within
sight
of
the
coastguard
at
Selsey
Bill
.
<EOS>
Two
other
ships
were
blown
up
in
the
Channel
by
drifting
mines
.
<EOS>
The
running
of
arms
across
from
France
and
Spain
was
a
very
risky
proceeding
;
yet
the
British
skipper
is
nothing
if
not
patriotic
,
and
every
man
who
crossed
the
Channel
on
those
dangerous
errands
took
his
life
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Into
Liverpool
,
Whitehaven
,
and
Milford
weapons
were
also
coming
over
from
Ireland
,
even
though
several
German
cruisers
,
who
had
been
up
to
Lamlash
to
cripple
the
Glasgow
trade
,
had
now
come
south
,
and
were
believed
still
to
be
in
the
Irish
Sea
.

CHAPTER
VIII
.
 
<EOS>
DEFENCES
OF
SOUTH
LONDON
.
  
<EOS>
Preparations
were
being
continued
night
and
day
to
place
the
working
-
class
districts
in
Southwark
and
Lambeth
in
a
state
of
strong
defence
,
and
the
constant
meetings
convened
in
public
halls
and
chapels
by
the
newly
-
formed
League
of
Defenders
incited
the
people
to
their
work
.
<EOS>
Everybody
lent
a
willing
hand
,
rich
and
poor
alike
.
<EOS>
People
who
had
hitherto
lived
in
comfort
in
Regent
's
Park
,
Hampstead
,
or
one
or
other
of
the
better
-
class
northern
suburbs
,
now
found
themselves
herded
among
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
and
women
,
and
living
as
best
they
could
in
those
dull
,
drab
streets
of
Lambeth
,
Walworth
,
Battersea
,
and
Kennington
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
strange
experience
for
them
.
<EOS>
In
the
sudden
flight
from
the
north
,
parents
had
become
separated
from
their
children
and
husbands
from
their
wives
,
so
that
in
many
cases
haggard
and
forlorn
mothers
were
in
frantic
search
of
their
little
ones
,
fearing
that
they
might
have
already
died
of
starvation
or
been
trampled
underfoot
by
the
panic
-
stricken
multitudes
.
<EOS>
The
dense
population
of
South
London
had
already
been
trebled
.
<EOS>
They
were
penned
in
by
the
barricades
in
many
instances
,
for
each
district
seemed
to
be
now
placing
itself
in
a
state
of
defence
,
independent
of
any
other
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
THE
DEFENCES
OF
SOUTH
LONDON
on
Sept
26^{th
}
]
 
Kennington
,
for
instance
,
was
practically
surrounded
by
barricades
,
tons
upon
tons
of
earth
being
dug
from
the
"
Oval
"
and
the
"
Park
.
<EOS>
"
Besides
the
barricades
in
Harleyford
Road
and
Kennington
Lane
,
all
the
streets
converging
on
the
"
Oval
"
were
blocked
up
,
a
huge
defence
arm
just
being
completed
across
the
junction
of
Kennington
and
Kennington
Park
Roads
,
and
all
the
streets
running
into
the
latter
thoroughfare
from
that
point
to
the
big
obstruction
at
the
"
Elephant
"
were
blocked
by
paving
-
stones
,
bags
of
sand
,
barrels
of
cement
,
bricks
,
and
such
-
like
odds
and
ends
impervious
to
bullets
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
this
,
there
was
a
double
fortification
in
Lambeth
Road
--
a
veritable
redoubt
--
as
well
as
the
barricade
at
Lambeth
Bridge
,
while
all
the
roads
leading
from
Kennington
into
the
Lambeth
Road
,
such
as
St.
George
's
Road
,
Kennington
Road
,
High
Street
,
and
the
rest
,
had
been
rendered
impassable
and
the
neighbouring
houses
placed
in
a
state
of
defence
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
whole
district
of
Kennington
became
therefore
a
fortress
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
only
a
typical
instance
of
the
scientific
methods
of
defence
now
resorted
to
.
<EOS>
Mistakes
made
in
North
London
were
not
now
repeated
.
<EOS>
Day
and
night
every
able
-
bodied
man
,
and
woman
too
,
worked
on
with
increasing
zeal
and
patriotism
.
<EOS>
The
defences
in
Haverstock
Hill
,
Holloway
Road
,
and
Edgware
Road
,
which
had
been
composed
of
overturned
tramcars
,
motor
'
buses
,
household
furniture
,
etc
.
,
had
been
riddled
by
the
enemy
's
bullets
.
<EOS>
The
lesson
had
been
heeded
,
and
now
earth
,
sand
,
tiles
,
paving
-
stones
,
and
bricks
were
used
.
 
<EOS>
From
nearly
all
the
principal
thoroughfares
south
of
the
river
<EOS>
the
paving
-
stones
were
being
rapidly
torn
up
by
great
gangs
of
men
,
and
whenever
the
artillery
brought
up
a
fresh
Maxim
or
field
-
gun
<EOS>
the
wildest
demonstrations
were
made
.
<EOS>
The
clergy
held
special
services
in
churches
and
chapels
,
and
prayer
meetings
for
the
emancipation
of
London
were
held
twice
daily
in
the
Metropolitan
Tabernacle
at
Newington
.
<EOS>
In
Kennington
Park
,
Camberwell
Green
,
the
Oval
,
Vauxhall
Park
,
Lambeth
Palace
Gardens
,
Camberwell
Park
,
Peckham
Rye
and
Southwark
Park
<EOS>
a
division
of
Lord
Byfield
's
army
was
encamped
.
<EOS>
They
held
the
Waterloo
terminus
of
the
South
-
Western
Railway
strongly
,
the
Chatham
Railway
from
the
Borough
Road
Station
--
now
the
terminus
--
the
South
-
Eastern
from
Bricklayers
'
Arms
,
which
had
been
converted
into
another
terminus
,
as
well
as
the
Brighton
line
,
at
Battersea
Park
and
York
Road
.
 
<EOS>
The
lines
destroyed
by
the
enemy
's
spies
in
the
early
moments
of
the
invasion
had
long
ago
been
repaired
,
and
up
to
the
present
railway
and
telegraphic
communication
south
and
west
remained
uninterrupted
.
<EOS>
The
"
Daily
Telegraph
"
had
managed
to
transfer
some
of
its
staff
to
the
offices
of
a
certain
printer
's
in
Southwark
,
and
there
,
under
difficulties
,
published
several
editions
daily
despite
the
German
censorship
.
<EOS>
While
northern
London
was
without
any
news
except
that
supplied
from
German
sources
,
South
London
was
still
open
to
the
world
,
the
cables
from
the
south
coast
being
,
as
yet
,
in
the
hands
of
the
British
,
and
the
telegraphs
intact
to
Bristol
and
to
all
places
in
the
West
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
during
those
stifling
and
exciting
days
following
the
occupation
,
while
London
was
preparing
for
its
great
uprising
,
the
"
South
London
Mirror
,
"
though
a
queer
,
unusual
-
looking
sheet
,
still
continued
to
appear
,
and
was
read
with
avidity
by
the
gallant
men
at
the
barricades
.
 
<EOS>
Contrary
to
expectation
,
Von
Kronhelm
was
leaving
South
London
severely
alone
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
no
doubt
,
wise
.
<EOS>
Full
well
he
knew
that
his
men
,
once
within
those
narrow
,
tortuous
streets
beyond
the
river
,
would
have
no
opportunity
to
manoeuvre
,
and
would
,
as
in
the
case
of
the
assault
of
Waterloo
Bridge
,
be
slaughtered
to
a
man
.
<EOS>
His
spies
reported
that
each
hour
that
passed
rendered
the
populace
the
stronger
,
yet
he
did
nothing
,
devoting
his
whole
time
,
energy
,
and
attention
to
matters
in
that
half
of
London
he
was
now
occupying
.
 
<EOS>
Everywhere
the
walls
of
South
London
were
placarded
with
manifestoes
of
the
League
of
Defenders
.
<EOS>
Day
after
day
fresh
posters
appeared
,
urging
patience
and
courage
,
and
reporting
upon
the
progress
of
the
League
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
Graham
was
now
upon
every
one
's
lips
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
it
seemed
,
arisen
as
saviour
of
our
beloved
country
.
<EOS>
Every
word
of
his
inspired
enthusiasm
,
and
this
was
well
illustrated
at
the
mass
meeting
on
Peckham
Rye
,
when
,
beneath
the
huge
flag
of
St.
George
,
the
white
banner
with
the
red
cross
--
the
ancient
standard
of
England
--
which
the
League
had
adopted
as
theirs
,
he
made
a
brilliant
and
impassioned
appeal
to
every
Londoner
and
every
Englishman
.
 
<EOS>
Report
had
it
that
the
Germans
had
set
a
price
upon
his
head
,
and
that
he
was
pursued
everywhere
by
German
spies
--
mercenaries
who
would
kill
him
in
secret
if
they
could
.
<EOS>
Therefore
he
was
compelled
to
go
about
with
an
armed
police
guard
,
who
arrested
any
suspected
person
in
his
vicinity
.
<EOS>
The
Government
,
who
had
at
first
laughed
Graham
's
enthusiasm
to
scorn
,
now
believed
in
him
.
<EOS>
Even
Lord
Byfield
,
after
a
long
council
,
declared
that
his
efforts
to
inspire
enthusiasm
had
been
amazingly
successful
,
and
it
was
now
well
known
that
the
"
Defenders
"
and
the
Army
had
agreed
to
act
in
unison
towards
one
common
end
--
the
emancipation
of
England
from
the
German
thraldom
.
 
<EOS>
Some
men
of
the
Osnabrueck
Regiment
,
holding
Canning
Town
and
Limehouse
,
managed
one
night
,
by
strategy
,
to
force
their
way
through
the
Blackwall
Tunnel
and
break
down
its
defences
on
the
Surrey
side
in
an
attempt
to
blow
up
the
South
Metropolitan
Gas
Works
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
holding
the
tunnel
were
completely
overwhelmed
by
the
number
that
pressed
on
,
and
were
compelled
to
fall
back
,
twenty
of
their
number
being
killed
.
<EOS>
The
assault
was
a
victorious
one
,
and
it
was
seen
that
the
enemy
were
pouring
out
,
when
,
of
a
sudden
,
there
was
a
dull
,
heavy
roar
,
followed
by
wild
shouts
and
terrified
screams
,
as
there
rose
from
the
centre
of
the
river
a
great
column
of
water
,
and
next
instant
the
tunnel
was
flooded
<EOS>
,
hundreds
of
the
enemy
being
drowned
like
rats
in
a
hole
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
of
the
Royal
Engineers
had
,
on
the
very
day
previous
,
made
preparations
for
destroying
the
tunnel
if
necessary
,
and
had
done
<EOS>
so
ere
the
Germans
were
aware
of
their
intention
.
<EOS>
The
exact
loss
of
life
is
unknown
,
but
it
is
estimated
that
over
400
men
must
have
perished
in
that
single
instant
,
while
those
who
had
made
the
sudden
dash
towards
the
Gas
Works
were
all
taken
prisoners
,
and
their
explosives
confiscated
.
 
<EOS>
The
evident
intention
of
the
enemy
being
thus
seen
,
General
Sir
Francis
Bamford
,
from
his
headquarters
at
the
Crystal
Palace
,
gave
orders
for
the
tunnels
at
Rotherhithe
and
that
across
Greenwich
Reach
,
as
well
as
the
several
"
tube
"
tunnels
and
subways
,
to
be
destroyed
,
a
work
which
was
executed
without
delay
,
and
was
witnessed
by
thousands
,
who
watched
for
the
great
disturbances
and
upheavals
in
the
bed
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Old
Kent
Road
<EOS>
the
bridge
over
the
canal
,
as
well
as
the
bridges
in
Wells
Street
,
Sumner
Road
,
Glengall
Road
,
and
Canterbury
Road
,
were
all
prepared
for
demolition
in
case
of
necessity
,
the
canal
from
the
Camberwell
Road
to
the
Surrey
Dock
forming
a
moat
behind
which
the
defenders
might
,
if
necessary
,
retire
.
<EOS>
Clapham
Common
and
Brockwell
Park
were
covered
with
tents
,
for
General
Bamford
's
force
,
consisting
mostly
of
auxiliaries
,
were
daily
awaiting
reinforcements
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Byfield
,
now
at
Windsor
,
was
in
constant
communication
by
wireless
telegraphy
with
the
London
headquarters
at
the
Crystal
Palace
,
as
well
as
with
Hibbard
on
the
Malvern
Hills
and
Woolmer
at
Shrewsbury
.
<EOS>
To
General
Bamford
at
Sydenham
came
constant
news
of
the
rapid
spread
of
the
national
movement
of
defiance
,
and
Lord
Byfield
,
as
was
afterwards
known
,
urged
the
London
commander
to
remain
patient
,
and
invite
no
attack
until
the
League
were
strong
enough
to
act
on
the
offensive
.
 
<EOS>
Affairs
of
outpost
were
,
of
course
,
constantly
recurring
along
the
river
bank
between
Windsor
and
Egham
,
and
the
British
Free
-
shooters
and
Frontiersmen
were
ever
harassing
the
Saxons
.
 
<EOS>
Very
soon
Von
Kronhelm
became
aware
of
Lord
Byfield
's
intentions
,
but
his
weakness
was
apparent
when
he
made
no
counter
-
move
.
<EOS>
The
fact
was
that
the
various
great
cities
he
now
held
required
all
his
attention
and
all
his
troops
.
<EOS>
From
Manchester
,
from
Birmingham
,
from
Leeds
,
Bradford
,
Sheffield
,
and
Hull
came
similar
replies
.
<EOS>
Any
withdrawal
of
troops
from
either
city
would
be
the
signal
for
a
general
rising
of
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
having
gained
possession
,
he
could
only
now
sit
tight
and
watch
.
 
<EOS>
From
all
over
Middlesex
,
and
more
especially
from
the
London
area
,
came
sensational
reports
of
the
drastic
measures
adopted
by
the
Germans
to
repress
any
sign
of
revolt
.
<EOS>
In
secret
,
the
agents
of
the
League
of
Defenders
were
at
work
,
going
from
house
to
house
,
enrolling
men
,
arranging
for
secret
meeting
-
places
,
and
explaining
in
confidence
the
programme
as
put
forward
by
the
Bristol
committee
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
,
however
,
these
agents
were
betrayed
,
and
their
betrayal
was
in
every
case
followed
by
a
court
-
martial
at
Bow
Street
,
death
outside
in
the
yard
of
the
police
station
,
and
the
publication
in
the
papers
of
their
names
,
their
offence
,
and
the
hour
of
the
execution
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
undaunted
and
defiantly
,
the
giant
organisation
grew
as
no
other
society
had
ever
grown
,
and
its
agents
and
members
quickly
developed
into
fearless
patriots
.
<EOS>
It
being
reported
that
the
Saxons
were
facing
Lord
Byfield
with
the
Thames
between
them
,
the
people
of
West
London
began
in
frantic
haste
to
construct
barricades
.
<EOS>
The
building
of
obstructions
had
,
indeed
,
now
become
a
mania
north
of
the
river
as
well
as
south
.
<EOS>
The
people
,
fearing
that
there
was
to
be
more
fighting
in
the
streets
of
London
,
began
to
build
huge
defences
all
across
West
London
.
<EOS>
The
chief
were
across
King
Street
,
Hammersmith
,
where
it
joins
Goldhawk
Road
,
across
the
junction
of
Goldhawk
and
Uxbridge
Roads
,
in
the
Harrow
Road
where
it
joins
Admiral
Road
,
and
Willesden
Lane
,
close
to
the
Paddington
Cemetery
,
and
the
Latimer
Road
opposite
St.
Quintin
Park
Station
.
<EOS>
All
the
side
streets
leading
into
the
Goldhawk
Road
,
Latimer
Road
,
and
Ladbroke
Grove
Road
were
also
blocked
up
,
and
hundreds
of
houses
placed
in
a
state
of
strong
defence
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
this
Von
Kronhelm
did
not
interfere
.
<EOS>
The
building
of
such
obstructions
acted
as
a
safety
-
valve
to
the
excited
populace
,
therefore
he
rather
encouraged
than
discountenanced
it
.
<EOS>
The
barricades
might
,
he
thought
,
be
of
service
to
his
army
if
Lord
Byfield
really
risked
an
attack
upon
London
from
that
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Crafty
and
cunning
though
he
was
,
he
was
entirely
unaware
that
those
barricades
were
being
constructed
at
the
secret
orders
of
the
League
of
Defenders
,
and
he
never
dreamed
that
they
had
actually
been
instigated
by
the
British
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
Day
of
Reckoning
hourly
approached
,
and
London
,
though
crushed
and
starving
,
waited
in
patient
vigilance
.
 
<EOS>
At
Enfield
Chase
was
a
great
camp
of
British
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
the
Germans
,
amounting
to
several
thousands
.
<EOS>
Contrary
to
report
,
both
officers
and
men
were
fairly
well
treated
by
the
Germans
,
though
with
his
limited
supplies
Von
Kronhelm
was
already
beginning
to
contemplate
releasing
them
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
higher
-
grade
officers
who
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
,
together
with
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
,
the
Mayors
of
Hull
,
Goole
,
Lincoln
,
Norwich
,
Ipswich
,
and
the
Lord
Mayors
of
Manchester
and
Birmingham
,
had
been
sent
across
to
Germany
,
where
,
according
to
their
own
reports
,
they
were
being
detained
in
Hamburg
and
treated
with
every
consideration
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
all
this
greatly
incensed
Englishmen
.
<EOS>
Lord
Byfield
,
with
Hibbard
and
Woolmer
,
was
leaving
no
stone
unturned
in
order
to
reform
our
shattered
Army
,
and
again
oppose
the
invaders
.
<EOS>
All
three
gallant
officers
had
been
to
Bristol
,
where
they
held
long
consultation
with
the
members
of
the
Cabinet
,
with
the
result
that
the
Government
still
refused
to
entertain
any
idea
of
paying
the
indemnity
.
<EOS>
The
Admiralty
were
confident
now
that
the
command
of
the
sea
had
been
regained
,
and
in
Parliament
itself
a
little
confidence
was
also
restored
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
we
had
to
face
the
hard
facts
that
nearly
two
hundred
thousand
Germans
were
upon
British
soil
,
and
that
London
was
held
by
them
.
<EOS>
Already
parties
of
German
commissioners
had
visited
the
National
Gallery
,
the
Wallace
Collection
,
the
Tate
Gallery
,
and
the
British
and
South
Kensington
Museums
,
deciding
upon
and
placing
aside
certain
art
treasures
and
priceless
antiques
ready
for
shipment
to
Germany
.
<EOS>
The
Raphaels
,
the
Titians
,
the
Rubenses
,
the
Fra
Angelicos
,
the
Velasquezes
,
the
Elgin
Marbles
,
the
best
of
the
Egyptian
,
Assyrian
,
and
Roman
antiques
,
the
Rosetta
Stone
,
the
early
Biblical
and
classical
manuscripts
,
the
historic
charters
of
England
,
and
such
-
like
treasures
which
could
never
be
replaced
,
were
all
catalogued
and
prepared
for
removal
.
<EOS>
The
people
of
London
knew
this
;
for
though
there
had
been
no
newspapers
,
information
ran
rapidly
from
mouth
to
mouth
.
<EOS>
German
sentries
guarded
our
world
-
famous
collections
,
which
were
now
indeed
entirely
in
the
enemy
's
hands
,
and
which
the
Kaiser
intended
should
enrich
the
German
galleries
and
museums
.
 
<EOS>
One
vessel
flying
the
British
flag
had
left
the
Thames
laden
with
spoil
,
in
an
endeavour
to
reach
Hamburg
,
but
off
Harwich
she
had
been
sighted
and
overhauled
by
a
British
cruiser
,
with
the
result
that
she
had
been
steered
to
Dover
.
<EOS>
Therefore
our
cruisers
and
destroyers
,
having
thus
obtained
knowledge
of
the
enemy
's
intentions
,
were
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
about
the
coast
for
any
vessels
attempting
to
leave
for
German
ports
.
 
<EOS>
Accounts
of
fierce
engagements
in
the
Channel
between
British
and
German
ships
went
the
rounds
,
but
all
were
vague
and
unconvincing
.
<EOS>
The
only
solid
facts
were
that
the
Germans
held
the
great
cities
of
England
,
and
that
the
millions
of
Great
Britain
were
slowly
but
surely
preparing
to
rise
in
an
attempt
to
burst
asunder
the
fetters
that
now
held
them
.
 
<EOS>
Government
,
Army
,
Navy
,
and
Parliament
had
all
proved
rotten
reeds
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
every
man
for
himself
--
to
free
himself
and
his
loved
ones
--
or
to
die
in
the
attempt
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
south
and
west
of
England
Graham
's
clear
,
manly
voice
was
raised
everywhere
,
and
the
whole
population
were
now
fast
assembling
beneath
the
banner
of
the
Defenders
,
in
readiness
to
bear
their
part
in
the
most
bloody
and
desperate
encounter
of
the
whole
war
.
 
<EOS>
The
swift
and
secret
death
being
meted
out
to
the
German
sentries
--
or
,
in
fact
,
to
any
German
caught
alone
in
a
side
street
--
having
been
reported
to
Von
Kronhelm
,
he
issued
another
of
his
now
famous
proclamations
,
which
was
posted
upon
half
the
hoardings
in
London
;
but
the
populace
at
once
amused
themselves
by
tearing
it
down
wherever
it
was
discovered
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
was
the
arch
-
enemy
of
London
,
and
it
is
believed
that
there
were
at
that
moment
no
fewer
than
five
separate
conspiracies
to
encompass
his
death
.
<EOS>
Londoners
detested
the
Germans
,
but
with
a
hatred
twenty
times
the
more
intense
did
they
regard
those
men
who
,
having
engaged
in
commercial
pursuits
in
England
,
had
joined
the
colours
and
were
now
acting
as
spies

CHAPTER
IX
.
 
<EOS>
REVOLTS
IN
SHOREDITCH
AND
ISLINGTON
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
September
27
,
a
very
serious
conflict
,
entailing
much
loss
of
life
on
both
the
London
civilian
and
German
side
,
occurred
at
the
point
where
Kingsland
Road
joins
Old
Street
,
Hackney
Road
,
and
High
Street
.
<EOS>
Across
both
Hackney
and
Kingsland
Roads
the
barricades
built
before
the
bombardment
still
remained
in
a
half
-
ruined
state
,
any
attempt
at
clearing
them
away
being
repulsed
by
the
angry
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
Dalston
,
Kingsland
,
Bethnal
Green
,
and
Shoreditch
were
notably
antagonistic
to
the
invaders
,
and
several
sharp
encounters
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
those
districts
were
discovered
by
the
enemy
to
be
very
unsafe
.
 
<EOS>
The
conflict
in
question
,
however
,
commenced
at
the
corner
of
Old
Street
at
about
9.30
in
the
evening
,
by
three
German
tailors
from
Cambridge
Road
being
insulted
by
two
men
,
English
labourers
.
<EOS>
The
tailors
appealed
in
German
to
four
Westphalian
infantrymen
who
chanced
to
be
passing
,
and
who
subsequently
fired
and
killed
one
of
the
Englishmen
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
signal
for
a
local
uprising
.
<EOS>
The
alarm
given
,
hundreds
of
men
and
women
rushed
from
their
houses
,
many
of
them
armed
with
rifles
and
knives
,
and
,
taking
cover
behind
the
ruined
barricades
,
opened
fire
upon
a
body
of
fifty
Germans
,
who
very
quickly
ran
up
.
<EOS>
The
fire
was
returned
,
when
from
the
neighbouring
houses
a
perfect
hail
of
lead
was
suddenly
rained
upon
the
Germans
,
who
were
then
forced
to
retire
down
High
Street
towards
Liverpool
Street
Station
,
leaving
many
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Very
quickly
news
was
sent
over
the
telephone
,
which
the
Germans
had
now
established
in
many
quarters
of
London
,
and
large
reinforcements
were
soon
upon
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
men
of
Shoreditch
had
,
however
,
obtained
two
Maxim
guns
,
which
had
been
secreted
ever
since
the
entry
of
the
Germans
into
the
Metropolis
,
and
as
the
enemy
endeavoured
to
storm
their
position
they
swept
the
street
with
a
deadly
fire
.
<EOS>
Quickly
the
situation
became
desperate
,
but
the
fight
lasted
over
an
hour
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
firing
brought
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
Londoners
upon
the
scene
.
<EOS>
All
these
took
arms
against
the
Germans
,
who
,
after
many
fruitless
attempts
to
storm
the
defences
,
and
being
fired
upon
from
every
side
,
were
compelled
to
fall
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
followed
along
High
Street
into
Bethnal
Green
Road
,
up
Great
Eastern
Street
into
Hoxton
Square
and
Pitfield
Street
,
and
there
cut
up
,
being
given
no
quarter
at
the
hands
of
the
furious
populace
.
<EOS>
In
those
narrow
thoroughfares
they
were
powerless
,
and
were
therefore
simply
exterminated
.
 
<EOS>
The
victory
for
the
men
of
Shoreditch
was
complete
,
over
three
hundred
and
fifty
Germans
being
killed
,
while
our
losses
were
only
about
fifty
.
 
<EOS>
The
conflict
was
at
once
reported
to
Von
Kronhelm
,
and
the
very
fact
that
he
did
not
send
exemplary
punishment
into
that
quarter
was
sufficient
to
show
that
he
feared
to
arouse
further
the
hornets
'
nest
in
which
he
was
living
,
and
more
especially
that
portion
of
the
populace
north
of
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
News
of
the
attack
,
quickly
spreading
,
inspired
courage
in
every
other
part
of
the
oppressed
Metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
The
successful
uprising
against
the
Germans
in
Shoreditch
incited
Londoners
to
rebel
,
and
in
various
other
parts
of
the
Metropolis
there
occurred
outbreaks
.
 
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
had
found
to
his
cost
that
London
was
not
to
be
so
easily
cowed
after
all
.
<EOS>
The
size
and
population
of
the
Metropolis
had
not
been
sufficiently
calculated
upon
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
a
country
in
itself
,
while
the
intricacies
of
its
by
-
ways
formed
a
refuge
for
the
conspirators
,
who
were
gradually
completing
their
preparations
to
rise
_
en
masse
_
and
strike
down
the
Germans
wherever
found
.
<EOS>
In
the
open
country
his
great
army
could
march
,
manoeuvre
,
and
use
strategy
,
but
here
in
the
maze
of
narrow
London
streets
it
was
impossible
to
know
in
one
thoroughfare
what
was
taking
place
in
the
next
.
 
<EOS>
Supplies
,
too
,
were
now
running
very
short
.
<EOS>
The
distress
among
our
vanquished
populace
was
most
severe
;
while
Von
Kronhelm
's
own
army
was
put
on
meagre
rations
.
<EOS>
The
increasing
price
of
food
and
consequent
starvation
had
not
served
to
improve
the
relations
between
the
invaders
and
the
citizens
of
London
,
who
,
though
they
were
assured
by
various
proclamations
that
they
would
be
happier
and
more
prosperous
under
German
rule
,
now
discovered
that
they
were
being
slowly
starved
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
Their
only
hope
,
therefore
,
was
in
the
efforts
of
that
now
gigantic
organisation
,
the
League
of
Defenders
.
 
<EOS>
A
revolt
occurred
in
Pentonville
Road
,
opposite
King
's
Cross
Underground
Station
,
which
ended
in
a
fierce
and
terrible
fray
.
<EOS>
A
company
of
the
Bremen
Infantry
Regiment
No
.
75
,
belonging
to
the
IXth
Corps
,
were
marching
from
the
City
Road
towards
Regent
's
Park
,
when
several
shots
were
fired
at
them
from
windows
of
shops
almost
opposite
the
station
.
<EOS>
Five
Germans
fell
dead
,
including
one
lieutenant
,
a
very
gorgeous
person
who
wore
a
monocle
.
<EOS>
Another
volley
rang
out
before
the
infantrymen
could
realise
what
was
happening
,
and
then
it
was
seen
that
the
half
-
ruined
shops
had
been
placed
in
such
a
state
of
defence
as
to
constitute
a
veritable
fortress
.
 
<EOS>
The
fire
was
returned
,
but
a
few
moments
later
a
Maxim
spat
its
deadly
fire
from
a
small
hole
in
a
wall
,
and
a
couple
of
dozen
of
the
enemy
fell
upon
the
granite
setts
of
the
thoroughfare
.
<EOS>
The
rattle
of
musketry
quickly
brought
forth
the
whole
of
that
populous
neighbourhood
--
or
all
,
indeed
,
that
remained
of
them
--
<EOS>
the
working
-
class
district
between
Pentonville
Road
and
Copenhagen
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Quickly
the
fight
became
general
.
<EOS>
The
men
of
Bremen
endeavoured
to
take
the
place
by
assault
,
but
found
that
it
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
The
strength
of
the
defences
was
amazing
,
and
showed
only
too
plainly
that
Londoners
were
in
secret
preparing
for
the
great
uprising
that
was
being
planned
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
position
were
the
houses
held
by
the
Londoners
,
that
their
fire
commanded
both
the
Pentonville
and
King
's
Cross
Roads
;
but
very
soon
the
Germans
were
reinforced
by
another
company
of
the
same
regiment
,
and
these
being
attacked
in
the
rear
from
Rodney
Street
,
Cumming
Street
,
Weston
Street
,
York
Street
,
Winchester
Street
,
and
other
narrow
turnings
leading
into
the
Pentonville
Road
,
the
fighting
quickly
became
general
.
 
<EOS>
The
populace
came
forth
in
swarms
,
men
and
women
,
armed
with
any
weapon
or
article
upon
which
they
could
lay
their
hands
,
and
all
fired
with
the
same
desire
.
 
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
men
who
came
forth
were
armed
with
rifles
which
had
been
carefully
secreted
on
the
entry
of
the
enemy
into
the
Metropolis
.
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
those
men
,
indeed
,
had
fought
at
the
barricades
in
North
London
,
and
had
subsequently
taken
part
in
the
street
fighting
as
the
enemy
advanced
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
arms
had
come
from
the
League
of
Defenders
,
smuggled
into
the
Metropolis
nobody
exactly
knew
how
.
 
<EOS>
Up
and
down
the
King
's
Cross
,
Pentonville
,
and
Caledonian
Roads
<EOS>
the
crowd
swayed
and
fought
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
against
that
overwhelming
mass
of
angry
civilians
seemed
powerless
.
<EOS>
Small
bodies
of
the
troops
were
cornered
in
the
narrow
by
-
streets
,
and
then
given
no
quarter
.
<EOS>
Brave
-
hearted
Londoners
,
though
they
knew
well
what
dire
punishment
they
must
inevitably
draw
upon
themselves
,
had
taken
the
law
into
their
own
hands
,
and
were
shooting
or
stabbing
every
German
who
fell
into
their
hands
.
 
<EOS>
The
scene
of
carnage
in
that
hour
of
fighting
was
awful
.
<EOS>
The
"
Daily
Chronicle
"
described
it
as
one
of
the
most
fiercely
contested
encounters
in
the
whole
history
of
the
siege
.
<EOS>
Shoreditch
had
given
courage
to
King
's
Cross
,
for
,
unknown
to
Von
Kronhelm
<EOS>
,
houses
in
all
quarters
were
being
put
in
a
state
of
defence
,
their
position
being
carefully
chosen
by
those
directing
the
secret
operations
of
the
League
of
Defenders
.
 
<EOS>
For
over
an
hour
the
houses
in
question
gallantly
held
out
,
sweeping
the
streets
constantly
with
their
Maxim
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
however
,
on
further
reinforcements
arriving
,
the
German
colonel
directed
his
men
to
enter
the
houses
opposite
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
a
door
was
broken
in
,
and
presently
glass
came
tumbling
down
as
muzzles
of
rifles
were
poked
through
the
panes
,
and
soon
sharp
crackling
showed
that
the
Germans
had
settled
down
to
their
work
.
 
<EOS>
The
defence
of
the
Londoners
was
most
obstinate
.
<EOS>
In
the
streets
,
Londoners
attacked
the
enemy
with
utter
disregard
for
the
risks
they
ran
.
<EOS>
Women
,
among
them
many
young
girls
,
joined
in
the
fray
,
armed
with
pistols
and
knives
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
a
great
body
of
reinforcements
appeared
in
the
Euston
Road
,
having
been
sent
hurriedly
along
from
Regent
's
Park
.
<EOS>
Then
the
option
was
given
to
those
occupying
the
fortified
house
to
surrender
,
the
colonel
promising
to
spare
their
lives
.
<EOS>
The
Londoners
peremptorily
refused
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
the
fighting
became
more
desperate
and
spread
all
through
the
streets
leading
out
of
St.
Pancras
,
York
,
and
Caledonian
Roads
,
until
the
whole
of
that
great
neighbourhood
became
the
scene
of
a
fierce
conflict
,
in
which
both
sides
lost
heavily
.
<EOS>
Right
across
Islington
the
street
fighting
spread
,
and
many
were
the
fatal
traps
set
for
the
unwary
German
who
found
himself
cut
off
in
that
maze
of
narrow
streets
between
York
Road
and
the
Angel
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
,
on
the
other
hand
,
were
shooting
down
women
and
girls
as
well
as
the
men
,
even
the
non
-
combatants
--
those
who
came
out
of
their
homes
to
ascertain
what
was
going
on
--
being
promptly
fired
at
and
killed
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
somebody
ignited
some
petrol
in
a
house
a
few
doors
from
the
chapel
in
Pentonville
Road
,
and
in
a
few
moments
the
whole
row
of
buildings
were
blazing
furiously
,
belching
forth
black
smoke
and
adding
to
the
terror
and
confusion
of
those
exciting
moments
.
<EOS>
Even
that
large
body
of
Germans
now
upon
the
scene
were
experiencing
great
difficulty
in
defending
themselves
.
<EOS>
A
perfect
rain
of
bullets
seemed
directed
upon
them
on
every
hand
,
and
to
-
day
's
experience
certainly
proves
that
Londoners
are
patriotic
and
brave
,
and
in
their
own
districts
they
possess
a
superiority
over
the
trained
troops
of
the
Kaiser
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
a
most
sanguinary
struggle
,
the
Londoners
'
position
was
carried
,
the
houses
were
entered
,
and
twenty
-
two
brave
patriots
,
mostly
of
the
working
-
class
,
taken
prisoners
.
<EOS>
The
populace
now
realising
that
the
Germans
had
,
after
all
,
overpowered
their
comrades
,
in
their
fortress
,
fell
back
;
but
being
pursued
northward
towards
the
railway
line
between
Highbury
and
Barnsbury
stations
,
many
of
them
were
despatched
on
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
What
followed
was
indeed
terrible
.
<EOS>
The
anger
of
the
Germans
now
became
uncontrollable
.
<EOS>
Having
in
view
Von
Kronhelm
's
proclamation
--
which
sentenced
to
death
all
who
,
not
being
in
uniform
,
fired
upon
German
troops
--
they
decided
to
teach
the
unfortunate
populace
a
lesson
.
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
they
feared
that
such
revolts
might
be
repeated
in
other
quarters
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
seized
dozens
of
prisoners
,
men
and
women
,
and
shot
them
down
.
<EOS>
Many
of
these
summary
executions
took
place
against
the
wall
of
the
St.
Pancras
Station
at
the
corner
of
Euston
Road
.
<EOS>
Men
and
women
were
pitilessly
sent
to
death
.
<EOS>
Wives
,
daughters
,
fathers
,
sons
were
ranged
up
against
that
wall
,
and
,
at
signal
from
the
colonel
,
fell
forward
with
bullets
through
them
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
men
who
so
gallantly
held
the
fortified
house
not
a
single
one
escaped
.
<EOS>
Strings
of
men
and
women
were
hurried
to
their
doom
in
one
day
,
for
the
troops
were
savage
with
the
lust
of
blood
,
and
Von
Kronhelm
,
though
he
was
aware
of
it
by
telephone
,
lifted
not
a
finger
to
stop
those
arbitrary
executions
.
 
<EOS>
But
enough
of
such
details
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
to
say
that
the
stones
of
Islington
were
stained
with
the
blood
of
innocent
Londoners
,
and
that
those
who
survived
took
a
fierce
vow
of
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
's
legions
had
the
upper
hand
for
the
moment
,
yet
the
conflict
and
its
bloody
sequel
had
the
effect
of
arousing
the
fiercest
anger
within
the
heart
of
every
Briton
in
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
in
store
for
us
none
could
tell
.
<EOS>
We
were
conquered
,
oppressed
,
starved
;
yet
hope
was
still
within
us
.
<EOS>
The
League
of
Defenders
were
not
idle
,
while
South
London
was
hourly
completing
her
strength
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
that
after
quelling
the
revolt
at
King
's
Cross
wholesale
arrests
were
made
in
Islington
.
<EOS>
The
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
prisoners
did
not
seem
to
matter
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
dealing
out
to
them
summary
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
Terror
reigns
in
London
.
<EOS>
One
newspaper
correspondent
--
whose
account
is
published
this
morning
in
South
London
,
having
been
sent
across
the
Thames
by
carrier
pigeon
,
many
of
which
were
now
being
employed
by
the
newspapers
--
had
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
the
wholesale
executions
which
took
place
yesterday
afternoon
outside
Dorchester
House
,
where
Von
Kleppen
has
established
his
quarters
.
<EOS>
Von
Kleppen
seems
to
be
the
most
pitiless
of
the
superior
officers
.
<EOS>
The
prisoners
,
ranged
up
for
inspection
in
front
of
the
big
mansion
,
were
mostly
men
from
Islington
,
all
of
whom
knew
only
too
well
the
fate
in
store
for
them
.
<EOS>
Walking
slowly
along
and
eyeing
the
ranks
of
these
unfortunate
wretches
,
the
German
General
stopped
here
and
there
,
tapping
a
man
on
the
shoulder
or
beckoning
him
out
of
the
rear
ranks
.
<EOS>
In
most
cases
,
without
further
word
,
the
individual
thus
selected
was
marched
into
the
Park
at
Stanhope
Gate
,
where
a
small
supplementary
column
was
soon
formed
.

Those
chosen
knew
that
their
last
hour
had
come
.
<EOS>
Some
clasped
their
hands
and
fell
upon
their
knees
,
imploring
pity
,
while
others
remained
silent
and
stubborn
patriots
.
<EOS>
One
man
,
his
face
covered
with
blood
and
his
arm
broken
,
sat
down
and
howled
in
anguish
,
and
others
wept
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Some
women
--
wives
and
daughters
of
the
condemned
men
--
tried
to
get
within
the
Park
to
bid
them
adieu
and
to
urge
courage
,
but
the
soldiers
beat
them
back
with
their
rifles
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
men
laughed
defiantly
,
others
met
death
with
a
stony
stare
.
<EOS>
The
eye
-
witness
saw
the
newly
-
dug
pit
that
served
as
common
grave
,
and
he
stood
by
and
saw
them
shot
and
their
corpses
afterwards
flung
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
One
young
fair
-
haired
woman
,
condemned
by
Von
Kleppen
,
rushed
forward
to
that
officer
,
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
,
imploring
mercy
,
and
protested
her
innocence
wildly
.
<EOS>
But
the
officer
,
callous
and
pitiless
,
simply
motioned
to
a
couple
of
soldiers
to
take
her
within
the
Park
,
where
she
shared
the
same
fate
as
the
men
.
 
<EOS>
How
long
will
this
awful
state
of
affairs
last
?
<EOS>
We
must
die
,
or
conquer
.
<EOS>
London
is
in
the
hands
of
a
legion
of
assassins
--
Bavarians
,
Saxons
,
Wuertembergers
,
Hessians
,
Badeners
--
all
now
bent
upon
prolonging
the
reign
of
terror
,
and
thus
preventing
the
uprising
that
they
know
is
,
sooner
or
later
,
inevitable
.
 
<EOS>
Terrible
accounts
are
reaching
us
of
how
the
Germans
are
treating
their
prisoners
on
Hounslow
Heath
,
at
Enfield
,
and
other
places
;
of
the
awful
sufferings
of
the
poor
unfortunate
fellows
,
of
hunger
,
of
thirst
,
and
of
inhuman
disregard
for
either
their
comfort
or
their
lives
.
 
<EOS>
At
present
we
are
powerless
,
hemmed
in
by
our
barricades
.
<EOS>
Behind
us
,
upon
Sydenham
Hill
,
General
Bamford
is
in
a
strong
position
,
and
his
great
batteries
are
already
defending
any
attack
upon
London
from
the
south
.
<EOS>
From
the
terrace
in
front
of
the
Crystal
Palace
his
guns
can
sweep
the
whole
range
of
southern
suburbs
.
<EOS>
Through
Dulwich
,
Herne
Hill
,
Champion
Hill
,
and
Denmark
Hill
are
riding
British
cavalry
,
all
of
whom
show
evident
traces
of
the
hard
and
fierce
campaign
.
<EOS>
We
see
from
Sydenham
constant
messages
being
heliographed
,
for
General
Bamford
and
Lord
Byfield
are
in
hourly
communication
by
wireless
telegraphy
or
by
other

<EOS>
What
is
transpiring
at
Windsor
is
not
known
,
save
that
every
night
there
are
affairs
of
outposts
with
the
Saxons
,
who
on
several
occasions
have
attempted
to
cross
the
river
by
pontoons
,
and
have
on
each
occasion
been
driven
back

It
was
reported
to
Parliament
at
its
sitting
at
Bristol
yesterday
that
the
Cabinet
had
refused
to
entertain
any
idea
of
paying
the
indemnity
demanded
by
Germany
,
and
that
their
reply
to
Von
Kronhelm
is
one
of
open
defiance
.
<EOS>
The
brief
summary
of
the
speeches
published
shows
that
the
Government
are
hopeful
,
notwithstanding
the
present
black
outlook
.
<EOS>
They
believe
that
when
the
hour
comes
for
the
revenge
,
London
will
rise
as
a
man
,
and
that
Socialists
,
Nonconformists
,
Labour
agitators
,
Anarchists
,
and
demagogues
will
unite
with
us
in
one
great
national
patriotic
effort
to
exterminate
our
conquerors
as
we
would
exterminate
vermin
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Gerald
Graham
has
made
another
great
speech
in
the
House
,
in
which
he
reported
the
progress
of
the
League
of
Defenders
and
its
wide
-
spread
ramifications
.
<EOS>
He
told
the
Government
that
there
were
over
seven
millions
of
able
-
bodied
men
in
the
country
ready
to
revolt
the
instant
the
word
went
forth
.
<EOS>
That
there
would
be
terrible
bloodshed
<EOS>
he
warned
them
,
but
that
the
British
would
eventually
prove
the
victors
he
was
assured
.
<EOS>
He
gave
no
details
of
the
organisation
,
for
to
a
great
measure
it
was
a
secret
one
,
and
Von
Kronhelm
was
already
taking
active
steps
to
combat
its
intentions
;
but
he
declared
that
there
was
still
a
strong
spirit
of
patriotism
in
the
country
,
and
explained
how
sturdy
Scots
were
daily
making
their
way
south
,
and
how
men
from
Wales
were
already
massing
in
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
The
speech
was
received
on
both
sides
of
the
House
with
ringing
cheers
when
,
in
conclusion
,
he
promised
them
that
,
within
a
few
days
,
the
fiat
would
go
forth
,
and
the
enemy
would
find
himself
crushed
and
powerless
.
 
<EOS>
"
South
London
,
"
he
declared
,
"
is
our
stronghold
,
our
fortress
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
it
is
impregnable
,
defended
by
a
million
British
patriots
,
and
I
defy
Von
Kronhelm
--
indeed
,
I
dare
him
to
attack
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
was
,
of
course
,
well
aware
of
the
formation
of
the
Defenders
,
but
treated
the
League
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
If
there
was
any
attempt
at
a
rising
,
he
would
shoot
down
the
people
like
dogs
.
<EOS>
He
declared
this
openly
and
publicly
,
and
he
also
issued
a
warning
to
the
English
people
in
the
German
official
"
Gazette
,
"
a
daily
periodical
printed
in
one
of
the
newspaper
offices
in
Fleet
Street
in
both
German
and
English
.
 
<EOS>
The
German
commander
fully
believed
that
England
was
crushed
;
yet
,
as
the
days
went
on
,
he
was
puzzled
that
he
received
no
response
to
his
demand
for
indemnity
.
<EOS>
Twice
he
had
sent
special
despatch
-
bearers
to
Bristol
,
but
on
both
occasions
the
result
was
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Diplomatic
representations
had
been
made
in
Berlin
through
the
Russian
Ambassador
,
who
was
now
in
charge
of
British
interests
in
Germany
,
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
Our
Foreign
Minister
simply
acknowledged
receipt
of
the
various
despatches
.
<EOS>
On
the
Continent
the
keenest
interest
was
manifested
at
what
was
apparently
a
deadlock
.
<EOS>
The
British
had
,
it
was
known
,
regained
command
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
's
supplies
were
already
cut
off
.
<EOS>
The
cables
in
direct
communication
between
England
and
Germany
had
been
severed
,
and
the
Continental
Press
,
especially
the
Paris
journals
,
gleefully
recounted
how
two
large
Hamburg
-
American
liners
attempting
to
reach
Hamburg
by
passing
north
of
Scotland
had
been
captured
by
British
cruisers

In
the
Channel
,
too
,
a
number
of
German
vessels
had
been
seized
,
and
one
that
showed
fight
off
the
North
Foreland
was
fired
upon
and
sunk
.
<EOS>
The
public
at
home
,
however
,
were
more
interested
in
supremacy
on
land
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
very
well
to
have
command
of
the
sea
,
they
argued
,
but
it
did
not
appear
to
alleviate
perceptibly
the
hunger
and
privations
on
land
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
occupied
London
,
and
while
they
did
so
all
freedom
in
England
was
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
poster
headed
"
Englishmen
,
"
<EOS>
here
reproduced
,
was
seen
everywhere
.
<EOS>
The
whole
country
was
flooded
with
it
,
and
thousands
upon
thousands
of
heroic
Britons
,
from
the
poorest
to
the
wealthiest
,
clamoured
to
enrol
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
movement
was
an
absolutely
national
one
in
every
sense
of
the
word
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
Gerald
Graham
,
the
new
champion
of
England
's
power
,
was
upon
every
one
's
tongue
.
<EOS>
Daily
he
spoke
in
the
various
towns
in
the
West
of
England
,
in
Plymouth
,
Taunton
,
Cardiff
,
Portsmouth
,
and
Southampton
,
and
,
assisted
by
the
influential
committee
among
whom
were
many
brilliant
speakers
and
men
whose
names
were
as
household
words
<EOS>
,
he
aroused
the
country
to
the
highest
pitch
of
hatred
against
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
defenders
,
as
they
drilled
in
various
centres
through
the
whole
of
the
West
of
England
,
were
a
strange
and
incongruous
body
.
<EOS>
Grey
-
bearded
Army
pensioners
ranged
side
by
side
with
keen
,
enthusiastic
youths
,
advised
them
and
gave
them
the
benefit
of
their
expert
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Volunteer
officers
in
many
cases
assumed
command
,
together
with
retired
drill
sergeants
.
<EOS>
The
digging
of
trenches
and
the
making
of
fortifications
were
assigned
to
navvies
,
bricklayers
,
platelayers
,
and
agricultural
labourers
,
large
bodies
of
whom
were
under
railway
gangers
,
and
were
ready
to
perform
any
excavation
work
.
 
<EOS>
The
Maxims
and
other
machine
guns
were
mostly
manned
by
Volunteer
artillery
;
but
instruction
in
the
working
of
the
Maxim
was
given
to
select
classes
in
Plymouth
,
Bristol
,
Portsmouth
,
and
Cardiff
.
<EOS>
Time
was
of
utmost
value
,
therefore
the
drilling
was
pushed
forward
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
Von
Kronhelm
was
already
watchful
of
the
movements
of
the
League
,
and
was
aware
daily
of
its
growth
.
 
<EOS>
In
London
,
with
the
greatest
secrecy
,
the
defenders
were
banding
together
.
<EOS>
In
face
of
the
German
proclamation
posted
upon
the
walls
,
Londoners
were
holding
meetings
in
secret
and
enrolling
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
German
eagle
flew
in
Whitehall
and
from
the
summit
of
St.
Stephen
's
Tower
,
and
though
the
heavy
tramp
of
German
sentries
echoed
in
Trafalgar
Square
,
in
the
quiet
,
trafficless
streets
in
the
vicinity
,
England
was
not
yet
vanquished
.
 
<EOS>
The
valiant
men
of
London
were
still
determined
to
sell
their
liberty
dearly
,
and
to
lay
down
their
lives
for
the
freedom
of
their
country
and
honour
of
their
King

Three
days
have
passed
since
the
revolt
at
King
's
Cross
,
and
each
day
,
both
on
the
Horse
Guards
'
Parade
and
in
the
Park
,
opposite
Dorchester
House
,
there
have
been
summary
executions
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
is
in
evident
fear
of
the
excited
London
populace
,
and
is
endeavouring
to
cow
them
by
his
plain
-
spoken
and
threatening
proclamations
,
and
by
these
wholesale
executions
of
any
person
found
with
arms
in
his
or
her
possession
.
<EOS>
But
the
word
of
command
does
not
abolish
the
responsibility
of
conscience
,
and
we
are
now
awaiting
breathlessly
for
the
word
to
strike
the
blow
in
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
other
newspapers
are
reappearing
,
but
all
that
is
printed
each
morning
is
first
subjected
to
a
rigorous
censorship
,
and
nothing
is
allowed
to
be
printed
before
it
is
passed
and
initialled
by
the
two
gold
-
spectacled
censors
who
sit
and
smoke
their
pipes
in
an
office
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
Below
,
we
have
German
sentries
on
guard
,
for
our
journal
is
one
of
the
official
organs
of
Von
Kronhelm
,
and
what
now
appears
in
it
is
surely
sufficient
to
cause
our
blood
to
boil
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
day
,
there
are
everywhere
signs
of
rapidly
increasing
unrest
.
<EOS>
Londoners
are
starving
,
and
are
now
refusing
to
remain
patient
any
longer
.
<EOS>
The
"
Daily
Bulletin
"
of
the
League
of
Defenders
,
though
the
posting
of
it
is
punishable
by
imprisonment
,
and
it
is
everywhere
torn
down
where
discovered
by
the
Germans
,
still
gives
daily
brief
news
of
what
is
in
progress
,
and
still
urges
the
people
to
wait
in
patience
,
for
'
the
action
of
the
Government
,
'
as
it
is
sarcastically
put
.
 
<EOS>
"
Soon
after
eleven
o'clock
this
morning
a
sudden
and
clearly
premeditated
attack
was
made
upon
a
body
of
the
Bremen
infantry
,
who
were
passing
along
Oxford
Street
from
Holborn
to
the
Marble
Arch
.
<EOS>
The
soldiers
were
suddenly
fired
upon
from
windows
of
a
row
of
shops
between
Newman
Street
and
Rathbone
Place
,
and
before
they
could
halt
and
return
the
fire
they
found
themselves
surrounded
by
a
great
armed
rabble
,
who
were
emerging
from
all
the
streets
leading
into
Oxford
Street
.
 
<EOS>
"
While
the
Germans
were
manoeuvring
,
some
unknown
hand
launched
from
a
window
a
bomb
into
the
centre
of
them
.
<EOS>
Next
second
there
was
a
red
flash
,
a
loud
report
,
and
twenty
-
five
of
the
enemy
were
blown
to
atoms
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
the
soldiers
were
demoralised
,
but
orders
were
shouted
loudly
by
their
officers
,
and
they
began
a
most
vigorous
defence
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
seconds
the
fight
was
as
fierce
as
that
at
King
's
Cross
;
for
out
of
every
street
in
that
working
-
class
district
lying
between
the
Tottenham
Court
Road
and
Great
Portland
Street
on
the
north
,
and
out
of
Soho
on
the
South
,
poured
thousands
upon
thousands
of
fierce
Londoners
,
all
bent
upon
doing
their
utmost
to
kill
their
oppressors
.
<EOS>
From
almost
every
window
along
Oxford
Street
a
rain
of
lead
was
now
being
poured
upon
the
troops
,
who
vainly
strove
to
keep
their
ground
.
<EOS>
Gradually
,
however
,
they
were
,
by
slow
degrees
,
forced
back
into
the
narrow
side
-
turnings
up
Newman
Street
,
and
Rathbone
Place
into
Mortimer
Street
,
Foley
Street
,
Goodge
Street
,
and
Charlotte
Street
;
and
there
they
were
slaughtered
almost
to
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
Two
officers
were
captured
by
the
armed
mob
in
Tottenham
Street
and
,
after
being
beaten
,
were
stood
up
and
shot
in
cold
blood
as
vengeance
for
those
shot
during
the
past
three
days
at
Von
Kleppen
's
orders
at
Dorchester
House
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fierce
fight
lasted
quite
an
hour
;
and
though
reinforcements
were
sent
for
,
yet
curiously
none
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
great
mob
,
however
,
were
well
aware
that
very
soon
the
iron
hand
of
Germany
would
fall
heavily
upon
them
;
therefore
,
in
frantic
haste
,
they
began
soon
after
noon
to
build
barricades
and
block
up
the
narrow
streets
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
Rathbone
Place
,
Newman
Street
,
Berners
Street
,
Wells
Street
,
and
Great
Tichfield
Street
,
huge
obstructions
soon
appeared
,
while
on
the
east
all
by
-
streets
leading
into
Tottenham
Court
Road
were
blocked
up
,
and
the
same
on
the
west
in
Great
Portland
Street
,
and
on
the
north
where
the
district
was
flanked
by
the
Euston
Road
.
<EOS>
So
that
by
two
o'clock
the
populous
neighbourhood
bounded
by
the
four
great
thoroughfares
was
rendered
a
fortress
in
itself
.
 
<EOS>
"
Within
that
area
were
thousands
of
armed
men
and
women
from
Soho
,
Bloomsbury
,
Marylebone
,
and
even
from
Camden
Town
.
<EOS>
There
they
remained
in
defiance
of
Von
Kronhelm
's
newest
proclamation
,
which
stared
one
in
the
face
from
every
wall
.
<EOS>

"
_
<EOS>
Later
.
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
"
The
enemy
were
unaware
of
the
grave
significance
of
the
position
of
affairs
,
because
Londoners
betrayed
no
outward
sign
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
nearly
every
man
and
woman
wore
pinned
upon
their
breasts
a
small
piece
of
silk
about
two
inches
square
,
printed
as
a
miniature
Union
Jack
--
<EOS>
the
badge
adopted
by
the
League
of
Defenders
.
<EOS>
Though
Von
Kronhelm
was
unaware
of
it
,
Lord
Byfield
,
in
council
with
Greatorex
and
Bamford
,
had
decided
that
,
in
order
to
demoralise
the
enemy
and
give
him
plenty
of
work
to
do
,
a
number
of
local
uprisings
should
take
place
north
of
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
These
would
occupy
Von
Kronhelm
,
who
would
experience
great
difficulty
in
quelling
them
,
and
would
no
doubt
eventually
recall
the
Saxons
from
West
Middlesex
to
assist
.
<EOS>
If
the
latter
retired
upon
London
they
would
find
the
barricades
held
by
Londoners
in
their
rear
and
Lord
Byfield
in
their
front
,
and
be
thus
caught
between
two
fires
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
each
district
of
London
there
is
a
chief
of
the
Defenders
,
and
to
each
chief
these
orders
had
been
conveyed
in
strictest
confidence
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
to
-
day
,
while
the
outbreak
occurred
in
Oxford
Street
,
there
were
fully
a
dozen
others
in
various
parts
of
the
metropolis
,
each
of
a
more
or
less
serious
character
.
<EOS>
Every
district
has
already
prepared
its
own
secret
defences
,
its
fortified
houses
,
and
its
barricades
in
hidden
by
-
ways
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
quantity
of
arms
smuggled
into
London
,
every
dead
German
has
had
his
rifle
,
pistol
,
and
ammunition
stolen
from
him
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
the
enemy
have
been
surreptitiously
killed
for
that
very
reason
.
<EOS>
Lawlessness
is
everywhere
,
Government
and
Army
have
failed
them
,
and
Londoners
are
now
taking
the
law
into
their
own
hands
.

Kentish

the
League
of

this
morning
--
at
about
the
same
hour
--
first
made
their
organisation
public
by
displaying
our
national
emblem
,
together
with
the
white
flags
,
with
the
scarlet
St.
George
's
Cross
,
the
ancient
battle
flag
of
England

<EOS>
"
For
that
reason
,
then
,
no
reinforcements
were
sent
to
Oxford
Street
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
was
far
too
busy
in
other
quarters
.
<EOS>
In
Kentish
Town
,
it
is
reported
,
the
Germans
gained
a
complete
and
decisive
victory
,
for
the
people
had
not
barricaded
themselves
strongly
;
besides
,
there
were
large
reinforcements
of
Germans
ready
in
Regent
's
Park
,
and
these
came
upon
the
scene
before
the
Defenders
were
sufficiently
prepared
.
<EOS>
The
flag
was
captured
from
the
barricade
in
Prince
of
Wales
Road
,
and
the
men
of
Kentish
Town
lost
over
four
hundred
killed
and
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
Stepney
,
the
result
was
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
,
believing
it
to
be
a
mere
local
disturbance
and
easily
quelled
,
sent
but
<EOS>
a
small
body
of
men
to
suppress
it
.
<EOS>
But
very
quickly
,
in
the
intricate
by
-
streets
off
Commercial
Road
,
these
were
wiped
out
,
not
one
single
man
surviving
.
<EOS>
A
second
and
third
body
were
sent
,
but
so
fiercely
was
the
ground
contested
that
they
were
at
length
compelled
to
fall
back
and
leave
the
men
of
Stepney
masters
of
their
own
district
.
<EOS>
In
Hammersmith
and
in
Notting
Dale
the
enemy
also
lost
heavily
,
though
in
Hackney
they
were
successful
after
hard
fighting
.
 
<EOS>
"
Every
one
declares
that
this
secret
order
issued
by
the
League
means
that
England
is
again
prepared
to
give
battle
,
and
that
London
is
commencing
by
her
strategic
movement
of
local
rebellions
.
<EOS>
The
gravity
of
the
situation
can
not
now
,
for
one
moment
,
be
concealed
.
<EOS>
London
north
of
the
Thames
is
destined
to
be
the
scene
of
the
fiercest
and
most
bloody
warfare
ever
known
in
the
history
of
the
civilised
world
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
will
,
of
course
,
fight
for
their
lives
,
while
we
shall
fight
for
our
homes
and
for
our
liberty
.
<EOS>
But
right
is
on
our
side
,
and
right
will
win
.
 
<EOS>
"
Reports
from
all
over
the
metropolis
tell
the
same
tale
.
<EOS>
London
is
alert
and
impatient
.
<EOS>
At
a
word
she
will
rise
to
a
man
,
and
then
woe
betide
the
invader
!
<EOS>
Surely
Von
Kronhelm
's
position
is
not
a
very
enviable
one
.
<EOS>
Our
two
censors
in
the
office
are
smoking
their
pipes
very
gravely
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
of
the
street
fighting
is
to
be
published
.
<EOS>
They
will
write
their
own
account
of
it

There
has
been
a
most
frightful
encounter
at
the
Oxford
Street
and
Tottenham
Court
Road
barricades
--
a
most
stubborn
resistance
and
gallant
defence
on
the
part

men

"
From
the
lips
of
one
of
our
correspondents
who
was
within
the
barricade
I
have
just
learned
the
details
.
<EOS>
It
appears
that
just
about
four
o'clock
General
Von
Wilberg
sent
from
the
City
a
large
force
of
the
19th
Division
under
Lieutenant
General
Frankenfeld
,
and
part
of
these
,
advancing
through
the
squares
of
Bloomsbury
into
Gower
Street
,
attacked
the
Defenders
'
position
from
the
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
while
others
coming
up
Holborn
and
New
Oxford
Street
entered
Soho
from
Charing
Cross
Road
and
threw
up
counter
-
barricades
at
the
end
of
Dean
Street
,
Wardour
Street
,
Berwick
,
Poland
,
Argyll
,
and
the
other
streets
,
all
of
which
were
opposite
the
defences
of
the
populace
.
<EOS>
In
Great
Portland
Street
,
too
,
they
adopted
a
similar
line
,
and
without
much
ado
the
fight
,
commenced
in
a
desultory
fashion
,
soon
became
a
battle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Within
the
barricades
was
a
dense
body
of
armed
and
angry
citizens
,
each
with
his
little
badge
,
and
every
single
one
of
them
was
ready
to
fight
to
the
death
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
false
patriotism
now
,
no
mere
bravado
.
<EOS>
Men
make
declarations
,
and
carry
them
out
.
<EOS>
The
gallant
Londoners
,
with
their
several
Maxims
,
wrought
havoc
among
the
invaders
,
especially
in
the
Tottenham
Court
Road
,
where
hundreds
were
maimed
or
killed
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
Oxford
Street
,
the
enemy
being
under
cover
of
their
counter
-
barricades
,
little
damage
could
be
done
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
The
wide
,
open
,
deserted
thoroughfare
was
every
moment
swept
by
a
hail
of
bullets
,
but
no
one
was
injured
.
<EOS>
On
the
Great
Portland
Street
side
the
populace
made
a
feint
of
giving
way
at
the
Mortimer
Street
barricade
,
and
a
body
of
the
enemy
rushed
in
,
taking
the
obstruction
by
storm
.
<EOS>
But
next
moment
they
regretted
it
,
for
they
were
set
upon
by
a
thousand
armed
men
and
wild
haired
women
,
so
that
<EOS>
every
man
paid
for
his
courage
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
women
,
seizing
the
weapons
and
ammunition
of
the
dead
Germans
,
now
returned
to
the
barricade
to
use
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Mortimer
Street
defences
were
at
once
repaired
,
and
it
was
resolved
to
relay
the
fatal
trap
at
some
other
point
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
repeated
at
the
end
of
Percy
Street
,
where
about
fifty
more
Germans
,
who
thought
themselves
victorious
,
were
set
upon
and
exterminated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Until
dusk
the
fight
lasted
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
,
finding
their
attack
futile
,
began
to
hurl
petrol
bombs
over
the
barricades
and
these
caused
frightful
destruction
among
our
gallant
men
,
several
houses
in
the
vicinity
being
set
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
there
was
still
water
in
the
street
hydrants
,
and
two
fire
engines
had
already
been
brought
within
the
beleaguered
area
in
case
of
necessity
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
last
,
about
seven
o'clock
,
the
enemy
,
having
lost
very
heavily
in
attempting
to
take
the
well
-
chosen
position
by
storm
,
brought
down
several
light
field
-
guns
from
Regent
's
Park
;
and
,
placing
them
at
their
counter
-
barricades
--
where
,
by
the
way
,
they
had
lost
many
men
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
conflict
while
piling
up
their
shelters
--
suddenly
opened
fire
with
shell
at
the
huge
obstructions
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
first
they
made
but
little
impression
upon
the
flagstones
,
etc
.
,
of
which
the
barricades
were
mainly
composed
.
<EOS>
But
before
long
their
bombardment
began
to
tell
;
for
slowly
,
here
and
there
,
exploding
shells
made
great
breaches
in
the
defences
that
had
been
so
heroically
manned
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
a
high
explosive
shell
burst
right
among
the
crowd
of
riflemen
behind
a
barricade
,
sweeping
dozens
into
eternity
in
a
single
instant
.
<EOS>
Against
the
fortified
houses
each
side
of
the
barricades
the
German
artillery
trained
their
guns
,
and
very
quickly
reduced
many
of
those
buildings
to
ruins
.
<EOS>
The
air
now
became
thick
with
dust
and
smoke
;
and
mingled
with
the
roar
of
artillery
at
such
close
quarters
came
the
screams
of
the
injured
and
the
groans
of
the
dying
.
<EOS>
The
picture
drawn
by
the
eye
-
witness
who
described
this
was
a
truly
appalling
one
.
<EOS>
Gradually
the
Londoners
were
being
overwhelmed
,
but
they
were
selling
their
lives
dearly
,
fully
proving
themselves
worthy
sons
of
grand
old
England
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
last
the
fire
from
the
Newman
Street
barricade
of
the
Defenders
was
silenced
,
and
ten
minutes
later
,
a
rush
being
made
across
from
Dean
Street
,
it
was
taken
by
storm
.
<EOS>
Then
ensued
fierce
and
bloody
hand
-
to
-
hand
fighting
right
up
to
Cleveland
Street
,
while
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
enemy
broke
in
from
Great
Portland
Street
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
scene
followed
that
is
impossible
to
describe
.
<EOS>
Through
all
those
narrow
,
crooked
streets
the
fighting
became
general
,
and
on
either
side
hundreds
fell
.
<EOS>
The
Defenders
in
places
cornered
the
Germans
,
cut
them
off
,
and
killed
them
.
<EOS>
Though
it
was
felt
that
now
the
barricades
had
been
broken
the
day
was
lost
,
yet
every
man
kept
courage
,
and
fought
with
all
his
strength
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
half
an
hour
the
Germans
met
with
no
success
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
they
found
themselves
entrapped
amid
thousands
of
furious
citizens
,
all
wearing
their
silken
badges
,
and
all
sworn
to
fight
to
the
death
.
 
<EOS>
"
While
the
Defenders
still
struggled
on
,
loud
and
ringing
cheers
were
suddenly
raised
from
Tottenham
Court
Road
.
<EOS>
The
people
from
Clerkenwell
,
joined
by
those
in
Bloomsbury
,
had
arrived
to
assist
them
.
<EOS>
They
had
risen
,
and
were
attacking
the
Germans
in
the
rear
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fighting
was
now
general
right
across
from
Tottenham
Court
Road
to
Gray
's
Inn
Road
,
and
by
nine
o'clock
,
though
Von
Wilberg
sent
reinforcements
,
a
victory
was
gained
by
the
Defenders
.
<EOS>
Over
two
thousand
Germans
are
lying
dead
and
wounded
about
the
streets
and
squares
of
Bloomsbury

Marylebone

Through

there
were
desultory
conflicts

Reports
reaching

to

day
from
Lord
Byfield
's
headquarters
at
Windsor
are
numerous
,
but
conflicting
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
can
be
gathered
,
the
authentic
facts
are
as
follows
:
<EOS>
Great
bodies
of
the
Defenders
,
including
many
women
,
all
armed
,
are
massing
at
Reading
,
Sonning
,
Wokingham
,
and
Maidenhead
.
<EOS>
Thousands
have
arrived
,
and
are
hourly
arriving
by
train
,
from
Portsmouth
,
Plymouth
,
Exeter
,
Bristol
,
Gloucester
,
and
,
in
fact
,
all
the
chief
centres
of
the
West
of
England
,
where
Gerald
Graham
's
campaign
has
been
so
marvellously
successful
.
<EOS>
Sturdy
Welsh
colliers
are
marching
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
agricultural
labourers
from
Dorset
and
Devon
,
and
clerks
and
citizens
from
the
towns
of
Somerset
,
Cornwall
,
Gloucestershire
,
and
Oxfordshire
are
taking
arms
beside
the
riff
-
raff
of
their
own
neighbourhoods
.
<EOS>
Peer
and
peasant
,
professional
man
and
pauper
<EOS>
,
all
are
now
united
with
one
common
object
--
to
drive
back
the
invader
,
and
to
save
our
dear
old
England
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oxford
has
,
it
seems
,
been
one
of
the
chief
points
of
concentration
,
and
the
undergraduates
who
re
-
assembled
there
to
defend
their
colleges
now
form
an
advance
-
guard
of
a
huge
body
of
Defenders
on
the
march
,
by
way
of
Henley
and
Maidenhead
,
to
follow
in
the
rear
of
Lord
Byfield
.
<EOS>
The
latter
holds
Eton
and
the
country
across
to
High
Wycombe
,
while
the
Saxon
headquarters
are
still
at
Staines

are
holding
the
country
across
from
Pinner
through
Stanmore
and
Chipping
Barnet
to
the
prison
camp
at
Enfield
Chase
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
only
German
troops
outside
West
London
,
the
Saxons
being
now
barred
from
entering
by
the
huge
barricades
which
the
populace
of
West
London
have
during
the
past
few
days
been
constructing
.
<EOS>
Every
road
leading
into
London
from
West
Middlesex
is
now
either
strongly
barricaded
or
entirely
blocked
up
.
<EOS>
Kew
,
Richmond
,
and
Kingston
Bridges
have
been
destroyed
,
and
Lord
Byfield
,
with
General
Bamford
at
the
Crystal
Palace
,
remains
practically
in
possession
of
the
whole
of
the
south
of
the
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
conflict
which
is
now
about
to
begin
will
be
one
to
the
death
.
<EOS>
While
,
on
the
one
hand
,
the
Germans
are
bottled
up
among
us
,
the
fact
must
not
be
overlooked
that
their
arms
are
superior
,
and
that
they
are
trained
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
two
or
three
local
risings
of
yesterday
and
the
day
previous
have
given
us
courage
,
for
they
show
that
the
enemy
can
not
manoeuvre
in
the
narrow
streets
,
and
soon
become
demoralised
.
<EOS>
In
London
we
fail
because
we
have
so
few
riflemen
.
<EOS>
If
every
man
who
now
carries
a
gun
could
shoot
,
we
could
compel
the
Germans
to
fly
a
flag
of
truce
within
twenty
-
four
hours
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
if
Lord
Roberts
'
scheme
of
universal
training
in
1906
had
been
adopted
,
the
enemy
would
certainly
never
have
been
suffered
to
approach
our
capital
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
apathy
has
resulted
in
this
terrible
and
crushing
disaster
,
and
we
have
only
now
to
bear
our
part
,
each
one
of
us
,
in
the
blow
to
avenge
this
desecration
of
our
homes
and
the
massacre
of
our
loved
ones

To

day
I
have
seen
the
white
banners
with
the
red
cross
--
the
ensign
of
the
Defenders
--
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Till
yesterday
it
was
not
openly
displayed
,
but
to
-
day
it
is
actually
hung
from
windows
or
flown
defiantly
from
flagstaffs
in
full
view
of
the
Germans

In
Kilburn
,
or
,
to
be
more
exact
,
in
the
district
lying
between
the
Harrow
Road
and
the
High
Road
,
Kilburn
,
there
was
another
conflict
this
morning
between
some
of
the
German
Garde
Corps
and
the
populace
.
<EOS>
The
outbreak
commenced
by
the
arrest
of
some
men
who
were
found
practising
with
rifles
in
Paddington
Recreation
Ground
.
<EOS>
One
man
who
resisted
was
shot
on
the
spot
,
whereupon
the
crowd
who
assembled
attacked
the
German
picket
,
and
eventually
killed
them
to
a
man
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
signal
for
a
general
outbreak
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
half
an
hour
later
,
when
a
force
was
sent
to
quell
the
revolt
,
fierce
fighting
became
general
all
through
the
narrow
streets
of
Kensal
Green
,
especially
at
the
big
barricade
that
blocks
the
Harrow
Road
where
it
is
joined
by
Admiral
Road
.
<EOS>
Here
the
bridges
over
the
Grand
Junction
Canal
have
already
been
destroyed
,
for
the
barricades
and
defences
have
been
scientifically
constructed
under
the
instruction
of
military
engineers
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
an
early
hour
to
-
day
it
has
been
apparent
that
all
these
risings
were
purposely
ordered
by
the
League
of
Defenders
to
cause
Von
Kronhelm
's
confusion
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
while
the
outbreak
at
Kensal
Green
was
in
progress
,
we
had
another
reported
from
Dalston
,
a
third
from
Limehouse
,
and
a
fourth
from
Homerton
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
various
centres
of
the
League
are
acting
in
unison
upon
secret
orders
from
headquarters
.
 
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
South
London
also
took
part
in
the
fray
this
morning
,
for
the
Defenders
at
the
barricade
at
London
Bridge
have
now
mounted
several
field
guns
,
and
have
started
shelling
Von
Wilberg
's
position
in
the
City
.
<EOS>
It
is
said
that
the
Mansion
House
,
where
the
General
had
usurped
the
apartments
of
the
deported
Lord
Mayor
,
has
already
been
half
reduced
to
ruins
.
<EOS>
This
action
is
,
no
doubt
,
only
to
harass
the
enemy
,
for
surely
General
Bamford
has
no
desire
to
destroy
the
City
proper
any
more
than
it
has
already
been
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Lower
Thames
Street
,
King
William
Street
,
Gracechurch
Street
,
and
Cannon
Street
have
at
any
rate
,
been
found
untenable
by
the
enemy
,
upon
whom
some
losses
have
been
inflicted
.

South
London
is
every
moment
anxious
to
know
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Two
days
after
the
bombardment
we
succeeded
at
night
in
sinking
a
light
telegraph
cable
in
the
river
across
from
the
Embankment
at
the
bottom
of
Temple
Avenue
,
and
are
in
communication
with
our
temporary
office
in
Southwark
Street
.
 
<EOS>
"
An
hour
ago
there
came
,
through
secret
sources
,
information
of
another
naval
victory
to
our
credit
,
several
German
warships
being
sunk
and
captured
.
<EOS>
Here
we
dare
not
print
it
,
so
I
have
just
wired
it
across
to
the
other
side
,
where
they
are
issuing
a
special
edition
.
 
<EOS>
"
Almost
simultaneously
with
the
report
of
the
British
victory
,
namely
,
at
five
o'clock
,
the
truth
--
the
great
and
all
-
important
truth
--
became
revealed
.
<EOS>
The
mandate
has
gone
forth
from
the
headquarters
of
the
League
of
Defenders
that
London
is
to
rise
in
her
might
at
ten
o'clock
to
-
night
,
and
that
a
million
men
are
ready
to
assist
us
.
<EOS>
Placards
and
bills
on
red
paper
are
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
"
Frantic
efforts
are
being
made
by
the
Germans
all
over
London
to
suppress
both
posters
and
handbills
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
now
six
o'clock
.
<EOS>
In
four
hours
it
is
believed
that
London
will
be
one
huge
seething
conflict
.
<EOS>
Night
has
been
chosen
,
I
suppose
,
in
order
to
give
the
populace
the
advantage
.
<EOS>
The
by
-
streets
are
for
the
most
part
still
unlit
,
save
for
oil
-
lamps
,
for
neither
gas
nor
electric
light
are
yet
in
proper
working
order
after
the
terrible
dislocation
of
everything
.
<EOS>
The
scheme
of
the
Defenders
is
,
as
already
proved
,
to
lure
the
Germans
into
the
narrower
thoroughfares
,
and
then
exterminate
them
.
<EOS>
Surely
in
the
history
of
the
world
there
has
never
been
such
a
bitter
vengeance
as
that
which
is
now
inevitable
.
<EOS>
London
,
the
greatest
city
ever
known
,
is
about
to
rise
!
     
<EOS>
"
_
Midnight
.
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
"
London
has
risen
!
<EOS>
How
can
I
describe
the
awful
scenes
of
panic
,
bloodshed
,
patriotism
,
brutality
,
and
vengeance
that
are
at
this
moment
in
progress
?
<EOS>
As
I
write
,
through
the
open
window
I
can
hear
the
roar
of
voices
,
the
continual
crackling
of
rifles
,
and
the
heavy
booming
of
guns
.
<EOS>
I
walked
along
Fleet
Street
at
nine
o'clock
,
and
I
found
,
utterly
disregarding
the
order
that
no
unauthorised
persons
are
to
be
abroad
after
nightfall
,
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
all
classes
,
all
wearing
their
little
silk
Union
Jack
badges
pinned
to
their
coats
,
on
the
way
to
join
in
their
particular
districts
.
<EOS>
Some
carried
rifles
,
others
revolvers
,
while
others
were
unarmed
.
<EOS>
Yet
not
a
German
did
I
see
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
though
,
for
the
moment
,
the
enemy
had
vanished
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
the
strong
cordon
across
the
bottom
of
Ludgate
Hill
,
men
who
looked
on
in
wonder
,
but
without
bestirring
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible
that
Von
Kronhelm
's
strategy
is
to
remain
inactive
,
and
refuse
to
fight
?
 
<EOS>
"
The
first
shot
I
heard
fired
,
just
after
ten
o'clock
,
was
at
the
Strand
end
of
Fleet
Street
,
at
the
corner
of
Chancery
Lane
.
<EOS>
There
,
I
afterwards
discovered
,
a
party
of
forty
German
infantrymen
had
been
attacked
,
and
all
of
them
killed
.
<EOS>
Quickly
following
this
,
I
heard
the
distant
booming
of
artillery
,
and
then
the
rattle
of
musketry
and
pom
-
poms
became
general
,
but
not
in
the
neighbourhood
where
I
was
.
<EOS>
For
nearly
half
an
hour
I
remained
at
the
corner
of
Aldwych
;
then
,
on
going
farther
along
the
Strand
,
I
found
that
the
defenders
from
the
Waterloo
Road
had
made
a
wild
sortie
into
the
Strand
,
but
could
find
no
Germans
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
men
who
had
for
a
fortnight
held
that
barricade
at
the
bridge
were
more
like
demons
than
human
beings
;
therefore
I
retired
,
and
in
the
crush
made
my
way
back
to
the
office
to
await
reports
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
not
long
in
arriving
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
give
a
very
brief
_
resume
_
at
the
moment
,
for
they
are
so
numerous
as
to
be
bewildering
.
 
<EOS>
"
Speaking
generally
,
the
whole
of
London
has
obeyed
the
mandate
of
the
League
,
and
,
rising
,
are
attacking
the
Germans
at
every
point
.
<EOS>
In
the
majority
of
cases
,
however
,
the
enemy
hold
strong
positions
,
and
are
defending
themselves
,
inflicting
terrible
losses
upon
the
unorganised
populace
.
<EOS>
Every
Londoner
is
fighting
for
himself
,
without
regard
for
orders
or
consequences
.
<EOS>
In
Bethnal
Green
the
Germans
,
lured
into
the
maze
of
by
-
streets
,
have
suffered
great
losses
,
and
again
in
Clerkenwell
,
St.
Luke
's
,
Kingsland
,
Hackney
and
Old
Ford
.
<EOS>
Whitechapel
too
,
devoid
of
its
alien
population
,
who
have
escaped
into
Essex
,
has
held
its
own
,
and
the
enemy
have
had
some
great
losses
in
the
streets
off
Cable
and
Leman
Streets
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
the
exception
of
the
sortie
across
Waterloo
Bridge
,
South
London
is
,
as
yet
,
remaining
in
patience
,
acting
under
the
orders
of
General
Bamford
.
 
<EOS>
"
News
has
come
in
ten
minutes
ago
of
a
fierce
and
sudden
attack
upon
the
Saxons
by
Lord
Byfield
from
Windsor
,
but
there
are
,
as
yet
,
no
details
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
the
office
across
the
river
I
am
being
constantly
asked
for
details
of
the
fight
,
and
how
it
is
progressing
.
<EOS>
In
Southwark
the
excitement
is
evidently
most
intense
,
and
it
requires
all
the
energy
of
the
local
commanders
of
the
Defenders
to
repress
another
sortie
across
that
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
has
just
occurred
an
explosion
so
terrific
that
the
whole
of

has
been
shaken
as

by
an
earthquake

first
blow

CHAPTER
II

<EOS>
SCENES
AT
WATERLOO
BRIDGE
.
  
<EOS>
The
following
is
the
personal
narrative
of
a
young
chauffeur
named
John
Burgess
,
who
assisted
in
the
defence
of
the
barricade
at
Waterloo
Bridge
.
 
<EOS>
The
statement
was
made
to
a
reporter
at
noon
on
October
5
,
while
he
was
lying
on
a
mattress
in
the
Church
of
St.
Martin's
-
in
-
the
-
Fields
,
so
badly
wounded
in
the
chest
that
the
surgeons
had
given
him
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
related
his
story
in
the
form
of
a
farewell
letter
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
The
reporter
chanced
to
be
passing
,
and
,
hearing
him
asking
for
some
one
to
write
for
him
,
volunteered
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
all
did
our
best
,
"
he
said
,
"
every
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
Myself
,
I
was
at
the
barricade
for
thirteen
days
--
thirteen
days
of
semi
-
starvation
,
sleeplessness
,
and
constant
tension
,
for
we
knew
not
,
from
one
moment
to
another
,
when
a
sudden
attack
might
be
made
upon
us
.
<EOS>
At
first
our
obstruction
was
a
mere
ill
-
built
pile
of
miscellaneous
articles
,
half
of
which
would
not
stop
bullets
;
but
on
the
third
day
our
men
,
superintended
by
several
non
-
commissioned
officers
in
uniform
,
began
to
put
the
position
in
a
proper
state
of
defence
,
to
mount
Maxims
in
the
neighbouring
houses
,
and
to
place
explosives
in
the
crown
of
two
of
the
arches
of
the
bridge
,
so
that
we
could
instantly
demolish
it
if
necessity
arose
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fully
a
thousand
men
were
holding
the
position
,
but
unfortunately
few
of
them
had
ever
handled
a
rifle
.
<EOS>
As
regards
myself
,
I
had
learned
to
shoot
rooks
when
a
boy
in
Shropshire
,
and
now
that
I
had
obtained
a
gun
I
was
anxious
to
try
my
skill
.
<EOS>
When
the
League
of
Defenders
was
started
,
and
a
local
secretary
came
to
us
,
we
all
eagerly
joined
,
each
receiving
,
after
he
had
taken
his
oath
and
signed
his
name
,
a
small
silk
Union
Jack
,
the
badge
of
the
League
,
not
to
be
worn
till
the
word
went
forth
to
rise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
came
a
period
--
long
,
dreary
,
shadeless
days
of
waiting
--
when
the
sun
beat
down
upon
us
mercilessly
and
our
vigilance
was
required
to
be
constant
both
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
So
uncertain
were
the
movements
of
the
enemy
opposite
us
that
we
scarcely
dared
to
leave
our
positions
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Night
after
night
I
spent
sleeping
in
a
neighbouring
doorway
,
with
an
occasional
stretch
upon
somebody
's
bed
in
some
house
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
,
whenever
we
saw
Germans
moving
in
Wellington
Street
,
we
sent
a
volley
into
them
,
in
return
receiving
a
sharp
reply
from
their
pom
-
poms
.
<EOS>
Constantly
our
sentries
were
on
the
alert
along
the
wharves
,
and
in
the
riverside
warehouses
,
watching
for
the
approach
of
the
enemy
's
spies
in
boats
.
<EOS>
Almost
nightly
some
adventurous
spirits
among
the
Germans
would
try
and
cross
.
<EOS>
On
one
occasion
,
while
doing
sentry
duty
in
a
warehouse
backing
on
Commercial
Road
,
I
was
sitting
with
a
comrade
at
a
window
overlooking
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
moon
was
shining
,
for
the
night
was
a
balmy
and
beautiful
one
,
and
all
was
quiet
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
as
we
sat
smoking
our
pipes
,
with
our
eyes
fixed
upon
the
glittering
water
,
we
suddenly
saw
a
small
boat
containing
three
men
stealing
slowly
along
in
the
shadow
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
a
moment
the
rowers
rested
upon
their
oars
,
as
if
undecided
,
then
pulled
forward
again
in
search
of
a
landing
-
place
.
<EOS>
As
they
passed
below
our
window
I
shouted
a
challenge
.
<EOS>
At
first
there
was
no
response
.
<EOS>
Again
I
repeated
it
,
when
I
heard
a
muttered
imprecation
in
German
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Spies
!
'
<EOS>
I
cried
to
my
comrade
,
and
with
one
accord
we
raised
our
rifles
and
fired
.
<EOS>
Ere
the
echo
of
the
first
shot
had
died
away
<EOS>
I
saw
one
man
fall
into
the
water
,
while
at
the
next
shot
a
second
man
half
rose
from
his
seat
,
threw
up
his
hands
,
and
staggered
back
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
firing
gave
the
alarm
at
the
barricade
,
and
ere
the
boat
could
approach
the
bridge
,
though
the
survivor
pulled
for
dear
life
,
a
Maxim
spat
forth
its
red
fire
,
and
both
boat
and
oarsman
were
literally
riddled
.
 
<EOS>
"
Almost
every
night
similar
incidents
were
reported
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
were
doing
all
in
their
power
to
learn
the
exact
strength
of
our
defences
,
but
I
do
not
think
their
efforts
were
very
successful
.
<EOS>
The
surface
of
the
river
,
every
inch
of
it
,
was
under
the
careful
scrutiny
of
a
thousand
watchful
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
Each
day
the
'
Bulletin
'
of
our
national
association
brought
us
tidings
of
what
was
happening
outside
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
last
,
however
,
the
welcome
word
came
to
us
on
the
morning
of
October
4
,
that
at
ten
that
night
we
were
to
make
a
concerted
attack
upon
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
A
scarlet
bill
was
thrust
into
my
hand
,
and
as
soon
as
the
report
was
known
we
were
all
highly
excited
,
and
through
the
day
prepared
ourselves
for
the
struggle
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
gun
sounded
from
the
direction
of
Westminster
.
<EOS>
We
looked
at
our
watches
,
and
found
it
was
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Our
bugles
sounded
and
we
sprang
to
our
positions
,
as
we
had
done
dozens
,
nay
,
hundreds
of
times
before
.
<EOS>
I
felt
faint
,
for
I
had
only
had
half
a
pint
of
weak
soup
all
day
,
for
the
bread
did
not
go
round
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
knowledge
that
we
were
about
to
strike
the
blow
inspired
me
with
fresh
life
and
strength
.
<EOS>
Our
officer
shouted
a
brief
word
of
command
,
and
next
moment
we
opened
a
withering
fire
upon
the
enemy
's
barricade
in
Wellington
Street
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
a
moment
a
hundred
rifles
and
several
Maxims
spat
their
red
fire
at
us
,
but
as
usual
the
bullets
flattened
themselves
harmlessly
before
us
.
<EOS>
Then
the
battery
of
artillery
which
Sir
Francis
Bamford
had
sent
us
three
days
before
got
into
position
,
and
in
a
few
moments
began
hurling
great
shells
upon
the
German
defences
.
 
<EOS>
"
Behind
us
was
a
great
armed
multitude
ready
and
eager
to
get
at
the
foe
,
a
huge
,
unorganised
body
of
fierce
,
irate
Londoners
,
determined
upon
having
blood
for
blood
.
<EOS>
From
over
the
river
the
sound
of
battle
was
rising
,
a
great
roaring
like
the
sound
of
a
distant
sea
,
with
ever
and
anon
the
crackling
of
rifles
and
the
boom
of
guns
,
while
above
the
night
sky
grew
a
dark
blood
-
red
with
the
glare
of
a
distant
conflagration
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
half
an
hour
we
pounded
away
at
the
barricade
in
Wellington
Street
with
our
siege
guns
,
Maxims
,
and
rifles
,
until
a
well
-
directed
shell
exploded
beneath
the
centre
of
the
obstruction
,
blowing
open
a
great
gap
and
sending
fragments
high
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
Then
it
seemed
that
all
resistance
suddenly
ceased
.
<EOS>
At
first
we
were
surprised
at
this
;
but
on
further
scrutiny
we
found
that
it
was
not
our
fire
that
had
routed
the
enemy
,
but
that
they
were
being
attacked
in
their
rear
by
hosts
of
armed
citizens
surging
down
from
Kingsway
and
the
Strand
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
could
plainly
discern
that
the
Germans
were
fighting
for
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Into
the
midst
of
them
we
sent
one
or
two
shells
;
but
fearing
to
cause
casualties
among
our
own
comrades
,
we
were
compelled
to
cease
firing
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
armed
crowd
behind
us
,
finding
that
we
were
again
inactive
,
<EOS>
at
once
demanded
that
our
barricade
should
be
opened
,
so
that
they
might
cross
the
bridge
and
assist
their
comrades
by
taking
the
Germans
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
For
ten
minutes
our
officer
in
charge
refused
,
for
the
order
of
General
Greatorex
,
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
of
the
League
,
was
that
no
sortie
was
to
be
made
at
present
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
South
Londoners
became
so
infuriated
that
our
commander
was
absolutely
forced
to
give
way
,
though
he
knew
not
into
what
trap
we
might
fall
,
as
he
had
no
idea
of
the
strength
of
the
enemy
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
A
way
was
quickly
opened
in
the
obstruction
,
and
two
minutes
later
we
were
pouring
across
Waterloo
Bridge
in
thousands
,
shouting
and
yelling
in
triumph
as
we
passed
the
ruins
of
the
enemy
's
barricade
,
and
fell
upon
him
with
merciless
revenge
.
<EOS>
With
us
were
many
women
,
who
were
,
perhaps
,
fiercer
and
more
unrelenting
than
the
men
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
many
a
woman
that
night
killed
a
German
with
her
own
hands
,
firing
revolvers
in
their
faces
,
striking
with
knives
,
or
even
blinding
them
with
vitriol
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
scene
was
both
exciting
and
ghastly
.
<EOS>
At
the
spot
where
I
first
fought
--
on
the
pavement
outside
the
Savoy
--
we
simply
slaughtered
the
Germans
in
cold
blood
.
<EOS>
Men
cried
for
mercy
,
but
we
gave
them
no
quarter
.
<EOS>
London
had
risen
in
its
might
,
and
as
our
comrades
fought
all
along
the
Strand
and
around
Aldwych
,
we
gradually
exterminated
every
man
in
German
uniform
.
<EOS>
Soon
the
roadways
of
the
Strand
,
Wellington
Street
,
Aldwych
,
Burleigh
Street
,
Southampton
Street
,
Bedford
Street
,
and
right
along
to
Trafalgar
Square
,
were
covered
with
dead
and
dying
.
<EOS>
The
wounded
of
both
nationalities
were
trodden
underfoot
and
killed
by
the
swaying
,
struggling
thousands
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
loss
must
have
been
severe
in
our
particular
quarter
,
for
of
the
great
body
of
men
from
Hamburg
and
Luebeck
holding
their
end
of
Waterloo
Bridge
<EOS>
I
do
not
believe
a
single
one
was
spared
,
even
though
they
fought
for
their
lives
like
veritable
devils
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
success
intoxicated
us
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
That
we
were
victorious
at
that
point
can
not
be
doubted
,
but
with
foolish
disregard
for
our
own
safety
,
we
pressed
forward
into
Trafalgar
Square
,
in
the
belief
that
our
comrades
were
similarly
making
an
attack
upon
the
enemy
there
.
<EOS>
The
error
was
,
alas
!
<EOS>
a
fatal
one
for
many
of
us
.
<EOS>
To
fight
an
organised
force
in
narrow
streets
is
one
thing
,
but
to
meet
him
in
a
large
open
space
with
many
inlets
,
like
Trafalgar
Square
,
is
another
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
enemy
were
no
doubt
awaiting
us
,
for
as
we
poured
out
from
the
Strand
at
Charing
Cross
we
were
met
with
a
devastating
fire
from
German
Maxims
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
.
<EOS>
They
were
holding
Whitehall
--
to
protect
Von
Kronhelm
's
headquarters
--
the
entrances
to
Spring
Gardens
,
Cockspur
Street
,
and
Pall
Mall
East
,
and
their
fire
was
converged
upon
the
great
armed
multitude
which
,
being
pressed
on
from
behind
,
came
out
into
the
open
square
only
to
fall
in
heaps
beneath
the
sweeping
hail
of
German
lead
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
error
was
one
that
could
not
be
rectified
.
<EOS>
We
all
saw
it
when
too
late
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
turning
back
now
,
I
struggled
to
get
into
the
small
side
-
street
that
runs
down
by
the
bar
of
the
Grand
Hotel
,
but
it
was
blocked
with
people
already
in
refuge
there
.
 
<EOS>
"
Another
instant
and
<EOS>
I
was
lifted
from
my
legs
by
the
great
throng
going
to
their
doom
,
and
carried
right
in
the
forefront
to
the
square
.
<EOS>
Women
screamed
when
they
found
themselves
facing
the
enemy
's
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
scene
was
awful
--
a
massacre
,
nothing
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
For
every
German
's
life
we
had
taken
,
a
dozen
of
our
own
were
now
being
sacrificed
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
woman
was
pushed
close
to
me
,
her
grey
hair
streaming
down
her
back
,
her
eyes
starting
wildly
from
her
head
,
her
bony
hands
smeared
with
blood
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
she
realised
that
right
before
her
red
fire
was
spitting
from
the
German
guns
.
 
<EOS>
"
Screaming
in
despair
,
she
clung
frantically
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
felt
next
second
a
sharp
burning
pain
in
my
chest
....
<EOS>
We
fell
forward
together
upon
the
bodies
of
our
comrades
....
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
myself
I
found
myself
here
,
in
this
church
,
close
to
where
I
fell

was
received
on
the

of

,
but
was
not

some

which

being

"
WILLESDEN

<EOS>
_

(
Evening
)
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
a
bloody
but
successful
combat
lasting
from
early
dawn
till
late
in
the
afternoon
,
the
country
to
the
immediate
west
of
the
metropolis
has
been
swept
clear
of
the
hated
invaders
,
and
the
masses
of
the
'
League
of
Defenders
'
can
be
poured
into
the
West
of
London
without
let
or
hindrance
.
<EOS>
In
the
desperate
street
fighting
which
is
now
going
on
they
will
be
much
more
formidable
than
they
were
ever
likely
to
be
in
the
open
field
,
where
they
were
absolutely
incapable
of
manoeuvring
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
Saxons
--
what
is
left
of
them
--
and
Froelich
's
Cavalry
Division
,
with
whom
we
have
been
engaged
all
day
,
they
have
now
fallen
back
on
Harrow
and
Hendon
,
it
is
said
;
but
it
is
currently
reported
that
a
constant
movement
towards
the
high
ground
near
Hampstead
is
going
on
.
<EOS>
These
rumours
come
by
way
of
London
,
since
the
enemy
's
enormous
force
of
cavalry
is
still
strong
enough
to
prevent
us
getting
any
first
-
hand
intelligence
of
his
movements
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
has
been
previously
reported
,
the
XIIth
Saxon
Corps
,
under
the
command
of
Prince
Henry
of
Wuertemberg
,
had
taken
up
a
position
intended
to
cover
the
metropolis
from
the
hordes
of
'
Defenders
'
which
,
supported
by
a
small
leaven
of
Regulars
,
with
a
proportion
of
cavalry
and
guns
,
were
known
to
be
slowly
rolling
up
from
the
west
and
south
.
<EOS>
Their
front
,
facing
west
,
extended
from
Staines
on
the
south
,
to
Pinner
on
the
north
,
passing
through
Stanwell
,
West
Drayton
,
and
Uxbridge
.
<EOS>
In
addition
they
had
a
strong
reserve
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Hounslow
,
whose
business
it
was
to
cover
their
left
flank
by
keeping
watch
along
the
line
of
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
They
had
destroyed
all
bridges
over
the
river
between
Staines
and
Hammersmith
.
<EOS>
Putney
Bridge
,
however
,
was
still
intact
,
as
all
attacks
on
it
had
been
repulsed
by
the
British
holding
it
on
the
south
side
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
general
state
of
affairs
<EOS>
when
Lord
Byfield
,
who
had
established
his
headquarters
at
Windsor
,
formed
his
plan
of
attack
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
I
have
been
able
to
ascertain
,
its
general
idea
was
to
hold
the
Saxons
to
their
position
by
the
threat
of
300,000
Defenders
that
were
assembled
and
were
continually
increasing
along
a
roughly
parallel
line
to
that
occupied
by
the
enemy
at
about
ten
miles
'
distance
from
it
,
while
he
attacked
their
left
flank
with
what
Regular
and
Militia
regiments
he
could
rapidly
get
together
near
Esher
and
Kingston
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
southern
lines
in
the
neighbourhood
of
London
were
all
in
working
order
,
the
damage
that
had
been
done
here
and
there
by
small
parties
of
the
enemy
who
had
made
raids
across
the
river
having
been
repaired
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
therefore
,
not
a
very
difficult
matter
to
assemble
troops
from
Windsor
and
various
points
on
the
South
of
London
at
very
short
notice
.
 
<EOS>
"
General
Bamford
,
to
whom
had
been
entrusted
the
defence
of
South
London
,
and
who
had
established
his
headquarters
at
the
Crystal
Palace
,
also
contributed
every
man
he
could
spare
from
the
remnant
of
the
Regular
troops
under
his
command
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
considered
quite
safe
now
that
the
Germans
in
the
City
were
so
hardly
pressed
to
leave
the
defence
of
the
Thames
bridges
to
the
masses
of
Irregulars
who
had
all
along
formed
the
bulk
of
their
defenders
.
<EOS>
The
risk
that
Prince
Henry
of
Wuertemberg
would
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
,
and
by
a
sudden
forward
move
attack
and
scatter
the
inert
and
invertebrate
mass
of
'
Defenders
'
who
were
in
his
immediate
front
had
,
of
course
,
to
be
taken
;
but
it
was
considered
that
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
in
London
he
would
hardly
dare
to
increase
the
distance
between
the
Saxon
Corps
and
the
rest
of
the
German
Army
.
<EOS>
Events
proved
the
correctness
of
this
surmise
;
but
owing
to
unforeseen
circumstances
,
the
course
of
the
battle
was
somewhat
different
from
that
which
had
been
anticipated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Despite
the
vigilance
of
the
German
spies
our
plans
were
kept
secret
till
the
very
end
,
and
it
is
believed
that
the
great
convergence
of
Regular
troops
that
began
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
from
Windsor
and
from
along
the
line
occupied
by
the
Army
of
the
League
on
the
west
,
right
round
to
Greenwich
on
the
east
,
went
on
without
any
news
of
the
movement
being
carried
to
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
dawn
this
morning
every
unit
was
in
the
position
to
which
it
had
been
previously
detailed
,
and
,
everything
being
in
readiness
,
the
Royal
Engineers
began
to
throw
a
pontoon
bridge
over
the
Thames
at
the
point
where
it
makes
a
bend
to
the
south
just
above
the
site
of
Walton
Bridge
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
patrols
and
pickets
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
at
once
opened
a
heavy
fire
on
the
workers
,
but
it
was
beaten
down
by
that
which
was
poured
upon
them
from
the
houses
in
Walton
-
on
-
Thames
,
which
had
been
quietly
occupied
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
in
vain
tried
to
reinforce
them
,
but
in
order
to
do
this
their
troops
had
to
advance
into
a
narrow
peninsula
which
was
swept
by
a
cross
-
fire
of
shells
from
batteries
which
had
been
placed
in
position
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
for
this
very
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
seven
o'clock
the
bridge
was
completed
,
and
the
troops
were
beginning
to
cross
over
covered
by
the
fire
of
the
artillery
and
by
an
advance
guard
which
had
been
pushed
over
in
boats
.
<EOS>
Simultaneously
very
much
the
same
thing
had
been
going
on
at
Long
Ditton
,
and
fierce
fighting
was
going
on
in
the
avenues
and
gardens
<EOS>
round
Hampton
Court
.
<EOS>
Success
here
,
too
,
attended
the
British
arms
.
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
a
determined
attempt
to
cross
the
river
in
force
had
not
at
all
been
anticipated
by
the
Germans
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
credited
their
opponents
with
the
power
of
so
rapidly
assembling
an
army
and
assuming
an
effective
and
vigorous
offensive
so
soon
after
their
terrible
series
of
disasters
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
they
had
probably
looked
for
was
an
attempt
to
overwhelm
them
by
sheer
force
of
numbers
.
<EOS>
They
doubtless
calculated
that
Lord
Byfield
would
stiffen
his
flabby
masses
of
'
Defenders
'
with
what
trained
troops
he
could
muster
,
and
endeavour
to
attack
their
lines
along
their
whole
length
,
overlapping
them
on
the
flank
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
realised
that
to
do
this
he
would
have
to
sacrifice
his
men
in
thousands
upon
thousands
,
but
they
knew
that
to
do
so
would
be
his
only
possible
chance
of
success
in
this
eventuality
,
since
the
bulk
of
his
men
could
neither
manoeuvre
nor
deploy
.
<EOS>
Still
they
reckoned
that
in
the
desperate
situation
of
the
British
,
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
do
this
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
their
part
,
although
they
fully
realised
the
possibility
of
being
overwhelmed
by
such
tactics
,
they
felt
pretty
confident
that
,
posted
as
they
were
behind
a
perfect
network
of
small
rivers
and
streams
which
ran
down
to
join
the
Thames
,
they
would
at
least
succeed
in
beating
off
the
attack
with
heavy
loss
,
and
stood
no
bad
chance
of
turning
the
repulse
into
a
rout
by
skilful
use
of
Froelich
's
Cavalry
Division
,
which
would
be
irresistible
when
attacking
totally
untrained
troops
after
they
had
been
shattered
and
disorganised
by
artillery
fire
.
<EOS>
This
,
at
least
,
is
the
view
of
those
experts
with
whom
I
have
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
,
perhaps
,
tended
rather
to
confirm
them
in
their
theories
as
to
the
action
of
the
British
was
the
rifle
firing
that
went
on
along
the
whole
of
their
front
all
night
through
.
<EOS>
The
officers
in
charge
of
the
various
units
which
conglomerated
together
formed
the
forces
facing
the
Saxons
,
had
picked
out
the
few
men
under
their
command
who
really
had
some
little
idea
of
using
a
rifle
,
and
,
supplied
with
plenty
of
ammunition
,
had
sent
them
forward
in
numerous
small
parties
with
general
orders
to
approach
as
near
the
enemy
's
picket
line
as
possible
,
and
as
soon
as
fired
on
to
lie
down
and
open
fire
in
return
.
<EOS>
So
a
species
of
sniping
engagement
went
on
from
dark
to
dawn
.
<EOS>
Several
parties
got
captured
or
cut
up
by
the
German
outlying
troops
and
many
others
got
shot
by
neighbouring
parties
of
snipers
.
<EOS>
But
,
although
they
did
not
in
all
probability
do
the
enemy
much
damage
,
yet
they
kept
them
on
the
alert
all
night
,
and
led
them
to
expect
an
attack
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
One
way
and
another
luck
was
entirely
on
the
side
of
the
patriots
that
morning
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
daylight
came
the
British
massed
to
the
westward
of
Staines
<EOS>
had
such
a
threatening
appearance
from
their
immense
numbers
,
and
their
fire
from
their
batteries
of
heavy
guns
and
howitzers
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
,
which
took
the
German
left
flank
in
,
was
so
heavy
that
Prince
Henry
,
who
was
there
in
person
,
judged
an
attack
to
be
imminent
,
and
would
not
spare
a
man
to
reinforce
his
troops
at
Shepperton
and
Halliford
,
who
were
,
numerically
,
totally
inadequate
to
resist
the
advance
of
the
British
once
they
got
across
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
most
imploring
requests
for
assistance
,
but
ordered
the
officer
in
command
at
Hounslow
to
move
down
at
once
and
drive
the
British
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
So
it
has
been
reported
by
our
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Unluckily
for
him
this
officer
had
his
hands
quite
full
enough
at
this
time
;
for
the
British
,
who
had
crossed
at
Long
Ditton
,
had
now
made
themselves
masters
of
everything
east
of
the
Thames
Valley
branch
of
the
London
and
South
-
Western
Railway
,
were
being
continually
reinforced
,
and
were
fast
pushing
their
right
along
the
western
bank
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
"
Their
left
was
reported
to
be
at
Kempton
Park
,
where
they
joined
hands
with
those
who
had
effected
a
crossing
near
Walton
-
on
-
Thames
.
<EOS>
More
bridges
were
being
built
at
Platt
's
Eyot
,
Tagg
's
Eyot
,
and
Sunbury
Lock
,
while
boats
and
wherries
in
shoals
appeared
from
all
creeks
and
backwaters
and
hiding
-
places
as
soon
as
both
banks
were
in
the
hands
of
the
British
.
 
<EOS>
"
Regulars
,
Militia
,
and
,
lastly
,
Volunteers
,
were
now
pouring
across
in
thousands
.
<EOS>
Forward
was
still
the
word
.
<EOS>
About
noon
a
strong
force
of
Saxons
was
reported
to
be
retreating
along
the
road
from
Staines
to
Brentford
.
<EOS>
They
had
guns
with
them
,
which
engaged
the
field
batteries
which
were
at
once
pushed
forward
by
the
British
to
attack
them
.
<EOS>
These
troops
,
eventually
joining
hands
with
those
at
Hounslow
,
opposed
a
more
determined
resistance
to
our
advance
than
we
had
hitherto
encountered
.
 
<EOS>
"
According
to
what
we
learned
subsequently
from
prisoners
and
others
,
they
were
commanded
by
Prince
Henry
of
Wuertemberg
in
person
.
<EOS>
He
had
quitted
his
position
at
Staines
,
leaving
only
a
single
battalion
and
a
few
guns
as
a
rearguard
to
oppose
the
masses
of
the
'
Defenders
'
who
threatened
him
in
that
direction
,
and
had
placed
his
troops
in
the
best
position
he
could
to
cover
the
retreat
of
the
rest
of
his
corps
from
the
line
they
had
been
occupying
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
it
would
appear
,
soon
after
the
fighting
began
,
received
the
most
urgent
orders
from
Von
Kronhelm
to
fall
back
on
London
and
assist
him
in
the
street
fighting
that
had
now
been
going
on
without
intermission
for
the
best
part
of
two
days
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
probably
thought
that
he
would
be
able
to
draw
off
some
of
his
numerous
foes
to
the
westward
.
<EOS>
But
the
message
was
received
too
late
.
<EOS>
Prince
Henry
did
his
best
to
obey
it
,
but
by
this
time
the
very
existence
of
the
XIIth
Corps
was
at
stake
on
account
of
the
totally
unexpected
attack
on
his
left
rear
by
the
British
regular
troops
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
opposed
such
a
stout
resistance
with
the
troops
under
his
immediate
command
that
he
brought
the
British
advance
to
a
temporary
standstill
,
while
in
his
rear
every
road
leading
Londonward
was
crowded
with
the
rest
of
his
army
as
they
fell
back
from
West
Drayton
,
Uxbridge
,
Ruislip
and
Pinner
.
<EOS>
Had
they
been
facing
trained
soldiers
<EOS>
they
would
have
found
it
most
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
do
this
;
but
as
it
was
the
undisciplined
and
untrained
masses
of
the
League
of
Defenders
lost
a
long
time
in
advancing
,
and
still
longer
in
getting
over
a
series
of
streams
and
dykes
that
lay
between
them
and
the
abandoned
Saxon
position
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
lost
heavily
,
too
,
from
the
fire
of
the
small
rearguards
that
had
been
left
at
the
most
likely
crossing
-
places
.
<EOS>
The
Saxons
were
therefore
able
to
get
quite
well
away
from
them
,
and
when
some
attempt
was
being
made
to
form
up
the
thousands
of
men
who
presently
found
themselves
congregated
on
the
heath
east
of
Uxbridge
,
before
advancing
farther
,
a
whole
brigade
of
Froelich
's
heavy
cavalry
suddenly
swept
down
upon
them
from
behind
Ickenham
village
.
<EOS>
The
_
debacle
_
that
followed
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
The
unwieldy
mass
of
'
Leaguers
'
swayed
this
way
and
that
for
a
moment
in
the
panic
occasioned
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
the
serried
masses
of
charging
cavalry
that
were
rushing
down
on
them
with
a
thunder
of
hoofs
that
shook
the
earth
.
<EOS>
A
few
scattered
shots
were
fired
,
without
any
perceptible
effect
,
and
before
they
could
either
form
up
or
fly
the
German
Reiters
were
upon
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
perfect
massacre
.
<EOS>
The
'
Leaguers
'
could
oppose
no
resistance
whatever
.
<EOS>
They
were
ridden
down
and
slaughtered
with
no
more
difficulty
than
if
they
had
been
a
flock
of
sheep
.
<EOS>
Swinging
their
long
,
straight
swords
,
the
cavalrymen
cut
them
down
in
hundreds
and
drove
thousands
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
'
Defenders
'
were
absolutely
pulverised
and
fled
westwards
in
a
huge
scattered
crowd
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
Germans
had
the
satisfaction
of
scoring
a
local
victory
in
this
quarter
,
things
were
by
no
means
rosy
for
them
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Prince
Henry
,
by
desperate
efforts
,
contrived
to
hold
on
long
enough
in
his
covering
position
to
enable
the
Saxons
from
the
central
portion
of
his
abandoned
line
to
pass
through
Hounslow
and
move
along
the
London
road
,
through
Brentford
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
disaster
befell
them
.
<EOS>
A
battery
of
4.7
guns
was
suddenly
unmasked
on
Richmond
Hill
,
and
,
firing
at
a
range
of
5,000
yards
,
played
havoc
with
the
marching
column
.
<EOS>
The
head
of
it
also
suffered
severe
loss
from
riflemen
concealed
in
Kew
Gardens
,
and
the
whole
force
had
to
extend
and
fall
back
for
some
distance
in
a
northerly
direction
.
<EOS>
Near
Ealing
they
met
the
Uxbridge
brigade
,
and
a
certain
delay
and
confusion
occurred
.
<EOS>
However
,
trained
soldiers
such
as
these
are
not
difficult
to
reorganise
,
and
while
the
latter
continued
its
march
along
the
main
road
the
remainder
moved
in
several
small
parallel
columns
through
Acton
and
Turnham
Green
.
<EOS>
Before
another
half
-
hour
had
elapsed
there
came
a
sound
of
firing
from
the
advanced
guard
.
<EOS>
Orders
to
halt
followed
,
then
orders
to
send
forward
reinforcements
.
 
<EOS>
"
During
all
this
time
the
rattle
of
rifle
fire
waxed
heavier
and
heavier
.
<EOS>
It
soon
became
apparent
that
every
road
and
street
leading
into
London
was
barricaded
and
that
the
houses
on
either
side
were
crammed
with
riflemen
.
<EOS>
Before
any
set
plan
of
action
could
be
determined
on
,
the
retiring
Saxons
found
themselves
committed
to
a
very
nasty
bout
of
street
fighting
.
<EOS>
Their
guns
were
almost
useless
,
since
they
could
not
be
placed
in
positions
from
which
they
could
fire
on
the
barricades
except
so
close
as
to
be
under
effective
rifle
fire
.
<EOS>
They
made
several
desperate
assaults
,
most
of
which
were
repulsed
.
<EOS>
In
Goldhawk
Road
a
Jaegar
battalion
contrived
to
rush
a
big
rampart
of
paving
-
stones
which
had
been
improvised
by
the
British
;
but
,
once
over
,
they
were
decimated
by
the
fire
from
the
houses
on
either
side
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
Big
high
explosive
shells
from
Richmond
Hill
,
too
,
began
to
drop
among
the
Saxons
.
<EOS>
Though
the
range
was
long
,
the
gunners
were
evidently
well
informed
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
Saxon
troops
and
made
wonderfully
lucky
shooting
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
some
time
the
distant
rumble
of
the
firing
to
the
south
-
west
had
been
growing
more
distinct
in
their
ears
,
and
about
four
o'clock
<EOS>
it
suddenly
broke
out
comparatively
near
by
.
<EOS>
Then
came
an
order
from
Prince
Henry
to
fall
back
on
Ealing
at
once
.
<EOS>
What
had
happened
?
<EOS>
It
will
not
take
long
to
relate
this
.
<EOS>
Prince
Henry
's
covering
position
had
lain
roughly
between
East
Bedfont
and
Hounslow
,
facing
south
-
east
.
<EOS>
He
had
contrived
to
hold
on
to
the
latter
place
long
enough
to
allow
his
right
to
pivot
on
it
and
fall
back
to
Cranford
Bridge
.
<EOS>
Here
they
were
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
relieved
from
the
close
pressure
they
had
been
subjected
to
by
the
constantly
advancing
British
troops
,
by
the
able
and
determined
action
of
Froelich
's
Cavalry
Brigade
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
in
the
meantime
his
enemies
on
the
left
,
constantly
reinforced
from
across
the
river
--
while
never
desisting
from
their
so
far
unsuccessful
attack
on
Hounslow
--
worked
round
through
Twickenham
and
Isleworth
till
they
began
to
menace
his
rear
.
<EOS>
He
must
abandon
Hounslow
,
or
be
cut
off
.
<EOS>
With
consummate
generalship
he
withdrew
his
left
along
the
line
of
the
Metropolitan
and
District
Railway
,
and
sent
word
to
the
troops
on
his
right
to
retire
and
take
up
a
second
position
at
Southall
Green
.
<EOS>
Unluckily
for
him
,
there
was
a
delay
in
transmission
,
resulting
in
a
considerable
number
of
these
troops
being
cut
off
and
captured
.
<EOS>
Froelich
's
cavalry
were
unable
to
aid
them
at
this
juncture
,
having
their
attention
drawn
away
by
the
masses
of
'
Leaguers
'
who
had
managed
to
get
over
the
Colne
and
were
congregating
near
Harmondsworth
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
cut
these
up
and
dispersed
them
,
but
afterwards
found
that
they
were
separated
from
the
Saxons
by
a
strong
force
of
British
regular
troops
who
occupied
Harlington
and
opened
a
fire
on
the
Reiters
that
emptied
numerous
saddles
.
<EOS>
They
,
therefore
,
made
off
to
the
northward
.
<EOS>
From
this
forward
nothing
could
check
the
steady
advance
of
the
English
,
though
fierce
fighting
went
on
till
dark
all
through
Hanwell
,
Ealing
,
Perivale
,
and
Wembley
,
the
Saxons
struggling
gamely
to
the
last
,
but
getting
more
and
more
disorganised
.
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
Froelich
's
division
on
their
right
they
would
have
been
surrounded
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
they
must
have
lost
half
their
strength
in
casualties
and
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
dark
,
however
,
Lord
Byfield
ordered
a
general
halt
of
his
tired
though
triumphant
troops
,
and
bivouacked
and
billeted
them
along
a
line
reaching
from
Willesden
on
the
right
through
Wembley
to
Greenford
.
<EOS>
He
established
his
headquarters
at
Wembley
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
some
critics
say
that
he
ought
to
have
pushed
on
his
freshest
troops
towards
Hendon
to
prevent
the
remnant
of
our
opponents
from
re
-
entering
London
;
but
others
,
with
reason
,
urge
that
he
is
right
to
let
them
into
the
metropolis
,
which
they
will
now
find
to
be
merely
a
trap
.

Our
position

much
as
we
are
attempting
to
conceal
it
,
is
a
very
grave
one
.
<EOS>
We
believed
that
if
we
reached

the
British
spirit
would
be
broken

Yet
the
more

How
it
will
end

are

they

Last

we
had
an
example
of
it

<EOS>
This
League

Defenders

which
Von
Kronhelm
has
always
treated
with
ridicule
,
is
,
we
have
discovered
too
late

practically
the
whole
of
England

<EOS>
Von

commanding
the

Von

have
constantly

its
spread
through

,
Sheffield
,
Birmingham
and
the
other
great
towns
we
now
occupy
;
but
our
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
has
treated
the
matter
lightly
,
declaring
it
to
be
a
kind
of
offshoot
of
some
organisation
they
have
in
England
,
called
the
Primrose
League

Yesterday
,
at
the
Council
of
War
,
however
,
he
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
his
error
when
I
handed
him
a
scarlet
handbill
calling
upon
the
British
to
make
a
concerted
attack
upon
us
at
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
we
were
prepared
for
the
assault

otherwise
I
verily
believe
that
the
honours
would
have
rested
with
the
populace
in
London

As
it
is
,
we
suffered
considerable
reverses
in
various
districts

where
our
men
were
lured
into

narrow
side

streets
and
cut
up

I
confess
I
am
greatly
surprised
at
the
valiant
stand
made
everywhere
by
the
Londoners

Last
night
they
fought
to
the
very
end

A
disaster
to

Through
the
whole
of
last
week
the
Germans
occupying
London
suffered
great
losses
.
<EOS>
They
are
now
hemmed
in
on
every
side

"
At
three
o'clock
this
morning
,
Von
Kronhelm
,
having
withdrawn
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
from
the
defence
of
the
bridges
,
in
an
attempt
to
occupy
defensive
positions
in
North
London
,
the
South
Londoners
,
impatient
with
long
waiting
,
broke
forth
and
came
across
the
river
in
enormous
multitudes
,
every
man
bent
upon
killing
a
German
wherever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
night
air
was
rent
everywhere
by
the
hoarse
<EOS>
,
exultant
shouts
as
London
--
the
giant
,
all
-
powerful
city
--
fell
upon
the
audacious
invader
.
<EOS>
Through
our
office
windows
came
the
dull
roar
of
London
's
millions
swelled
by
the
'
Defenders
'
from
the
west

south
of
England
,
and
by
the
gallant
men
from
Canada
,
India
,
the
Cape

and
other
British
colonies
who
had
come
forward
to
fight
for

her
position

to
be

In

In
these
terrible
days
a
man
's
life
is
not
safe
from
one
moment
to
another
.
<EOS>
Both
sides
seem
to
have
now
lost
their
heads
completely
.
<EOS>
Among
the
Germans
all
semblance
of
order
has
apparently
been
thrown
to
the
winds
.
<EOS>
It
is
known
that
London
has
risen
to
a
man
,
and
the
enemy
are
therefore
fully
aware
of
their
imminent
peril
.
<EOS>
Already
they
are
beaten
.
<EOS>
True
,
Von
Kronhelm
still
sits
in
the
War
Office
directing
operations
--
<EOS>
operations
he
knows
too
well
are
foredoomed
to
failure
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Germans
have
,
it
must
be
admitted
,
carried
on
the
war
in
a
chivalrous
spirit
,
until
those
drastic
executions
exasperated
the
people
.
<EOS>
Then
neither
side
gave
quarter
,
and
now
to
-
day
,
all
through
Islington
,
Hoxton
,
Kingsland
,
and
Dalston
,
right
out
eastwards
to
Homerton
,
a
perfect
massacre
of
Germans
is
in
progress
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
Byfield
has
issued
two
urgent
proclamations
,
threatening
the
people
of
London
with
all
sorts
of
penalties
if
they
kill
instead
of
taking
an
enemy
prisoner
,
but
they
seem
to
have
no
effect
.
<EOS>
London
is
starved
and
angered
to
such
a
pitch
,
that
her
hatred
knows
no
bounds
,
and
only
blood
will
atone
for
the
wholesale
slaughter
of
the
innocent
since
the
bombardment
of
the
metropolis
began
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Kaiser
has
,
we
hear
,
left
the
'
Belvedere
,
'
at
Scarborough
,
where
he
has
been
living
incognito
.
<EOS>
A
confidential
report
,
apparently
well
founded
,
has
reached
us
that
he
embarked
upon
the
steam
-
trawler
_
Morning
Star
_
at
Scarborough
yesterday
,
and
set
out
across
the
Dogger
,
with
Germany
,
of
course
,
as
his
destination
.
<EOS>
Surely
he
must
now
regret
his
ill
-
advised
policy
of
making
an
attack
upon
England
.
<EOS>
He
had
gauged
our
military
weakness
very
accurately
,
but
he
had
not
counted
upon
the
patriotic
spirit
of
our
Empire
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
he
has
already
given
orders
to
Von
Kronhelm
,
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
very
significant
fact
that
the
German
wireless
telegraph
apparatus
on
the
summit
of
Big
Ben
is
in
constant
use
by
the
German
Commander
-
in
-
Chief
.
<EOS>
He
is
probably
in
hourly
communication
with
Bremen
,
or
with
the
Emperor
himself
upon
the
trawler
_
Morning
Star
_
.
 
<EOS>
"
Near
Highbury
Fields
about
noon
to
-
day
<EOS>
some
British
cavalry
surprised
a
party
of
Germans
,
and
attempted
to
take
them
prisoners
.
<EOS>
The
latter
showed
fight
,
whereupon
they
were
shot
down
to
a
man
.
<EOS>
The
British
held
as
prisoners
by
the
Germans
near
Enfield
have
now
been
released
,
and
are
rejoining
their
comrades
along
the
northern
heights
.
<EOS>
Many
believe
that
another
and
final
battle
will
be
fought
north
of
London
,
but
military
men
declare
that
the
German
power
is
already
broken
.
<EOS>
Whether
Von
Kronhelm
will
still
continue
to
lose
his
men
at
the
rate
he
is
now
doing
,
or
whether
he
will
sue
for
peace
,
is
an
open
question
.
<EOS>
Personally
,
he
was
against
the
bombardment
of
London
from
the
very
first
,
yet
he
was
compelled
to
carry
out
the
orders
of
his
Imperial
master
.
<EOS>
The
invasion
,
the
landing
,
and
the
successes
in
the
north
were
,
in
his
opinion
,
quite
sufficient
to
have
paralysed
British
trade
and
caused
such
panic
that
an
indemnity
would
have
been
paid
.
<EOS>
To
attack
London
was
,
in
his
opinion
,
a
proceeding
far
too
dangerous
,
and
his
estimate
is
now
proved
to
have
been
the
correct
one
.
<EOS>
Now
that
they
have
lost
command
of
the
sea
,
and
are
cut
off
from
their
bases
in
Essex
,
the
enemy
's
situation
is
hopeless
.
<EOS>
They
may
struggle
on
,
but
assuredly
the
end
can
only
be
an
ignominious
one
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yet
the
German
eagle
still
flies
proudly
over
the
War
Office
,
over
St.
Stephen
's
,
and
upon
many
other
public
buildings
,
while
upon
others
British
Royal
Standards
and
Union
Jacks
are
commencing
to
appear
,
each
one
being
cheered
by
the
excited
Londoners

now
full

hope

Germany
shall
be
made
to
bite

everywhere

Many
a
proud
Uhlan

Cuirassier
has
to

day
ridden
to
his
death
amid
the
dense
mobs
,
mad
with
the
lust
of
blood
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
more
unfortunate
of
the
enemy
have
been
lynched
,
and
torn
limb
from
limb
,

others
have
died
deaths
too
horrible
to

"
Each
hour
brings
to
us
further
news
showing
how
,
by
slow
degrees
,
the
German
army
of
occupation
is
being
wiped
out
.
<EOS>
People
are
jeering
at
the
audacious
claim
for
indemnity
presented
to
the
British
Government
when
the
enemy
entered
London
,
and
are
asking
whether
we
will
not
now
present
a
claim
to
Germany
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
is
not
blamed
so
much
as
his
Emperor
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
the
cat
's
paw
,
and
has
burned
his
fingers
in
endeavouring
to
snatch
the
chestnuts
from
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
a
commander
,
he
has
acted
justly
,
fully
observing
the
international
laws
concerning
war
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
faced
by
the
problem
of
a
national
uprising
that
he
countenanced
anything
bordering
upon
capital
punishment
.
<EOS>
An
hour
ago
our
censors
were
withdrawn
.
<EOS>
They
came
and
shook
hands
with
many
members
of
the
staff
,
and
retired
.
<EOS>
This
surely
is
a
significant
fact
that
Von
Kronhelm
hopes
to
regain
the
confidence
of
London
by
appearing
to
treat
her
with
a
fatherly
solicitude
.
<EOS>
Or
is
it
that
he
intends
to
sue
for
peace
at
any
price
?
 
<EOS>
"
An
hour
ago
another
desperate
attempt
was
made
on
the
part
of
the
men
of
South
London
,
aided
by
a
large
body
of
British
regulars
,
to
regain
possession
of
the
War
Office
.
<EOS>
Whitehall
was
once
more
the
scene
of
a
bloody
fight
,
but
so
strongly
does
Von
Kronhelm
hold
the
place
and
all
the
adjacent
thoroughfares
--
he
apparently
regarding
it
as
his
own
fortress
--
that
the
attack
was
repulsed
with
heavy
loss
on
our
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
the
bridges
are
now
open
,
the
barricades
are
in
most
cases
being
blown
up
,
and
people
are
passing
and
repassing
freely
for
the
first
time
since
the
day
following
the
memorable
bombardment
.
<EOS>
London
streets
are
,
however
,
in
a
most
deplorable
condition
.
<EOS>
On
every
hand
is
ruin
and
devastation
.
<EOS>
Whole
streets
of
houses
rendered
gaunt
and
windowless
by
the
now
spent
fires
meet
the
eye
everywhere
.
<EOS>
In
certain
places
the
ruins
were
still
smouldering
,
and
in
one
or
two
districts
the
conflagrations
spread
over
an
enormous
area
.
<EOS>
Even
if
peace
be
declared
,
can
London
ever
recover
from
this
present
wreck
?
<EOS>
Paris
recovered
,
and
quickly
too
.

Therefore
we
place
our
faith
in
British
wealth

British
industry

and
British
patriotism

Yes

The
tide
has

The
great
revenge
now
in
progress
is
truly
a
mad
and
bloody
one

In
Kilburn
this
afternoon
there
was
a
wholesale
killing
of
a
company
of
German
infantry
,
who
,
while
marching
along
the
High
Road
,
were
set
upon
by
the
armed
mob

practically
exterminated

Brondesbury

Victoria

,
Glendall
Road
,
and
Priory
Park
Road

across
to
Paddington
Cemetery

were
the
scene
of
a
frightful
slaughter
.
<EOS>
The
Germans
died
hard
,
but
in
the
end
were
completely
wiped
out
.
<EOS>
German
-
baiting
is
now
,
indeed
,
the
Londoner
's
pastime
,
and
on
this
dark
and
rainy
afternoon
hundreds
of
men
of
the
Fatherland
have
died
upon
the
wet
roads

fresh

facts

all
combine
to
show
that
Von

can
not
hold
out
much
longer

Surely
the
Commander

in

Chief
of
a

army
will
not
allow
his
men
to
be
massacred

they

mixed
up
in

London
streets

are
utterly
unable

cope
with
the
oncoming
multitudes

some
armed
with
rifles

others
with
anything
they
can
lay
their

Women
--
wild
,
infuriated
women
--
have
now
made

reappearance
north

Thames

<EOS>
In
more
than
one
instance
,
where
German
soldiers
have
attempted
to
take
refuge
in
houses
,
these
women
have
obtained
petrol
,
and
,
with
screams
of
fiendish
delight
,
set
the
houses
in
question
on
fire

Awful
dramas
are
being
enacted
in

The
history
of
to

day
is
written
in
German
blood

<EOS>
"
Lord
Byfield
has
established
temporary
headquarters
at
Jack
Straw
's
Castle
,
where
Von
Kronhelm
was
during
the
bombardment
,
and
<EOS>
last
night
we
could
see
the
signals
exchanged
between
Hampstead
and
Sydenham
Hill
,
from
whence
General
Bamford
has
not
yet
moved
.
<EOS>
Our
cavalry
in
Essex
are
,
it
is
said
,
doing
excellent
work
.
<EOS>
Lord
Byfield
has
also
sent
a
body
of
troops
across
from
Gravesend
to
Tilbury
,
and
these
have
regained
Maldon
and
Southminster
after
some
hard
fighting
.
<EOS>
Advices
from
Gravesend
state
that
further
reinforcements
are
being
sent
across
the
river
to
operate
against
the
East
of
London
and
hem
in
the
Germans
on
that
side
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
confident
is
London
of
success
that
several
of
the
railways
are
commencing
to
reorganise
their
traffic
.
<EOS>
A
train
left
Willesden
this
afternoon
for
Birmingham
,
the
first
since
the
bombardment
--
while
another
has
left
Finsbury
Park
for
Peterborough
,
to
continue
to
York
if
possible
.
<EOS>
So
wrecked
are
the
London
termini
,
however
,
that
it
must
be
some
weeks
before
trains
can
arrive
or
be
despatched
from
either
Euston
,
King
's
Cross
,
Paddington
,
Marylebone
,
or
St.
Pancras
.
<EOS>
In
many
instances
the
line
just
north
of
the
terminus
is
interrupted
by
a
blown
-
up
tunnel
or
a
fallen
bridge
,
therefore
the
termination
of
traffic
must
,
for
the
present
,
be
at
some
distance
north
on
the
outskirts
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shops
are
also
opening
in
South
London
,
though
they
have
but
little
to
sell
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
this
may
be
regarded
as
a
sign
of
renewed
confidence
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
supplies
of
provisions
are
now
arriving
,
and
the
London
County
Council
and
the
Salvation
Army
are
distributing
free
soup
and
food
in
the
lower
-
class
districts
.
<EOS>
Private
charity
,
everywhere
abundant
during
the
trying
days
of
dark
despair
,
is
doing
inestimable
good
among
every
class
.
<EOS>
The
hard
,
grasping
employer
and
the
smug
financier
,
who
had
hitherto
kept
scrupulous
accounts
,
and
have
been
noteworthy
on
account
of
their
uncharitableness
,
have
now
,
in
the
hour
of
need

come
forward
and
subscribed
liberally
to
the
great
Mansion
House
Fund
,
opened
yesterday
by
the
Deputy
Lord
Mayor
of
London

<EOS>
The
subscription
list
occupies
six
columns
of
the
issue
of
to

morrow

paper
,
and
this
,
in
itself
,
speaks
well
for
the
openheartedness
of
the
moneyed
classes
of
Great
Britain

No
movement

The

places
is
now
under
strong
British
guard

will
,
it
is
supposed
,
be
returned
to
the
Bank
immediately

<EOS>
Only
a
comparatively
small
sum
has
yet
been
sent

Therefore
all
Von

strategy
has
utterly
failed

By

Germany
has

up
to

gained
nothing

has
made
huge
demands
at
which
we
can
afford
to
jeer
.

True
,
she
has
wrecked
London
,
but
have
we
not
sent
the
greater
part
of
her
fleet
to
the
bottom
of
the
North
Sea

have
we
not
created
havoc

The
leave

taking
of

play
practical

upon

To

Private
information
has
just
reached
us
from
a
most
reliable
source
that
a
conference
has
been
arranged
between
Von
Kronhelm
and
Lord
Byfield
.
<EOS>
This
evening
the
German
Field
Marshal
sent
a
messenger
to
the
British
headquarters
at
Hampstead
under
a
flag
of
truce
.
<EOS>
He
bore
a
despatch
from
the
German
Commander
asking
that
hostilities
should
be
suspended
for
twenty
-
four
hours
,
and
that
they
should
make
an
appointment
for
a
meeting
during
that
period
.
 
<EOS>
"
Von
Kronhelm
has
left
the
time
and
place
of
meeting
to
Lord
Byfield
,
and
has
informed
the
British
Commander
that
he
has
sent
telegraphic

to
the
German

Sheffield

Manchester
,
Bradford

Leeds

ordering
that
for
the
present
hostilities
on
the
part
of
the
Germans
shall
be
suspended

"
It
seems
more
than
likely
that
the
German
Field
Marshal
has
received
these
very
definite
instructions
by
wireless
telegraph
from

Emperor
at

Potsdam

that
Lord
Byfield

brief
consultation
by

has
sent
a
reply

the

<EOS>
"
Lord
Byfield
has
granted
a
truce
,
and
hostilities
have
now
been
suspended

<EOS>
"
London
has
gone
mad
with
delight
,
for
the
German
yoke
is
cast
off
.
<EOS>
Further
information
which
has
just
reached
us
from
private
sources
states
that
thousands
of
prisoners
have
been
taken
by
Lord
Byfield
to
-
day
,
and
that
Von
Kronhelm
has
acknowledged
his
position
to
be
absolutely
hopeless
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
great
German
Army
has
been
defeated
by
our
British
patriots
,
who
have
fought
so
valiantly
<EOS>
and
so
well
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
that
the
war
will
be
resumed
.
<EOS>
Von
Kronhelm
received
a
number
of
British
officers
at
the
War
Office
half
an
hour
ago
,
and
it
is
said
that
he
is
already
making
preparations
to
vacate
the
post
he
has
usurped
.
 
<EOS>
"
Lord
Byfield
has
issued
a
reassuring
message
to
London
,
which
we
have
just
received
with
instructions
to
print
.
<EOS>
It
declares
that
although
for
the
moment
only
a
truce
is
proclaimed
,
yet
this
means
the
absolute
cessation
of
all
hostilities
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
naval
news
of
the
past
few
days
may
be
briefly
summarised
.
<EOS>
The
British
main
fleet
entered
the
North
Sea
,
and
our
submarines
did
most
excellent
work
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
Maas
Lightship
.
<EOS>
Prince
Stahlberger
had
concentrated
practically
the
whole
of
his
naval
force
off
Lowestoft
,
but
a
desperate
battle
was
fought
about
seventy
miles
from
the
Texel
,
full
details
of
which
are
not
yet
to
hand
.
<EOS>
All
that
is
known
is
that
,
having
now
regained
command
of
the
sea
,
we
were
enabled
to
inflict
a
crushing
defeat
upon
the
Germans
,
in
which
the
German
flagship
was
sunk
.
<EOS>
In
the
end
sixty
-
one
British
ships
were
concentrated
against
seventeen
German
,
with
the
result
that
the
German
fleet
has
practically
been
wiped
out
,
there
being
19,000
of
the
enemy
's
officers
and
men
on
the
casualty
list
,
the
greatest
recorded
in
any
naval
battle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whatever
may
be
the
demands
for
indemnity
on
either
side
,
one
thing
is
absolutely
certain
,
namely
,
that
the
invincible
German
Army
and
Navy
are
completely
vanquished

CHAPTER
V.
 
<EOS>
HOW
THE
WAR
ENDED
.
  
<EOS>
Days
passed
--
weary
,
waiting
,
anxious
days
.
<EOS>
A
whole
month
went
by
.
<EOS>
What
had
really
happened
at
sea
was
unknown
.
<EOS>
After
the
truce
,
London
very
gradually
began
to
resume
her
normal
life
,
though
the
gaunt
state
of
the
streets
was
indescribably
weird
.
 
<EOS>
Shops
began
to
open
,
and
as
each
day
passed
,
food
became
more
plentiful
and
consequently
less
dear
.
<EOS>
The
truce
meant
the
end
of
the
war
,
therefore
thanksgiving
services
were
held
in
every
town
and
village
throughout
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
great
prison
-
camps
of
Germans
at
Hounslow
,
Brentwood
,
and
Barnet
,
while
Von
Kronhelm
and
his
chief
officers
were
also
held
as
prisoners
until
some
decision
through
diplomatic
channels
could
be
arrived
at
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
a
little
business
began
to
be
done
;
thousands
began
to
resume
their
employment
,
bankers
reopened
their
doors
,
and
within
a
week
the
distress
and
suffering
of
the
poor
became
perceptibly
alleviated
.
<EOS>
The
task
of
burying
the
dead
after
the
terrible
massacre
of
the
Germans
in
the
London
streets
had
been
a
stupendous
one
,
but
so
quickly
had
it
been
accomplished
that
an
epidemic
was
happily
averted
.
 
<EOS>
Parliament
moved
back
to
Westminster
,
and
daily
meetings
of
the
Cabinet
were
being
held
in
Downing
Street
.
<EOS>
These
resulted
in
the
resignation
of
the
Ministry
,
and
with
a
fresh
Cabinet
,
in
which
Mr.
Gerald
Graham
,
the
organiser
of
the
Defenders
,
was
given
a
seat
,
a
settlement
was
at
last
arrived
at
.
 
<EOS>
To
further
describe
the
chaotic
state
of
England
occasioned
by
the
terrible
and
bloody
war
would
serve
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
loss
and
suffering
which
it
had
caused
the
country
had
been
incalculable
;
statisticians
estimated
that
in
one
month
of
hostilities
it
had
amounted
to
L500,000,000
,
a
part
of
which
represented
money
transferred
from
British
pockets
to
German
,
as
the
enemy
had
carried
off
some
of
the
securities
upon
which
the
German
troops
had
laid
their
hands
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
for
a
moment
take
a
retrospective
glance
.
<EOS>
Consols
were
at
50
;
bread
was
still
1_s
.
<EOS>
_
6_d
.
<EOS>
_
per
loaf
;
and
the
ravages
of
the
German
commerce
-
destroyers
had
sent
up
the
cost
of
insurance
on
British
shipping
sky
-
high
.
<EOS>
Money
was
almost
unprocurable
;
except
for
the
manufacture
of
war
material
,
there
was
no
industry
;
and
the
suffering
and
distress
among
the
poor
could
not
be
exaggerated
.
<EOS>
In
all
directions
men
,
women
,
and
children
had
been
starving
.
 
<EOS>
The
mercantile
community
were
loud
in
their
outcry
for
"
peace
at
any
price
,
"
and
the
pro
-
German
and
Stop
-
the
-
War
Party
were
equally
vehement
in
demanding
a
cessation
of
the
war
.
<EOS>
They
found
excuses
for
the
enemy
,
and
forgot
the
frightful
devastation
and
loss
which
the
invasion
had
caused
to
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
They
insisted
that
the
working
class
gained
nothing
,
even
though
the
British
fleet
was
closely
blockading
the
German
coast
,
and
their
outcry
was
strengthened
when
a
few
days
after
the
blockade
of
the
Elbe
had
begun
,
two
British
battleships
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
strike
German
mines
,
and
sink
with
a
large
part
of
their
crews
.
<EOS>
The
difficulty
of
borrowing
money
for
the
prosecution
of
the
war
was
a
grave
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
party
of
action
,
and
preyed
upon
the
mind
of
the
British
Government
.
 
<EOS>
Socialism
,
with
its
creed
of
"
Thou
shalt
have
no
other
god
but
Thyself
,
"
and
its
doctrine
,
"
Let
us
eat
and
drink
,
for
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
we
die
,
"
had
replaced
the
religious
beliefs
of
a
generation
of
Englishmen
taught
to
suffer
and
to
die
sooner
than
surrender
to
wrong
.
<EOS>
In
the
hour
of
trial
,
amidst
smoking
ruins
,
among
the
holocausts
of
dead
which
marked
the
prolonged
,
bloody
,
and
terrible
battles
on
land
and
at
sea
,
the
spirit
of
the
nation
quailed
,
and
there
was
really
no
great
leader
to
recall
it
to
ways
of
honour
and
duty
.
 
<EOS>
The
wholesale
destruction
of
food
,
and
particularly
of
wheat
and
meat
,
removed
from
the
world
's
market
a
large
part
of
its
supplies
,
and
had
immediately
sent
up
the
cost
of
food
everywhere
,
outside
the
United
Kingdom
as
well
as
in
it
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
the
attacks
upon
shipping
laden
with
food
increased
the
cost
of
insurance
to
prohibitive
prices
upon
vessels
freighted
for
the
United
Kingdom
.
<EOS>
The
underwriters
after
the
first
few
captures
by
the
enemy
would
not
insure
at
all
except
for
fabulous
rates
.
 
<EOS>
The
withdrawal
of
all
the
larger
British
cruisers
for
the
purpose
of
defeating
the
main
German
fleets
in
the
North
Sea
left
the
commerce
-
destroyers
a
free
hand
,
and
there
was
no
force
to
meet
them
.
<EOS>
The
British
liners
commissioned
as
commerce
-
protectors
were
too
few
and
too
slow
to
be
able
to
hold
their
adversaries
in
check
.
 
<EOS>
Neutral
shipping
was
molested
by
the
German
cruisers
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
raw
cotton
or
food
of
any
kind
was
discovered
upon
a
neutral
vessel
bound
for
British
ports
,
the
vessel
was
seized
and
sent
into
one
or
other
of
the
German
harbours
on
the
West
Coast
of
Africa
.
 
<EOS>
The
United
Kingdom
,
indeed
,
might
have
been
reduced
to
absolute
starvation
<EOS>
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
the
Canadian
Government
interfered
in
Canada
to
prevent
similar
German
tactics
from
succeeding
,
and
held
the
German
contracts
for
the
cornering
of
Canadian
wheat
,
contrary
to
public
policy
.
 
<EOS>
The
want
of
food
,
the
high
price
of
bread
and
meat
in
England
,
and
the
greatly
increased
cost
of
the
supplies
of
raw
material
sent
up
the
expenditure
upon
poor
relief
to
enormous
figures
.
<EOS>
Millions
of
men
were
out
of
employment
,
and
in
need
of
assistance
.
<EOS>
Mills
and
factories
in
all
directions
had
closed
down
,
either
because
of
the
military
danger
from
the
operations
of
the
German
armies
,
or
because
of
the
want
of
orders
,
or
,
again
,
because
raw
materials
were
not
procurable
.
 
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
when
the
invasion
began
,
many
rich
foreigners
who
had
lived
in
England
collected
what
portable
property
they
possessed
and
retired
abroad
to
Switzerland
,
Italy
,
and
the
United
States
.
<EOS>
Their
example
was
followed
by
large
numbers
of
British
subjects
who
had
invested
abroad
,
and
now
,
in
the
hour
of
distress
,
were
able
to
place
their
securities
in
a
handbag
and
withdraw
them
to
happier
countries
.
 
<EOS>
They
may
justly
be
blamed
for
this
want
of
patriotism
,
but
their
reply
was
that
they
had
been
unjustly
and
mercilessly
taxed
by
men
who
derided
patriotism
,
misused
power
,
and
neglected
the
real
interests
of
the
nation
in
the
desire
to
pander
to
the
mob
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
with
the
income
-
tax
at
3_s
.
<EOS>
_
6_d
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
in
the
pound
,
and
with
the
cost
of
living
enormously
enhanced
,
they
declared
that
it
was
a
positive
impossibility
to
live
in
England
,
while
into
the
bargain
their
lives
were
exposed
to
danger
from
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
result
of
this
wholesale
emigration
,
in
London
and
the
country
the
number
of
empty
houses
inordinately
increased
,
and
there
were
few
well
-
to
-
do
people
left
to
pay
the
rates
and
taxes
.
<EOS>
The
fearful
burden
of
the
extravagant
debts
which
the
British
municipalities
had
heaped
up
was
cruelly
felt
,
since
the
nation
had
to
repudiate
the
responsibility
which
it
had
incurred
for
the
payment
of
interest
on
the
local
debts
.
<EOS>
The
Socialist
dream
,
in
fact
,
might
almost
be
said
to
have
been
realised
.
<EOS>
There
were
few
rich
left
,
but
the
consequences
to
the
poor
,
instead
of
being
beneficial
,
were
utterly
disastrous
.
 
<EOS>
Under
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
,
constrained
by
hunger
and
financial
necessities
,
and
with
thousands
of
German
prisoners
in
their
hands
,
the
British
Government
acceded
to
the
suggested
conference
to
secure
peace
.

Peace
was
finally
signed
on
January
13
,
1911
.
<EOS>
The
British
Empire
emerged
from
the
conflict
outwardly
intact
,
but
internally
so
weakened
that
only
the
most
resolute
reforms
accomplished
by
the
ablest
and
boldest
statesmen
,
could
have
restored
it
to
its
old
position
.
 
<EOS>
Germany
,
on
the
other
hand
,
emerged
with
an
additional
21,000
miles
of
European
territory
,
with
an
extended
seaboard
on
the
North
Sea
,
fronting
the
United
Kingdom
at
Rotterdam
and
the
Texel
,
and
,
it
was
calculated
,
with
a
slight
pecuniary
advantage
.
<EOS>
Practically
the
entire
cost
of
the
war
had
been
borne
by
England
.
 
<EOS>
As
is
always
the
case
,
the
poor
suffered
most
.
<EOS>
The
Socialists
,
who
had
declared
against
armaments
,
were
faithless
friends
of
those
whom
they
professed
to
champion
.
<EOS>
Their
dream
of
a
golden
age
proved
utterly
delusive
.
<EOS>
But
the
true
authors
of
England
's
misfortunes
escaped
blame
for
the
moment
,
and
the
Army
and
Navy
were
made
the
scapegoats
of
the
great
catastrophe
.
 
<EOS>
When
success
did
come
,
it
came
too
late
,
and
could
not
be
utilised
without
a
great
British
Army
capable
of
carrying
the
war
into
the
enemy
's
country
,
and
thus
compelling
a
satisfactory
peace
.
