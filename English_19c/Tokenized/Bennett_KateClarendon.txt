On
the
banks
of
the
beautiful
Ohio
,
some
five
or
six
miles
above
the
large
and
flourishing
city
of
Cincinnati
,
can
be
seen
the
small
and
pleasant
village
of
Columbia
,
once
laid
out
and
designed
to
become
the
capital
of
the
great
West
.
<EOS>
This
village
stands
on
a
beautiful
plain
,
which
stretches
away
from
the
Ohio
in
a
north
-
easterly
direction
,
between
two
ridges
,
for
a
goodly
number
of
miles
,
and
at
the
base
of
what
is
termed
Bald
Hill
—
a
hill
of
a
conical
shape
,
from
the
summit
<EOS>
whereof
you
can
command
every
point
of
compass
,
and
some
of
the
most
delightful
views
in
the
western
country
.
<EOS>
Standing
upon
this
hill
,
with
your
face
toward
the
south
,
you
first
behold
,
immediately
below
you
,
a
cluster
of
dwellings
,
mostly
white
,
with
their
green
lawns
in
front
,
and
their
flowery
gardens
in
the
rear
,
with
one
or
two
neat
,
unostentatious
looking
churches
rising
above
them
,
as
if
to
give
a
quiet
and
moral
beauty
,
if
we
may
so
express
it
,
to
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Be
yond
these
buildings
,
which
constitute
the
principal
village
of
Columbia
,
the
eye
at
once
falls
upon
an
open
,
variegated
and
fertile
plain
,
over
which
it
wanders
for
something
like
a
mile
,
to
rest
again
for
a
moment
upon
a
few
brick
and
wood
-
colored
houses
,
half
hid
amid
a
grove
of
beautiful
trees
,
then
upon
the
smooth
,
silvery
Ohio
,
which
here
comes
sweeping
past
with
a
graceful
bend
,
and
,
<EOS>
lastly
,
upon
the
green
and
romantic
looking
hills
of
old
Kentucky
.
<EOS>
Turning
to
the
left
,
or
eastward
,
you
behold
,
some
mile
or
two
miles
distant
,
a
woody
ridge
,
which
intersects
the
Ohio
at
right
angles
,
and
,
stretching
away
northward
,
forms
the
eastern
boundary
of
the
plain
.
<EOS>
At
the
base
of
this
ridge
,
can
be
seen
,
here
and
there
,
a
quiet
farm
-
house
,
and
portions
of
the
Little
Miami
,
as
it
rolls
its
silvery
waters
onward
through
a
most
delightful
grove
,
to
unite
with
,
and
be
lost
in
,
the
placid
bosom
of
La
Belle
Riviere
.
<EOS>
Between
you
and
the
Little
Miami
,
and
for
many
a
mile
up
toward
its
source
,
lies
the
plain
we
have
mentioned
,
now
divided
as
far
as
you
can
see
,
into
lots
of
four
or
five
acres
each
,
all
of
which
,
being
under
cultivation
,
present
,
in
the
summer
season
,
with
their
different
products
,
a
pleasing
variety
of
colors
,
as
if
to
enchain
the
attention
of
the
beholder
with
an
unspeakable
sensation
of
delight
.
<EOS>
Following
the
course
of
the
plain
away
to
the
north
-
east
,
you
behold
,
some
few
miles
distant
,
another
pleasant
village
,
with
its
neat
,
white
houses
peeping
from
among
the
green
foliage
of
the
surrounding
trees
.
<EOS>
Turning
again
to
the
south
and
west
,
and
following
the
windings
of
the
Ohio
,
you
can
perceive
the
village
of
Fulton
along
its
banks
,
some
two
miles
away
,
with
here
and
there
an
elegant
mansion
,
all
standing
out
in
bold
relief
against
the
green
background
of
a
neighboring
ridge
,
and
not
unfrequently
finding
themselves
mirrored
in
the
river
's
placid
bosom
.
<EOS>
A
view
of
the
delightful
city
of
Cincinnati
is
here
cut
off
by
a
bend
in
the
ridge
and
river
;
but
notwithstanding
,
the
landscape
,
taken
as
a
whole
,
is
one
of
the
most
pleasing
that
can
be
found
on
the
globe
.
<EOS>
Such
is
an
outline
,
only
,
of
the
scene
which
is
presented
to
the
beholder
of
modern
days
;
but
very
different
was
it
sixty
years
ago
,
when
along
the
banks
of
the
river
and
over
the
plain
and
hills
,
instead
of
the
quiet
village
and
its
hum
of
civilization
,
and
the
many
pleasant
farms
under
cultivation
,
and
the
farm
-
houses
sending
up
in
graceful
wreaths
the
smoke
of
their
peaceful
fires
<EOS>
,
there
was
a
vast
,
unbroken
forest
,
inhabited
by
the
barbarous
,
untutored
savage
,
and
the
thousand
wild
beasts
of
the
wilderness
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
with
the
early
settlement
of
this
portion
of
the
country
we
have
to
do
,
we
must
leave
the
scene
as
it
now
exists
,
and
go
back
to
the
period
when
the
hardy
pioneer
left
his
comfortable
and
well
-
protected
home
,
to
venture
hither
,
and
dare
all
the
dangers
and
suffer
all
the
privations
of
frontier
life
.
<EOS>
As
early
as
November
,
1788
,
a
party
,
consisting
of
some
twenty
persons
,
conducted
by
Major
Benjamin
Stites
,
landed
at
the
mouth
of
the
Little
Miami
,
and
began
a
settlement
upon
the
purchase
of
ten
thousand
acres
,
which
the
Major
had
previously
made
from
Judge
Symmes
.
<EOS>
Among
this
party
were
many
whose
names
afterward
became
noted
in
history
,
and
whose
descendants
still
occupy
prominent
positions
in
the
community
whereof
they
are
citizens
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
first
adventurers
into
this
region
of
country
,
and
were
a
month
in
advance
of
the
party
which
landed
at
,
and
erected
the
first
log
cabins
on
,
the
present
site
of
Cincinnati
.
<EOS>
On
their
arrival
,
they
immediately
constructed
a
log
fort
,
built
several
cabins
or
huts
,
and
then
proceeded
to
lay
out
the
town
of
Columbia
into
streets
or
lots
,
on
the
plain
we
have
described
—
believing
at
the
time
,
that
it
would
eventually
become
the
great
capital
of
the
West
.
<EOS>
Beginning
at
Crawfish
Creek
,
a
small
stream
which
was
to
form
the
north
-
western
boundary
of
the
city
,
ascending
the
Ohio
for
more
than
a
mile
,
and
extending
back
from
the
river
for
three
-
quarters
of
a
mile
,
taking
in
a
portion
of
what
is
now
called
Bald
Hill
,
they
laid
out
the
ground
in
streets
and
squares
.
<EOS>
The
residue
of
the
plain
,
between
this
imaginative
city
and
the
Little
Miami
,
and
for
three
miles
up
this
stream
,
was
cut
up
into
lots
of
four
or
five
acres
each
,
intended
for
the
support
of
the
town
,
when
it
should
come
to
maturity
.
<EOS>
These
lots
have
since
been
divided
by
trenches
,
and
so
remain
at
the
present
day
;
and
as
you
view
them
from
Bald
Hill
,
one
covered
with
greensward
,
another
with
a
crop
of
wheat
,
a
third
with
corn
,
a
fourth
with
oats
,
and
so
on
,
the
whole
plain
appears
like
a
many
-
colored
carpet
of
beautiful
squares
.
<EOS>
The
first
pioneers
of
the
Miami
Bottom
were
soon
joined
by
others
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
,
Columbia
became
quite
a
flourishing
place
,
and
,
for
a
time
,
took
the
lead
of
its
sister
towns
,
Cincinnati
and
North
Bend
—
the
last
since
noted
as
the
residence
of
General
Harrison
.
<EOS>
At
this
period
,
these
three
villages
,
with
the
exception
of
Marietta
,
higher
up
the
river
,
were
the
only
white
settlements
in
Ohio
;
and
as
it
was
more
than
suspected
by
the
inhabitants
of
each
,
that
one
of
them
was
destined
to
become
the
great
emporium
of
the
West
,
each
looked
upon
the
advancement
of
its
neighbor
with
a
jealous
eye
,
and
sought
,
by
every
means
,
to
push
itself
forward
to
the
grand
desideratum
.
<EOS>
For
a
time
,
Fortune
seemed
bent
on
playing
her
pranks
,
by
now
favoring
this
one
,
now
that
,
and
so
alternately
raising
and
depressing
the
spirits
of
each
;
but
,
at
last
,
as
the
world
already
knows
,
she
yielded
the
palm
to
Cincinnati
,
by
establishing
there
a
fort
and
garrison
,
which
rendered
it
,
with
its
natural
advantages
,
a
place
of
greater
security
than
either
of
the
others
,
and
,
consequently
,
a
more
desirable
location
for
those
venturing
into
the
Western
Wilds
.
<EOS>
About
the
period
when
rivalry
between
the
places
named
was
at
its
height
—
and
when
the
momentous
question
was
pending
,
as
to
which
would
be
the
favored
spot
of
fortune
,
the
Queen
City
of
the
West
—
our
story
opens
.
<EOS>
Columbia
,
as
we
said
before
,
had
already
made
rapid
advances
,
and
taken
the
lead
of
her
rival
sisters
,
in
point
of
business
and
population
.
<EOS>
Over
the
broad
plain
,
between
Bald
Hill
and
the
Little
Miami
,
were
now
scattered
some
forty
or
fifty
log
cabins
,
and
at
the
southern
base
of
this
hill
,
on
a
little
knoll
—
where
,
at
the
present
day
,
can
be
seen
a
neat
grave
-
yard
,
with
its
marble
and
sand
-
stone
slabs
recording
the
names
of
many
who
,
since
then
,
have
gone
to
the
shadowy
realms
of
death
—
stood
a
rude
sanctuary
,
the
first
building
erected
solely
to
the
worship
of
God
by
the
pioneers
of
the
Miami
Valley
.
<EOS>
Around
this
humble
sanctuary
was
a
grove
of
beautiful
trees
,
in
whose
branches
a
thousand
merry
songsters
,
of
all
hues
,
sang
blithely
.
<EOS>
Side
by
side
with
this
place
of
worship
,
on
the
same
knoll
,
amid
the
same
delightful
grove
,
was
erected
a
block
-
house
,
for
the
protection
of
the
inhabitants
in
the
immediate
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Hither
,
on
a
Sabbath
morning
,
when
the
toil
of
the
week
was
over
,
the
villagers
of
both
sexes
,
and
all
ages
,
would
repair
,
to
listen
to
the
word
of
God
,
as
it
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
venerable
Stephen
Gano
(
father
of
the
late
General
Gano
)
,
whose
mild
,
noble
,
benevolent
countenance
,
his
long
,
white
flowing
locks
,
and
his
solemn
,
tremulous
voice
,
as
he
raised
his
eyes
to
Heaven
in
supplication
,
or
forcibly
pointed
out
to
his
hearers
the
way
to
eternal
life
,
made
his
remarks
deep
,
grand
and
impressive
.
<EOS>
And
the
more
so
,
it
may
be
,
that
each
felt
himself
to
be
in
the
wilderness
,
surrounded
by
the
hostile
savage
,
and
knew
not
at
what
moment
he
might
be
called
to
his
last
account
,
a
victim
to
the
fatal
rifle
,
or
the
bloody
tomahawk
and
scalping
-
knife
.
<EOS>
To
avoid
a
surprise
and
be
prepared
for
any
emergency
,
during
the
hours
of
worship
,
sentinels
were
stationed
without
the
walls
of
the
sanctuary
,
who
,
with
loaded
rifles
on
their
shoulders
,
paced
to
and
fro
with
measured
tread
,
examining
minutely
every
object
of
a
suspicious
character
;
while
those
within
sat
,
with
their
weapons
by
their
sides
,
ready
,
at
a
moment
's
warning
,
a
given
signal
,
to
rush
from
the
house
of
quiet
devotion
,
to
the
field
of
blood
and
slaughter
.
<EOS>
Not
only
to
church
,
but
to
their
places
of
labor
,
where
they
repaired
in
companies
,
and
,
in
fact
,
on
all
occasions
,
the
early
settlers
went
armed
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
block
-
house
on
the
knoll
,
there
were
one
or
two
others
nearer
the
river
,
and
one
some
half
a
mile
further
up
the
plain
,
close
by
where
now
winds
a
broad
and
beautiful
turnpike
,
and
on
the
site
of
which
now
stands
a
private
dwelling
.
<EOS>
Bald
Hill
(
now
owned
by
N.
Longworth
,
one
of
the
wealthiest
gentlemen
in
the
country
,
and
by
him
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
the
grape
)
was
,
at
the
period
referred
to
,
covered
by
a
dark
,
dense
forest
,
where
prowled
the
wild
beasts
,
and
not
unfrequently
lurked
the
murderous
Indian
,
seeking
his
"
great
revenge
"
on
his
more
civilized
and
less
wily
foe
.
<EOS>
Such
,
reader
,
is
an
outline
view
of
the
scene
where
our
story
is
laid
,
and
the
condition
of
the
country
at
the
time
of
its
opening
.

Having
said
this
much
of
general
facts
,
we
shall
now
proceed
to
detail

CHAPTER
II.A
<EOS>
lovely
being
,
scarcely
formed
or
molded
—
A
rose
with
all
its
sweetest
leaves
yet
folded.—Byron
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
,
her
lips
,
her
cheeks
,
her
shape
,
her
features
,
Seem
to
be
drawn
by
Love
's
own
hand.—Dryden
.
<EOS>
Strange
being
he
,
Of
whom
all
men
did
stand
in
awe
;
and
noneKnew
whence
he
came
,
nor
how
,
nor
whither
bound
,
Nor
cared
to
question
.
<EOS>
Strange
things
he
told
,
And
true
—
then
disappeared
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
—
Old
Play
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
lovely
day
in
spring
,
and
earth
had
donned
her
raiment
of
many
colors
,
and
seemed
smiling
to
the
whispering
zephyr
that
softly
floated
over
her
.
<EOS>
The
bright
sun
had
already
passed
the
zenith
of
the
day
,
yet
his
oblique
rays
fell
warmly
upon
the
great
forest
,
extending
over
the
Miami
Bottom
,
and
pierced
through
the
foliage
,
here
and
there
,
down
to
the
earth
,
and
kissed
the
violet
,
the
rose
and
the
lily
,
and
danced
to
and
fro
to
the
music
of
the
swaying
branches
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
songsters
,
of
all
hues
—
from
the
bright
red
-
bird
,
the
black
-
bird
,
the
paroquet
of
green
and
gold
,
to
the
white
and
plaintive
dove
—
flew
hither
and
thither
,
fluttered
among
the
leaves
,
and
made
the
perfumed
air
heavy
with
their
melody
.
<EOS>
Here
might
be
seen
the
bear
,
sitting
upon
his
haunches
,
or
lazily
crawling
off
to
seek
his
lair
;
there
the
timid
deer
,
daintily
cropping
the
green
herbage
,
or
,
startled
by
some
rude
sound
,
bounding
away
with
an
unmatched
grace
and
the
speed
of
the
flying
arrow
.
<EOS>
Underneath
the
leaves
,
occasionally
,
lay
coiled
the
wily
copper
-
head
,
ready
to
strike
his
victim
;
and
the
sound
of
the
rattle
-
snake
could
ever
and
anon
be
heard
,
giving
the
generous
,
but
if
unheeded
,
perchance
fatal
,
warning
.
<EOS>
Here
,
too
,
more
cunning
,
more
deadly
than
all
the
dread
beasts
or
serpents
of
the
forest
,
might
peradventure
be
found
the
swarthy
savage
,
with
his
murderous
weapons
in
hand
,
crawling
stealthily
and
silently
onward
,
to
execute
his
fell
design
upon
some
innocent
and
unwary
foe
of
his
race
.
<EOS>
But
for
the
dangers
everywhere
lurking
in
this
forest
of
beauty
,
it
might
have
seemed
a
Paradise
indeed
,
unsurpassed
by
that
primitive
Eden
,
where
man
first
broke
the
holy
command
,
and
entailed
misery
upon
his
descendants
even
to
the
last
generation
of
time
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
the
peril
which
surrounded
her
,
which
perchance
lay
hid
behind
each
bush
and
beneath
each
leaf
,
there
was
one
,
a
fairy
,
beautiful
being
,
who
seemed
to
give
no
thought
to
danger
,
as
if
her
own
fair
self
were
an
amulet
of
safety
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
on
the
bank
of
the
Little
Miami
,
some
two
hundred
rods
above
its
junction
with
the
Ohio
,
her
back
braced
against
a
tall
old
Sycamore
,
her
head
bent
a
little
forward
,
and
her
eyes
,
those
sparkling
orbs
of
the
soul
,
resting
upon
the
dark
waters
rolling
slowly
onward
before
her
,
perchance
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
own
fair
face
,
perchance
to
watch
the
motions
of
the
finny
tribe
,
or
perchance
to
behold
the
pictures
of
light
and
shade
,
which
the
sportive
sunheams
,
streaming
through
the
rustling
leaflets
,
made
upon
the
glassy
surface
of
the
quivering
stream
.
<EOS>
Beautiful
creature
!
<EOS>
how
shall
we
describe
her
?
<EOS>
how
convey
,
by
the
dull
pen
,
to
the
optical
sense
,
the
etheriality
,
the
reality
,
the
sunny
brightness
of
the
being
in
form
divine
before
us
?
<EOS>
We
can
give
the
outline
of
form
—
we
can
describe
the
shape
of
her
features
,
the
color
of
her
hair
and
eyes
—
yet
how
shall
we
convey
the
ever
-
varying
expression
of
her
countenance
—
the
buoyant
,
merry
,
sympathetic
,
versatile
soul
,
which
animated
,
and
made
to
differ
from
others
,
the
clayey
tenement
which
it
inhabited
!
<EOS>
We
can
not
—
we
despair
of
doing
it
;
<EOS>
and
yet
we
will
do
,
to
the
extent
of
our
ability
,
and
let
the
imagination
of
the
reader
supply
the
deficiency
.
<EOS>
Know
then
,
reader
,
that
she
whom
we
have
introduced
to
your
notice
,
was
an
angel
—
not
of
heaven
,
but
of
earth
;
not
pale
and
pensive
,
with
wings
upon
her
shoulders
,
as
we
sometimes
see
the
tenants
of
paradise
represented
—
but
full
of
color
,
life
,
music
,
soul
—
a
bright
being
,
calculated
to
adorn
the
sphere
where
her
lot
was
cast
,
and
yet
,
when
done
,
to
"
shuffle
off
the
mortal
coil
,
"
and
be
equally
an
ornament
among
immortals
!
<EOS>
Her
age
was
sweet
,
glowing
,
imaginative
seventeen
;
that
age
of
all
others
in
woman
,
the
most
peculiar
and
full
of
strange
sensations
;
when
she
stands
timidly
,
as
it
were
,
between
two
periods
—
girlhood
and
womanhood
—
just
pensively
looking
back
and
bidding
adieu
to
the
one
—
just
brightly
looking
before
and
greeting
the
other
:
when
,
if
by
chance
she
sees
through
the
rose
colored
optics
of
love
,
the
whole
pathway
before
her
seems
strewn
with
bright
,
unfading
flowers
,
and
every
thing
appears
so
new
and
perfectly
beautiful
;
and
she
dreams
not
that
serpents
,
and
thorns
,
and
ashes
,
and
coffin
-
palls
,
lie
in
her
path
,
to
make
her
weep
and
mourn
,
and
sigh
for
the
rest
of
the
grave
to
which
time
is
bearing
her
.
<EOS>
Bright
,
rosy
,
buoyant
seventeen
!
<EOS>
how
many
thousands
daily
look
back
to
it
with
a
sigh
,
as
they
think
of
the
hundred
still
unexecuted
plans
laid
out
for
coming
time
,
and
contrast
their
present
conditions
with
those
they
intended
to
occupy
!
<EOS>
At
seventeen
,
all
is
sweet
indecision
,
uncertainty
and
inexperience
;
and
life
is
then
to
us
only
an
ever
-
varying
kaleidescope
,
where
every
thing
we
behold
—
no
matter
how
we
twist
and
turn
it
by
pretended
reason
—
is
a
beautiful
flower
;
and
flower
upon
flower
,
each
more
bright
,
lovely
and
fascinating
than
the
last
;
and
if
we
dream
of
change
at
all
,
it
is
always
change
for
the
better
.
<EOS>
Happy
seventeen
,
then
,
was
she
who
stood
leaning
against
the
old
sycamore
—
God
keep
her
from
the
cold
,
stinging
,
unhappy
experience
of
many
of
her
sex
!
<EOS>
In
form
she
was
a
beauty
—
light
,
slender
,
graceful
—
full
of
youthful
elasticity
and
vigor
—
with
a
well
developed
bust
—
a
small
,
white
,
plump
,
dimpled
hand
,
and
a
foot
<EOS>
so
exquisite
,
it
might
have
rivalled
that
of
the
divine
Fanny
of
modern
days
.
<EOS>
Her
features
corresponded
with
her
form
—
were
fine
and
comely
,
and
radiant
with
the
glow
of
health
—
but
remarkable
for
nothing
save
expression
.
<EOS>
Had
they
been
chisseled
in
marble
;
with
the
soul
absent
,
they
would
not
probably
have
even
excited
a
passing
remark
;
but
with
the
soul
there
—
that
ever
varying
soul
—
they
took
the
beholder
captive
to
their
charms
,
drew
him
forward
as
the
magnet
draws
the
needle
,
held
him
fast
as
the
iron
chain
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
predominant
expression
of
her
countenance
was
a
bright
,
roguish
,
girlish
smile
,
which
almost
invariably
hovered
around
two
as
pretty
lips
as
were
ever
seen
,
and
was
a
type
of
her
nature
and
happy
heart
.
<EOS>
The
skin
of
her
features
,
though
somewhat
dark
,
was
smooth
and
transparent
,
where
every
thought
seemed
to
make
a
passing
impression
,
as
the
light
breeze
upon
the
still
bosom
of
a
glassy
lake
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
were
tinted
with
the
rose
,
and
slightly
dimpled
;
and
her
mouth
was
set
with
a
beautiful
row
of
pearly
teeth
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
dark
and
sparkling
,
full
of
vivacity
and
animation
,
and
yet
so
softened
by
long
fringy
lashes
,
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
eternally
looking
love
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
a
glossy
,
light
brown
;
and
now
,
when
the
sunlight
fell
upon
it
(
for
her
hood
was
held
in
her
left
hand
)
,
it
gave
out
a
bright
,
golden
hue
.
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
,
she
wore
a
loose
riding
dress
,
carelessly
arranged
,
which
,
together
with
her
partially
dishevelled
hair
,
showed
that
her
mind
was
not
entirely
occupied
with
external
appearances
.
<EOS>
In
her
right
hand
she
held
the
bridle
rein
of
a
sleek
,
coal
-
black
steed
,
from
the
saddle
of
which
she
had
apparently
just
dismounted
;
and
by
her
side
,
lolling
as
if
from
hard
running
,
and
occasionally
looking
up
into
her
sweet
face
,
crouched
a
large
,
Newfoundland
dog
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
she
stood
gazing
into
the
limpid
stream
,
in
the
position
we
have
described
her
,
and
then
giving
her
head
a
shake
,
as
if
to
throw
back
the
ringlets
that
had
fallen
somewhat
forward
over
her
eyes
<EOS>
,
she
turned
to
her
canine
companion
,
and
,
in
a
clear
,
ringing
voice
,
as
if
addressing
an
individual
,
said:"So
,
my
Bowler
,
you
think
you
have
had
a
hard
chase
,
eh
?
<EOS>
In
faith
,
I
thought
Marston
's
legs
would
prove
too
much
for
you?"Here
she
turned
,
and
stepping
around
the
tree
,
patted
the
proudly
arched
neck
of
her
horse
:
while
the
dog
arose
,
and
approaching
her
,
rubbed
his
head
in
a
familiar
manner
against
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"Ah
<EOS>
,
Bowler
,
dog
,
you
look
tired
,
"
she
continued
,
stooping
down
and
playfully
caressing
the
brute
;
"
you
can
watch
,
better
than
keep
Marston
's
company
—
particularly
when
he
is
in
such
fine
running
trim
as
now
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Marston
,
"
she
added
,
to
the
beast
,
"
let
us
away
again
,
for
I
trust
you
are
now
refreshed
;
"
and
as
she
adjusted
her
dress
,
preparatory
to
mounting
,
she
struck
out
in
a
full
,
silvery
voice
,
in
the
followingSONG."Cheerily
,
merrily
,
off
we
go
,
Over
hill
and
plain
with
glee
,
And
the
swiftly
bounding
roe
<EOS>
,
Scarce
can
keep
our
company
;
Swift
,
as
arrow
in
its
flight
,
Speed
we
with
a
wild
delight
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Horse
and
rider
,
linked
in
one
—
Instinct
,
reason
,
both
cembined
—
This
to
guide
,
and
that
to
run
<EOS>
,
How
the
breezes
lag
behind
!
<EOS>
Cheerily
,
merrily
,
off
we
go
,
Swifter
than
the
bounding
roe
.
<EOS>
""Well
<EOS>
sung
,
pretty
Kate
Clarendon
,
"
said
a
deep
,
heavy
voice
behind
her
.
<EOS>
Kate
(
for
the
fair
being
we
have
described
was
none
other
than
our
heroine
)
,
who
was
in
the
act
of
mounting
,
started
and
wheeled
around
with
a
look
of
alarmed
surprise
;
while
the
horse
pricked
up
his
ears
,
and
the
dog
,
with
a
savage
growl
,
sprang
in
front
of
his
mistress
,
ready
to
defend
her
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
"Be
not
alarmed
,
fair
being
,
"
continued
the
strange
voice
;
and
at
the
same
instant
,
a
thick
cluster
of
bushes
,
growing
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
some
ten
paces
distant
,
was
parted
by
a
large
,
sunburnt
,
hairy
hand
,
and
a
tall
,
athletic
,
singular
looking
figure
emerged
therefrom
.
<EOS>
Toward
him
the
dog
now
sprang
furiously
;
but
the
next
moment
,
and
ere
he
had
gained
half
way
between
his
mistress
and
the
stranger
,
he
dropped
his
tail
between
his
legs
,
and
then
wagging
it
in
token
of
recognition
,
trotted
up
to
the
other
as
if
to
solicit
a
caress
.
<EOS>
The
new
comer
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
a
singular
looking
being
.
<EOS>
In
stature
he
was
tall
—
being
full
six
feet
—
and
in
person
very
ungainly
.
<EOS>
His
legs
and
arms
,
each
very
long
and
sinewy
,
were
joined
to
a
crooked
,
bony
body
.
<EOS>
He
had
tremendous
breadth
of
shoulder
,
from
which
he
tapered
down
to
his
feet
,
in
shape
not
unlike
a
wedge
.
<EOS>
His
neck
was
slim
,
but
full
of
large
muscles
and
veins
,
which
seemed
to
stand
out
from
it
like
cords
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
rather
large
,
even
for
his
body
,
with
features
very
coarse
,
and
,
to
one
unacquainted
with
him
,
exceedingly
repulsive
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
big
,
Roman
nose
,
sallow
,
sunken
cheeks
,
and
a
prominent
chin
,
covered
with
a
thick
,
coarse
,
dirty
,
grizzly
beard
,
which
extended
down
even
to
his
broad
,
hard
,
bronzed
bosom
,
and
added
,
to
his
otherwise
unpleasing
exterior
,
an
almost
ferocious
look
.
<EOS>
About
his
eyes
,
if
indeed
eyes
they
could
be
called
,
he
had
a
remarkable
appearance
;
and
a
stranger
,
at
first
sight
,
would
have
pronounced
him
totally
blind
.
<EOS>
The
lid
of
one
eye
was
closed
entirely
;
and
that
of
the
other
so
much
so
,
as
just
to
leave
a
dull
,
lead
-
colored
rim
of
the
lower
part
of
the
ball
visible
.
<EOS>
To
add
to
this
disagreeable
appearance
,
the
nearly
closed
lid
quivered
continually
,
like
the
leaf
of
the
aspen
;
while
the
ball
of
the
eye
rolled
around
in
every
direction
,
as
if
the
owner
were
suffering
mortal
agony
.
<EOS>
Above
these
lids
,
across
the
lower
portion
of
a
high
,
dark
,
wrinkled
forehead
,
extended
light
,
shaggy
brows
;
and
his
hair
,
which
was
also
light
,
coarse
and
matted
,
came
down
to
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
He
wore
no
hat
;
but
instead
,
a
strip
of
deerskin
,
painted
white
,
on
which
were
some
strange
devices
in
black
,
passed
across
his
brow
,
and
around
his
head
,
giving
to
him
an
air
of
mystery
.
<EOS>
His
costume
was
as
simple
as
an
Indian
's
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
a
frock
made
of
deerskin
,
with
the
hair
outside
,
which
was
worn
next
his
body
,
reached
to
his
knees
,
and
was
tightened
around
his
waist
by
a
rough
belt
.
<EOS>
To
this
frock
were
no
sleeves
,
and
,
in
consequence
,
his
brawny
arms
were
entirely
naked
;
neither
did
it
fit
close
around
his
neck
,
but
left
a
large
portion
of
his
breast
bare
also
.
<EOS>
On
his
feet
were
moccasins
,
which
completed
his
attire
;
and
in
his
belt
,
instead
of
the
usual
weapons
of
that
day
,
was
only
a
long
knife
.
<EOS>
Strapped
to
his
back
was
a
rude
knapsack
,
in
which
he
carried
jerk
,
a
blanket
,
and
various
implements
.
<EOS>
In
one
hand
(
the
nails
of
which
were
very
long
,
and
the
back
of
which
was
thickly
covered
with
hair
)
<EOS>
he
held
a
stick
of
witch
-
hazel
,
at
one
end
of
which
were
prongs
,
not
unlike
the
tines
of
a
fork
.
<EOS>
To
conclude
,
the
age
of
this
strange
personage
might
have
been
forty
,
or
perhaps
fifty
,
so
difficult
was
it
to
determine
by
his
rough
,
weather
-
beaten
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
voice
was
very
deep
,
a
little
inclined
to
the
sepulchral
—
and
his
language
,
ever
good
,
was
often
metaphorical
.
<EOS>
Such
is
a
description
of
the
personal
appearance
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
individuals
ever
known
.
<EOS>
Who
he
was
,
or
whence
<EOS>
he
came
,
none
could
tell
.
<EOS>
Among
the
settlers
of
the
early
times
,
he
appeared
mysteriously
,
and
as
mysteriously
disappeared
;
and
as
he
pretended
to
be
gifted
with
second
sight
,
or
a
sight
into
futurity
,
there
were
not
wanting
those
superstitious
enough
to
believe
him
either
a
supernatural
being
,
or
leagued
with
the
devil
.
<EOS>
This
feeling
he
took
care
to
foster
,
by
his
acts
,
such
as
incantations
,
strange
mutterrings
to
himself
,
occasionally
a
wild
manner
,
and
eccentricities
of
various
kinds
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
,
that
,
in
those
times
,
he
should
excite
a
feeling
of
awe
and
superstition
;
for
often
,
when
thought
far
distant
,
would
he
make
his
appearance
among
a
group
of
individuals
,
who
had
perchance
been
conversing
of
him
;
and
this
so
suddenly
,
many
times
,
as
really
to
alarm
them
;
and
then
again
,
ere
any
one
was
aware
how
,
as
suddenly
disappear
.
<EOS>
He
was
sometimes
on
the
pretended
search
for
mines
or
money
,
and
not
unfrequently
did
he
excite
persons
to
dig
for
treasures
.
<EOS>
He
told
fortunes
,
occasionally
,
and
occasionally
,
too
,
uttered
prophesies
and
prophetic
warnings
.
<EOS>
Among
the
whites
he
came
and
went
as
he
chose
,
and
also
among
the
savages
,
who
respected
him
as
a
"
great
medicine
"
and
prophet
—
to
injure
whom
would
be
to
offend
the
Great
Spirit
.
<EOS>
By
the
latter
he
was
called
Kitchochobeka
,
or
Great
Medicine
;
and
by
the
former
,
Blind
Luther
,
the
Necromancer
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Kate
saw
his
person
in
full
,
she
said
,
with
a
gay
laugh
:
"
'
Pon
my
word
,
Luther
,
for
once
you
startled
me
,
for
I
deemed
myself
entirely
alone
.
<EOS>
""We
are
never
alone
,
Kate
,
"
returned
the
other
,
shaking
his
head
gravely
;
"
the
spirits
of
the
dead
are
always
with
us
.
<EOS>
""O
,
come
,
come
,
"
rejoined
the
fair
girl
,
tossing
her
head
gaily
,
though
not
without
a
perceptible
shade
of
uneasiness
in
her
countenance
:
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Luther
,
do
not
seek
to
make
me
superstitious
;
you
can
find
plenty
of
proselytes
without
me
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
—
how
long
have
you
been
concealed
in
you
thicket?""As
long
as
it
would
take
you
to
count
ten
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
how
got
you
there
so
silently?""By
my
will
,
and
<EOS>
the
wings
of
the
wind
.
<EOS>
""By
your
will
,
for
one
thing
,
most
undoubtedly
;
but
as
to
the
wings
of
the
wind
—
why
,
I
rather
think
that
a
joke
of
yours
—
eh
,
my
conjuror
?
"
and
the
gay
girl
closed
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
to
whom
the
future
is
as
an
open
scroll
,
legibly
written
,
never
stoops
to
joke
,
"
was
the
grave
reply
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
do
you
really
pretend
to
know
the
future
,
in
sincere
<EOS>
earnest?""Do
you
pretend
to
know
the
voice
of
your
own
mother
,
girl?""But
now
,
"
said
Kate
,
in
a
coaxing
,
coquettish
tone
,
"
be
honest
,
Luther
,
for
once
,
now
do
,
and
tell
me
—
have
you
any
faith
in
yourself
?
<EOS>
All
in
confidence
,
you
know
,
between
you
and
I
;
for
of
course
I
will
never
mention
it
.
<EOS>
O
no
,
I
will
give
you
a
proud
example
of
a
woman
keeping
a
secret
;
"
and
the
black
eyes
of
fairy
Kate
sparkled
with
a
roguish
expression
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
jest
,
girl
,
"
replied
the
other
,
solemnly
,
and
in
an
offended
tone
,
"
with
the
great
mysteries
of
nature
.
<EOS>
Have
I
faith
in
myself
?
<EOS>
Have
you
faith
in
what
you
behold
?
<EOS>
Look
yonder
,
and
tell
me
what
you
see
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
pointed
with
his
finger
toward
the
great
luminary
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"I
behold
trees
,
and
leaves
,
and
birds
,
the
sky
and
sun
,
"
answered
Kate
,
who
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
finger
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
do
you
believe
the
things
you
nave
named
really
exist?""Most
<EOS>
assuredly
I
do
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
do
you
<EOS>
so
believe?""Because
I
see
them
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
see
you
nothing
more?""Nothing
of
importance
.
<EOS>
""I
do
,
"
rejoined
the
Necromancer
,
in
a
guttural
voice
,
so
changed
from
the
tone
in
which
he
had
just
been
conversing
,
that
Kate
turned
to
him
with
an
involuntary
expression
of
surprise
and
wonder
;
which
was
not
lessened
,
by
observing
him
standing
with
his
gaze
fixed
on
high
,
in
wrapt
meditation
,
while
every
feature
seemed
expressive
of
some
strange
sight
,
and
his
lips
moved
as
if
uttering
words
,
though
no
sound
issued
from
them
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
what
do
you
see
,
strange
man
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
maiden
,
after
a
minute
's
pause
,
while
a
thrill
of
mysterious
awe
made
her
blood
creep
coldly
through
her
veins
.
<EOS>
"A
century
of
futurity
,
and
God
permitting
man
to
seize
upon
the
elements
and
harness
them
to
his
task
,
"
answered
Luther
,
in
a
solemn
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
behold
,
springing
from
the
earth
,
only
a
few
miles
distant
,
a
great
city
.
<EOS>
I
behold
the
light
and
smoke
of
its
fires
,
and
hear
the
voices
of
many
thousand
inhabitants
,
and
the
clink
of
the
hammers
of
industry
,
and
see
it
it
gradually
spreading
itself
,
enlarging
on
every
hand
,
as
the
eagle
when
he
raises
his
wings
to
soar
on
high
.
<EOS>
I
behold
the
dust
of
the
earth
put
into
a
great
crucible
,
and
lo
!
<EOS>
it
comes
forth
another
substance
.
<EOS>
It
is
seized
,
and
wrought
upon
,
and
shapcd
like
no
living
thing
that
now
exists
;
and
yet
it
is
to
be
a
thing
of
life
and
motion
,
with
rolling
legs
,
and
speed
beyond
the
speed
of
the
deer
,
endurance
beyond
calculation
,
and
strength
exceeding
a
hundred
horse
.
<EOS>
Its
breath
,
its
vitality
,
its
soul
,
is
vapor
;
and
though
it
travels
with
tearing
velocity
,
through
mountains
,
over
streams
,
hollows
and
plains
,
dragging
a
thousand
times
its
own
weight
behind
it
,
yet
so
gentle
is
it
,
when
properly
handled
,
that
a
child
can
guide
and
command
it
;
but
once
let
it
get
the
upper
hand
,
and
the
strength
of
ten
thousand
men
would
be
no
more
to
it
than
a
thread
to
a
ship
in
the
gale
.
<EOS>
I
behold
,
too
,
<EOS>
the
great
timbers
of
the
forest
transformed
to
leviathans
,
whose
vital
power
is
also
vapot
,
and
which
,
with
spoutings
that
can
be
heard
afar
off
,
glide
swiftly
over
the
bosom
of
rivers
,
against
wind
and
tide
,
and
plow
foaming
channels
in
the
mighty
deep
,
and
carry
the
sons
of
earth
in
their
great
bosoms
.
<EOS>
I
behold
the
red
lightning
,
also
,
drawn
from
the
thunder
-
car
of
heaven
,
and
sent
courier
throughout
the
Christian
world
.
<EOS>
I
behold
the
great
blue
vault
of
heaven
turned
to
an
ocean
,
over
which
sail
ten
thousand
ves
sels
,
looking
down
upon
,
forests
and
mountains
,
that
now
to
us
seem
almost
impassable
barriers
.
<EOS>
And
I
behold
plague
,
and
famine
,
and
war
,
and
blood
,
and
fire
,
and
flood
,
and
desolation
,
and
woe
,
and
crime
,
stalking
apace
,
by
whose
dread
calls
and
thunderings
,
thrones
totter
,
governments
of
tyrants
are
overthrown
,
and
liberty
shoots
upward
,
like
a
beautiful
tree
,
and
spreads
its
ever
-
green
branches
abroad
to
the
uttermost
ends
of
the
earth
,
beneath
which
all
nations
at
last
repose
in
security
,
and
smoke
together
the
calumet
of
peace
.
<EOS>
And
the
vision
has
gone
from
me
—
and
all
is
darkness
—
and
I
behold
no
more
—
for
the
great
seal
of
obscurity
is
now
set
upon
my
sight
.
<EOS>
"During
<EOS>
this
speech
of
Blind
Luther
,
his
countenance
was
lighted
up
with
the
fires
of
an
enthusiastic
soul
,
until
in
part
it
had
the
sublime
look
we
conceive
the
seers
to
have
had
of
old
,
when
they
uttered
those
great
and
mystic
truths
,
which
shall
descend
to
all
generations
;
and
our
fair
heroine
gazed
upon
him
in
wonder
,
not
unmingled
with
admiration
;
for
there
was
something
lofty
and
elevating
in
his
manner
and
strange
eloquence
.
<EOS>
As
he
concluded
,
he
waved
his
hand
with
a
majestic
gesture
,
and
then
turned
suddenly
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
think
me
demented
—
or
perhaps
an
idiot
;
yet
what
I
have
just
uttered
,
is
written
on
the
great
seal
of
the
nineteenth
century
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
understand
it
—
you
think
me
an
impostor
,
perhaps?""No
,
Luther
,
"
answered
Kate
,
"
not
an
impostor
;
but
I
fear
,
at
times
,
you
let
a
wild
imagination
get
the
better
of
your
reasoning
powers
.
<EOS>
""It
is
seldom
,
"
returned
Luther
,
"
that
I
condescend
to
experiment
,
in
order
to
convince
frail
mortality
<EOS>
I
am
what
I
pretend
;
but
in
the
present
instance
I
shall
do
so
;
as
it
is
necessary
,
for
your
future
welfare
,
that
you
believe
in
me
,
and
adhere
to
my
instructions
.
<EOS>
Behold
my
power!"As
<EOS>
he
concluded
,
he
brought
the
fore
-
finger
of
his
right
hand
in
front
of
his
face
,
and
strode
slowly
toward
Kate
,
who
fixed
her
gaze
upon
him
in
curious
wonder
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
reached
within
a
pace
of
her
,
he
paused
,
fastened
his
eye
upon
hers
for
a
moment
,
and
said:"You
are
now
under
the
influence
of
my
spirit
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
power
to
move
a
limb
without
my
consent
.
<EOS>
"Kate
made
an
effort
to
move
,
but
found
,
in
truth
,
she
had
not
the
command
of
a
single
muscle
.
<EOS>
She
was
like
a
rock
.
<EOS>
Not
even
her
eyes
<EOS>
could
she
turn
away
from
that
strange
being
who
stood
before
her
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
superstitious
—
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
secretly
acknowledged
a
power
in
man
beyond
the
scope
of
reason
.
<EOS>
As
she
thought
upon
it
,
her
blood
ran
cold
,
and
cold
drops
of
perspiration
stood
upon
her
face
and
body
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
you
believe
,
"
said
the
Necromancer
,
at
length
,
waving
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"I
believe
you
are
a
wonderful
being
,
"
answered
the
other
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"Yet
<EOS>
fear
me
not
girl
;
I
am
your
friend
.
<EOS>
Open
me
your
hand
.
<EOS>
"Gazing
<EOS>
for
a
few
moments
into
the
soft
,
white
palm
,
which
Kate
,
in
compliance
with
his
request
,
now
extended
toward
him
,
he
said
,
solemnly:"Eventful
destiny
is
thine
—
thou
of
the
sunny
locks
,
fairy
form
,
and
laughing
eye
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
proceeded
to
chant
the
following
mystical
lines:"Where
<EOS>
the
parent
stem
is
broken,'Neath
<EOS>
the
tree
that
's
old
and
oaken
—
Where
the
night
-
wind
cool
is
blowing
,
O'er
the
life
-
blood
warmly
flowing
—
By
unchanging
Fate
's
decree
,
And
<EOS>
Almighty
Destiny
,
One
shall
stand
thou
sawest
never
,
Yet
shall
see
and
love
forever
:
And
he
unto
thy
spirit
,
Shall
a
legal
right
inherit
:
Yet
moons
shall
come
and
wane
,
And
the
harvest
leave
the
plain
,
And
the
earth
be
green
again
,
And
tribulations
soreShall
befall
thee
o'er
and
o'et
—
<EOS>
Ere
<EOS>
thy
evil
all
be
mated
,
And
thy
web
of
joy
completed
.
<EOS>
Come
,
ye
fates
,
and
set
the
seal
,
On
what
I
of
ye
reveal!"He
paused
,
and
struck
the
palms
of
his
hands
three
times
together
.
<EOS>
"These
<EOS>
are
strange
words
,
Luther
,
"
said
Kate
,
"
and
I
do
not
understand
them
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
shalt
understand
all
in
time
,
"
answered
the
other
.
<EOS>
"When
sorrows
dark
<EOS>
do
weigh
thee
down
<EOS>
,
Thou
shalt
behold
<EOS>
this
mystic
crown;[Here
he
touched
the
band
around
his
head]"And
in
the
depths
of
deepest
woe
,
<EOS>
The
mysteries
I
have
told
thee
,
know
;
<EOS>
Whate'er
thy
fortune
,
nobly
bear
,
And
yield
thee
never
to
despair
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
mission
first
is
ended
,
and
so
I
leave
thee
.
<EOS>
Farewell!"He
waved
his
hand
,
and
turned
to
depart
;
but
just
as
he
did
so
,
Kate
uttered
a
piercing
scream
,
and
wheeling
suddenly
around
,
Luther
perceived
her
features
distorted
with
horror
—
for
notwithstanding
his
apparent
blindnes
,
he
could
see
very
distinctly
.
<EOS>
She
was
looking
upward
,
at
an
angle
of
sixty
degrees
;
and
turning
his
own
gaze
in
that
direction
<EOS>
,
he
beheld
,
to
his
amazement
and
alarm
,
the
fiery
,
glaring
eyeballs
of
a
large
panther
,
crouched
on
a
neighboring
tree
,
and
just
in
the
act
of
springing
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
;
and
catching
Kate
by
the
arm
,
as
though
she
were
an
infant
,
he
swung
her
upon
the
back
of
her
coal
black
steed
,
and
shouted
:
"
Away
!
<EOS>
away!"The
<EOS>
next
moment
,
horse
and
rider
were
bounding
over
the
plain
,
and
man
and
beast
were
closing
together
for
the
death
struggle
;
for
in
his
haste
to
spring
,
that
his
prey
might
not
escape
him
,
the
panther
had
fallen
a
little
short
of
Luther
,
who
,
dodging
quickly
around
the
tree
,
had
thus
time
to
draw
his
knife
and
prepare
himself
for
defense
.
<EOS>
As
to
Kate
,
knowing
that
she
could
render
Blind
Luther
no
personal
assistance
,
she
rode
swiftly
to
an
open
field
,
some
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
,
where
several
laborers
were
at
work
,
to
whom
she
quickly
made
known
the
peril
of
the
Necromancer
.
<EOS>
Seizing
their
rifles
,
which
were
always
their
companions
,
some
five
or
six
hardy
fellows
started
immediately
to
the
assistance
of
Blind
Luther
(
whom
all
knew
and
respected
)
,
preceded
by
Kate
herself
.
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
at
the
spot
,
to
their
astonishment
,
they
found
the
panther
lying
dead
,
but
not
a
single
trace
of
his
opponent
.
<EOS>
"He
's
not
here
now
,
"
said
one
.
<EOS>
"He
's
the
devil
,
"
returned
another
.
<EOS>
"Wonderful
<EOS>
being
,
"
observed
a
third
.
<EOS>
Uttering
such
,
and
similar
remarks
,
they
spent
some
half
an
hour
in
examining
the
animal
,
the
ground
round
about
,
and
then
returned
to
their
labors
,
more
than
ever
convinced
that
Blind
Luther
was
something
superhuman
.
<EOS>
As
for
Kate
,
she
explained
to
the
others
how
Luther
had
suddenly
appeared
to
her
,
and
the
manner
of
their
separation
;
but
of
their
conversation
she
told
nothing
;
and
her
thoughts
on
what
she
had
seen
and
heard
she
kept
to
herself
.
<EOS>
As
she
rode
slowly
over
the
plain
,
however
,
to
the
dwelling
of
her
father
,
some
half
a
mile
distant
,
a
close
observer
might
have
seen
a
sedateness
on
her
countenance
,
a
sadness
in
her
eye
,
that
accorded
but
ill
with
her
naturally
light
-
hearted
,
merry
look
.

George
Clarendon
,
the
father
of
our
fair
heroine
,
was
a
native
of
eastern
Pennsylvania
,
and
only
son
of
a
gentleman
,
who
,
to
use
the
phrase
,
was
"
well
to
do
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
At
an
early
age
,
he
was
sent
to
school
in
Philadelphia
,
where
he
received
a
good
education
,
and
became
acquainted
with
a
merchant
's
daughter
,
between
whom
and
himself
sprang
up
an
intimacy
,
which
,
in
course
of
time
,
ripened
into
an
ardent
passion
,
and
was
at
last
productive
of
a
happy
marriage
.
<EOS>
Not
having
any
set
occupation
,
he
entered
into
partnership
with
his
father
-
in
-
law
;
and
for
many
years
afterward
,
the
firm
of
Cooly
&
Clarendon
was
extensively
known
and
respected
.
<EOS>
During
this
time
,
a
daughter
was
added
to
the
family
—
the
bright
,
rosy
,
mirth
-
loving
Kate
,
whom
we
have
just
described
,
and
on
whom
both
parents
doated
fondly
,
looking
upon
her
as
an
angel
sent
from
Heaven
to
minister
to
their
happiness
.
<EOS>
Years
rolled
onward
,
and
all
went
smoothly
;
and
of
course
Kate
,
who
gave
promise
of
making
a
beautiful
and
intelligent
woman
,
was
not
neglected
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
became
of
a
suitable
age
,
she
was
sent
to
school
,
and
every
means
possible
taken
to
secure
her
a
pol
ished
education
—
which
she
,
to
her
praise
be
it
said
,
was
not
slow
to
profit
by
.
<EOS>
At
the
age
of
fourteen
,
she
returned
to
her
parents
.
<EOS>
At
fifteen
,
extensive
preparations
were
being
set
on
foot
for
giving
a
grand
party
,
that
she
might
make
her
debut
in
society
;
but
ere
the
consummation
of
this
event
,
the
firm
of
Cooly
&
Clarendon
,
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
every
one
,
suddenly
failed
.
<EOS>
This
was
caused
by
the
failure
of
a
large
mercantile
house
in
England
,
with
which
our
Philadelphians
had
a
too
close
business
connection
.
<EOS>
After
having
honorably
discharged
their
debts
,
by
other
property
in
their
posession
,
Clarendon
and
his
partner
found
they
had
<EOS>
but
little
left
them
;
and
the
former
at
once
resolved
to
take
what
means
he
had
,
and
set
out
for
the
West
forthwith
<EOS>
;
there
to
embrace
the
more
sure
,
if
not
more
profitable
,
occupation
of
agriculture
.
<EOS>
Having
completed
his
arrangements
,
he
bid
adieu
to
his
friends
,
and
departed
with
his
family
,
on
a
journey
of
adventure
to
the
frontiers
.
<EOS>
His
first
stopping
place
was
Pittsburgh
;
but
not
satisfied
with
the
appearance
of
the
town
,
he
joined
a
party
descending
the
river
,
and
landed
at
Marietta
Still
dissatisfied
,
he
joined
the
party
of
Major
Stites
,
and
was
one
of
the
first
who
landed
at
the
mouth
of
the
Little
Miami
,
on
the
ground
we
have
before
described
.
<EOS>
About
half
,
or
perhaps
three
-
fourths
of
a
mile
above
the
mouth
of
the
Miami
,
and
a
hundred
rods
west
of
this
stream
,
was
the
spot
selected
by
Clarendon
for
his
residence
.
<EOS>
Here
,
soon
after
his
arrival
,
he
erected
a
comfortable
log
-
cabin
,
whither
he
soon
removed
his
wife
and
daughter
,
who
meantime
had
remained
at
Marietta
.
<EOS>
As
must
naturally
be
supposed
,
it
was
anything
but
agreeable
to
people
brought
up
in
the
refined
manner
of
the
Clarendons
,
and
used
all
their
lives
to
luxury
,
to
be
changed
so
suddenly
from
their
former
enjoyments
,
to
all
the
rough
,
rude
customs
of
pioneer
life
;
and
from
a
state
of
security
and
ease
,
be
transported
to
one
of
danger
and
hardship
.
<EOS>
But
they
had
counted
the
cost
beforehand
,
and
prepared
themselves
for
the
worst
;
so
that
the
change
proved
less
severe
than
it
might
otherwise
have
done
.
<EOS>
Happiness
is
not
to
be
found
in
externals
—
it
lies
within
,
and
depends
altogether
upon
the
mind
—
and
as
the
Clarendons
,
instead
of
fretting
and
complaining
of
what
they
could
not
alter
,
strove
to
look
upon
everything
as
happening
for
the
best
,
and
sought
to
be
cheerful
and
to
cheer
each
other
with
words
of
hope
and
encouragement
,
so
they
soon
found
themselves
in
possession
of
enjoyments
beyond
what
at
first
thought
seemed
possible
for
them
to
obtain
.
<EOS>
As
for
Kate
,
always
light
-
hearted
and
merry
,
she
was
not
slow
in
finding
means
to
make
life
pass
gaily
and
agreeably
,
even
in
the
wilds
of
the
frontiers
.
<EOS>
She
was
exceedingly
fond
of
the
art
eques
train
;
and
that
she
might
not
be
deprived
of
all
the
priviliges
to
which
fortune
had
hitherto
entitled
her
,
her
father
purchased
the
steed
,
on
which
the
reader
has
already
seen
her
mounted
,
and
on
which
it
was
her
delight
to
scour
the
surrounding
country
,
accompanied
by
the
playmate
of
her
youth
,
the
faithful
Bowler
.
<EOS>
Kate
soon
grew
to
like
her
new
home
,
and
to
be
the
favorite
of
every
one
who
knew
her
.
<EOS>
Her
frank
,
cheerful
,
merry
disposition
and
winning
ways
,
won
the
hearts
of
all
;
and
there
was
not
a
man
,
woman
or
child
,
in
the
village
of
Columbia
,
but
spoke
of
her
in
the
highest
terms
of
praise
;
nor
one
whose
face
did
not
grow
brighter
at
her
coming
.
<EOS>
She
ever
had
a
cheerful
word
and
a
smile
for
all
,
either
young
or
old
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
belle
of
the
village
,
by
general
acclamation
,
and
yet
none
were
envious
.
<EOS>
Whatever
Kate
did
was
perfectly
right
;
and
as
to
the
young
men
,
the
greatest
poltroon
of
them
all
would
have
put
his
life
in
jeopardy
to
gratify
her
slightest
wish
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
queen
,
and
reigned
supreme
;
and
though
England
's
sovereign
of
modern
days
may
possess
more
power
and
splendor
,
yet
Victoria
,
in
the
height
of
her
popularity
,
never
had
admirers
more
ardent
,
nor
subjects
more
devoted
,
than
had
simple
Kate
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
Our
fair
heroine
had
but
<EOS>
one
fault
—
<EOS>
perhaps
this
was
not
a
fault
,
strictly
speaking
—
but
if
so
,
it
was
a
fault
of
circumstances
—
one
of
which
<EOS>
almost
every
pretty
woman
is
guilty
—
and
one
which
,
if
not
carried
to
extremes
,
is
certainly
pardonable
:
<EOS>
she
was
,
in
a
measure
,
a
coquette
.
<EOS>
Among
the
villagers
she
had
many
admirers
,
of
whom
there
were
three
,
genteel
young
men
,
special
suitors
for
her
hand
,
at
the
opening
,
of
our
story
.
<EOS>
For
these
three
,
it
was
rumored
,
Kate
held
a
preference
over
all
others
;
but
which
one
of
the
three
was
most
admired
by
the
fair
girl
,
none
could
tell
—
not
even
themselves
—
for
to
-
day
it
was
apparently
this
one
,
and
the
next
day
that
,
so
that
each
was
alternately
buoyed
up
with
hope
,
and
depressed
by
disappointment
.
<EOS>
All
the
gossips
contended
she
had
a
choice
;
but
the
difficulty
lay
in
finding
out
the
favored
one
.
<EOS>
Whenever
Kate
was
importuned
on
the
subject
herself
,
she
invariably
replied
with
a
laugh
,
that
she
liked
them
all
,
but
that
her
choice
was
neither
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
not
believed
;
and
those
who
strove
to
keep
a
record
of
every
event
transpiring
in
the
world
of
Columbia
,
were
daily
on
the
look
-
out
for
the
news
of
a
wedding
—
of
beholding
the
merry
Kate
caught
in
the
noose
Hymenial
.
<EOS>
The
father
of
Kate
,
was
a
man
some
forty
years
of
age
,
large
and
well
-
proportioned
,
with
a
noble
,
manly
,
handsome
countenance
,
and
manners
dignified
and
pleasing
.
<EOS>
Among
the
villagers
he
was
very
popular
;
and
being
a
man
of
fine
intellect
and
education
,
he
was
looked
up
to
,
by
most
,
with
much
deference
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
His
wife
was
a
mild
,
quiet
lady
,
of
a
sweet
,
benevolent
disposition
,
a
few
years
his
junior
,
who
also
stood
high
in
the
estimation
of
the
people
;
so
that
,
among
all
the
villagers
,
there
was
,
probably
,
no
family
that
en
joyed
a
greater
share
of
genuine
,
heart
-
felt
popularity
,
than
the
Clarendons
.
<EOS>
The
residence
of
the
Clarendons
was
a
well
-
constructed
double
cabin
,
with
puncheon
floors
and
clap
-
board
roof
.
<EOS>
Their
furuiture
,
of
course
,
was
of
the
plainest
description
;
for
in
those
days
,
and
in
this
section
of
country
,
it
was
impossible
to
have
other
.
<EOS>
They
had
some
good
clothing
,
and
a
number
of
small
articles
of
value
,
which
they
had
brought
with
them
from
the
East
.
<EOS>
The
cabin
itself
stood
upon
a
very
slight
knoll
,
and
fronted
the
west
,
surrounded
by
a
tall
grove
of
beech
,
sugar
-
tree
,
locust
,
&
c.—with
<EOS>
the
exception
of
an
acre
in
the
rear
,
that
had
been
cut
away
,
and
the
ground
turned
into
a
handsome
garden
of
vegetables
and
flowers
.
<EOS>
There
seemed
but
one
fault
in
the
whole
arrangement
;
and
that
was
,
that
the
dweliing
was
too
much
exposed
—
its
nearest
neighbor
being
at
the
distance
of
nearly
half
a
mile
.
<EOS>
This
was
remarked
upon
by
some
of
the
settlers
at
the
time
of
its
erection
;
but
Clarendon
himself
declared
that
he
had
no
apprehension
,
and
the
subject
was
never
again
referred
to
.
<EOS>
Time
rolled
on
smoothly
,
and
the
Clarendons
,
at
the
date
of
our
story
,
found
themselves
once
more
in
rather
prosperous
circumstances
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
is
with
Kate
we
have
for
<EOS>
the
present
especially
to
do
,
we
will
return
to
her
forthwith
.

CHAPTER
IV.Bright
as
the

And

But
then
her
face
,
So
lovely
,
yet
so
arch
—
so
full
of
mirth
,
The
overflowing
of
an
innocent
heart.—Rogers
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
youthful
mind
of
Kate
,
the
words
of
the
Necromancer
made
a
deep
impression
;
and
for
several
days
after
their
interview
,
it
was
noticed
by
her
friends
,
with
some
concern
,
that
,
contrary
to
her
usual
manner
,
she
appeared
sad
,
thoughtful
,
and
even
abstracted
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
was
known
she
had
received
a
severe
fright
from
the
panther
,
the
cause
was
attributed
to
this
,
and
every
one
looked
to
see
it
gradually
wear
off
,
and
behold
her
again
bright
with
her
own
cheerful
,
happy
smile
.
<EOS>
Wear
off
the
sadness
certainly
did
;
and
a
week
from
the
event
we
have
chronicled
,
Kate
appeared
the
same
smiling
,
joyous
being
as
before
.
<EOS>
About
this
time
,
the
young
people
of
Columbia
decided
on
having
a
ball
—
which
,
if
it
could
not
rival
in
splendor
some
in
the
older
settlements
,
might
,
at
least
,
in
heart
-
felt
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
an
appropriate
place
was
selected
,
a
fiddler
engaged
,
and
every
preparation
thought
necessary
for
the
coming
event
speedily
set
on
foot
.
<EOS>
The
building
chosen
for
the
purpose
,
was
a
new
double
cabin
,
which
had
just
been
completed
,
and
only
waited
this
kind
of
christening
,
as
some
of
them
termed
it
,
for
the
young
couple
,
who
were
to
tenant
it
,
to
take
up
their
abode
therein
.
<EOS>
Flowers
of
all
hues
,
together
with
sprigs
of
cedar
,
were
collected
;
and
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
decorated
with
hangings
of
green
,
and
with
beautiful
festoons
and
boquets
.
<EOS>
In
one
apartment
a
long
table
was
spread
,
and
covered
with
such
delicacies
as
the
country
then
afforded
;
and
many
dishes
there
were
(
composed
of
deer
,
bear
and
buffalo
meat
)
,
which
,
among
us
of
the
present
day
,
would
be
considered
great
rarities
.
<EOS>
An
old
banner
of
stars
and
stripes
(
that
had
been
somewhat
torn
and
riddled
in
the
long
and
sanguinary
struggle
of
the
Revolution
,
which
belonged
to
one
of
the
settlers
,
who
had
himself
carried
it
in
the
heat
of
battle
,
and
which
was
held
in
great
veneration
by
all
)
was
procured
and
arched
over
the
door
of
entrance
;
and
not
all
the
purple
and
crimson
robes
of
royalty
,
could
have
excited
one
tithe
of
the
pride
in
the
bosoms
of
those
simple
-
minded
pioneers
,
than
did
this
soiled
and
dirt
-
begrimmed
bunting
of
"
red
,
white
and
blue
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
belle
of
the
ball
was
,
of
course
,
to
be
our
youthful
Kate
;
and
as
she
was
to
be
escorted
thither
by
one
individual
only
,
and
as
there
were
three
young
men
who
laid
equal
claims
to
the
honor
of
being
her
beau
-
gallant
for
the
occasion
,
there
was
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
some
peculiar
sensations
excited
in
the
breasts
of
each
,
in
regard
to
which
should
be
the
favored
one
.
<EOS>
Unwilling
to
take
an
undue
advantage
of
each
other
,
they
met
to
decide
the
matter
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
Among
other
things
,
one
proposed
that
they
should
draw
lots
for
the
preference
;
another
,
that
they
should
run
a
race
for
it
;
and
the
third
and
last
,
that
they
should
all
go
in
a
body
together
,
and
allow
her
to
make
her
own
selection
.
<EOS>
This
last
proposition
was
finally
agreed
to
,
as
the
point
at
issue
would
,
in
this
way
,
be
decided
by
the
girl
herself
;
and
,
consequently
,
each
would
know
which
was
the
most
favored
suitor
of
the
three
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
next
morning
,
which
was
a
beautiful
one
indeed
,
and
the
third
preceding
the
gala
night
,
our
three
lovers
mounted
themselves
on
fine
horses
,
and
together
rode
over
the
plain
toward
the
residence
of
their
fair
umpire
,
to
have
the
pending
question
decided
by
her
own
sweet
lips
and
voice
—
each
to
be
made
happy
or
miserable
,
as
the
case
might
turn
out
.
<EOS>
Kate
was
seated
in
the
door
of
her
cot
,
gazing
upon
the
lofty
old
trees
,
that
threw
their
deep
,
cool
shadows
over
the
luxuriant
earth
beneath
,
watching
the
birds
that
hopped
from
branch
to
branch
,
and
listening
to
their
happy
,
musical
,
artless
songs
,
the
while
humming
some
tune
herself
,
in
a
corresponding
strain
of
melody
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
tones
of
her
voice
swelled
out
,
rich
and
clear
,
in
the
followingSONG
.
<EOS>
"
Sing

Through

And

<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Kate
concluded
,
she
leisurely
cast
her
eyes
over
the
plain
,
and
,
as
she
did
so
,
an
observer
might
have
seen
them
widen
,
brighten
and
twinkle
with
an
expression
of
quiet
,
mischievous
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Turning
to
her
mother
,
who
was
seated
behind
her
some
little
distance
,
within
the
cottage
,
needle
-
work
in
hand
,
she
said
,
gaily:"I
do
wonder
,
mother
,
whether
you
and
I
are
going
to
be
taken
by
storm
,
or
whether
it
be
me
alone
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
so
,
Kate
?
"
inquired
Mrs.
Clarendon
.
"Why
,
yonder
come
three
gallant
gentlemen
,
all
mounted
,
who
individually
honor
me
with
their
addresses
and
words
of
flattery
.
<EOS>
One
alone
,
or
one
at
a
time
,
is
enough
,
Heaven
knows!—but
,
heigh
-
ho
,
here
are
three
together
—
what
shall
I
do?"Well
,
Kate
,
if
you
would
follow
my
instructions
,
you
would
not
be
troubled
this
way
,
"
returned
the
mother
of
our
heroine
,
reprovingly
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
make
a
selection
,
and
dismiss
the
others
?
<EOS>
It
does
not
look
well
to
see
a
young
lady
with
too
many
beaux
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
which
shall
I
select
,
dearest
mother
mine
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Kate
,
with
a
roguish
smile
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
should
I
know
!
<EOS>
Select
the
one
you
esteem
the
most
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
suppose
they
are
all
alike
in
my
estimation?""Why
,
then
,
you
do
not
love
any
,
and
so
discharge
them
all
.
<EOS>
""Discharge
them
,
indeed
!
"
rejoined
Kate
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
Why
they
would
all
go
mad
,
and
hang
or
drown
themselves
—
that
is
,
if
I
may
believe
their
assurances
—
and
then
what
awful
crimes
would
be
laid
to
my
charge
,
and
what
a
weight
would
eternally
be
on
my
conscience!""Go
to
,
Kate
,
"
<EOS>
replied
her
mother
,
smiling
;
"
there
is
no
use
in
trying
to
do
anything
with
you
,
for
you
turn
everything
into
ridicule
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
spoiled
child
,
Kate
,
I
fear
.
<EOS>
""Heigh
-
ho
!
<EOS>
I
fear
so
,
too
,
"
rejoined
Kate
,
drawing
a
long
sigh
,
and
pretending
to
be
very
serious
,
although
she
could
scarcely
refrain
from
a
burst
of
merriment
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
say
,
mother
,
would
I
not
be
worse
spoiled
indeed
,
should
I
discharge
all
these
gay
youths
,
and
have
not
a
single
one
left
to
help
myself
with
?
<EOS>
O
,
would
not
that
be
awful
!
"
<EOS>
And
Kate
clasped
her
hands
together
,
with
a
stage
struck
air
,
and
rolled
her
eyes
upward
in
mock
solemnity
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
a
care
,
child
,
or
<EOS>
that
will
be
your
fate
in
earnest
,
"
said
her
mother
,
her
own
risible
muscles
requiring
a
great
effort
to
keep
them
quiet
,
as
she
gazed
upon
her
daughter
.
"
<EOS>
Have
a
care
,
Kate
,
or
they
will
discharge
themselves
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
think
so
,
mother
?
<EOS>
O
,
wonderful
youths
!
<EOS>
how
I
envy
them
such
firmness
of
decision
.
<EOS>
""Many
<EOS>
a
gay
coquette
has
died
an
old
maid
,
despised
and
rejected
by
those
she
once
flirted
with
,
and
rejected
herself
,
"
pursued
Mrs.
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
"
Better
take
warning
in
time
daughter
mine
.
<EOS>
""An
old
maid
!
"
exclaimed
Kate
,
in
mock
horror
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
throwing
about
her
sunny
curls
in
wanton
profusion
.
<EOS>
"
O
,
horrible
fate
—
horrible
!
<EOS>
To
think
of
living
without
a
lord
to
control
all
one
's
actions
—
to
hold
the
purse
—
to
give
one
grave
advice
on
the
most
trifling
subjects
—
to
tell
one
how
to
dress
—
where
one
may
go
—
when
one
must
stay
at
home;—to
think
of
living
without
a
family
to
slave
for
—
to
have
no
one
to
take
care
of
<EOS>
but
one
's
self:—oh
!
<EOS>
this
must
be
horrible
!
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
must
not
think
of
such
a
thing
;
and
as
here
come
my
cavalier
gallants
,
I
will
strive
to
secure
one
,
at
least
,
in
time
to
save
me
from
a
destiny
so
awful
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Kate
concluded
,
the
three
young
men
we
have
alluded
to
,
rode
up
to
the
door
,
and
each
made
his
obeisance
,
and
spoke
his
morning
salutation
.
<EOS>
"Good
morning
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Kate
,
in
return
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
,
I
know
not
what
to
think
of
beholding
you
three
together
.
<EOS>
Are
you
on
a
mission
of
peace
or
blood?""Peace
,
most
decidedly
,
"
answered
the
foremost
,
a
fine
,
comely
youth
of
twenty
,
with
dark
,
bright
eyes
,
brown
curly
hair
,
and
an
intelligent
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
son
of
a
respectable
citizen
of
the
village
,
and
was
called
Albert
Danvers
.
<EOS>
"We
never
enter
a
lady
's
company
with
any
other
motive
,
"
added
the
second
,
a
square
-
built
,
robust
,
jolly
-
faced
young
man
of
nineteen
,
whose
countenance
indicated
health
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
was
also
the
son
of
a
settler
,
and
was
called
Orville
Danbury
.
<EOS>
The
third
member
of
the
party
was
older
,
more
marked
in
his
apperance
than
either
of
the
others
,
and
consequently
will
require
a
more
minute
description
.
<EOS>
His
age
was
about
twenty
-
three
,
and
his
figure
slim
and
tall
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
rather
effeminate
than
manly
,
with
a
pale
,
sallow
complexion
,
and
were
expressive
of
habitual
thought
on
gloomy
subjects
.
<EOS>
He
had
black
,
sunken
,
piercing
eyes
,
a
straight
,
well
-
formed
nose
,
a
rather
pretty
mouth
,
and
a
round
and
prominent
chin
.
<EOS>
His
lips
were
thin
and
habitually
compressed
;
and
when
he
smiled
,
which
he
did
but
seldom
,
and
then
as
if
by
an
effort
,
there
lurked
around
them
an
expression
both
sensual
and
sinister
.
<EOS>
He
had
little
,
very
little
beard
—
so
that
his
face
was
as
smooth
almost
as
a
lady
's
.
<EOS>
His
forehead
was
high
,
but
not
of
a
prepossessing
cast
,
and
was
marred
by
deep
furrows
,
as
if
the
mind
were
continually
employed
on
some
difficult
theme
.
<EOS>
His
hair
was
black
and
curly
;
and
what
was
somewhat
rare
in
that
part
of
the
country
at
that
day
,
was
kept
well
oiled
and
brushed
.
<EOS>
His
suit
of
fine
broad
-
cloth
,
neatly
fitted
to
his
person
,
contrasted
forcibly
with
the
coarse
,
loose
,
home
-
made
,
woolmixed
grey
of
his
companions
.
<EOS>
The
origin
of
Rashton
Moody
(
so
he
termed
himself
)
was
not
definitely
known
to
any
of
the
villagers
.
<EOS>
About
a
year
previous
to
the
date
of
our
story
,
he
made
his
appearance
in
Columbia
,
bearing
a
pack
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
with
him
bringing
the
implements
of
a
surveyor
.
<EOS>
As
a
person
of
his
profession
happened
to
be
wanted
at
the
time
,
he
was
immediately
given
employment
,
and
had
remained
in
the
vicinity
ever
since
.
<EOS>
His
dress
,
occupation
,
and
finished
manners
,
at
once
made
him
the
beau
ideal
of
all
the
young
ladies
of
the
village
,
to
whom
his
slightest
expression
was
an
oracle
of
wisdom
;
and
in
whose
pale
,
thoughtful
,
half
-
melancholy
countenance
,
they
saw
enough
to
excite
their
sympathies
,
together
with
a
world
of
romance
;
and
consequently
,
of
all
their
imaginings
,
he
was
the
hero
.
<EOS>
But
if
all
fancied
him
,
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
reciprocate
;
for
after
a
time
,
he
gradually
withdrew
his
company
from
all
save
Kate
Clarendon
;
and
if
there
chanced
to
be
a
gathering
where
she
was
not
expected
to
be
present
,
Rashton
Moody
was
invariably
absent
.
<EOS>
Had
Kate
not
been
a
great
favorite
with
all
,
this
marked
expression
of
regard
for
her
alone
,
from
one
so
universally
popular
,
must
have
made
her
many
enemies
among
her
own
sex
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
often
happens
in
such
cases
,
the
individual
himself
,
and
the
preference
shown
by
him
for
her
company
,
were
less
agreeable
to
Kate
,
than
they
would
have
been
to
almost
any
other
unmarried
lady
in
Columbia
.
<EOS>
But
Kate
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
a
little
inclined
to
be
coquettish
;
so
that
whatever
might
be
her
real
feelings
<EOS>
,
they
were
concealed
by
a
dissemblance
that
completely
deceived
all
;
and
,
moreover
,
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
one
of
her
turn
of
mind
should
feel
flattered
by
the
attentions
of
a
personage
so
much
sought
for
by
others
,
whether
she
cared
for
him
herself
or
not
.
<EOS>
Had
Kate
expressed
the
real
sentiments
of
her
heart
,
she
would
have
said
that
she
liked
Danvers
,
could
endure
Danbury
,
but
that
the
company
of
Moody
was
really
disagreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
this
,
however
,
there
was
,
to
her
,
rare
sport
in
having
what
she
termed
three
devoted
lovers
of
respectability
;
and
so
she
encouraged
all
collectively
,
but
managed
to
evade
committing
herself
with
any
individually
.
<EOS>
Her
plan
was
adopted
more
for
her
own
amusement
,
doubtless
,
than
for
any
other
purpose
.
<EOS>
Her
delight
was
in
drawing
them
on
to
a
certain
point
,
and
<EOS>
then
,
just
as
the
conversation
was
becoming
somewhat
serious
,
adroitly
turning
it
by
some
light
remark
foreign
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
As
she
cared
less
for
Moody
than
either
of
the
others
,
so
she
feared
him
the
more
;
for
there
was
something
about
him
,
that
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
always
made
her
gloomy
,
and
chilled
all
the
warm
impulses
of
her
joyous
heart
.
<EOS>
Could
she
with
propriety
have
dismissed
him
,
doubtless
she
would
have
done
so
;
but
to
do
this
,
while
receiving
the
attentions
of
others
,
would
have
called
for
an
explanation
,
and
she
had
none
suitable
to
give
.
<EOS>
Neither
would
it
do
,
as
she
looked
upon
the
matter
,
to
wound
his
feelings
,
by
treating
him
less
civilly
than
his
rivals
.
<EOS>
Thus
matters
stood
between
the
various
parties
,
at
the
time
we
have
chosen
to
introduce
them
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Sir
Knight
of
the
Black
Armor
,
"
said
Kate
,
addressing
Moody
,
in
a
tone
of
innocent
raillery
,
after
having
waited
a
sufficient
time
for
him
to
begin
the
conversation
,
"
how
is
it
that
your
lips
are
more
sealed
than
your
companions
in
arms
of
the
Hodden
Grey?""True
love
is
ever
silent
,
"
returned
Moody
,
laconically
,
fixing
his
dark
,
piercing
eyes
upon
Kate
,
in
a
manner
so
earnest
,
as
to
draw
a
blush
to
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
"
said
Kate
,
rallying
,
"
that
is
not
to
the
point
,
sirrah
!
<EOS>
We
were
not
talking
of
love
.
<EOS>
""Only
<EOS>
thinking
,
"
observed
Moody
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
sir
,
I
deny
that
,
for
myself
,
I
was
even
thinking
of
love
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
say
as
much
for
myself
,
"
sighed
Moody
.
<EOS>
"Faith
<EOS>
,
but
you
are
becoming
sentimental
,
"
replied
Kate
,
forcing
out
a
ringing
laugh
,
to
cover
the
embarrassment
she
felt
from
a
remark
so
pointed
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
my
gallant
cavaliers
,
"
she
added
to
all
,
"
will
you
not
dismount
,
and
honor
the
dwelling
of
a
poor
maiden
,
for
a
short
time?""Why
,
as
to
that
,
"
replied
the
first
speaker
,
Albert
Danvers
,
"
I
can
say
,
for
myself
,
that
nothing
would
be
more
agreeable
to
me
,
were
it
not
that
I
think
the
errand
on
which
we
came
can
be
better
done
as
we
sit
.
<EOS>
""I
agree
with
you
,
"
said
Danbury
.
<EOS>
"Say
<EOS>
on
,
my
noble
seniors
—
I
am
all
attention
,
"
replied
Kate
.
<EOS>
"As
I
have
been
appointed
spokesman
,
"
said
Danvers
,
"
I
may
as
well—""Not
make
any
blunders
,
"
put
in
Kate
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"Exactly
.
<EOS>
""Well?""Well
,
first
you
must
know
,
fair
Miss
Clarendon—""Stop
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Kate
;
"
no
eulogy
on
the
party
present
.
<EOS>
No
flattery
to
the
face
,
Albert
.
<EOS>
""Well
<EOS>
,
then
,
you
must
know
,
Miss
Kate
,
if
you
do
not
already
,
that
a
few
nights
since
,
in
solemn
conclave
met
,
the
young
people
of
Columbia
decided
on
having
a
ball
—
rude
,
it
is
true
—
but
still
a
ball
—
and
the
best
we
can
give
.
""Hum!—indeed!—Well?""And
<EOS>
at
this
ball
,
it
was
anxiously
hoped
,
and
certainly
expected
,
would
be
collected
all
the
fair
faces
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
""Yes?""In
<EOS>
which
case
,
Kate
Clarendon
could
not
be
absent
.
<EOS>
""Hum!—flattery
again
.
<EOS>
""Whereupon
<EOS>
the
query
afterward
came
up
,
as
to
which
should
be
the
lucky
man
,
out
of
a
certain
three
,
to
escort
her
thither
.
<EOS>
""Which
<EOS>
was
decided—""Nay
,
which
has
not
been
decided
at
all
,
but
left
to
your
own
fair
self
to
say
.
<EOS>
""How
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
you
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
simply
,
Miss
Kate
,
you
are
to
choose
out
of
the
three
before
you
,
which
one
you
will
have
for
your
gallant
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
""In
earnest?""Earnest
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
"Kate
looked
at
the
three
mounted
young
men
,
for
a
moment
,
seriously
,
and
then
burst
into
a
wild
,
merry
laugh
,
and
clapped
her
hands
with
childish
delight
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
if
this
is
not
the
funniest
thing
I
ever
heard
of
,
"
she
exclaimed
:
"
<EOS>
Three
young
men
,
riding
off
to
their
lady
-
love
together
,
to
be
piched
from
as
a
farmer
would
select
a
sheep
from
his
flock
for
the
slaughter
.
<EOS>
Well
,
trot
out
here
,
and
let
me
consider
.
<EOS>
"First
<EOS>
,
"
continued
Kate
,
as
if
soliloquising
,
"
there
is
Albert
Danvers
—
a
good
-
looking
fellow
enough
,
but
then
he
do
n't
know
how
to
sit
his
horse
properly
,
keeps
his
knees
too
stiff
,
and
is
too
tall
,
I
think
,
and
broad
in
the
shoulders
,
to
suit
my
taste
.
<EOS>
Then
there
is
Orville
Danbury
—
not
quite
so
good
-
looking
as
the
first
,
is
too
short
and
clumsy
,
has
a
face
too
big
,
and
laughs
too
much
:
I
ca
n't
take
him
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
here
is
Rashton
Moody
—
too
tall
,
too
slim
,
too
pale
and
sallow
,
dresses
too
nice
,
and
do
n't
laugh
enough
;
and
when
he
does
laugh
,
makes
one
have
the
cold
chills
.
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
"
concluded
Kate
,
her
dark
,
sparkling
eyes
twinkling
with
merriment
,
"
I
have
thought
the
matter
over
,
seriously
,
and
,
'
pon
my
word
,
I
really
do
n't
think
I
shall
be
able
to
make
a
choice
.
<EOS>
""Then
,
"
said
Moody
,
quickly
,
"
allow
me
to
tender
my
services
alone
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
really
,
Sir
Knight
of
the
Black
Armor
,
I—""Unfair
!
unfair
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Albert
and
Orville
.
<EOS>
"
Kate
must
make
her
own
selection
,
or
we
go
back
as
we
came
—
those
are
the
terms
of
agreement
.
<EOS>
""Terms
,
or
no
terms
,
I
shall
do
as
I
think
proper
,
"
replied
Moody
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
come
—
no
airs
here
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Danvers
,
his
dark
eyes
flashing
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
pretend
to
dictate
to
me
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Moody
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"Hold
,
comrades
!
<EOS>
you
are
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
,
"
said
Danbury
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
pretend
to
come
on
a
mission
of
peace
,
"
rejoined
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
would
be
at
each
other
's
throats
soon
,
when
I
saw
you
ride
up
.
<EOS>
Fie
!
<EOS>
my
cavaliers
—
for
shame!""Your
rebuke
is
just
,
and
you
shall
hear
no
more
from
me
of
a
quarrelsome
nature
,
"
replied
Danvers
.
<EOS>
"
But
come
—
will
you
not
make
a
choice
between
us
,
for
your
escort
to
the
ball?""I
fear
to
choose
now
,
lest
I
revive
the
quarrel
,
"
answered
Kate
,
pointedly
.
<EOS>
"I
pledge
you
my
honor
,
that
I
will
abide
the
decision
without
a
word
,
"
said
Danvers
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
,
"
said
Danbury
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
do
as
the
others
,
"
said
Moody
,
sullenly
,
compressing
his
lips
,
and
looking
downward
.
<EOS>
"I
have
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Kategaily
,
a
new
idea
at
the
moment
striking
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
it
!
<EOS>
I
will
decide
it
by
a
race
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
my
Marston
,
and
mount
him
,
and
have
five
rods
the
start
,
and
he
who
overtakes
me
first
,
shall
be
my
companion
for
the
ball
.
<EOS>
What
say
you
,
my
cavaliers?""Agreed!—agreed!"—cried
Danvers
and
Danbury
,
in
a
breath
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
take
my
chance
of
course
,
"
said
Moody
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"Mother
,
where
is
Icha
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Kate
,
springing
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
"He
is
at
work
in
the
garden
,
child
;
but
what
strange
freak
have
you
got
in
your
head
now?""A
race
for
a
lover
,
"
answered
Kate
,
laughing
;
and
darting
to
the
door
in
the
rear
,
the
next
moment
her
clear
voice
was
heard
calling
,
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
,
the
name
of
Ichabod
Longtree
.
<EOS>
Presently
an
answer
was
returned
;
and
shortly
after
,
the
personage
bearing
the
poetical
appellation
just
mentioned
,
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
gaunt
,
bony
man
of
thirty
,
with
a
long
,
thin
visage
,
small
,
grey
,
cunning
eyes
,
a
large
nose
and
mouth
,
with
teeth
projecting
,
a
falling
off
,
double
chin
,
and
,
taken
as
a
whole
,
anything
but
a
beauty
.
<EOS>
For
many
years
,
while
the
Clarendons
were
in
good
circumstances
,
he
had
served
them
in
the
capacity
of
gardener
;
and
so
attached
<EOS>
had
he
become
to
the
family
,
particularly
to
his
"
little
pet
,
"
as
he
was
wo
nt
to
term
Kate
that
when
he
was
paid
off
and
discharged
,
he
refused
to
go
,
and
begged
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
accompany
them
to
the
West
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
,
Clarendon
tried
to
dissuade
him
from
this
;
but
finding
his
arguments
of
no
avail
,
he
at
last
consented
,
on
condition
that
he
must
expect
no
wages
,
unless
he
,
Clarendon
,
again
became
prosperous
.
<EOS>
As
affection
,
not
money
,
was
the
tie
which
bound
Ichabod
Longtree
to
the
Clarendons
,
so
he
,
in
consequence
,
made
one
of
the
party
,
and
had
remained
with
them
ever
since
—
employing
his
time
as
gardener
,
hostler
,
and
an
attendantin
general
upon
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Icha
,
"
said
Kate
,
as
the
personage
in
question
made
his
ap
pearance
,
"
saddle
Marston
,
and
bring
him
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
am
off
for
a
race
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
and
some
day
you
'll
jest
git
your
neck
broke
in
a
race
,
<EOS>
my
little
pet
,
"
returned
Ichabod
.
<EOS>
"Never
<EOS>
you
mind
my
neck
,
but
do
as
I
bid
you!""O
,
do
n't
fear
me
;
I
'll
go
straightway
;
"
and
off
went
Ichabod
for
the
horse
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
,
the
coal
-
black
pony
of
Kate
stood
before
the
door
,
arching
his
proud
neck
,
and
pawing
the
ground
,
impatient
to
be
off
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
meantime
,
had
thrown
on
her
riding
-
dress
,
and
in
another
moment
she
was
in
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
"Now
,
my
cavaliers
,
"
she
said
,
gaily
,
"
square
your
horses
'
heads
,
and
wait
the
word
.
<EOS>
"Complying
<EOS>
with
her
request
,
each
put
his
beast
on
a
line
with
his
neighbor
,
while
Kate
rode
out
in
front
,
to
a
suitable
distance
,
and
turning
upon
her
saddle
,
said:"Ready
,
all
!
<EOS>
Now!"At
<EOS>
the
last
word
,
her
riding
-
whip
touched
the
flank
of
Marston
,
and
away
bounded
the
fiery
beast
with
great
velocity
,
and
forward
leaped
the
horses
of
the
rivals
,
in
eager
chase
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
and
novel
sight
.
<EOS>
Erect
upon
her
rushing
steed
,
motionless
as
if
carved
there
from
marble
,
sat
Kate
Clarendon
,
her
tightened
reins
held
gracefully
in
her
snowy
hands
,
speeding
onward
fearlessly
,
amid
the
labyrinthian
forest
,
gradually
gaining
upon
her
pursuers
,
who
now
,
becoming
separated
from
each
other
,
somewhat
,
by
the
difference
in
the
speed
of
their
horses
,
were
spurring
and
whipping
forward
with
all
their
might
.
<EOS>
On
,
on
they
dashed
—
startling
the
tenants
of
the
wood
—
causing
the
birds
to
flutter
and
twitter
above
them
,
or
leave
what
they
considered
a
dangerous
vicinity
—
while
ever
and
anon
the
ringing
voice
and
laugh
of
Kate
,
echoing
through
the
forest
,
urged
on
her
pursuers
almost
to
desperation
.
<EOS>
Forward
they
dashed
,
for
half
an
hour
,
on
a
circuitous
route
,
when
the
horse
of
Moody
,
being
of
exceedingly
good
bottom
,
began
to
distance
his
rivals
,
and
gradually
gain
upon
the
pony
of
Kate
.
<EOS>
This
Kate
perceived
with
any
thing
but
satisfaction
,
and
urged
Marston
to
do
his
best
.
<EOS>
In
vain
,
however
,
did
her
noble
animal
renew
all
his
powers
of
velocity
;
in
vain
fell
the
whip
upon
his
flanks
;
he
had
met
with
more
than
his
equal
;
and
steadily
the
beast
of
Moody
came
bounding
forward
,
every
step
shortening
the
distance
between
them
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
Kate
,
who
saw
she
must
soon
be
overtaken
,
sought
,
by
a
manoeuver
,
to
turn
,
pretend
to
yield
,
and
then
suddenly
pass
Moody
,
and
by
a
straight
course
,
gain
her
home
in
advance
of
him
,
and
thus
clear
herself
;
but
the
design
was
anticipated
—
the
effort
failed
—
and
two
minutes
after
,
the
hand
of
Moody
was
laid
upon
her
bridlerein
.
<EOS>
"I
have
won
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
his
black
eyes
sparkling
,
and
a
rather
malicious
smile
of
triumph
hovering
around
his
almost
white
and
closely
compressed
lips
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
won
,
Miss
Clarendon
—
fairly
won
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
won
,
that
is
certain
,
whether
fairly
or
not
,
"
replied
Kate
,
pettishly
,
with
a
vexed
expression
on
her
usually
laughing
countenance
.
<EOS>
"I
have
won
,
by
your
own
proposal
,
at
all
events
,
"
he
repled
,
rather
coolly
,
"
and
of
course
I
shall
claim
my
reward
.
<EOS>
""Of
course
you
will
claim
it
,
"
rejoined
Kate
,
pointedly
,
"
and
of
course
you
will
get
it
.
<EOS>
""You
seem
displeased
,
Miss
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
""Hamlet
says
,
`
I
know
not
seems
,
'
"
answered
Kate
,
drily
.
"
<EOS>
Let
us
return
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
if
one
of
my
rivals
had
won
,
you
would
have
been
better
suited
,
"
observed
Moody
,
fastening
his
eyes
keenly
upon
his
fair
companion
.
<EOS>
Kate
made
no
reply
;
but
jerking
the
rein
of
her
beast
rather
hastily
,
started
him
into
a
gallop
.
<EOS>
A
cloud
suddenly
came
over
the
face
of
Moody
,
and
he
placed
his
hands
to
his
temples
,
as
if
in
pain
.
<EOS>
Then
dark
thoughts
could
he
traced
in
the
gleam
of
his
eyes
,
and
a
cold
,
sinister
smile
played
around
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
Then
muttering—"If
you
tread
upon
a
serpent
,
beware
of
his
fangs
!
"
<EOS>
He
tightened
his
rein
,
and
,
spurring
forward
,
soon
overtook
Kate
,
who
was
riding
in
advance
.
<EOS>
When
he
reached
her
side
,
his
countenance
had
resumed
its
usual
expression
.
<EOS>
On
their
way
to
the
residence
of
our
heroine
,
they
were
joined
by
the
others
,
who
,
after
passing
some
few
dry
congratulations
on
the
termination
of
the
chase
,
and
perceiving
all
was
not
right
,
relapsed
into
silence
.
<EOS>
The
remainder
of
the
way
was
passed
without
a
word
from
either
party
.
<EOS>
At
the
door
of
the
cottage
,
each
took
leave
of
Kate
,
rather
ceremoniously
,
and
then
departed
—
<EOS>
Moody
by
himself
—
not
one
of
the
four
pleased
with
the
morning
's
work
.

<EOS>
At
an
early
hour
,
on
the
evening
of
the
ball
alluded
to
in
the
preeeding
chapter
,
Rashton
Moody
,
finely
mounted
,
rode
up
to
the
door
of
the
Clarendons
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
previously
completed
her
preparations
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
mounted
on
her
beast
,
and
bearing
him
company
to
the
place
appointed
.
<EOS>
But
although
she
strictly
complied
with
her
agreement
,
in
accompanying
him
to
the
ball
,
yet
it
was
clearly
evident
to
Moody
,
by
her
manner
,
that
his
company
was
not
so
agreeable
to
her
as
he
could
have
wished
.
<EOS>
All
his
efforts
to
draw
her
into
conversation
,
only
resulted
,
on
her
part
,
in
the
utterance
of
monosyllables
;
so
that
,
in
a
short
time
,
he
gave
up
the
attempt
in
despair
;
and
the
remainder
of
the
ride
over
the
plain
was
passed
in
silence
—
<EOS>
both
occupied
with
thoughts
of
their
own
—
those
of
Moody
,
we
fear
,
not
being
of
the
most
harmless
nature
imaginable
.
<EOS>
The
ball
turned
out
to
be
a
fine
affair
—
at
least
for
those
days
—
and
great
hilarity
prevailed
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
however
,
seemed
not
herself
.
<EOS>
She
danced
,
it
is
true
;
was
lively
and
even
gay
;
but
those
who
observed
her
narrowly
—
and
there
were
many
who
did
,
among
whom
were
Danvers
and
Danbury
—
perceived
that
the
feeling
of
joyousness
,
usually
so
apparent
on
such
occasions
,
was
sadly
wanting
.
<EOS>
Some
,
who
noticed
it
,
even
went
so
far
as
to
question
her
on
the
subject
;
but
she
even
replied
,
with
a
forced
laugh
,
that
her
looks
must
belie
her
,
as
she
never
felt
more
cheerful
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
Moody
,
too
,
was
more
cold
and
distant
than
usual
;
rarely
spoke
to
any
,
and
then
very
briefly
;
seldom
smiled
,
and
altogether
seemed
in
an
ill
-
humor
.
<EOS>
But
the
dance
,
notwithstanding
,
went
gaily
on
;
the
fiddler
,
to
the
best
of
his
ability
,
"
discoursed
his
eloquent
music
,
"
and
a
stranger
,
to
have
seen
the
sparkling
eyes
,
the
rosy
cheeks
radiant
with
smiles
,
and
the
bounding
forms
,
as
they
whirled
over
the
floor
,
and
heard
the
jests
,
and
the
laugh
,
and
peradventure
the
gay
song
,
from
such
as
chose
not
to
be
occupied
with
the
"
fantastic
toe
,
"
would
have
pronounced
it
a
happy
assemblage
,
without
one
present
who
did
not
feel
what
all
seemed
to
enjoy
.
<EOS>
Between
ten
and
eleven
o'clock
the
company
was
invited
to
partake
of
refreshments
,
and
all
crowded
to
the
adjoining
apartment
,
where
ample
justice
was
done
to
the
viands
before
them
,
and
where
the
same
hilarious
feelings
continued
to
prevail
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
this
was
over
,
Kate
announced
her
intention
of
returning
immediately
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
,
every
one
looked
surprised
,
and
a
dozen
crowded
around
her
at
once
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
ill
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
one
.
<EOS>
"Or
<EOS>
displeased
with
the
ball
?
"
said
another
.
<EOS>
"Or
<EOS>
grown
exceedingly
sober
of
late
,
and
wish
to
keep
good
hours
?
<EOS>
"
added
a
third
.
<EOS>
"None
of
these
,
I
assure
you
,
"
answered
Kate
.
<EOS>
"What
is
it
then
?
"
asked
a
fourth
.
<EOS>
"O
<EOS>
,
I
see
through
it
,
"
cried
a
fifth
,
a
young
man
,
rubbing
his
hands
together
,
in
a
manner
expressive
of
mirth
about
to
be
enjoyed
:
"
<EOS>
I
see
through
it
.
<EOS>
She
's
not
been
herself
the
whole
evening
,
and
I
can
guess
the
cause
.
<EOS>
""Out
<EOS>
with
it
,
then
,
"
cried
one
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
I
tell
,
Kate
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
young
man
,
with
a
leer
,
and
smiling
mischievously
.
<EOS>
"Certainly
<EOS>
,
"
replied
our
heroine
,
a
little
sarcastically
;
"
if
you
know
anything
,
tell
it
,
and
put
these
anxious
friends
out
of
suspense
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
they
are
dying
for
your
knowledge?""Yes
<EOS>
,
let
us
have
it
,
Charley
,
do
!
"
<EOS>
put
in
a
merry
girl
of
sixteen
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
then
,
"
said
Charley
,
maling
his
face
long
and
serious
,
"
you
must
know
my
most
worthy
friends
,
that
Miss
Kate
Clarendon
,
the
beautiful
being
here
before
you
,
has
had
a
quarred
with
her
lover
,
Mr.
Rashton
Moody
,
and
is
anxious
to
make
an
escape
early
,
in
order
she
may
have
time
and
opportunity
to
put
all
to
rights
again
before
she
sleeps
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
hearty
laugh
followed
this
speech
,
with
cries
of
"
Good
!
good
!
"
<EOS>
"
That
is
it
,
for
the
world
!
"
<EOS>
"
Stupid
we
did
not
see
it
before
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
features
of
Kate
flushed
,
an
angry
frown
came
on
her
brow
,
her
eyes
flashed
,
and
she
bit
her
lips
in
sheer
vexation
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
gentleman
informant
,
"
she
said
,
with
a
touch
of
severity
<EOS>
,
"
always
was
remarkable
for
his
penetration
;
and
I
have
no
doubt
he
could
see
completely
through
a
mill
-
stone
,
as
we
say
in
the
East
—
<EOS>
provided
,
that
is
,
there
were
a
hole
through
it
eight
inches
in
diameter
.
<EOS>
For
once
,
however
,
allow
me
,
who
ought
to
know
,
to
say
,
with
all
deference
to
his
superior
judgment
,
that
he
is
most
decidedly
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Ladies
and
gentlemen
,
I
wish
you
all
a
happy
evening
!
"
and
turning
upon
her
heel
abruptly
,
Kate
,
with
a
dignified
,
but
graceful
step
,
moved
away
,
and
disappeared
from
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
Each
of
the
group
looked
at
each
other
in
surprise
and
with
a
crest
-
fallen
countenance
;
for
not
one
,
by
his
or
her
innocent
jest
and
laugh
,
had
dreamed
of
giving
offense
.
<EOS>
Moody
,
who
a
little
apart
had
watched
the
whole
proceedings
,
at
once
took
an
abrupt
leave
,
and
hastened
after
Kate
;
and
presently
both
were
mounted
,
and
riding
over
the
plain
toward
the
house
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
was
very
clear
,
and
the
bright
moon
,
which
had
risen
an
hour
before
their
departure
,
shed
a
soft
luster
over
all
,
and
bathed
the
deep
forest
of
the
plain
in
a
flood
of
mellow
light
—
which
,
as
it
came
crinkling
through
the
slightly
rustling
leaflets
overhead
,
and
fell
upon
the
soft
earth
like
quivering
beads
of
quicksilver
,
made
the
scene
superbly
enchanting
.
<EOS>
For
some
distance
nothing
was
said
;
and
the
hollow
trampling
of
the
horses
'
feet
,
the
snapping
of
some
dry
twig
,
the
sighing
of
the
forest
,
and
the
chirp
and
hum
of
the
thousand
night
-
watchers
,
were
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
otherwise
death
-
like
stillness
.
<EOS>
At
length
Moody
,
desirous
of
starting
a
conversation
,
said:"Somehow
,
Miss
Clarendon
,
you
seem
low
-
spirited
to
-
night
,
and
have
left
the
party
earlier
than
is
your
wo
nt
.
<EOS>
Has
anything
of
importance
transpired
to
mar
your
<EOS>
happiness?""I
can
not
say
there
has
,
"
replied
Kate
,
briefly
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
why
not
be
gay
,
as
usual?""People
do
not
feel
at
all
times
alike
,
and
I
suppose
I
have
a
right
to
be
serious
occasionally
.
<EOS>
""O
,
certainly
,
Miss
Clarendon
;
no
one
has
a
better
right
.
<EOS>
I
merely
spoke
,
because
I
take
a
deep
interest
in
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
,
sir
!
<EOS>
O
,
I
was
not
aware
of
that
,
"
answered
Kate
,
in
a
tone
of
provoking
coolness
.
<EOS>
Moody
bit
his
lips
,
and
moved
nervously
on
his
saddle
,
for
he
felt
severely
the
sting
of
her
words
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
,
that
you
have
not
ere
this
discovered
the
motive
I
had
in
addressing
you
;
and
that
,
of
all
others
,
it
should
surprise
you
that
I
sought
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
"Kate
made
no
reply
;
and
after
waiting
for
one
a
few
moments
,
Moody
resumed:"You
must
have
perceived
,
Miss
Clarendon
,
or
at
least
you
should
have
been
aware
,
that
my
attentions
to
you
thus
long
,
have
not
been
attentions
of
mere
gallantry
,
but
have
sprung
from
deeper
<EOS>
and
I
trust
more
sacred
feelings
.
<EOS>
""To
tell
you
the
truth
,
"
replied
Kate
,
in
the
same
indifferent
tone
she
had
hitherto
used
,
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
troubled
myself
enough
about
the
matter
to
perceive
anything
the
kind
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
am
I
to
understand
from
this?""Whatever
you
choose
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
Moody
bit
his
lips
,
and
remained
for
a
short
time
silent
;
during
which
he
passed
an
openspot
in
the
forest
,
where
the
moon
shone
full
upon
his
face
,
and
exhibited
features
now
grown
dark
and
fearful
with
a
thousand
angry
thoughts
,
over
which
played
a
bitter
,
sinister
smile
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
I
conjecture
rightly
,
"
he
said
at
length
,
"
my
company
must
be
most
disagreeable
to
you
.
<EOS>
""You
might
be
more
in
error
,
"
was
the
consoling
reply
.
<EOS>
"Then
wherefore
<EOS>
have
you
silently
encouraged
me
so
long
?
<EOS>
why
have
you
not
made
this
manifest
before?""Perhaps
<EOS>
there
has
been
no
occasion
for
my
doing
so
.
<EOS>
""I
see
how
it
is
:
you
have
coquetted
me
,
and
led
me
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
.
<EOS>
""You
are
quick
-
sighted
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
uncommonly
so
,
<EOS>
or
I
should
have
seen
through
your
base
artifice
<EOS>
ere
this
.
""Sir
!
<EOS>
"
said
Kate
,
angrily
,
"
your
language
is
unbecoming
a
gentleman
;
and
if
you
can
not
carry
a
more
civil
tongue
in
your
head
,
I
pray
you
leave
me
,
and
I
will
find
my
way
home
by
myself
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
fast
,
my
lady
,
for
I
design
doing
no
such
thing
;
and
moreover
,
my
language
,
which
you
are
pleased
to
think
uncivil
,
is
only
in
keeping
with
your
own
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
wish
to
quarrel
with
me
,
sir!""Not
<EOS>
at
all
;
I
wish
to
treat
you
as
a
lady
,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
why
not
cease
your
conversation
,
and
continue
silent?""Because
I
do
not
choose
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
""Indeed!""Ay
,
Miss
Clarendon
,
indeed!""Then
,
"
rejoined
Kate
,
pettishly
,
"
I
will
allow
you
the
estimable
privilege
of
conversing
with
yourself
,
while
I
remain
a
listener
only
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
but
you
must
talk
also
,
"
returned
Rashton
,
riding
up
close
to
her
side
,
and
laying
his
hand
upon
her
bridle
-
rein
.
<EOS>
"How
,
sir
!
<EOS>
what
means
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
indignantly
,
not
without
some
alarm
,
however
.
<EOS>
"I
said
you
must
talk
,
also
,
"
replied
Moody
,
coolly
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
you
would
force
me
to
talk
<EOS>
,
eh?""I
simply
said
you
must
,
"
answered
the
young
man
,
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
word
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
would
you
have
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Kate
,
her
heart
now
fluttering
with
a
strange
,
undefinable
fear
.
<EOS>
"I
would
hold
a
conversation
on
what
has
now
become
,
to
me
at
least
,
a
grave
subject
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
that
is—""Love
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
in
the
humor
to
talk
now
,
on
what
I
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
the
matter
of
that
,
it
is
easily
comprehended
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
<EOS>
sir
,
what
would
you
say?""That
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
""Umph
!
<EOS>
your
actions
show
it
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
I
agree
with
you
,
they
do
show
it
,
in
everything
I
do
.
<EOS>
Think
you
,
if
I
did
not
love
you
,
Miss
Clarendon
,
I
would
have
sought
your
company
,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other?""May
<EOS>
be
so
—
like
things
are
often
done
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
by
one
of
my
nature
and
temperament
.
<EOS>
""As
to
that
,
I
can
not
say
;
but
before
the
matter
goes
any
further
,
allow
me
to
observe
,
that
if
you
love
me
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
;
as
there
is
no
reciprocity
of
feeling
,
and
consequently
can
be
no
encouragement
on
my
part
given
.
<EOS>
""Is
this
<EOS>
really
so
?
"
rejoined
Moody
,
with
something
like
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"Really
<EOS>
so
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
""It
pains
me
to
hear
it
,
for
I
had
hoped
it
were
otherwise
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
candidly
—
do
you
love
another?""That
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
have
a
right
to
keep
secret
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
that
,
on
the
same
principle
,
I
feel
I
have
a
right
to
know
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
aware
,
<EOS>
sir
,
what
constitutes
your
right
to
any
such
knowledge
,
"
answered
Kate
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"That
matters
not
;
but
again
to
the
question
:
<EOS>
Do
you
,
or
do
you
not
love
another?""I
decline
answering
,
sir
,
"
replied
Kate
,
haughtily
;
"
but
whether
I
do
or
not
,
understand
one
thing
,
I
do
not
,
and
never
can
love
you
.
"Again
<EOS>
Moody
bit
his
lips
,
until
the
blood
almost
sprang
through
;
and
could
Kate
have
seen
the
dark
,
devilish
expression
on
his
features
then
,
she
would
have
trembled
with
very
fear
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
spoke
,
but
in
a
voice
so
altered
and
husky
,
that
she
started
,
thinking
it
was
another
who
addressed
her
.
<EOS>
"Weigh
<EOS>
well
your
words
,
girl
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
beware
of
their
import
,
for
I
am
one
that
can
not
be
trifled
with
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
trifled
with
me
thus
far
—
if
you
have
led
me
on
to
hope
,
without
a
cause
,
save
to
make
an
idle
jest
—
then
the
consequences
rest
with
yourself
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
not
understand
you
,
"
said
Kate
,
in
some
trepidation
.
<EOS>
"I
am
fully
aware
of
that
—
neither
do
you
know
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
foot
-
ball
,
maiden
,
to
take
quietly
the
kicks
of
the
world
,
merely
for
the
amusement
of
others
.
<EOS>
I
am
—
but
I
will
not
say
what
;
you
may
some
day
learn
to
your
sorrow
.
<EOS>
""This
is
strange
speech
,
sir!""Perhaps
<EOS>
it
is
to
you
—
to
me
it
is
simply
natural
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
at
what
do
you
aim
,
Mr.
Moody
?
<EOS>
Am
I
to
understand
that
you
threaten
me?""You
<EOS>
have
said
that
you
do
not
,
and
never
can
,
love
me
.
<EOS>
""I
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
wherefore
<EOS>
did
you
lead
me
to
suppose
otherwise?—wherefore
<EOS>
did
you
encourage
my
addresses?""I
deny
that
I
did
.
<EOS>
You
called
upon
me
at
different
times
—
others
did
the
same
—
and
I
treated
you
as
I
did
them
,
civilly
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
You
never
asked
me
for
my
company
,
my
hand
,
nor
my
love
;
and
if
you
chose
to
call
,
it
was
not
my
place
to
tell
you
to
desist
,
so
long
as
you
behaved
yourself
as
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
have
yet
to
be
informed
,
sir
,
that
the
calls
of
a
gentleman
upon
a
lady
,
are
tacit
acknowledgements
,
on
her
part
,
that
she
desires
him
above
all
others
,
and
that
,
as
a
matter
of
course
,
she
must
love
him
,
and
yield
him
a
right
to
inquire
into
all
her
thoughts
and
actions
.
<EOS>
You
should
be
aware
,
sir
,
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
lady
,
to
treat
with
respect
those
who
call
upon
her
,
provided
they
move
in
society
her
equals
and
behave
themselves
properly
,
whether
she
secretly
admires
them
or
not
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
to
this
duty
,
then
,
as
you
call
it
,
I
suppose
I
am
indebted
for
all
the
favors
I
have
received
at
your
hands?""To
nothing
else
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
""Had
<EOS>
I
known
this
in
time
,
before
my
mind
was
fully
set
upon
you
—
before
I
had
received
what
I
considered
secret
encouragement
from
yourself
,
that
my
passion
was
returned
—
it
might
perhaps
have
saved
us
both
a
world
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
too
late
now
;
and
,
as
I
said
before
,
the
consequences
must
rest
with
yourself
.
<EOS>
To
be
plain
,
Kate
Clarendon
,
I
love
you
—
love
you
with
a
wild
,
burning
,
consuming
passion
,
that
,
unless
I
can
attain
my
object
,
will
destroy
me
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
do
not
love
you
,
and
that
should
be
sufficient
to
destroy
that
passion
.
<EOS>
""It
is
not
,
though
.
<EOS>
You
may
be
as
cold
as
marble
,
and
yet
my
passion
for
you
will
be
unabated
;
in
sooth
,
if
anything
,
methinks
its
fire
would
burn
more
fiercely
,
or
be
smothered
for
a
time
,
only
to
burst
out
in
a
terrible
,
devouring
,
destructive
flame
.
<EOS>
No
,
Kate
,
the
die
is
cast
;
there
is
no
alternative
—
you
must
be
mine!""Never
!
"
cried
Kate
,
energetically
.
"Nay
<EOS>
,
be
not
too
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
have
staked
my
all
upon
it
,
and
it
is
life
or
death
.
<EOS>
You
little
know
the
nature
of
him
now
by
your
side
,
girl
.
<EOS>
Sooner
than
you
should
escape
me
,
and
be
another
's
,
I
would
bury
a
knife
in
your
heart
,
draw
it
forth
,
and
with
the
blood
still
warm
upon
the
blade
,
plunge
it
into
my
own
,
and
thus
perish
with
you
.
<EOS>
""Oh
God
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
;
"
you
chill
my
blood
with
horror
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
help
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
let
you
know
the
consequences
of
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
Be
mine
,
or
die!""Let
<EOS>
us
talk
no
more
of
this
,
now
,
"
said
Kate
,
shuddering
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
but
now
is
the
time
;
an
opportunity
for
such
conversation
may
not
soon
present
itself
again
,
and
the
moments
must
be
improved
as
they
pass
.
"While
<EOS>
conversing
thus
,
the
two
had
been
riding
steadily
forward
,
and
,
just
at
this
moment
,
a
glimpse
of
Kate
's
residence
could
be
seen
through
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Never
,
to
her
eyes
,
had
it
looked
so
enchanting
as
now
;
so
eager
was
she
to
escape
from
her
companion
,
<EOS>
whose
strange
,
wild
language
was
well
calculated
to
alarm
her
.
<EOS>
A
moving
light
,
flashing
through
a
window
of
the
cottage
,
assured
Kate
that
some
one
was
astir
;
and
instantly
she
felt
her
spirits
rise
,
and
her
courage
revive
.
<EOS>
"See
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
in
something
resembling
her
usually
light
,
silvery
tone
;
"
we
are
almost
back
to
the
race
-
ground
.
<EOS>
Yonder
light
must
be
carried
by
Icha
.
<EOS>
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
he
always
waits
up
for
his
little
pet
,
as
he
calls
me
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
more
reason
,
then
,
that
we
should
not
be
in
a
hurry
,
"
returned
Moody
,
taking
hold
of
Kate
's
rein
,
and
stopping
both
horses
.
<EOS>
"How
,
sir
!
<EOS>
what
means
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
angrily
,
and
in
some
alarm
.
<EOS>
"It
means
,
girl
,
that
I
am
determined
to
improve
the
present
opportunity
,
to
bind
you
by
solemn
oath
,
to
myself
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
you
mad
,
sir
,
to
talk
thus
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
that
I
am
the
person
to
tamely
submit
to
your
insults
in
this
manner
?
<EOS>
Unhand
that
rein
,
sir
,
or
<EOS>
I
will
raise
an
alarm
that
will
bring
to
me
such
aid
as
will
chastise
you
for
your
presumption
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
speak
not
so
haughtily
;
you
are
not
yet
out
of
my
power
,
"
returned
Moody
,
in
a
low
,
determined
tone
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
wish
to
behold
your
friends
again
,
with
honor
,
swear
you
will
be
mine
,
and
your
road
is
free
—
otherwise
(
and
he
grasped
her
rein
more
tightly
)
,
you
shall
know
what
a
bold
man
may
dare
.
<EOS>
""Swear
to
be
yours
,
I
never
will
,
"
answered
Kate
,
"
let
the
result
be
what
it
may
.
<EOS>
""By
heavens
!
<EOS>
then
,
"
said
Moody
,
"
you
see
not
the
inside
of
yon
cottage
again
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
struck
both
horses
with
his
riding
-
whip
,
and
,
as
the
fiery
beasts
reared
under
the
smart
,
and
attempted
to
rush
forward
,
he
suddenly
wheeled
their
heads
in
a
direction
opposite
the
cottage
,
and
would
have
dashed
into
the
mazes
of
the
great
forest
,
had
not
Kate
suddenly
uttered
a
prolonged
and
piercing
shriek
,
and
,
with
the
agility
of
an
accomplished
equestrienne
,
disengaged
herself
from
the
saddle
,
slid
to
the
ground
,
and
darted
away
toward
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
that
she
had
escaped
him
,
Moody
reined
in
his
horse
,
leaped
to
the
ground
himself
,
and
instantly
gave
chase
.
<EOS>
Kate
now
uttered
shriek
upon
shriek
,
and
sped
forward
with
all
her
might
;
but
her
dress
soon
became
entangled
with
the
shrubbery
,
and
in
another
moment
an
arm
of
Moody
was
thrown
around
her
,
and
a
hand
placed
upon
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
"Fiends
<EOS>
seize
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
if
yon
escape
me
now
,
though
all
hell
were
in
pursuit
!
"
<EOS>
and
lifting
her
as
though
she
were
an
infant
,
he
instantly
sprang
back
to
his
horse
,
and
attempted
to
remount
;
but
the
struggles
of
Kate
,
and
the
uneasiness
of
his
beast
,
prevented
him
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
lights
were
seen
flashing
near
the
cottage
,
and
distant
voices
were
heard
,
lending
hope
to
the
one
and
despair
to
the
other
.
"Too
<EOS>
late
,
I
see
,
"
growled
Moody
;
"
then
there
is
no
alternative
;
"
and
instantly
a
long
,
bright
blade
flashed
in
the
moonlight
,
above
the
head
of
our
heroine
.
<EOS>
Kate
saw
and
shrank
away
from
it
,
with
an
agonizing
shriek
;
but
this
could
not
save
her
;
she
still
saw
it
gleaming
<EOS>
—
already
was
it
on
its
descent
—
and
she
shut
her
eyes
in
horror
,
and
tho't
her
fate
was
sealed
.
<EOS>
Already
was
it
near
her
heart
—
a
second
more
,
and
her
spirit
would
be
flown
—
when
suddenly
it
was
checked
by
some
obstruction
,
and
the
next
moment
Kate
found
herself
released
,
and
the
villain
who
had
sought
her
life
stretched
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
,
and
,
in
the
dim
light
which
the
moon
made
among
the
trees
,
saw
the
tall
,
shadowy
form
of
the
Necromancer
standing
over
her
.
<EOS>
"Girl
,
"
said
the
strange
being
,
"
thy
destiny
is
not
thus
to
die
.
<EOS>
Arise!""God
bless
you
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
springing
to
her
feet
,
and
grasping
his
rough
hand
with
a
warm
pressure
,
while
tears
of
joy
started
to
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
Luther
.
<EOS>
""I
did
not
save
thee
,
girl
;
it
was
a
Higher
Power
,
"
said
the
other
,
solemnly
;
and
he
raised
his
bare
arm
majestically
in
the
moonlight
,
and
his
fore
-
finger
pointed
upward
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Moody
gave
a
groan
,
and
rose
into
a
sitting
posture
.
<EOS>
"Villain
!
"
cried
Luther
,
seizing
him
by
the
collar
,
and
jerking
him
to
his
feet
:
"
Villain
!
<EOS>
did
I
not
know
that
thou
wert
sent
here
as
a
messenger
of
evil
,
to
fulfill
the
decrees
of
fate
,
I
would
crush
thee
as
a
worthless
worm!""Ha
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Moody
,
starting
back
,
and
gazing
upon
the
other
,
for
a
moment
,
while
his
whole
frame
shook
with
fear
:
"
Blind
Luther
!
<EOS>
you
here
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
far
away
.
<EOS>
""I
told
thee
,
"
rejoined
the
Necromancer
,
almost
fiercely
,
"
it
was
my
unenviable
destiny
to
be
near
thy
evil
deeds
—
to
follow
thee
,
as
the
carrion
-
eater
the
wounded
wolf
.
<EOS>
""This
way
,
"
said
a
voice
,
which
Kate
instantly
recognized
to
be
her
father
's
;
and
with
a
cry
of
joy
,
she
sprang
toward
him
,
and
the
next
moment
was
clasped
in
his
arms
,
while
Ichabod
,
his
companion
,
exclaimed
in
alarm:"Why
,
darling
pet
,
what
's
happened?""Ay
<EOS>
,
what
means
this
?
<EOS>
and
who
are
those
I
hear
yonder
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
her
father
,
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"Kate
instantly
proceeded
to
detail
what
had
occurred
,
in
as
few
words
as
possible
;
but
ere
she
had
concluded
,
her
father
sprang
forward
,
<EOS>
exclaiming:"Where
is
the
villain?"Moody
would
have
fled
,
but
for
the
iron
grasp
which
Luther
laid
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
the
imperative
command:"Stay
!
<EOS>
and
behold
your
victim
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Clarendon
caught
sight
of
Moody
,
he
strode
up
to
him
like
a
madman
,
and
,
seizing
him
by
the
collar
,
smote
him
on
his
face
several
times
,
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
go
,
disgraced
and
worthless
dog
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
releasing
him
,
"
and
tell
your
friends
,
if
you
have
any
,
that
you
are
as
far
beneath
them
,
as
Hell
is
beneath
Heaven!"For
something
like
a
minute
,
Moody
stood
over
-
powered
with
rage
;
his
dark
eyes
darting
forth
fiery
gleams
,
like
those
of
an
enraged
wild
beast
;
his
hands
clenched
,
his
teeth
grinding
together
,
and
white
foam
issuing
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Then
he
started
,
with
a
howl
of
fury
,
and
felt
for
his
knife
,
which
,
fortunately
,
was
not
about
him
.
<EOS>
Finding
he
was
foiled
in
every
way
,
he
turned
upon
his
heel
,
and
shouting
hoarsely
,
"
I
will
be
revenged
!
"
<EOS>
darted
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
"He
prophesies
and
speaks
the
truth
!
"
said
the
Necromancer
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"Strange
<EOS>
man
,
I
thank
you
with
my
whole
soul
!
"
<EOS>
said
Clarendon
,
advancing
to
Luther
and
grasping
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
saved
the
idol
of
my
heart
—
my
more
than
life
.
<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
I
could
the
latter
,
as
the
former
,
"
replied
the
Necromancer
,
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
"What
mean
you?""Full
of
life
and
hope
thou
must
,
Early
seek
thy
native
dust,"was
the
no
less
mysterious
answer
of
Luther
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
pray
you
be
more
lucid
in
your
explanation
,
if
,
as
I
doubt
not
,
your
words
hold
a
meaning
,
"
said
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
"O
<EOS>
yes
,
do
,
now
,
"
said
Ichabod
,
coaxingly
,
approaching
the
fortuneteller
;
"
do
,
now
,
tell
us
what
you
mean
,
good
Mr.
Luther
,
and
I
'll
see
that
you
get
good
fare
,
as
long
as
you
've
a
mind
to
stay
with
us
,
if
it
's
to
next
January
.
<EOS>
"Luther
drew
up
his
form
erect
,
and
waving
his
hand
with
dignity
,
replied:"For
whom
the
scroll
is
filled
and
sealed
,
The
future
may
not
be
revealed
—
Other
than
that
which
now
you
hear
:
When
the
new
moon
shall
be
near
,
One
,
whose
blood
now
warmly
flows
,
Shall
in
death
find
stern
repose
:
<EOS>
When
the
earth
drinks
blood
and
rain
,
Some
shall
see
this
form
again
;
Then
a
child
can
tell
the
tale
,
Over
which
now
hangs
a
vail
.
<EOS>
"What
light
is
that
yonder
?
"
added
Luther
,
pointing
toward
the
dwelling
of
Clarendon
,
as
he
concluded
his
mysterious
rhymes
.
<EOS>
Each
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
,
but
saw
nothing
;
and
turning
round
,
Clarendon
was
about
to
ask
the
Necromancer
what
he
meant
,
when
,
to
his
astonishment
,
he
found
the
latter
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
He
called
his
name
several
times
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
but
no
answer
was
returned
.
<EOS>
Ichabod
,
determined
that
the
Necromancer
should
not
escape
without
his
full
quota
of
thanks
,
at
once
darted
into
the
surrounding
bushes
,
and
sought
him
in
every
direction
,
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"I
am
half
inclined
to
be
superstitious
myself
,
"
said
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
"
But
come
,
darling
Kate
,
let
us
return
on
foot
by
ourselves
,
while
Ichabod
looks
after
Marston
;
"
and
taking
the
hand
of
his
daughter
in
his
own
,
both
set
off
toward
the
cottage
,
pondering
upon
the
villainous
conduct
of
Moody
,
and
the
strange
appearance
,
disappearance
,
and
language
of
the
Necromancer
.

CHAPTER
VI.The
sky
grew
darker
.
<EOS>
Soon
came
booming
on
The
deep
-
voiced
thunder
,
whilst
at
distance
rolled
The
wild
winds
'
dirge
-
like
,
and
yet
tempest
tone
;
And
lightning
's
evanescent
sheets
of
gold
Burst
,
in
their
anger
,
from
the
clouds
'
huge
fold.—T.
D.
English

<EOS>
Is
there
a
crimeBeneath
the
roof
of
Heaven
,
that
stains
the
soulOf
men
with
more
infernal
hue
,
than
damn'dAssassination?—Cibber
.
<EOS>
Dead
!
<EOS>
dead
!
<EOS>
ay
,
dead!—forever
dead
to
those
That
loved
him!At
an
early
hour
on
the
morning
succeeding
the
night
of
events
just
detailed
,
Ichabod
Longtree
,
who
being
in
his
way
something
of
a
gossip
,
was
stirring
betimes
,
that
he
might
be
first
with
his
wonderful
news
among
the
villagers
.
<EOS>
With
a
mysterious
air
,
and
sundry
additions
and
embellishments
,
where
he
thought
them
necessary
,
he
told
his
tale
to
a
gaping
crowd
,
who
,
with
feelings
of
indignation
too
deep
for
words
,
at
once
proceeeded
to
the
residence
of
Moody
,
with
the
intention
of
punishing
him
according
to
his
deserts
.
<EOS>
Had
they
found
him
,
under
the
excitement
they
were
then
laboring
,
it
is
more
than
propable
<EOS>
the
affair
would
have
had
a
tragical
termination
;
but
he
was
gone
,
and
no
one
knew
whither
,
so
that
pursuit
was
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
The
whole
affair
created
a
great
sensation
,
and
was
a
common
topic
for
several
days
.
<EOS>
As
a
story
looses
nothing
by
being
repeated
,
particularly
when
it
borders
on
the
marvelous
,
so
the
tale
in
question
,
as
it
went
from
one
to
another
,
became
distorted
to
a
wonderful
degree
—
until
at
last
an
old
lady
,
in
telling
it
for
the
twentieth
time
,
ac
tually
vouched
for
the
truth
of
the
assertion
,
that
Moody
had
placed
the
knife
against
the
heart
of
Kate
,
and
was
pressing
with
all
his
strength
upon
the
handle
,
without
making
the
least
impression
,
when
a
dark
cloud
suddenly
enveloped
him
,
and
Luther
appeared
in
a
flame
of
fire
,
and
seized
and
bore
him
off
,
amid
terrible
thunderings
,
and
the
most
awful
shrieks
of
woe
that
mortal
ear
ever
heard
.
<EOS>
As
for
Kate
herself
,
her
gay
spirits
seemed
suddenly
to
have
left
her
.
<EOS>
She
grew
reserved
and
silent
,
and
withal
,
not
a
little
melancholy
.
<EOS>
In
vain
her
friends
—
who
after
the
events
we
have
detailed
,
flocked
to
see
her
in
numbers
—
tried
to
enliven
her
by
their
conversation
,
and
frequent
sallies
of
wit
.
<EOS>
She
said
little
to
any
,
and
if
she
smiled
at
all
,
it
was
one
of
those
wan
smiles
,
which
,
contrasting
as
it
did
so
forcibly
with
her
former
ringing
laugh
,
was
really
painful
to
observe
.
<EOS>
From
a
laughing
,
frolicsome
,
light
-
hearted
girl
,
she
seemed
changed
to
a
serious
,
thoughtful
woman
;
and
all
so
suddenly
,
as
to
make
it
rather
marvelous
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
something
preyed
upon
her
mind
,
and
depressed
her
spirits
,
and
many
were
the
conjectures
concerning
it
.
<EOS>
Some
hinted
that
she
loved
Moody
,
and
that
his
base
actions
had
destroyed
her
confidence
in
him
;
and
though
she
had
torn
him
forever
from
her
heart
,
yet
there
had
been
left
an
aching
void
,
from
which
time
alone
could
relieve
her
.
<EOS>
Others
said
it
was
owing
to
the
fright
she
had
received
,
and
that
in
a
few
days
she
would
be
herself
again
.
<EOS>
But
these
were
conjectures
only
,
for
Kate
kept
her
secret
close
locked
in
her
own
breast
;
and
when
questioned
on
the
matter
,
she
ever
managed
to
answer
in
such
a
way
that
none
were
made
the
wiser
for
it
.
<EOS>
Thus
matters
ran
along
for
several
weeks
,
and
flowery
spring
was
just
taking
leave
of
the
year
,
to
give
bright
summer
her
accustomed
place
and
reign
over
the
advancing
golden
harvest
.
<EOS>
Since
that
eventful
night
,
Rashton
Moody
had
never
been
seen
nor
heard
of
by
any
of
the
villagers
;
and
the
circumstances
connected
with
his
disappearance
,
having
been
discussed
time
and
again
,
were
now
becoming
worn
out
topics
,
of
but
<EOS>
little
interest
to
any
.
<EOS>
Luther
,
too
,
had
not
since
made
his
appearance
,
and
it
was
doubted
by
some
that
he
ever
would
.
<EOS>
Danvers
and
Danbury
had
both
called
upon
Kate
,
separately
,
some
two
or
three
times
;
but
finding
their
reception
very
cold
,
had
at
last
given
up
their
visits
,
in
despair
of
ever
being
able
to
win
her
affections
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
this
time
,
say
some
six
weeks
from
the
night
of
the
ball
,
that
Kate
Clarendon
and
her
mother
were
seated
a
little
apart
,
in
their
own
dwelling
,
engaged
upon
some
coarse
sewing
.
<EOS>
The
night
—
for
it
was
an
early
hour
in
the
evening
—
was
very
dark
,
and
now
and
then
a
flash
of
lightning
,
followed
by
the
rumbling
sound
of
distant
thunder
,
together
with
a
cool
damp
breeze
,
which
blew
steadily
from
the
west
,
announced
that
a
shower
was
fast
approaching
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
mother
and
daughter
kept
silence
—
both
intently
occupied
with
the
work
in
their
hands
—
when
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
,
that
seemed
to
crinkle
and
play
upon
their
needles
,
made
them
involuntarily
start
together
and
utter
exclamations
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
near
,
and
how
loud
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
alluding
to
the
lighting
,
and
the
thunder
which
followed
with
a
crashing
report
immediately
after
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
aware
that
the
shower
was
so
near
us
.
<EOS>
""O
,
I
wish
father
would
come
,
"
said
Kate
;
<EOS>
"
I
always
feel
so
gloomy
in
a
thunder
-
storm
,
and
so
frightened
,
too
.
<EOS>
""You
have
no
cause
for
being
frightened
now
,
Kate
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
"
more
than
at
any
other
time
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
in
the
hands
of
God
,
at
all
times
,
and
are
just
as
safe
,
if
he
so
wills
it
,
when
the
elements
are
in
dire
commotion
,
as
when
every
thing
is
clear
and
tranquil
.
<EOS>
""I
know
it
,
mother
;
but
at
the
same
time
,
I
can
not
avoid
feeling
more
timid
,
when
I
behold
dark
clouds
lowering
around
me
,
darting
forth
their
angry
lightnings
,
and
hear
the
mighty
thunders
that
seem
to
shake
the
earth
beneath
them
,
than
when
all
is
bright
and
clear
.
<EOS>
""It
is
natural
,
my
child
,
that
we
should
feel
our
danger
more
sensibly
,
when
we
can
see
it
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
is
no
nearer
us
at
such
times
than
at
others
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
wish
father
would
come
!
"
rejoined
Kate
,
rising
,
and
advancing
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
How
dark
!
"
<EOS>
she
continued
,
as
she
gazed
forth
;
"
and
see
yon
cloud
!
<EOS>
how
angry
it
looks
!
<EOS>
and
how
full
it
is
of
electricity
!
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
mother
,
do
you
not
hear
a
roaring
sound?""I
do
,
"
answered
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
approaching
the
door
herself
and
listening
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
wind
and
rain
coming
through
the
forest
.
"How
<EOS>
mournfully
it
wails
,
"
sighed
Kate
,
shuddering
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
blood
feels
chilly
in
my
veins
.
<EOS>
It
seems
as
if
somebody
were
dying
,
and
this
were
the
funeral
dirge
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
the
lightning
again!—how
fearful
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
she
,
starting
back
,
as
at
the
moment
a
bright
flash
almost
blinded
her
,
and
a
crash
of
thunder
,
following
close
,
made
the
cabin
tremble
to
its
center
.
<EOS>
"Better
<EOS>
stand
away
from
the
door
,
Kate
,
"
said
the
dame
,
anxiously
,
retreating
herself
.
<EOS>
"I
thought
,
"
replied
Kate
,
"
you
just
now
implied
that
all
times
and
places
were
alike
as
to
danger?""I
said
we
should
not
fear
,
child
,
at
one
time
more
than
another
;
that
we
were
all
in
the
hands
of
a
just
God
,
who
watches
over
us
;
but
I
did
not
say
it
would
be
right
to
needlessly
expose
ourselves
;
and
it
is
dangerous
standing
in
a
door
,
during
a
severe
thunder
-
storm
,
from
the
tendency
of
the
lightning
to
follow
a
current
of
air
.
<EOS>
But
see
—
yonder
!
<EOS>
"
added
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
pointing
toward
the
forest
;
"
methought
<EOS>
I
just
now
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
;
perhaps
we
had
better
shut
and
bolt
the
door
.
<EOS>
""O
,
it
is
Icha
'
exclaimed
Kate
,
joyfully
,
as
at
the
moment
another
flash
revealed
to
her
the
tall
,
ungainly
form
of
the
gardener
,
hurrying
forward
with
immensely
long
strides
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Icha
is
afraid
of
a
drenching
,
judging
by
his
movements
;
but
is
it
not
singular
that
I
did
not
see
father
with
him!""He
must
be
near
,
though
,
I
think
,
"
returned
the
mother
of
Kate
,
rather
uneasily
,
moving
toward
the
door
again
herself
.
<EOS>
A
few
large
drops
of
rain
now
began
to
patter
on
the
leaves
of
the
trees
,
and
on
the
roof
of
the
cabin
,
while
a
loud
roaring
,
like
that
of
a
near
water
-
fall
,
announced
the
body
of
the
shower
to
be
near
at
hand
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
Ichabod
Longtree
came
bounding
into
the
room
,
nearly
out
of
breath
,
bearing
a
rifle
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Icha
,
"
exclaimed
Kate
,
hurriedly
,
"
where
is
father?""Why
,
is
n't
he
here
?
"
asked
Ichabod
,
in
reply
,
looking
round
the
apartment
,
as
if
he
expected
to
behold
the
object
of
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
he
not
go
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
quickly
,
slightly
turning
pale
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
yes
,
"
replied
the
gardener
,
"
we
went
together
,
and
kept
together
till
near
dark
,
when
he
said
as
how
he
'd
take
a
deer
I
'd
just
then
shot
,
and
start
for
home
.
<EOS>
I
'
spected
to
find
him
here
when
I
come
.
<EOS>
""Strange
,
"
said
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
"
that
he
has
not
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
How
long
since
you
parted
with
him?""It
's
more'n
two
hours
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
dame
,
in
alarm
;
"
so
long
ago
,
and
he
not
here
yet
!
<EOS>
How
far
off
was
he
then?""Not
more'n
half
a
mile
—
jest
on
t'other
side
of
the
Miami
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
something
has
happened
him
,
"
said
Kate
.
<EOS>
"Maybe
<EOS>
he
gin
chase
arter
another
deer
,
like
I
did
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Ichabod
,
consolingly
.
"
<EOS>
"
'
Tisn't
best
to
be
alarmed
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
""He
would
not
be
likely
to
do
that
,
I
think
,
so
near
night
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
in
some
trepidation
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
with
Kate
,
that
something
has
happened
of
a
serious
nature
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
has
been
killed
,
or
captured
by
the
savages
;
for
I
understand
one
or
two
have
lately
been
seen
prowling
about
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
""God
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
;
and
at
the
moment
the
words
of
the
Necromancer
seemed
ringing
in
her
ears
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
where
have
you
been
,
Ichabod
,
since
you
separated
from
him
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs.
Clarendon
.
"Why
,
<EOS>
ye
see
,
we
both
on
us
started
out
for
to
hunt
some
deer
,
"
answered
the
gardener
,
"
and
a
long
,
dry
chase
we
had
on't
<EOS>
;
for
some
how
the
pesky
critters
seemed
to
know
we
were
arter
'em
,
and
so
kept
out
o
'
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
reckon
we
went
much
as
five
miles
up
the
Miami
,
and
did
n't
see
one
—
though
we
seed
some
fresh
tracks
occasionally
—
and
<EOS>
so
we
concluded
we
'd
give
in
and
come
home
.
<EOS>
When
we
got
most
home
,
say
half
a
mile
off
,
we
somehow
stumbled
on
to
one
that
had
n't
kept
quite
so
good
look
-
out
as
the
rest
,
and
him
I
shot
straightway
.
<EOS>
This
started
up
another
,
that
looked
liked
he
might
be
shot
,
if
a
body
could
get
near
enough
;
and
so
I
told
Mr.
Clarendon
,
that
if
he
'd
see
that
home
,
I
'd
try
my
legs
and
ammunition
for
another
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
would
,
and
off
I
sot
,
and
a
confounded
long
chase
I
had
,
and
did
n't
catch
it
at
last
—
the
scamp
of
a
critter
that
it
was
!
<EOS>
and
when
I
got
started
coming
home
,
I
found
it
gitting
right
dark
.
<EOS>
I
'
spected
he
'd
be
here
,
and
have
some
on't
cooked
when
I
got
here
sartin
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
this
time
the
rain
was
pouring
down
in
torrents
,
the
wind
blew
a
hurricane
,
the
lightning
flashed
almost
incessantly
,
and
the
thunder
came
peal
upon
peal
,
with
terrific
and
deafening
sound
.
<EOS>
"Merciful
<EOS>
Heaven
!
<EOS>
he
could
not
live
in
such
a
storm
as
this
!
"
exclaimed
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
that
crash
!
<EOS>
it
was
like
a
falling
tree
.
<EOS>
""Possibly
<EOS>
his
burthen
may
have
delayed
him
,
and
finding
the
shower
upon
him
,
he
has
taken
shelter
in
the
hollow
of
some
old
sycamore
,
"
suggested
Mrs.
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
you
forget
,
mother
,
"
rejoined
Kate
,
"
that
two
long
hours
have
elapsed
since
Icha
left
him
;
and
surely
he
would
have
reached
home
before
this
,
unless
something
had
happened
of
a
serious
nature
.
<EOS>
""Soon
's
this
storm
's
over
,
I
'll
start
off
in
sarch
,
"
said
Ichabod
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
Bowler
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Kate
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"He
went
with
him
,
"
replied
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
a
happy
thought
strikes
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Kate
,
with
animation
.
<EOS>
"
The
noble
brute
will
obey
me
above
all
others
;
and
if
he
hears
my
voice
,
he
will
come
hither
immediately
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
this
,
she
stepped
to
the
door
and
opened
it
;
but
the
storm
was
raging
so
fiercely
,
that
it
was
found
impossible
to
make
the
proposed
trial
.
<EOS>
For
half
an
hour
the
wind
and
rain
continued
unabated
,
when
the
former
gradually
began
to
die
away
,
and
the
latter
to
slacken
,
while
the
lightning
less
vivid
,
and
the
thunder
more
distant
,
told
that
the
main
force
of
the
shower
had
passed
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
that
Kate
made
the
trial
,
by
elevating
her
voice
,
and
uttering
a
clear
,
musical
call
,
that
could
be
heard
echoing
far
away
through
the
forest
.
<EOS>
All
listened
,
but
heard
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Again
she
called
,
but
still
deep
silence
followed
.
<EOS>
The
third
and
last
trial
was
made
,
when
,
to
the
gratification
of
each
,
the
well
known
yelp
of
Bowler
was
heard
far
away
.
<EOS>
"He
comes
!
<EOS>
he
comes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
and
her
mother
joyfully
,
in
the
same
breath
.
<EOS>
Another
call
,
and
another
yelp
succeeded
—
but
much
nearer
,
showing
that
the
brute
was
making
rapid
progress
toward
them
.
<EOS>
Presently
a
rattling
was
heard
among
the
bushes
near
by
,
and
the
next
moment
the
noble
animal
came
bounding
forward
,
shaking
the
wet
from
his
shaggy
hair
,
and
uttering
a
mournful
howl
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
your
master
,
Bowler
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Kate
,
stooping
down
to
pat
his
head
.
<EOS>
The
dog
looked
up
in
her
face
,
as
if
conscious
of
what
she
said
,
and
then
gave
vent
to
a
low
,
mournful
whine
,
that
ended
at
last
in
a
loud
,
dismal
howl
,
which
made
the
hearts
of
each
tremble
with
a
strange
,
undefinable
fear
;
then
springing
away
,
he
took
the
backward
track
and
disappeared
,
in
spite
of
the
calls
of
Kate
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
I
fear
the
worst
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
cry
,
my
little
pet
—
don't
!
"
began
Ichabod
,
consolingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
al'ays
makes
me
feel
age
rish
to
hear
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
straightway
and
hunt
up
your
father
,
for
he
ca
n't
be
far
off
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
will
accompany
you
,
"
cried
Kate
,
seizing
her
hood
and
placing
it
on
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
quick
,
get
the
lantern
,
Icha
,
and
let
us
be
moving!""Don't
go
,
Kate
,
"
said
her
mother
,
uneasily
;
for
it
is
certainly
imprudent
to
venture
forth
in
such
a
night
,
and
after
so
severe
a
storm
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
,
for
it
can
do
no
good
,
and
will
only
delay
Ichabod
.
<EOS>
""O
<EOS>
yes
,
Katy
,
pet
,
do
n't
go
now
!
"
<EOS>
added
Ichabod
,
coaxingly
,
"
<EOS>
and
as
your
mother
says
,
'
tisn't
prudent
.
<EOS>
"Kate
,
however
,
was
used
to
hav
ing
her
own
way
,
whenever
she
insisted
on
it
;
and
as
,
in
the
present
instance
,
she
had
resolved
on
going
,
so
all
that
was
said
to
the
contrary
was
said
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
Icha
,
quick
now
,
and
get
ready
!
"
<EOS>
was
her
only
reply
;
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
gliding
through
the
wood
,
close
upon
the
heels
of
her
serving
man
,
who
bore
in
one
hand
a
rifle
,
and
in
the
other
a
lighted
lantern
.
<EOS>
The
course
of
our
friends
from
the
cottage
was
nearly
due
east
;
and
after
continuing
for
some
time
without
speaking
,
through
thick
tangles
of
brush
,
that
saturated
them
as
they
passed
,
and
over
large
fallen
trees
,
that
had
been
uprooted
,
or
broken
and
cast
down
by
the
storm
—
they
reached
the
Miami
,
whose
now
dark
,
swollen
and
turbulent
waters
came
rushing
past
with
a
cheerless
,
gloomy
sound
,
which
struck
upon
the
ear
like
the
hollow
rattling
of
earth
upon
a
coffin
.
<EOS>
Luckily
a
small
canoe
,
kept
here
for
fording
the
stream
when
the
water
was
high
,
was
found
hid
among
the
bushes
on
the
western
bank
.
<EOS>
Placing
this
upon
the
stream
,
Ichabod
,
after
vainly
trying
to
persuade
Kate
to
remain
or
return
,
as
sisted
her
into
it
,
and
shoved
across
—
not
,
however
,
without
some
risk
,
as
the
current
,
being
strong
,
rapidly
bore
them
down
several
yards
,
before
they
were
able
to
effect
a
landing
.
<EOS>
Reaching
the
other
bank
at
length
in
safety
,
Kate
gave
another
call
to
Bowler
,
which
,
to
her
gratification
,
was
almost
immediately
answered
.
<EOS>
A
minute
after
,
the
dog
came
bounding
up
to
her
,
whining
piteously
,
and
then
immediately
darted
away
,
and
up
the
hill
,
which
here
rose
somewhat
steep
above
her
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Kate
,
clasping
her
hands
in
an
agony
of
mind
almost
unbearable
,
"
I
know
the
worst
has
happened
!
<EOS>
God
give
me
strength
to
go
through
with
it!""Let
<EOS>
us
forward
,
"
returned
her
companion
,
in
a
voice
slightly
faltering
;
and
taking
Kate
by
the
hand
<EOS>
,
he
began
to
ascend
the
hill
at
a
fast
gait
.
<EOS>
They
had
proceeded
about
a
hundred
yards
further
,
when
they
heard
a
deep
groan
,
which
made
the
blood
of
both
run
coldly
through
their
veins
;
and
Kate
placing
her
hands
upon
her
heart
,
to
still
its
wild
throbbings
,
felt
a
sickening
dizziness
come
over
her
,
that
almost
took
away
the
power
of
motion
.
<EOS>
"I
can
go
no
further
,
"
she
gasped
,
faintly
;
"
I
can
scarcely
stand
.
<EOS>
""Courage
,
darling
,
"
whispered
Ichabod
.
<EOS>
"Help
!
"
cried
a
voice
just
above
them
;
"
for
the
love
of
mercy
,
if
you
are
friends
,
hurry
forward!""Who
be
you
,
and
what
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ichabod
,
springing
up
the
steep
,
and
dragging
Kate
after
him
,
more
dead
than
alive
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
I
am
,
matters
not
,
save
that
I
am
friendly
to
the
right
,
"
answered
the
strange
voice
;
and
the
next
moment
,
the
light
carried
by
Ichabod
flashed
upon
the
comely
form
and
face
of
a
young
man
of
twenty
-
three
,
who
was
standing
alone
,
rifle
in
hand
,
upon
a
huge
rock
,
not
ten
feet
above
their
heads
,
his
handsome
figure
clearly
set
off
against
the
dark
background
beyond
.
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
foul
play
here
,
"
he
added
,
solemnly
.
"Where
?
<EOS>
where
?
"
cried
Ichabod
.
<EOS>
"Just
above
me
,
"
answered
the
stranger
,
springing
into
a
thicket
of
bushes
close
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Ichabod
quickly
gained
the
thicket
,
entered
it
with
Kate
,
and
the
next
moment
he
stood
beside
a
tall
,
old
oak
,
and
saw
the
stranger
upon
his
knees
,
bending
over
some
dark
object
on
the
ground
,
and
the
dog
running
to
and
fro
,
and
whining
mournfully
.
<EOS>
Approaching
with
the
light
,
Ichabod
placed
it
in
a
position
to
reveal
a
horrid
spectacle
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
Kate
uttered
a
loud
shriek
,
and
sank
down
insensible
.
<EOS>
"A
woman
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
stranger
,
springing
to
his
feet
,
with
a
look
of
surprise
;
for
Kate
had
kept
so
much
in
the
shade
,
that
,
until
now
,
he
had
not
been
aware
of
the
presence
of
one
of
the
opposite
sex
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
of
Heaven
!
<EOS>
what
a
shock
for
a
woman
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
stooping
down
and
raising
her
in
his
arms
—
for
under
the
excitement
of
the
moment
,
Ichabod
thought
of
nothing
,
saw
nothing
,
but
the
object
before
him
.
<EOS>
A
sight
for
a
woman
indeed
!
<EOS>
and
more
,
a
sight
for
an
affectionate
daughter
!
<EOS>
Upon
the
ground
,
his
back
partly
supported
by
the
tree
before
mentioned
,
lay
the
father
of
Kate
,
his
features
pale
and
ghastly
,
save
where
they
were
rendered
more
frightful
by
being
spotted
with
blood
.
<EOS>
In
his
breast
was
a
deep
wound
,
and
another
in
his
abdomen
,
from
both
of
which
the
red
current
of
life
was
flowing
freely
,
and
his
vestments
were
already
stained
to
a
frightful
extent
.
<EOS>
Either
wound
was
mortal
,
and
yet
Clarendon
still
survived
;
though
a
few
gasps
,
a
groan
now
and
then
,
and
a
rattling
,
choking
sound
in
his
throat
,
betokened
the
rapid
approach
of
death
.
<EOS>
"May
<EOS>
perdition
seize
the
fiend
that
's
done
this
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ichabod
,
bending
over
the
prostrate
form
of
Clarendon
,
and
bursting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
to
me
,
Mr.
Clarendon
,
my
good
old
friend
—
speak
to
me
,
and
tell
me
who
did
it!"A
<EOS>
groan
was
the
only
answer
.
<EOS>
"It
might
ha
'
been
you
,
sir
,
"
for
all
I
know
,
cried
Ichabod
,
abruptly
,
starting
up
and
turning
to
the
stranger
,
who
was
now
engaged
in
restoring
Kate
to
consciousness
.
<EOS>
"Had
<EOS>
I
done
it
,
think
you
I
would
be
here
now
?
"
returned
the
other
,
sharply
,
an
angry
flush
mantling
his
fine
,
noble
countenance
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
comes
ye
here
at
all
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Ichabod
,
not
well
pleased
with
the
other
's
answer
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
I
will
explain
to
your
satisfaction
some
other
time
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Look
you
,
now
,
and
see
if
it
be
possible
to
save
the
wounded
man!"There
was
a
certain
lofty
superiority
in
the
tone
and
manner
of
the
speaker
,
a
something
which
spoke
one
accustomed
to
command
and
be
obeyed
,
that
completely
over
-
awed
Ichabod
,
and
dispelled
his
doubts
regarding
him
;
and
he
turned
at
once
to
Clarendon
,
to
see
if
it
were
possible
to
save
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
bent
down
to
examine
his
wounds
and
staunch
the
blood
,
his
eye
fell
upon
a
piece
of
white
paper
,
pinned
upon
his
body
,
on
which
was
writing
in
a
legible
hand
;
at
the
same
moment
the
wounded
man
gave
a
groan
,
a
gasp
,
and
all
was
over
.
<EOS>
Tearing
the
paper
from
his
body
,
Ichabod
,
unable
to
read
,
handed
it
to
the
stranger
,
saying:"Here
's
something
,
that
maybe
you
can
tell
what
it
means
.
<EOS>
""By
heavens
!
<EOS>
it
is
a
clue
to
the
mystery
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
other
,
as
his
eye
fell
upon
the
letters
;
and
he
read:"`So
shall
perish
all
my
enemies
!
<EOS>
Wo
to
them
that
bear
the
name
of
the
dead!Rashton
Moody
.
'
"
<EOS>
"
The
damnable
villain
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Ichabod
,
catching
up
his
rifle
,
which
was
leaning
against
the
oak
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
his
sowrn
foe
,
straightway
,
to
death
;
and
if
we
ever
do
meet
,
which
Heaven
grant
,
by
all
my
hopes
of
justice
,
I
'll
kill
him
if
I
can!""Rightly
spoken
,
sir
,
for
a
bold
man
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
I
am
your
friend
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
next
moment
the
hand
of
Ichabod
was
clasped
in
that
of
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
During
this
time
,
the
stranger
hadbeen
supporting
Kate
with
his
left
arm
,
and
chafing
her
temples
with
his
right
hand
;
and
he
now
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
gradually
revive
.
<EOS>
At
length
she
opened
her
eyes
,
gazed
around
her
with
a
bewildered
air
,
and
exclaimed:"Where
am
I
?
<EOS>
and
who
are
you
,
sir?""You
are
safe
,
fair
lady
,
"
answered
the
stranger
,
in
a
mild
,
soothing
tone
,
very
different
from
the
one
in
which
he
had
addressed
Ichabod
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
safe
,
maiden
,
and
in
the
hands
of
one
who
would
suffer
death
sooner
than
see
harm
befall
you
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
believe
he
says
true
,
darling
,
"
observed
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
Icha
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
wildly
,
her
conciousness
fairly
regained
;
"
I
remember
now
—
my
father
—
where
—
what
—
oh
,
God
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
,
and
her
form
shook
convulsively
.
<EOS>
"Be
calm
,
fair
maiden
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
tenderly
<EOS>
;
"
be
tranquil
<EOS>
I
pray
you
.
<EOS>
"Kate
made
a
sudden
bound
,
sprang
from
his
arms
,
and
,
ere
she
could
be
prevented
,
threw
herself
upon
the
corpse
of
her
father
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
father
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
in
tones
of
anguish
,
"
father
—
speak
to
your
Kate!—speak
to
me
!
—
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
no
answer!—he
never
refused
to
answer
me
before
.
<EOS>
Great
God
!
<EOS>
I
have
it
<EOS>
now!—he
is
dead
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
dead
!
<EOS>
dead
!
<EOS>
dead
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
shrieked
,
wildly
.
<EOS>
Then
she
burst
into
tears
and
lamentations
,
while
Ichabod
stood
and
gazed
upon
her
like
one
stultified
,
and
the
stranger
,
placing
his
hands
to
his
eyes
,
brushed
away
a
tear
.
<EOS>
"I
have
seen
some
hard
scenes
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
none
that
moved
me
like
this
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
removed
,
"
he
added
,
touching
Ichabod
on
the
shoulder
.
"
<EOS>
Gently
,
my
worthy
friend
,
let
us
remove
her
.
<EOS>
"Ichabod
<EOS>
drew
a
long
sigh
,
that
seemed
like
a
gasp
,
and
signified
his
assent
to
the
stranger
's
proposition
by
simply
nodding
his
head
.
<EOS>
"Come
<EOS>
,
Kate
,
my
darling
pet
,
"
he
said
,
stooping
down
to
her
,
"
let
's
return
,
and
I
'll
see
to
having
your
father
taken
care
on
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
lady
,
do
!
<EOS>
"
urged
the
stranger
;
"
and
I
pledge
you
my
honor
,
as
a
gentleman
,
that
whatever
can
be
done
,
shall
be
done
,
to
your
satisfaction
,
in
all
that
pertains
to
this
unfortunate
affair
.
<EOS>
""You
are
very
kind
,
sir
,
"
answered
Kate
,
rising
slowly
to
her
feet
,
and
,
by
a
master
effort
,
commanding
her
feelings
so
as
to
speak
somewhat
calmly
;
"
and
I
feel
confident
,
from
your
look
and
voice
,
that
you
can
be
trusted
fully
.
<EOS>
You
will
pardon
me
,
I
trust
,
for
my
wild
manner
.
<EOS>
The
loss
of
a
father
,
and
one
so
affectionate
(
here
the
voice
of
Kate
died
away
to
a
whisper
,
and
she
placed
her
hand
to
her
throat
as
if
to
prevent
strangulation
)
,
and
—
and
—
by
foul
means
too
—
is
no
light
affair
.
<EOS>
""It
is
terrible
!
"
rejoined
the
stranger
,
with
emotion
;
"
and
God
,
who
sees
the
hearts
of
all
,
knows
that
I
sympathize
with
you
and
yours
most
deeply
;
and
could
I
,
by
any
sacrifice
,
ease
you
,
fair
lady
,
of
a
single
pang
,
that
sacrifice
should
be
freely
made
.
<EOS>
""Tell
—
me
<EOS>
—
truly;—he
—
he
—
is
dead
—
is
he
—
he
not
?
"
gasped
Kate
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
bent
over
,
felt
of
the
corpse
in
several
places
,
and
answered
sadly:"I
fear
he
is
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
a
moment
Kate
stood
with
her
hands
to
her
eyes
,
while
her
whole
form
shook
fearfully
;
then
withdrawing
them
,
she
said:"I
will
endeavor
to
be
more
calm
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
bear
the
body
of
my
father
to
the
cottage
,
I
will
go
before
with
the
light
.
<EOS>
"A
look
of
surprise
and
admiration
lighted
up
the
countenance
of
the
stranger
,
and
he
said
,
as
if
to
himself:"She
who
can
so
command
herself
on
an
occasion
like
this
<EOS>
—
show
so
much
nerve
—
can
be
no
ordinary
being
.
<EOS>
Lady
,
"
he
added
to
Kate
,
respectfully
,
"
your
request
shall
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Come
,
my
friend
,
"
he
continued
,
touching
Ichabod
,
who
was
now
standing
with
his
hands
locked
behind
him
,
his
chin
dropped
upon
his
bosom
,
his
eyes
fastened
upon
the
dead
,
and
apparently
heeding
nothing
that
had
been
spoken
since
his
own
remarks
to
Kate
:
"
Come
,
my
friend
,
let
us
tarry
here
no
longer
.
<EOS>
I
will
assist
you
in
carrying
the
corpse
down
to
the
dwelling
of
this
fair
lady
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
a
few
minutes
a
rough
kind
of
litter
was
prepared
,
on
which
having
laid
the
mortal
remains
of
George
Clarendon
,
Ichabod
and
the
stranger
,
preceded
by
Kate
,
bore
it
slowly
forward
down
the
descent
.
<EOS>
Reaching
the
Miami
,
the
party
entered
the
canoe
,
and
paddled
across
in
safety
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
about
raising
the
litter
to
proceed
again
,
the
dog
,
which
had
kept
them
company
,
uttered
a
low
growl
,
and
,
at
the
same
moment
,
a
deep
voice
was
heard
chanting:"Where
<EOS>
the
parent
stem
is
broken,'Neath
<EOS>
the

<EOS>
""Who
speaks
thus
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
stranger
,
drawing
a
pistol
,
and
preparing
to
rush
into
the
thicket
.
<EOS>
"One
who
knows
both
thee
and
the
future
<EOS>
,
"
answered
Blind
Luther
the
Necromancer
,
stepping
forth
from
his
covert
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
not
you
,
"
returned
the
other
,
haughtily
,
"
nor
why
you
appear
here
at
such
a
time
,
chanting
such
mystic
words
.
<EOS>
A
foul
murder
has
just
been
done
,
and
I
feel
myself
called
upon
to
arrest
all
suspicious
persons
found
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
sir
,
if
I
now
arrest
you
,
in
the
name
of
the
general
commonwealth
of
these
United
States
.
<EOS>
"
As
he
spoke
,
the
stranger
threw
off
an
oil
-
skin
coat
,
and
displayed
the
uniform
of
a
military
officer
.
<EOS>
Then
drawing
a
sword
from
his
side
,
he
laid
the
blade
upon
the
shoulder
of
Luther
,
and
added
:
"
You
are
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
sudden
and
singular
was
this
last
proceeding
,
that
Kate
and
Ichabod
remained
for
a
moment
silent
,
<EOS>
when
the
former
found
her
voice
and
exclaimed:"Harm
him
not
,
sir
,
I
pray
you
!
<EOS>
We
know
him
,
and
that
he
is
as
innocent
as
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Luther
,
"
she
added
to
him
,
"
I
fear
thou
art
a
bird
of
evil
omen
.
<EOS>
Behold
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
pointed
to
the
dead
.
<EOS>
"I
am
a
messenger
of
truth
,
"
replied
Luther
;
"
and
yet
I
deeply
sympathize
with
you
,
and
regret
the
decrees
of
fate
.
<EOS>
I
saved
your
life
,
and
might
his
,
had
it
been
so
ordained
.
"
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
the
young
officer
,
who
,
meantime
,
had
sheathed
his
sword
,
he
continued
,
in
a
tone
of
superiority
:
"
Boy
,
you
might
as
well
arrest
the
wind
!
<EOS>
Think
you
I
would
go
with
you
against
my
will
?
<EOS>
No
,
Ernest
Clifton
,
you
have
mistaken
him
who
addresses
you
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
ejaculated
the
officer
<EOS>
"
you
know
me
then?""You
!
<EOS>
ay
—
and
your
parents
before
you
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
parents
?
<EOS>
heavens
!
<EOS>
Who
are
you
,
pray?""Ask
your
friends
.
<EOS>
"Clifton
turned
inquiringly
to
Kate
.
<EOS>
"We
know
him
as
Blind
Luther
,
the
Necromancer
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"I
know
no
such
person
,
"
rejoined
Ernest
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
know
yourself
?
"
asked
Luther
.
<EOS>
A
flush
mantled
the
cheeks
of
the
young
officer
as
he
replied:"You
ask
a
strange
question
,
sir
.
<EOS>
""Which
<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
you
in
the
negative
,
"
said
Luther
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
neither
yourself
nor
your
parents
.
<EOS>
""Do
you
wish
to
insult
me
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
other
,
reddening
and
somewhat
confused
.
<EOS>
"I
wish
to
insult
no
man
.
<EOS>
But
enough
!
<EOS>
you
shall
know
more
in
time
.
"
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Kate
,
he
continued
:
"
As
I
told
thee
before
,
fair
damsel,"When
sorrows
dark
do
weigh
thee
down
<EOS>
,
Thou
shalt
behold
<EOS>
this
mystic
crown;[Here
he
touched
the
band
around
his
head.]"And
in
the
depths
of
deepest
woe
,
<EOS>
The
mysteries
I
have
told
thee
,
know
;
<EOS>
Whate'er
thy
fortune
,
nobly
bear
,
And
yield
thee
never
to
despair
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
I
told
thee
,
"
continued
the
Necromancer,"When
the
new
moon
shall
be
near
,
<EOS>
One
whose
blood
now
warmly
flows
,
Shall
in
death
find
stern
repose—[Here
<EOS>
he
pointed
to
the
corpse.]When
the
earth
drinks
blood
and
rain
,
Some
shall
see
this
form
again—[Here
he
smote
his
breast.]Then
a
child
can
tell
the
tale
,
Over
which
now
hangs
a
vail
.
"Behold
<EOS>
so
much
of
my
prophesy
,
and
await
the
revealings
of
the
great
future
.
<EOS>
We
shall
all
meet
again,"When
dark
storms
around
us
lower
,
Or
bright
sunshine
rules
the
hour
.
"Farewell
!
"
<EOS>
and
as
he
concluded
speaking
,
Luther
sprang
into
the
thicket
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
"A
strange
,
eccentric
being
,
"
observed
young
Clifton
,
as
if
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Then
motioning
Ichabod
to
assist
him
,
he
bent
down
to
raise
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
way
to
the
cottage
of
the
deceased
was
passed
in
silence
.

CHAPTER
VII.The
blight
of
hope
and
happiness
Is
felt
when
fond
ones
part
,
And
the
bitter
tear
that
follows
,
is
The
life
-
blood
of
the
heart.—Fitz
-
Green
Halleok
.
<EOS>
We
thank
you
,
friends
,
that
you
have
buried
our
dead
forever
from
our
sight.—The
BuriaIt
is
needless
for
us
to
describe
,
or
even
attempt
to
describe
,
the
scene
which
followed
the
awful
announcement
to
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
that
her
well
-
beloved
partner
for
life
was
no
more
—
or
when
,
too
,
nearly
frantic
with
the
news
,
she
rushed
to
him
and
beheld
him
all
gory
with
the
generous
blood
that
had
so
lately
warmed
his
veins
.
<EOS>
And
even
did
we
describe
it
,
what
benefit
would
accrue
to
the
reader
?
<EOS>
Who
could
realize
the
heart
-
rending
agony
,
but
such
as
have
been
placed
in
similar
circumstances
;
and
for
such
,
no
description
is
needed
;
for
all
potent
and
poignant
memory
will
too
forcibly
recall
the
eventful
past
.
<EOS>
Suffice
,
that
she
was
nigh
distracted
with
grief
,
and
,
for
several
hours
,
manifested
strong
symptoms
of
confirmed
insanity
.
<EOS>
The
day
following
,
nearly
all
the
villagers
,
who
received
the
news
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
,
flocked
to
the
house
of
mourning
,
to
behold
the
deceased
,
and
condole
with
the
living
.
<EOS>
As
Clarendon
came
to
his
death
in
a
manner
so
singular
,
it
was
judged
expedient
to
hold
an
inquest
over
the
body
.
<EOS>
For
this
purpose
,
a
jury
was
speedily
collected
,
consisting
of
twelve
persons
,
among
whom
were
two
physicians
,
who
at
once
proceeded
to
examine
the
body
minutely
,
and
who
gave
it
as
their
opinion
,
that
the
deceased
came
to
his
death
by
reason
of
gashes
made
by
a
knife
upon
his
breast
and
abdomen
.
<EOS>
Ernest
Clifton
,
the
young
officer
,
who
had
remained
over
night
at
the
cottage
,
was
next
called
upon
to
state
what
he
knew
in
regard
to
the
affair
,
and
how
he
came
to
be
found
with
the
deceased
,
so
far
from
any
habitation
,
alone
,
at
such
a
time
of
night
,
and
under
circumstances
so
calculated
to
render
him
an
object
of
suspicion
.
<EOS>
The
jury
had
now
formed
a
circle
around
the
deceased
,
in
the
adjoining
apartment
or
cabin
,
and
as
the
spokesman
concluded
,
each
turned
his
face
toward
Ernest
,
who
,
with
some
five
or
six
other
spectators
,
was
standing
just
without
the
ring
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
the
question
put
,
he
started
,
a
deep
flush
mantled
his
features
,
and
without
ado
,
he
stepped
boldly
within
the
circle
,
and
with
one
hand
gently
touched
the
dead
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
noble
-
looking
young
man
,
nearly
six
feet
in
height
,
with
handsome
proportions
,
that
lost
nothing
of
their
beauty
in
being
set
off
by
his
close
-
fitting
uniform
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
comely
and
very
expressive
;
and
there
was
a
nobility
in
his
high
,
broad
forehead
,
surmounted
by
dark
brown
curls
,
and
in
his
full
black
eyes
,
which
forbade
the
idea
that
he
could
be
guilty
of
a
mean
or
base
action
.
<EOS>
"Gentlemen
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
calmly
,
and
with
dignity
,
moving
his
eyes
slowly
around
the
circle
,
and
resting
them
for
a
moment
on
each
member
:
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
you
have
heard
me
called
upon
to
state
what
I
know
in
regard
to
this
unfortunate
affair
,
in
a
manner
calculated
to
leave
upon
your
minds
the
impression
that
my
knowledge
was
not
honestly
and
honorably
gained
.
<EOS>
What
object
the
speaker
had
in
addressing
me
in
the
way
he
did
,
I
know
not
,
but
shall
call
upon
him
to
explain
hereafter
;
and
I
trust
his
answer
will
be
satisfactory
:
<EOS>
otherwise
(
here
he
gracefully
and
lightly
touched
the
hilt
of
his
sword
with
his
right
hand
,
and
fixed
his
eyes
steadily
upon
the
one
alluded
to
,
who
quailed
before
his
glance
)
,
there
is
,
thank
fortune
!
<EOS>
an
honorable
way
of
settling
all
matters
of
a
similar
nature
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
now
proceed
,
"
he
continued
,
"
to
state
the
facts
,
briefly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
as
you
will
perceive
by
my
uniform
,
I
am
in
the
service
of
the
Government
.
<EOS>
I
hold
a
lieutenant
's
commission
,
and
am
quartered
at
Cincinnati
.
<EOS>
Some
few
nights
since
,
word
was
brought
to
my
commanding
officer
,
that
a
body
of
Indians
was
prowling
about
the
vicinity
,
and
that
,
unless
they
were
seen
to
in
time
,
serious
results
would
be
likely
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
I
was
immediately
ordered
to
head
a
detachment
of
ten
picked
men
,
and
scour
the
surrounding
country
,
and
if
I
found
no
Indians
,
to
divide
and
send
my
men
out
separately
as
scouts
.
<EOS>
To
make
a
long
story
short
,
my
men
were
sent
out
in
every
direction
,
one
after
another
,
until
I
was
left
entirely
alone
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
while
scouting
myself
,
I
reached
and
crossed
the
Little
Miami
,
and
was
on
my
return
last
evening
to
the
garrison
,
when
,
finding
myself
belated
,
and
that
a
severe
storm
was
approaching
,
I
ascended
a
tree
to
await
the
appearance
of
a
clear
sky
.
<EOS>
While
in
the
tree
,
I
several
times
fancied
I
heard
a
groan
,
but
thought
I
had
most
probably
mistaken
the
wailings
of
the
storm
,
which
was
then
raging
with
fury
,
for
a
human
voice
.
<EOS>
When
the
storm
began
to
die
away
,
I
descended
to
the
ground
,
for
the
purpose
of
resuming
my
journey
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
I
done
so
,
when
I
heard
the
mournful
howl
of
a
dog
near
by
.
<EOS>
Thinking
there
must
be
something
wrong
,
I
hastened
in
the
direction
<EOS>
whence
the
noise
proceeded
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
gone
far
,
when
I
heard
a
distant
call
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
,
the
dog
,
with
a
yelp
,
bounded
away
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
a
deep
groan
sounded
in
my
ear
;
and
pressing
forward
,
I
was
not
long
in
finding
the
cause
in
the
person
of
the
deceased
,
who
was
lying
upon
his
side
,
under
a
large
tree
,
and
bleeding
profusely
from
a
couple
of
wounds
,
located
as
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
I
questioned
him
as
to
what
had
occurred
,
but
he
was
too
far
gone
to
answer
.
<EOS>
I
endeavored
to
staunch
the
blood
,
but
did
not
succeed
in
doing
much
good
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
dog
returned
;
and
shortly
after
,
I
saw
a
light
in
the
distance
,
apparently
moving
toward
me
.
<EOS>
Steadily
the
light
approached
,
and
at
length
I
espied
a
couple
of
figures
with
it
.
<EOS>
From
my
position
,
I
was
afterward
enabled
to
keep
them
in
view
,
until
near
enough
to
make
them
hear
my
voice
,
when
I
urged
them
to
hasten
forward
,
while
I
at
once
sprang
back
to
the
deceased
.
<EOS>
While
bending
over
the
wounded
man
,
I
heard
a
shriek
,
and
looking
around
,
was
surprised
to
find
a
beautiful
female
near
me
,
on
the
ground
,
in
a
swooning
state
.
<EOS>
I
hastened
to
raise
her
in
my
arms
,
and
while
engaged
in
restoring
her
to
consciousness
,
the
unfortunate
man
breathed
his
last
.
<EOS>
On
his
breast
was
found
this
paper
,
which
having
perused
,
and
taken
the
testimony
of
Miss
Clarendon
and
her
serving
-
man
,
I
trust
,
gentlemen
,
you
will
fully
exonerate
me
from
even
a
suspicion
of
being
in
any
manner
concerned
in
the
death
of
him
now
lying
before
you
.
"As
<EOS>
Clifton
concluded
,
he
presented
to
the
foreman
of
the
jury
the
paper
alluded
to
,
which
the
reader
will
recollect
as
the
one
bearing
the
signature
of
Rashton
Moody
.
<EOS>
No
little
excitement
was
created
on
reading
this
,
for
all
knew
Moody
well
,
and
also
the
cause
of
quarrel
between
him
and
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
Kate
and
Ichabod
were
called
and
examined
separately
;
but
as
their
testimony
only
corroborated
Clifton
's
,
the
matter
was
soon
decided
,
and
<EOS>
the
verdict
rendered
—
That
George
Clarendon
came
to
his
death
by
means
of
a
knife
,
or
some
other
sharp
instrument
,
in
the
hands
of
Rashton
Moody
,
whom
the
jury
in
consequence
considers
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
.
<EOS>
The
funeral
of
Clarendon
took
place
on
the
following
day
,
and
was
attended
by
a
large
concourse
of
citizens
,
of
both
sexes
,
all
of
whom
appeared
to
sympathize
deeply
with
the
afflicted
family
.
<EOS>
The
funeral
service
was
uncommonly
solemn
and
impressive
,
and
when
the
speaker
concluded
,
scarcely
a
dry
eye
could
be
found
in
the
whole
assemblage
.
<EOS>
A
long
procession
attended
the
corpse
to
its
last
earthly
resting
place
,
which
was
the
quiet
little
graveyard
covering
the
knoll
,
where
stood
the
sanctuary
,
of
which
mention
was
made
in
the
opening
chapter
of
this
history
.
<EOS>
As
the
soft
earth
fell
with
a
hollow
,
rattling
sound
upon
the
coffin
,
assuring
the
living
that
the
last
parting
between
them
and
the
dead
had
really
taken
place
,
not
a
dry
eye
could
be
found
among
the
group
that
now
stood
around
the
open
grave
.
<EOS>
As
for
Kate
and
her
mother
,
their
sobs
and
lamentations
were
truly
heart
-
rending
;
and
it
almost
required
force
to
remove
them
from
the
"
narrow
house
appointed
for
all
living
.
<EOS>
"Ernest
<EOS>
Clifton
,
from
one
cause
or
another
,
had
not
yet
taken
his
departure
;
and
a
stranger
to
have
seen
him
at
the
funeral
,
and
at
the
grave
of
Clarendon
,
would
have
pronounced
him
one
of
the
chief
mourners
—
so
pale
were
his
features
,
and
so
sad
in

<EOS>
As
Kate
and
her
mother
quitted
the
grave
,
he
held
their
horses
,
assisted
them
to
mount
,
and
then
,
with
Ichabod
,
kept
them
company
on
foot
,
as
they
slowly
took
their
way
to
their
now
desolate
home
.
<EOS>
Here
,
after
partaking
some
refreshment
,
he
said:"Friends
—
for
I
claim
the
privilege
of
calling
you
by
that
endearing
term
—
our
first
meeting
and
acquaintance
has
been
made
under
strange
and
heart
-
rending
circumstances
—
such
as
I
trust
it
may
never
be
our
lot
to
witness
again
.
<EOS>
To
say
that
I
deeply
,
from
my
heart
,
sympathize
with
you
in
your
affliction
,
would
be
to
repeat
in
words
what
my
actions
have
already
spoken
.
<EOS>
Duty
now
calls
me
away
;
and
I
fear
I
have
intruded
too
long
already
;
for
whatever
might
have
been
my
feelings
,
I
should
have
remembered
that
I
was
a
stranger
,
and
therefore
had
no
right
to
press
my
sympathies
upon
your
notice
.
<EOS>
And
if
in
doing
so
I
have
,
in
your
view
of
the
matter
,
overstepped
the
bounds
of
propriety
,
I
trust
you
will
fully
acquit
me
,
on
the
ground
that
all
was
meant
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sorry
you
think
it
necessary
to
make
apologies
,
Mr.
Clifton
,
"
answered
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
while
Kate
looked
up
at
the
young
officer
with
tearful
eyes
;
"
for
I
assure
you
,
we
feel
deeply
our
obligations
to
you
,
for
the
kindness
manifested
in
this
awful
,
soul
-
rending
calamity
,
and
sincerely
regret
that
the
time
has
come
for
you
to
leave
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
we
have
known
you
only
a
short
period
;
but
there
are
times
when
the
friendship
of
an
hour
bears
with
it
the
weight
of
a
lifetime
;
and
such
,
I
assure
you
,
is
yours
.
<EOS>
That
you
are
a
stranger
,
comparatively
speaking
,
I
know
;
and
yet
,
somehow
,
it
seems
as
if
I
had
known
you
for
years
;
and
I
hope
,
sincerely
,
that
though
duty
now
calls
you
away
,
you
will
not
altogether
neglect
the
house
of
the
widow
and
orphan
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
be
too
happy
in
the
privilege
of
calling
upon
you
whenever
circumstances
will
permit
,
"
answered
Ernest
,
glancing
toward
Kate
,
whose
eyes
modestly
sought
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"Any
<EOS>
thing
that
a
poor
body
like
me
can
do
to
sarve
ye
,
Mr.
Clifton
,
"
rejoined
Ichabod
,
"
shall
ever
be
done
straightway
,
if
you
'll
only
mention
it
.
<EOS>
""Thank
you
,
"
returned
Clifton
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
Miss
Kate
,
"
he
continued
,
advancing
and
taking
her
hand
,
which
,
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
the
contrary
,
trembled
not
a
little
,
"
I
must
say
farewell
—
<EOS>
may
I
hope
it
is
not
forever?""Certainly
not
forever
,
"
said
Kate
,
looking
up
with
a
start
;
and
then
,
as
she
saw
the
dark
eyes
of
the
other
beaming
tenderly
upon
her
,
she
became
embarrassed
,
and
stammered
;
"
That
is
,
I
—
I
—
trust
you
will
call
again
to
see
us
—
for
—
for
—
friendship
sake
,
Mr.
Clifton
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
call
again
,
"
returned
Clifton
,
pointedly
;
and
shaking
the
hand
of
each
,
he
quitted
the
cottage
and
set
out
upon
his
return
to
the
garrison
.

<EOS>
It
is
one
of
the
blessings
of
Divine
Providence
that
the
mind
can
be
healed
as
well
as
the
body
—
otherwise
what
wretched
creatures
should
we
be
indeed!—for
who
,
among
the
most
heaven
favored
of
us
all
<EOS>
,
hath
not
lost
a
friend
—
a
near
and
dear
relative
—
and
felt
his
soul
oppressed
by
a
weight
of
woe
,
that
then
seemed
destined
never
to
be
removed
;
but
which
time
has
gradually
lightened
,
until
the
heart
has
leaped
as
free
and
joyous
as
in
the
noon
-
tide
of
its
prosperity
.
<EOS>
It
is
hard
to
part
from
those
we
love
—
even
when
we
expect
to
behold
them
again
in
life
—
for
the
separation
leaves
an
aching
void
,
that
nothing
for
the
time
can
fill
—
<EOS>
and
of
course
it
must
be
proportionately
hard
to
part
from
those
we
love
,
knowing
that
we
shall
behold
them
no
more
,
until
we
ourselves
shall
have
put
off
the
mortal
and
put
on
immortality
.
<EOS>
But
,
notwithstanding
this
,
we
should
ever
strive
to
avoid
being
too
much
cast
down
;
should
buoy
ourselves
up
with
the
reflection
,
that
all
are
born
to
die
;
and
that
they
who
have
passed
the
fatal
barrier
have
already
done
with
a
world
of
trouble
,
and
entered
upon
a
new
,
and
,
we
trust
,
more
happy
existence
—
where
we
,
when
we
have
played
our
parts
on
the
stage
of
life
,
shall
join
them
to
separate
no
more
forever
.
<EOS>
Let
us
philosophize
that
death
is
but
a
sleep
,
and
eternity
a
delightful
dream
,
and
that
the
sooner
our
spirits
leave
this
troublesome
tenement
,
fitly
prepared
for
the
change
,
the
sooner
we
shall
be
in
Heaven
.
<EOS>
Some
minds
are
so
constituted
,
that
the
least
trouble
seems
sufficient
to
overthrow
them
,
and
great
troubles
drive
them
nearly
distracted
;
and
yet
after
a
little
,
they
gradually
become
tranquil
,
sorrow
passes
away
,
and
they
appear
as
gay
and
light
-
hearted
as
before
:
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
we
find
others
,
who
appear
calm
amid
the
lesser
ills
,
and
amid
the
greater
make
little
or
no
complaint
,
and
yet
are
secretly
borne
down
to
the
grave
by
the
afflictions
they
scarce
seem
to
lament
.
<EOS>
Something
of
both
these
natures
could
be
found
in
Kate
and
her
mother
.
<EOS>
As
time
wore
on
,
the
former
gradually
became
more
and
more
herself
;
while
the
latter
appeared
to
pine
away
in
secret
,
as
though
some
inward
disease
were
preying
upon
her
vitals
.
<EOS>
From
the
moment
she
received
the
news
of
her
husband
's
death
,
Mrs.
Clarendon
was
never
known
to
smile
;
and
though
at
first
she
made
great
lamentation
over
him
,
yet
this
soon
settled
into
a
quiet
,
silent
melancholy
,
that
foreboded
,
ere
long
,
either
death
or
insanity
.
<EOS>
Three
months
rolled
away
,
and
the
mother
of
Kate
was
found
to
be
in
a
decline
of
health
.
<EOS>
A
cold
that
she
had
caught
some
two
months
before
,
had
settled
on
her
lungs
,
which
,
together
with
grief
for
the
loss
of
her
husband
,
was
now
making
those
rapid
strides
with
her
constitution
,
that
always
awaken
fears
of
the
most
painful
nature
.
<EOS>
She
coughed
a
good
deal
—
her
voice
became
changed
—
more
hoarse
and
hollow
—
and
there
was
,
at
times
,
a
wax
-
like
transparency
about
her
skin
,
and
a
hectic
flush
on
her
cheek
,
that
told
,
with
unmistakable
certainty
,
of
the
silent
work
of
death
going
on
within
.
<EOS>
Kate
noticed
the
progress
of
the
fell
destroyer
with
less
alarm
than
might
have
been
supposed
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
she
did
not
realize
how
much
had
already
been
done
,
and
looked
forward
to
years
of
companionship
with
her
mother
.
<EOS>
But
not
so
Mrs.
Clarendon
herself
.
<EOS>
Unlike
many
who
have
that
flattering
disease
,
consumption
,
fastened
upon
them
,
she
saw
and
felt
her
danger
;
and
,
like
the
wise
ones
of
old
,
deemed
it
expedient
to
have
her
lamps
trimmed
and
burning
,
ready
for
the
coming
of
the
bridegroom
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
one
bright
summer
's
day
toward
the
latter
part
of
August
,
she
bade
Kate
seat
herself
by
her
side
,
that
they
might
converse
on
a
subject
of
no
little
moment
to
both
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
has
now
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
laying
her
thin
,
transparent
hand
on
the
white
and
plump
one
of
Kate
,
thereby
displaying
a
painful
contrast
between
sickness
and
health
:
"
<EOS>
It
has
now
,
daughter
,
been
three
months
,
since
that
terrible
night
when
your
father
was
brought
home
a
corpse
,
and
your
acquaintance
began
with
Ernest
Clifton
;
and
as
I
know
I
am
not
long
destined
to
remain
and
watch
over
you
,
I
wish
you
to
tell
me
,
truly
,
how
you
stand
affected
toward
each
other
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
mother
,
"
exclaimed
Kate
,
turning
her
eyes
tenderly
and
earnestly
upon
the
other
,
"
what
mean
you
,
by
using
such
gloomy
words?""Look
here
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
touching
her
face
with
her
finger
,
"
do
you
not
behold
here
the
effects
of
inward
disease
and
certain
<EOS>
decay?""But
death
may
not
come
for
years
,
yet
,
mother
,
"
rejoined
Kate
,
anxiously
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
<EOS>
Clarendon
shook
her
head
sadly
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
mistake
,
daughter
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Put
weeks
in
place
of
years
,
and
perhaps
you
will
have
hit
it
.
<EOS>
No
,
Kate
,
my
darling
,
I
know
,
by
an
inward
monitor
—
by
this
dry
,
hollow
cough
—
that
I
am
not
long
for
this
world
;
and
I
am
anxious
to
know
what
will
become
of
you
,
when
you
find
yourself
alone
,
with
no
father
nor
mother
to
turn
to
for
protection
and
advice
.
<EOS>
""Mother
,
dear
mother
,
do'nt
talk
<EOS>
so
"
cried
Kate
,
bursting
into
tears
,
and
burying
her
head
upon
the
lap
of
her
parent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
mother
,
you
will
,
you
must
live
years
yet
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
can
not
part
with
you
so
soon
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
your
sake
,
child
,
I
would
to
God
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
could!—but
<EOS>
He
who
sees
the
sparrow
fall
,
has
ordered
otherwise
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
do
not
talk
so
,
mother
!
<EOS>
You
are
ill
now
I
know
—
but
you
may
yet
be
well
again
.
<EOS>
""Child
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
bending
over
her
daughter
affectionately
,
her
now
somewhat
sunken
eyes
moist
with
tears
:
"
Child
,
do
not
delude
yourself
with
any
false
hope
.
<EOS>
The
grass
that
comes
upward
beneath
the
fairy
-
like
tread
of
the
foot
of
Spring
,
may
rise
,
perchance
,
from
the
soil
resting
on
the
body
of
your
mother
;
and
that
,
too
,
ere
another
year
has
joined
the
great
unapproachable
Past
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
when
last
you
saw
Ernest
Clifton
,
and
how
matters
stand
between
you
!
<EOS>
I
ask
with
no
idle
curiosity
;
I
ask
only
as
a
mother
;
so
tell
me
truly
.
<EOS>
""It
is
a
week
,
dearest
mother
,
since
we
last
met
,
"
answered
Kate
,
looking
up
through
her
tears
,
a
slight
flush
giving
her
comely
features
a
beautiful
glow
;
"
but
as
to
the
matters
you
allude
to
,
I
scarcely
know
how
to
answer
.
<EOS>
""Has
<EOS>
he
ever
offered
you
his
hand?""Not
exactly
,
"
answered
Kate
,
hesitatingly
;
"
though
perhaps
he
would
have
done
so
,
had
I
always
remained
silent
at
the
proper
time
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
why
did
you
not
,
my
daughter
?
<EOS>
Do
you
not
love
him?""I
<EOS>
hardly
know
what
love
is
,
"
answered
Kate
,
dropping
her
eyes
to
the
ground
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
certainly
admire
him
more
than
any
other
I
have
ever
seen
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
admire
him
sufficiently
,
to
desire
him
for
a
life
-
companion
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
"I
think
I
could
be
happy
with
him
,
mother
.
<EOS>
""Then
,
daughter
,
understand
me
!
<EOS>
From
what
I
have
seen
,
I
think
him
a
brave
,
noble
,
and
generous
young
man
,
and
worthy
of
you
;
and
it
is
my
desire
to
see
you
united
before
I
die
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
mother
,
you
are
talking
of
death
again
,
"
said
Kate
,
her
tears
starting
afresh
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
know
not
,
daughter
,
when
we
may
be
called
away
;
and
should
my
death
be
sudden
,
it
would
be
a
bitter
pang
to
know
I
was
leaving
you
behind
without
a
protector
,
in
this
cold
,
calculating
world
.
<EOS>
But
of
course
I
leave
the
matter
with
yourself
,
to
do
as
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
Marriage
is
a
solemn
undertaking
,
and
should
not
be
lightly
entered
into
.
<EOS>
Unless
you
can
place
your
full
,
undivided
affections
upon
one
individual
,
do
not
marry
at
all
;
for
there
are
,
necessarily
,
trials
in
married
life
,
that
none
but
such
as
truly
love
can
surmount
with
any
thing
like
harmony
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
would
delight
me
more
than
to
see
you
happily
wedded
;
yet
,
understand
,
I
do
not
wish
to
influence
you
against
your
choice
,
and
your
own
sober
reason
;
for
,
as
I
said
before
,
marriage
is
a
most
solemn
undertaking
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
we
are
on
the
subject
,
pray
tell
me
how
it
stands
with
your
former
suitors?""Why
,
Danvers
and
Danbury
,
I
believe
,
have
suited
themselves
elsewhere
;
and
as
for
that
villain
,
Moody—""Name
him
not
,
Kate
—
name
him
not
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
covering
her
eyes
,
and
shuddering
at
the
images
of
horror
which
his
name
called
up
.
<EOS>
"
May
he
meet
his
deserts
,
is
all
I
ask
.
<EOS>
Yet
one
question
:
Has
he
been
found?""He
has
not
,
although
Governor
St.
Clair
has
offered
the
reward
of
a
hundred
dollars
for
his
apprehension
.
<EOS>
It
is
supposed
,
by
some
,
that
he
has
joined
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
we
may
fear
the
worst
,
"
rejoined
the
mother
of
our
heroine
,
sadly
.
"Why
<EOS>
so
,
mother?""Have
you
forgotten
the
awful
threat
contained
on
that
paper
,
Kate—`Wo
to
them
that
bear
the
name
of
the
dead
?
'
"
<EOS>
"
O
,
that
might
have
been
done
to
intimidate
us
,
you
know
,
mother
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
it
trouble
you
.
<EOS>
I
feel
not
the
least
apprehension
;
for
Ern
—
a

Mr

<EOS>
Clifton
assured
me
,
that
scouts
were
continually
out
in
all
directions
,
so
that
at
present
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
body
of
Indians
to
reach
either
this
place
or
Cincinnati
,
before
alarm
of
their
approach
would
be
given
.
""Yet
<EOS>
do
not
rely
too
much
upon
your
safety
,
Kate
,
"
pursued
Mrs.
Clarendon
;
"
for
I
have
been
informed
,
that
the
force
at
Fort
Washington
is
not
large
,
so
that
from
there
not
many
soldiers
could
be
spared
for
scouting
purposes
.
<EOS>
Now
I
think
of
it
seriously
,
perhaps
we
had
better
give
up
our
premises
here
and
take
up
our
quarters
nearer
<EOS>
some
block
-
house!""But
<EOS>
why
so
,
mother
?
<EOS>
Has
any
thing
new
and
startling
transpired
to
alarin
<EOS>
you?""Why
<EOS>
,
I
had
a
very
singular
dream
last
night
,
which
,
I
confess
,
troubles
me
not
a
little
on
your
account
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
was
standing
in
a
beantiful
arbor
,
surrounded
by
flowers
of
all
colors
and
varieties
—
from
the
modest
pink
and
violet
,
to
the
large
and
luxuriant
rose
—
and
that
you
and
many
others
were
seated
around
,
arrayed
in
white
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
some
solemn
occasion
of
rejoicing
—
something
like
a
wedding
,
and
yet
not
a
wedding
either
.
<EOS>
In
the
center
of
the
group
stood
an
old
,
grey
-
headed
man
,
that
methought
was
our
pastor
;
and
yet
,
the
resemblance
to
him
was
not
perfect
,
but
confused
.
<EOS>
Methought
he
raised
his
trembling
hands
above
his
venerable
head
,
to
pronounce
a
benediction
,
when
suddenly
,
and
while
every
eye
was
upon
him
,
a
dark
cloud
enveloped
us
,
and
forth
with
resounded
shrieks
and
groans
,
the
most
awful
I
ever
heard
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
I
felt
my
self
growing
dizzy
—
indistinct
objects
whirled
past
me
—
and
I
felt
myself
to
be
falling
—
down
—
down
—
down
—
into
a
horrible
lake
of
blood
—
when
your
father
,
pale
as
marble
,
sprang
forward
,
clasped
me
in
his
arms
,
and
,
hurrying
me
away
to
some
quiet
spot
,
whispered
in
my
ear
,
`
<EOS>
We
have
met
to
part
no
more
.
'
<EOS>
With
a
cry
of
joy
,
tinged
with
the
horror
of
the
scene
I
had
just
witnessed
,
I
awoke
,
and
found
myself
lying
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
What
augur
you
from
the
dream
,
my
daughter?""Why
,
I
do
not
think
it
best
to
give
ourselves
any
uneasiness
about
it
;
people
often
dream
as
strangely
,
without
any
serious
results
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
somehow
,
"
pursued
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
"
I
can
not
shake
off
the
impression
,
that
this
portends
evil
to
somebody
—
perhaps
myself
.
<EOS>
""God
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Kate
,
fervently
,
throwing
her
arms
around
her
mother
's
neck
,
and
pressing
a
kiss
upon
her
fading
lips
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
any
thing
should
happen
you
,
dearest
mother
!
<EOS>
But
let
us
hope
our
afflictions
are
over
—
at
least
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
""It
is
always
proper
to
hope
,
child
;
and
God
in
his
goodness
has
so
ordained
it
,
that
there
are
but
few
situations
,
in
all
the
changes
of
human
life
,
where
hope
becomes
extinct
.
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
have
you
seen
any
thing
of
Luther
of
late?""No
<EOS>
,
I
have
not
seen
him
since
the
night
of
father
's
death
,
though
I
have
heard
of
his
being
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
He
passed
through
the
village
a
few
days
since
,
and
I
believe
uttered
some
of
his
prophesies
;
one
of
which
was
to
the
effect
,
that
Columbia
would
never
be
a
city
;
and
another
,
that
treasures
had
been
concealed
on
the
banks
of
the
Little
Miami
.
<EOS>
Some
have
put
faith
in
his
words
,
and
been
and
dug
for
gold
;
but
I
believe
nothing
unusual
has
been
the
result
.
<EOS>
""Strange
<EOS>
being
he
!
"
<EOS>
observed
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Can
it
be
possible
that
he
is
gifted
with
what
is
called
second
sight?""I
know
not
,
mother
,
what
are
his
gifts
in
that
respect
;
but
I
do
know
,
that
he
foretold
some
things
which
have
come
true
;
and
that
over
me
exercised
a
strange
kind
of
power
,
beyond
my
comprehension
.
<EOS>
Never
did
I
put
faith
in
him
till
then
.
<EOS>
But
,
Heaven
preserve
him
!
<EOS>
for
he
saved
my
life
from
a
villian
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
will
again
,
"
said
a
deep
voice
.
<EOS>
"Kate
and
her
mother
turned
quickly
round
,
and
,
to
their
astonishment
,
beheld
the
tall
,
rough
form
of
Luther
,
standing
in
the
doorway
,
calmly
leaning
upon
his
long
stick
of
witch
-
hazel
.
"Art
<EOS>
thou
mortal
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
vainly
endeavoring
to
shake
off
a
superstitions
feeling
that
came
creeping
over
her
,
with
a
chilly
sensation
.
"
<EOS>
Art
thou
mortal
,
<EOS>
Luther?""I
<EOS>
am
what
I
am
,
"
replied
the
Necromancer
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
much
know
:
<EOS>
I
was
born
of
woman
,
and
am
bound
to
die
.
<EOS>
God
save
all
here
!
<EOS>
for
already
the
second
trump
of
woe
is
being
blown
—
the
second
vial
of
wrath
being
emptied
.
<EOS>
Maiden
,
listen!"To
him
who
holds
thy
heart
in
bond
,
Freely
may'st
thou
now
respond
;
Yet
guard
thy
<EOS>
every
word
and
sigh
,
For
trysting
hour
with
thee
is
nigh
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
whom
you
love
will
soon
be
with
you
.
<EOS>
""Whom
<EOS>
I
love
,
"
repeated
Kate
,
a
deep
flush
mantling
her
face
and
neck
.
"
<EOS>
And
whom
do
I
love?""Whom
<EOS>
the
fates
decreed
you
should
—
Ernest
Clifton
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
that
I
love
him
,
"
responded
Kate
,
turning
away
her
head
.
<EOS>
"Tell
<EOS>
that
to
the
winds
—
peradventure
they
will
believe
you
;
but
think
not
to
deceive
me
,
nor
thyself
,
fair
maiden
.
<EOS>
Thou
knowest
,
Kate
Clarendon
,
that
Ernest
Clifton
holds
thy
heart
—
else
why
that
averted
head
and
tell
-
tale

.
<EOS>
And
,
maiden
,
fear
not
that
he
is
unworthy
thee
.
<EOS>
The
diamond
,
fresh
raised
from
the
bedded
mine
,
is
not
more
pure
than
the
blood
leaping
with
the
impetuosity
of
youth
through
his
veins
.
<EOS>
Sometime
I
will
tell
thee
more
.
<EOS>
Adieu
!
<EOS>
and
remember
—
<EOS>
trysting
time
is
near
.
<EOS>
""Stay
,
Luther
,
and
partake
of
some
refreshment
,
"
said
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
as
the
Necromancer
turned
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"Would
<EOS>
to
God
,
"
returned
Luther
,
solemnly
,
"
I
could
bid
thee
stay
!
<EOS>
But
I
go
now
,
and
you
go
soon
;
and
yet
you
will
not
follow
me
,
for
we
journey
different
ways
.
<EOS>
Your
path
lies
there
;
"
and
Luther
pointed
upward
.
<EOS>
"
You
ask
me
to
take
refreshment
.
<EOS>
This
is
kind
of
you
,
and
I
thank
you
;
but
I
have
it
here
;
"
and
he
pointed
over
his
shoulder
,
with
his
thumb
,
to
the
knapsack
on
his
back
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
God
!
<EOS>
it
costs
little
to
keep
me
;
for
I
live
plain
,
as
becometh
one
of
my
calling
.
<EOS>
Jerk
,
roots
and
berries
are
my
food
;
and
my
drink
,
the
silver
waters
spouting
from
the
cool

forest

shaded
earth
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
adieu
!
<EOS>
Pray
often
,
and
fast
often
—
for
if
the
stars
do
not
lie
,
you
will
both
soon
feel
the
need
of
Divine
aid

"As
<EOS>
Luther
said
this
,
he
turned
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
Kate
and
her
mother
met
,
with
expressions
of
superstitious
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
"It
can
do
us
no
harm
to
pray
,
at
all
events
,
"
said
Mrs.
Clarendon
;
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
,
she
knelt
upon
the
ground
—
<EOS>
Kate
knelt
beside
her
—
and
the
hearts
of
both
were
poured
out
in
supplications
to
the
God
of
that
Tribunal
before
which
all
nations
must
be
judged
.

CHAPTER

rather

<EOS>
It
was
a
bewitching
night
.
<EOS>
The
moon
rode
high
in
the
heavens
,
and
poured
her
soft
,
silvery
flood
over
the
luxuriant
and
apparently
sleeping
earth
.
<EOS>
No
breeze
rustled
a
leaflet
—
no
sounds
were
heard
,
save
those
soft
,
dreamy
ones
which
are
made
by
the
night
-
watehers
.
<EOS>
Not
a
cloud
marred
the
broad
,
blue
canopy
overhead
,
through
which
could
here
and
there
be
seen
the
rich
,
golden
light
,
shot
from
some
bright
star
,
itself
away
in
the
incomprehensible
and
boundless
realms
of
space
.
<EOS>
The
mighty
forest
seemed
sleeping
,
and
one
could
almost
fancy
nodding
,
too
,
in
its
sleep
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
night
for
love
.
<EOS>
Just
sufficiently
calm
and
holy
to
a
waken
<EOS>
all
those
fine
poetic
chords
of
nature
,
whose
gentle
,
musical
tones
are
drowned
and
lost
amid
the
harsher
sounds
of
every
day
,
active
life
.
<EOS>
A
night
for
communing
with
some
bright
being
,
who
has
gone
from
this
vale
of
tears
to
a
happier
and
holier
sphere
—
or
with
one
who
still
lingers
here
,
pluming
her
wings
for
an
immortal
and
eternal
flight
.
<EOS>
A
night
,
indeed
,
for
lovers
and
love
.
<EOS>
On
the
banks
of
the
Little
Miami
,
stood
an
old
sycamore
,
whose
white
and
aged
arms
,
thrown
abroad
over
the
murmuring
stream
,
seemed
no
bad
type
of
a
prophet
about
to
utter
oracles
for
coming
ages
to
define
,
or
pronounce
a
benediction
over
the
gurgling
waters
that
rolled
beneath
.
<EOS>
In
keeping
with
the
hour
and
the
scene
,
there
glided
beneath
this
old
sycamore
,
in
the
checkered
light
which
the
moon
made
by
stealing
among
the
leaflets
,
two
figures
—
a
youth
and
a
maiden
.
<EOS>
At
the
base
of
the
old
tree
they
paused
,
and
seated
themselves
on
a
crooked
trunk
of
a
smaller
one
,
which
,
projecting
over
the
waters
,
shot
upward
a
growing
rival
to
its
patriarchal
neighbor
.
<EOS>
They
seated
themselves
upon
the
trunk
of
this
tree
in
silence
,
and
looked
downward
for
a
few
moments
,
and
listened
to
the
song
of
the
streamlet
,
as
it
mingled
harmoniously
with
the
quiet
hum
of
forest
life
.
<EOS>
Beautiful
and
sacred
thoughts
were
in
the
breasts
of
both
;
for
they
thought
of
each
other
and
of
love
;
and
who
will
deny
that
true
love
is
a
sacred
theme
,
and
has
more
of
Heaven
in
it
than
earth!"This
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
in
a
low
,
musical
voice
,
that
accorded
well
with
every
thing
around
:
"
<EOS>
This
is
a
night
,
and
a
scene
that
I
love
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
,
"
was
the
response
of
the
gentle
maiden
by
his
side
,
in
a
tone
that
lost
itself
in
harmony
with
the
murmuring
river
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
"
she
continued
,
"
is
more
enchanting
than
Nature
,
when
displayed
in
her
mildest
and
loveliest
form
,
to
the
soul
that
views
it
in
a
corresponding
mood
of
quietude?""Ay
!
and
to
behold
its
beauties
,
"
answered
her
companion
,
"
the
soul
must
be
in
harmony
with
it
;
and
what
will
so
soon
harmonize
the
soul
to
a
scene
like
this
,
as
love?"The
maiden
drooped
her
head
,
and
tapped
the
earth
lightly
with
her
delicate
little
foot
,
but
did
not
answer
.
<EOS>
A
moment
the
young
man
paused
,
and
then
gently
stealing
the
hand
of
the
maiden
,
and
pressing
it
in
his
own
,
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"What
feeling
is
there
,
dear
Kate
,
more
subdued
and
holy
than
the
yearning
of
a
soul
toward
a
kindred
spirit
?
<EOS>
and
the
intoxicating
response
—
the
harmonious
blending
together
of
both
?
<EOS>
Harmony
is
the
main
spring
of
creation
,
on
which
depends
alike
the
existence
of
a
world
,
and
the
happiness
of
a
human
being
.
<EOS>
He
whose
soul
is
not
in
unison
with
nature
and
the
things
around
him
,
must
of
necessity
be
unhappy
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
come
hither
,
however
,
to
philosophize
,
but
to
speak
of
matters
which
lie
nearer
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Months
,
dearest
Kate
,
have
intervened
,
since
that
never
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
night
,
when
we
met
for
the
first
time
,
under
circumstances
the
most
painful
to
both
;
and
often
since
then
have
we
been
together
,
walked
together
,
and
conversed
together
on
various
subjects
—
may
I
inquire
if
these
meetings
have
in
any
wise
been
disagreeable
to
you?""On
the
contrary
,
"
answered
Kate
,
"
I
will
be
frank
to
own
,
they
have
proved
the
happiest
periods
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
""On
<EOS>
this
point
,
then
,
our
feelings
harmenize
;
for
the
only
real
pleasure
I
have
myself
enjoyed
,
has
been
in
your
sweet
company
.
<EOS>
But
to
change
the
subject
,
somewhat
—
let
me
inquire
regarding
your
mother?""She
does
not
seem
so
well
tonight
,
"
answered
Kate
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
fancied
,
from
what
I
saw
,
"
rejoined
Clifton
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
tho't
seriously
upon
her
illness
<EOS>
,
Kate?""I
do
not
know
as
I
understand
you
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
wish
to
alarm
you
,
Kate
,
but
only
to
prepare
your
mind
for
a
grave
subject
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
are
ignorant
of
her
complaint?""Ha
!
<EOS>
then
you
think
it
dangerous
,
Ernest
?
"
exclaimed
the
fair
girl
,
grasping
his
arm
,
with
a
nervous
motion
,
and
endeavoring
to
catch
the
expression
of
his
features
in
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
"You
must
prepare
yourself
to
part
with
her
ere
long
,
"
said
Ernest
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
Heaven
!
<EOS>
you
alarm
me
,
Ernest!—and
yet
<EOS>
you
but
repeat
what
she
told
me
herself
to

day

<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
if
she
be
taken
from
me
,
I
shall
be
alone
,
indeed
,
without
a
protector
,
perhaps
a
friend!""Nay
,
Kate
,
dearest
,
"
rejoined
Ernest
,
encircling
her
waist
with
his
arm
;
"
it
is
of
that
I
wish
to
speak
.
<EOS>
There
are
none
,
I
know
,
that
can
supply
the
place
of
a
mother
;
and
could
my
earnest
prayers
avail
aught
,
you
should
never
feel
the
want
of
one
;
but
it
would
be
little
less
than
criminal
,
methinks
,
to
disguise
from
you
the
fact
,
that
,
as
regards
your
mother
,
the
fatal
work
of
death
has
already
begun
.
<EOS>
""Great
God
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
wildly
,
placing
her
hands
to
her
temples
<EOS>
;
"
you
do
not
mean
this
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
say
you
are
jesting!—say
<EOS>
you
did
it
to
frighten
me!—say
anything
!
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
but
,
for
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>
do
not
tell
me
my
dear
mother
is
<EOS>
dying!""In
<EOS>
this
world
,
"
replied
the
young
officer
,
in
a
tone
slightly
tremulous
,
"
we
must
look
for
nothing
hut
crosses
,
disappointments
,
and
partings
from
those
we
love
.
<EOS>
That
your
mother
is
dying
,
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
term
,
I
would
not
imply
;
she
may
hold
out
for
weeks
,
and
even
months
;
but
,
painful
as
is
the
task
,
I
can
not
conscientiously
conceal
from
you
the
truth
,
that
she
is
in
deep
consumption
,
and
that
there
is
no
hope
of
seeing
her
restored
to
health
.
<EOS>
"Kate
bowed
her
head
upon
her
hands
,
sobbed
aloud
,
and
groaned
like
one
in
pain
.
<EOS>
"Yet
<EOS>
,
dearest
girl
,
take
it
not
so
hard
!
<EOS>
Remember
,
we
are
in
a
world
where
death
is
ever
parting
friends
;
and
that
,
sooner
or
later
,
we
must
all
separate
,
according
to
the
will
of
Him
who
shapes
our
destinies
.
<EOS>
You
said
,
but
now
,
that
if
your
mother
were
called
away
,
you
would
be
without
a
protector
,
perchance
a
friend
.
<EOS>
It
grieved
me
,
dear
girl
,
to
hear
you
say
thus
.
<EOS>
No
,
Kate
Clarendon
,
while
Ernest
Clifton
lives
,
you
shall
never
want
a
friend
;
and
—
and
(
his
voice
trembled
and
sank
to
a
whisper)—it
rests
with
you
to
say
,
whether
the
friend
and
protector
shall
be
one
.
<EOS>
"Kate
still
sat
with
her
head
bowed
down
,
trembling
and
silent
;
and
pausing
for
a
moment
,
Clifton
again
proceeded
in
a
low
,
earnest
voice
.
<EOS>
"It
has
been
but
three
months
,
since
accident
first
threw
us
together
,
dear
Kate
;
and
yet
to
me
our
acquaintance
seems
that
of
years
.
<EOS>
From
what
I
have
seen
of
you
,
I
am
perfectly
confident
you
hold
the
power
to
make
me
happy
or
miserable
;
in
other
words
,
dearest
Kate
,
I
must
own
I
love
you
,
and
did
from
the
moment
I
saw
displayed
those
heroic
qualities
at
the
death
of
your
father
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
us
not
talk
of
this
now
,
"
said
Kate
,
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
why
not
now
?
"
rejoined
the
other
,
with
some
uneasiness
;
"
there
may
never
be
a
better
time
and
place
,
and
we
know
not
what
may
happen
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
somehow
,
"
sighed
Kate
,
"
<EOS>
I
feel
strangely
—
as
if
danger
were
lurking
nigh
.
<EOS>
""I
see
how
it
is
,
"
returned
Clifton
,
in
a
tone
of
sadness
;
"
you
do
not
love
me
,
and
seek
to
avoid
,
as
you
have
done
on
all
previous
occasions
,
any
mention
of
a
subject
which
I
must
own
lies
nearest
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Be
it
so
,
then
;
you
will
doubtless
find
another
more
worthy
,
and
more
to
your
liking
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
"
said
Kate
,
startled
at
the
turn
matters
had
taken
:
"
Nay
,
Ernest
,
I
meant
not
that
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
now
I
think
of
it
,
I
know
no
reason
why
you
should
love
me
,
"
continued
Clifton
,
pursuing
his
own
train
of
reflections
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
only
a
poor
officer
in
the
army
,
whose
duty
is
where
danger
lies
,
and
know
not
at
what
moment
I
may
be
ealled
away
to
another
station
or
another
world
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
better
,
now
I
think
seriously
on
the
subject
,
that
you
do
not
love
me
,
Kate
<EOS>
;
I
might
only
be
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
Providence
,
for
making
your
sorrows
heavier
.
<EOS>
"Kate
turned
her
eyes
toward
her
companion
for
a
moment
—
with
a
look
,
which
,
could
Ernest
have
seen
,
<EOS>
his
heart
would
have
smote
him
—
and
then
burst
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
weep
dear
Kate
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
other
,
tenderly
.
"
<EOS>
Have
I
mistaken
your
meaning?"Kate
answered
not
;
but
her
head
gradually
sunk
against
his
breast
,
and
her
tears
burst
forth
afresh
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
Kate
,
"
cried
the
other
,
rapturously
,
throwing
both
arms
around
and
straining
her
to
his
heart
,
"
<EOS>
what
a
fool
have
I
been
to
mistake
you
!
<EOS>
You
love
me
,
Kate
—
you
love
me?"Kate
replied
not
,
save
by
pressing
closer
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
will
be
mine
,
dearest?"A
pressure
of
the
hand
was
the
only
answer
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
bless
you
,
mine
own
dear
angel
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Clifton
,
stealing
his
first
kiss
from
the
trembling
lips
of
the
lovely
being
reclining
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Two
hours
rolled
away
,
and
still
the
lovers
were
seated
beneath
that
same
old
sycamore
,
and
lost
to
the
outer
world
in
a
sweet
communion
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
when
shall
it
be
?
"
asked
Clifton
,
at
length
,
in
reference
to
something
which
had
gone
before
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
to
you
,
"
replied
Kate
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
the
sooner
the
better
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
,
stay
!
<EOS>
I
have
forgotten
one
question
:
Your
mother
,
Kate
—
<EOS>
will
she
give
her
consent?—for
<EOS>
I
will
do
nothing
against
her
will
.
<EOS>
""It
is
already
given
,
"
replied
Kate
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
her
own
desire
,
dear
Ernest
,
to
see
us
united
before
she
dies
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
bless
her
!
<EOS>
When
said
she
this?""To
day
.
<EOS>
She
called
me
to
her
,
questioned
me
of
you
,
spoke
of
you
in
the
highest
terms
of
praise
,
and
said
,
if
it
accorded
with
the
feelings
of
both
,
nothing
would
please
her
better
than
to
see
us
duly
united
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
go
wild
with
joy
.
<EOS>
A
week
from
to
-
night
,
then
,
Kate
—
will
that
suit
you?""I
said
I
should
leave
it
to
you
,
"
returned
Kate
,
averting
her
face
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
the
bond
is
settled
,
and
so
let
us
seal
it
,
"
rejoined
Clifton
,
gaily
;
and
the
next
moment
the
lips
of
the
lovers
met
in
a
long
and
rapturous
kiss
of
love
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
one
thing
more
,
"
said
Ernest
again
,
after
a
pause
of
a
few
moments
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
nothing
of
my
history
,
Kate
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
when
you
come
to
hear
that
,
you
will
change
your
mind
in
regard
to
this
matter?""Then
keep
it
ever
a
secret
,
Ernest
,
"
answered
Kate
,
frankly
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
we
d
you
,
it
will
be
for
your
noble
self
alone
.
<EOS>
So
that
your
own
conduct
has
been
upright
through
life
,
I
care
for
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
""Noble
,
generous
girl
!
"
cried
the
other
,
in
a
transport
of
joy
,
"
now
I
love
thee
more
than
ever
,
for
thy
unwavering
confidence
in
me
.
<EOS>
May
Heaven
watch
over
us
both
,
and
allow
me
to
strew
thy
path
with
flowers
even
to
the
verge
of
the
grave!""Hist
!
"
said
Kate
,
laying
her
hand
upon
the
arm
of
her
companion
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
not
hear
a
noise?""What
was
it
like?""The
<EOS>
cracking
of
some
dry
twig
or
bush
.
<EOS>
"Both
now
listened
attentively
for
some
moments
;
but
all
was
silent
,
save
the
rippling
of
the
stream
,
the
chirping
of
the
insects
,
and
the
low
sighing
of
the
forest
,
as
a
light
breeze
swept
through
it
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
think
you
must
have
been
mistaken
,
dear
Kate
,
"
said
Ernest
,
"
for
all
seems
still
.
<EOS>
""Then
fancy
has
made
me
timid
,
"
returned
Kate
,
pressing
closer
to
the
other
;
"
and
so
I
think
we
had
better
return
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
what
was
that?""I
hear
nothing
but
the
hooting
of
an
owl
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
a
gloomy
sound
!
<EOS>
Strange
it
is
,
dear
Ernest
,
but
I
feel
so
nervous
—
so
much
as
I
did
on
that
terrible
night
when
father
died
.
<EOS>
My
God
!
<EOS>
I
hope
I
am
not
to
pass
such
a
night
again
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
<EOS>
let
us
return
,
quick
as
possible
!
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
divest
myself
of
the
idea
that
we
are
surrounded
by
danger
.
<EOS>
""O
,
it
is
nothing
;
you
are
needlessly
alarmed
,
dear
Kate
,
I
am
sure
,
"
replied
Ernest
,
consolingly
.
"
<EOS>
But
we
will
return
,
at
all
events
,
for
I
fear
it
is
getting
late
.
<EOS>
""Late
!
"
echoed
Kate
,
as
they
commenced
retracing
their
steps
to
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
"
Why
how
long
have
we
been
away
I
pray
you?""Guess
.
<EOS>
""Half
an
hour
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
""You
are
more
complimentary
than
correct
,
"
returned
Clifton
,
with
a
light
laugh
,
as
,
by
the
glimmer
of
the
moon
through
the
trees
,
he
was
enabled
to
make
the
time
from
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
Add
two
hours
to
the
half
and
you
will
hit
it
exactly
.
<EOS>
"Kate
was
about
to
utter
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
and
insist
that
her
lover
was
mistaken
,
when
the
stirring
of
a
bush
just
ahead
of
her
,
caused
her
to
start
back
with
a
suppressed
cry
of
fear
.
<EOS>
Clifton
saw
the
bush
move
also
,
and
throwing
his
left
arm
around
the
waist
of
his
fair
companion
,
with
his
right
he
drew
his
sword
,
and
put
himself
in
an
attitude
of
defense
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
he
stood
,
awaiting
the
appearance
of
his
foe
,
if
such
the
unknown
should
prove
,
while
Kate
clung
to
him
with
a
maidenly
fear
,
that
made
his
arm
feel
strong
,
and
raised
within
him
a
desire
to
meet
danger
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
"All
is
quiet
there
again
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Could
our
eyes
have
possibly
deceived
us
?
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
probe
the
bush
with
my
good
sword
and
ascertain
.
<EOS>
""No
,
<EOS>
no
,
no
!
"
rejoined
Kate
,
clasping
him
more
tightly
;
"
you
shall
not
stir
a
step
toward
it
,
Ernest
!
<EOS>
Here
—
this
way
—
quick
—
let
us
hurry
back
!
"
<EOS>
and
taking
an
opposite
direction
to
the
bush
,
Kate
almost
dragged
Ernest
after
her
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
paces
Clifton
hung
back
,
as
if
reluctant
to
leave
the
mysterious
bush
:
then
,
as
if
actuated
by
another
thought
,
he
suddenly
threw
an
arm
around
the
maiden
's
waist
,
and
,
partly
raising
her
from
the
ground
,
hurried
her
forward
at
a
fast
run
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
reached
the
cottage
in
safety
.
<EOS>
Bidding
her
go
in
and
bolt
the
door
,
Ernest
was
about
to
turn
back
,
when
Kate
prevented
him
,
by
declaring
that
if
he
did
she
would
follow
.
<EOS>
After
much
entreaty
,
he
abandoned
the
idea
,
and
accepted
her
invitation
to
spend
the
night
under
her
mother
's
roof
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
after
Ernest
and
Kate
had
departed
,
everything
remained
quiet
;
then
the
bush
,
whose
movement
had
so
startled
the
latter
,
became
slightly
agitated
again
,
and
at
the
same
moment
a
head
was
thrust
through
,
and
turned
from
side
to
side
,
as
if
to
ascertain
that
the
coast
was
clear
.
<EOS>
Then
a
figure
emerged
from
the
thicket
,
and
,
as
it
came
into
the
broad
light
of
the
moon
,
displayed
the
tall
,
but
slender
form
of
a
white
man
,
metamorphosed
into
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
Portions
of
his
body
were
bare
,
after
the
Indian
fashion
.
<EOS>
He
wore
moccasins
on
his
feet
,
had
paint
on
his
face
,
and
his
head
was
shaved
,
all
but
a
single
tuft
of
hair
on
the
crown
,
which
was
ornamanted
with
feathers
.
<EOS>
A
belt
around
his
waist
contained
a
brace
of
pistols
,
a
scalping
-
knife
and
tomahawk
,
and
in
his
right
hand
he
carried
a
rifle
.
<EOS>
"'Tis
<EOS>
well
for
you
,
"
he
muttered
,
in
English
,
through
his
close
shut
teeth
,
shaking
his
fist
in
the
direction
whence
<EOS>
he
saw
the
lovers
disappear
:
"
'
Tis
<EOS>
well
for
you
,
you
did
not
probe
the
bush
,
as
you
were
about
to
do
,
young
man
—
or
<EOS>
you
might
have
found
a
few
inches
of
cold
steel
probing
you
.
<EOS>
A
week
from
to
night
,
eh
!
is
to
consummate
your
desire
?
<EOS>
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
mentioned
it
;
for
now
I
shall
be
there
,
though
an
uninvited
guest
;
and
I
will
invite
a
few
of
my
dusky
brethren
to
be
there
also
.
<EOS>
Peradventure
if
I
can
not
give
the
bride
away
,
I
can
take
her
to
myself
.
<EOS>
—
Once
in
my
power
—
once
mine
(
and
his
features
assumed
a
hellish
look
of
satisfaction
,
and
his
black
eyes
fairly
shone
in
the
darkness
)
—
and
if
yon
proud
youth
will
accept
her
then
<EOS>
—
why
—
ha
,
ha
!
let
him
have
her
—
a
ruined
,
cast
off
toy
.
<EOS>
Then
,
and
not
till
then
,
will
Rashton
Moody
think
his
insult
canceled
by
a
sweet

"As
<EOS>
he
said
this
,
the
figure
turned
,
plunged
into
the
thicket

an
evil

bent
on
a
devilish

In
sad
and

Silence
waited
each

His

were

O

treacherous
night!Thou

<EOS>
thy

to
every
treason

And
<EOS>
teeming
mischiefs

<EOS>
Death
and
destruction
,
and
the
shrieks
of
woe
,
Were
seen
and
heard
on
every
hand
.
—
The
Siege
.
<EOS>
Time
,
with
his
scythe
and
hourglass
,
strode
steadily
onward
,
and
soon
bro't
about
the
eventful
night
,
which
had
been
set
apart
for
the
consummation
of
the
rite
indissoluble
between
Ernest
Clifton
and
Kate
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
week
intervening
,
since
we
last
beheld
the
lovers
,
every
preparation
had
been
made
for
solemnizing
the
nuptials
of
two
beings
whose
souls
beat
in
unison
.
<EOS>
Invitations
had
been
sent
to
nearly
all
the
young
people
of
Columbia
;
and
at
an
early
hour
on
the
evening
in
question
,
they
might
have
been
seen
in
pairs
,
riding
gaily
up
to
the
door
of
the
bride
.
<EOS>
Ichabod
Longtree
,
arrayed
in
his
best
,
busied
himself
in
welcoming
them
to
the
wedding
of
his
pet
,
and
taking
charge
of
their
horses
,
which
he
led
around
the
house
and
secured
to
the
trees
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Kate
and
her
mother
had
robed
themselves
in
garments
of
white
,
being
relics
of
those
days
when
they
were
rolling
in
luxury
.
<EOS>
What
added
additional
joy
to
both
,
the
health
and
spirits
of
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
since
the
announcement
to
her
that
Ernest
Clifton
was
soon
to
become
her
son
-
in
-
law
,
had
revived
to
a
wonderful
degree
,
and
she
now
appeared
before
her
guests
with
something
of
the
look
and
manner
of
former
days
.
<EOS>
The
excitement
of
the
occasion
had
tinged
her
cheek
with
a
flush
resembling
health
,
and
added
additional
luster
to
her
eyes
,
which
now
beamed
with
animation
and
joy
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
as
might
be
supposed
,
looked
paler
—
more
sad
and
thoughtful
—
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
none
the
less
lovely
.
<EOS>
She
received
the
greetings
of
her
friends
with
an
air
of
grace
and
cordiality
,
and
sometimes
,
though
but
seldom
,
smiled
,
at
their
frequent
sallies
of
wit
.
<EOS>
To
her
it
seemed
a
grave
,
rather
than
light
occasion
,
and
one
little
suited
,
on
her
part
,
to
hilarity
.
<EOS>
However
much
she
might
have
jested
on
the
matter
once
,
she
now
felt
in
all
its
force
the
responsibility
of
the
step
she
was
about
to
take
.
<EOS>
She
was
about
to
give
her
hand
,
for
good
or
ill
,
to
one
she
loved
,
and
that
for
life
.
<EOS>
She
was
about
to
bid
adieu
to
the
romantic
visions
of
girlhood
,
and
enter
upon
the
responsible
realities
of
a
wife
and
womanhood
.
<EOS>
She
was
,
in
short
,
about
to
give
herself
away
,
to
become
another
's
,
to
be
bound
to
him
by
solemn
ties
,
that
could
not
be
broken
without
offense
against
the
laws
of
God
and
man
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
and
grave
undertaking
—
a
new
epoch
in
her
life
—
and
though
she
wavered
not
,
flinched
not
,
yet
she
trembled
and
felt
sad
at
the
thought
.
<EOS>
Among
the
invited
guests
,
came
two
of
the
former
suitors
of
Kate
—
Danvers
and
Danbury
—
each
accompanied
by
a
lass
,
who
now
had
the
honor
of
holding
a
place
in
his
heart
,
which
was
once
partially
occupied
by
our
fair
heroine
.
<EOS>
They
met
her
frankly
,
and
cordially
,
with
no
show
of
pique
or
resentment
,
and
as
friends
who
took
a
deep
interest
in
her
welfare
.
<EOS>
"I
once
flattered
myself
,
"
said
Danvers
to
Kate
,
smiling
pleasantly
,
"
that
I
should
be
a
prominent
actor
at
the
wedding
of
Kate
Clarendon
,
instead
of
a
spectator
;
but
matters
have
turned
out
otherwise
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
none
the
worse
for
you
,
"
returned
Kate
,
inclining
her
head
to
the
maiden
who
now
held
the
arm
and
heart
of
her
former
suitor
.
<EOS>
"We
will
hope
all
has
been
for
the
best
,
"
was
the
reply
of
Danvers
,
looking
fondly
toward
her
whose
arm
he
held
.
<EOS>
"We
lost
the
race
,
and
should
fain
be
content
,
"
put
in
Danbury
,
with
a
smile
,
coming
up
at
the
moment
,
with
a
pretty
maiden
also
hanging
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
in
losing
you
won
,
"
returned
Kate
,
pointedly
,
punning
upon
the
word
,
and
pointing
to
his
fair
companion
.
"Why
<EOS>
as
to
winning
,
"
rejoined
Danbury
,
laughing
,
"
that
will
depend
much
upon
a
certain
monosyllable
from
Emma
here
.
<EOS>
""Fie
!
<EOS>
Orville
,
"
said
Emma
,
blush
ing
,
and
dragging
him
away
,
in
the
utmost
good
humor
.
<EOS>
An
hour
from
the
setting
in
of
night
,
saw
all
the
guests
assembled
at
the
cottage
,
with
the
exception
of
the
groom
and
clergyman
,
who
were
momentarily
expected
.
<EOS>
As
was
customary
at
that
day
,
each
of
the
young
men
had
brought
with
him
his
rifle
,
more
from
the
force
of
habit
and
precaution
,
than
from
any
supposed
use
he
would
have
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
,
as
a
matter
of
form
,
thought
advisable
to
station
a
sentinel
without
,
that
,
in
case
anything
unusual
should
happen
,
alarm
might
be
given
.
<EOS>
This
last
precaution
would
doubtless
have
been
neglected
,
but
for
the
report
abroad
,
that
a
small
body
of
Indians
had
been
seen
,
not
long
since
,
within
a
few
miles
of
the
village
.
<EOS>
In
conse
-
of
this
rumor
,
some
of
the
more
timid
had
repaired
to
the
block
-
house
;
but
the
majority
of
the
citizens
of
Columbia
thought
lightly
of
the
news
,
and
turned
not
aside
from
their
usual
routine
of
business
.
<EOS>
The
guests
had
now
all
taken
their
seats
upon
rude
benches
,
ranged
around
the
walls
of
the
cabin
,
which
had
been
prepared
expressly
for
the
occasion
by
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
A
rough
chandelier
,
constructed
of
wood
,
in
feeble
imitation
of
some
of
a
more
solid
material
in
the
older
settlements
,
and
which
also
owed
its
existence
to
the
genius
and
labor
of
Ichabod
,
was
suspended
from
the
ceiling
by
a
small
iron
chain
,
near
the
center
of
the
apartment
,
and
supported
several
candles
,
whose
combined
gleams
served
to
render
every
object
distinct
to
the
eye
and
display
the
youthful
and
healthy
looking
faces
of
the
surrounding
party
,
the
expressions
of
which
had
grown
very
grave
,
preparatory
to
the
coming
solemn
ceremony
.
<EOS>
Beneath
this
chandelier
stood
a
table
,
on
which
were
a
Bible
,
a
hymn
-
book
,
a
vase
of
flowers
,
and
two
brass
candlesticks
supporting
tapers
.
<EOS>
Beside
the
table
was
a
stool
,
to
be
occupied
by
the
clergyman
on
his
arrival
,
and
during
the
service
he
was
expected
to
perform
.
<EOS>
Flowers
,
too
,
of
all
hues
,
had
been
liberally
scattered
over
the
white
and
sanded
floor
,
whose
fragrance
was
not
the
less
sweet
and
abundant
,
from
being
crushed
,
occasionally
,
beneath
the
passing
foot
of
some
bright
-
eyed
maiden
or
her
gay
gallant
.
<EOS>
Boquets
and
festoons
decorated
the
walls
,
and
added
a
rosy
and
beautiful
back
-
ground
to
the
picture
.
<EOS>
At
weddings
of
this
period
,
a
supper
and
dance
generally
succeeded
;
but
on
the
present
occasion
,
the
declining
health
of
her
mother
,
together
with
the
late
loss
of
her
father
,
had
been
a
sufficient
reason
to
induce
Kate
to
dispense
with
the
latter
.
<EOS>
The
supper
,
however
,
had
not
been
omitted
.
<EOS>
It
was
already
laid
on
tables
in
the
adjoining
apartment
,
and
was
,
like
almost
everything
else
about
the
premises
,
under
the
careful
supervision
of
Ichabod
Longtree
—
who
,
in
addition
to
the
qualities
of
gardener
and
hostler
,
could
,
when
occasion
required
,
fulfill
the
duties
of
chief
cook
and
butler
.
<EOS>
All
was
ready
,
and
waited
only
the
coming
of
the
groom
and
the
clergyman
,
to
begin
the
solemn
and
sacred
rite
.
<EOS>
A
deep
and
profound
silence
reigned
in
the
apartment
,
where
the
wedding
guests
were
seated
,
in
stern
repose
,
like
so
many
wax
figures
.
<EOS>
As
the
first
sensation
to
the
touch
of
fire
and
ice
is
the
same
—
so
,
as
a
general
thing
,
the
feelings
immediately
preceding
a
wedding
and
a
funeral
are
strangely
alike
.
<EOS>
There
steals
over
the
spectator
,
on
both
occasions
,
a
secret
awe
,
an
unaccountable
solemnity
,
that
he
finds
impossible
to
shake
off
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
feeling
pervading
the
assemblage
on
the
occasion
here
described
.
<EOS>
From
a
lively
and
even
gay
conversation
,
the
voices
of
the
different
speakers
had
gradually
died
away
to
whispers
,
and
finally
had
ceased
altogether
.
<EOS>
As
minute
after
minute
rolled
by
,
and
no
sounds
were
heard
indicating
the
approach
of
the
expected
parties
,
the
guests
began
to
look
at
each
other
inquiringly
,
with
faces
expressive
of
surprise
at
the
delay
;
and
then
low
whispers
stole
around
the
circle
,
of
strange
conjectures
,
giving
a
more
gloomy
turn
to
the
whole
affair
.
<EOS>
As
for
Kate
,
her
features
had
become
as
white
,
and
almost
as
rigid
,
as
marble
;
and
as
she
sat
in
full
light
,
robed
in
her
wedding
garments
,
clasping
the
thin
,
transparent
hand
of
her
mother
,
and
gazing
at
vacancy
,
one
could
easily
have
fancied
her
a
beautiful
conception
,
chiseled
from
the
cold
,
inanimate
stone
.
<EOS>
The
flush
mentioned
as
surmounting
the
features
of
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
had
rather
suddenly
given
place
to
a
pallor
almost
frightful
;
and
her
now
deeply
sunked
eyes
roved
around
the
apartment
,
nervously
,
over
the
whispering
group
,
as
if
in
quest
of
some
object
not
there
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
is
strange
they
do
not
come
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
at
last
,
in
a
grave
voice
.
<EOS>
"Hark
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Kate
,
in
reply
,
starting
to
her
feet
,
and
bending
forward
in
a
listening
attitude
.
<EOS>
"
My
ears
deceive
me
,
or
I
hear
the
tramp
of
horses
'
feet
;
"
and
as
she
concluded
,
she
sprang
to
the
door
,
followed
by
most
of
the
others
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
calm
,
beautiful
night
,
and
every
thing
without
seemed
wrapped
in
sweet
repose
.
<EOS>
The
moon
,
already
at
her
full
,
large
and
bright
,
was
just
struggling
over
the
eastern
hill
,
and
pouring
her
gray
light
down
into
the
forest
of
the
plain
,
and
giving
every
object
a
twilight
indistinctness
.
<EOS>
Wherever
her
rays
fell
upon
the
Miami
and
Ohio
,
their
waters
shone
like
burnished
silver
.
<EOS>
Along
the
base
of
the
eastern
ridge
,
mentioned
previously
,
lay
a
deep
shadow
,
gradually
disappearing
as
the
moon
rose
on
high
;
while
across
the
plain
,
BaldHill
could
be
distinctly
seen
,
looming
up
in
the
broad
light
not
unlike
some
beacon
of
warning
.
<EOS>
A
few
white
scuds
were
sailing
overhead
,
and
a
mist
,
gradually
ascending
here
and
there
,
defined
the
course
of
the
rivers
,
and
gave
indication
of
a
foggy
night
.
<EOS>
As
Kate
and
her
companions
turned
their
faces
toward
the
west
and
listened
,
the
tramp
of
horses
became
more
audible
,
until
at
last
the
shadowy
outline
of
two
figures
could
be
seen
gliding
among
the
trees
,
and
nearing
the
spectators
at
a
fast
amble
.
<EOS>
As
they
drew
close
upon
the
cottage
,
Kate
Clarendon
was
observed
to
tremble
quite
violently
.
<EOS>
She
had
recognised
in
them
two
important
characters
—
her
affianced
lover
,
and
the
venerable
pastor
that
was
to
bind
her
to
him
by
ties
the
most
strong
and
holy
;
and
the
thought
of
this
all
important
,
irrevocable
step
,
was
sufficient
to
unstring
her
nerves
,
and
produce
the
effect
described
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
wait
to
greet
either
of
the
new
comers
,
but
turned
abruptly
and
entered
the
dwelling
,
at
the
moment
when
Ernest
Clifton
and
the
divine
rode
up
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
fear
I
have
kept
you
waiting
,
friends
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
former
,
as
he
dismounted
,
and
gave
his
horse
in
charge
of
Ichabod
;
"
but
my
venerable
companion
here
,
met
with
a
slight
accident
on
the
way
,
which
detained
me
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
""What
happened
?
"
<EOS>
asked
half
-
a
-
dozen
voices
at
once
.
<EOS>
"He
was
thrown
from
his
horse
and
his
horse
thrown
down
,
by
a
rope
being
stretched
across
his
path
,
and
nearly
stunned
by
the
fall
,
"
answered
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"Foul
!
<EOS>
foul
!
"
<EOS>
cried
several
voices
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"I
am
poor
,
"
said
Clifton
,
"
but
I
would
give
fifty
dollars
to
know
the
author
of
this
piece
of
villiany
,
if
only
to
chastise
him
for
the
insult
offered
me
and
my
friends
.
<EOS>
""Never
<EOS>
mind
,
my
youthful
friend
,
"
said
the
divine
,
in
a
mild
,
soothing
tone
of
voice
;
"
the
accident
was
only
trifling
<EOS>
,
I
feel
quite
well
again
,
and
so
let
us
trouble
ourselves
no
more
about
the
matter
.
<EOS>
If
another
wrong
me
,
I
never
retaliate
,
save
in
supplicating
for
him
at
the
throne
of
mercy
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
sweet
and
satisfactory
revenge
,
and
fulfills
the
command
of
Scripture
,
which
says
,
`
Forgive
thine
enemies
,
and
pray
for
them
that
despitefully
use
you
.
'
<EOS>
Let
us
in
,
my
young
friends
,
and
return
thanks
to
God
that
the
affair
turned
out
no
worse
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
was
a
sweetness
,
earnestness
and
dignity
,
in
the
voice
and
manner
of
the
speaker
,
that
was
not
without
its
effect
upon
his
youthful
hearers
,
not
one
of
whom
ventured
a
reply
,
but
turned
,
entered
the
cottage
,
and
silently
resumed
their
places
.
<EOS>
As
the
venerable
pastor
took
his
seat
at
the
table
before
described
,
a
deep
silence
reigned
around
.
<EOS>
Every
lip
was
motionless
—
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"Is
all
ready
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
a
low
,
tremulous
,
solemn
voice
,
speaking
to
Clifton
,
who
had
taken
his
place
on
the
right
of
the
trembling
Kate
.
<EOS>
Clifton
whispered
to
Mrs.
Clarendon
,
then
to
Kate
,
and
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Then
let
us
pray
,
"
said
the
pious
pastor
;
and
forthwith
he
knelt
upon
the
ground
,
and
poured
forth
the
dictates
of
his
heart
,
in
a
strain
of
eloquence
seldom
surpassed
.
<EOS>
He
prayed
for
the
beings
before
him
,
who
were
about
to
become
one
flesh
,
by
the
sacred
rite
of
marriage
,
that
they
might
always
live
happily
together
in
this
world
,
and
meet
in
holy
unison
to
part
nevermore
in
the
world
to
come
.
<EOS>
He
prayed
for
the
only
parent
of
the
bride
,
whom
it
had
pleased
God
to
afflict
with
disease
and
pain
,
that
she
might
be
spared
many
years
yet
,
to
bless
and
comfort
those
who
would
otherwise
mourn
her
with
tears
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
He
prayed
for
the
youth
of
both
sexes
here
present
,
that
they
might
so
conduct
themselves
as
to
be
ornaments
to
the
age
in
which
they
lived
,
and
that
the
generations
,
which
,
in
the
order
of
events
would
soon
follow
them
,
might
be
strict
imitators
of
their
noble
examples
.
<EOS>
He
prayed
for
those
absent
—
enemies
as
well
as
friends
—
and
,
lastly
,
that
God
would
prosper
and
preserve
,
spotless
and
pure
,
the
liberties
of
the
great
Commonwealth
,
to
gain
which
had
cost
the
blood
of
thousands
.
<EOS>
As
he
ended
,
he
rose
from
his
knees
,
and
,
opening
the
Bible
on
the
stand
before
him
,
selected
and
read
a
passage
applicable
to
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
He
then
bade
Ernest
and
Kate
stand
upon
their
feet
,
and
commenced
the
solemn
ceremony
,
amid
a
breathless
silence
.
<EOS>
Every
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
youthful
pair
—
upon
the
pale
,
sweet
features
of
Kate
,
as
she
stood
downcast
and
trembling
—
upon
the
noble
,
commanding
form
and
face
of
Ernest
,
as
he
stood
erect
in
his
close
-
fitting
uniform
,
the
perfect
picture
of
youthful
pride
.
<EOS>
Every
head
was
inclined
forward
,
to
catch
the
slightest
tones
of
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
Never
did
a
pair
look
more
noble
and
lovely
;
never
was
an
occasion
more
solemn
;
never
was
a
silence
,
whenever
the
speaker
paused
,
more
deep
.
<EOS>
Not
a
breath
,
even
,
could
be
heard
,
and
the
fall
of
a
pin
would
have
been
audible
.
<EOS>
All
felt
a
strange
sensation
of
awe
and
fear
,
as
if
some
calamity
were
about
to
befall
them
,
yet
none
could
give
a
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
Even
the
venerable
pastor
himself
seemed
to
be
uncommonly
affected
;
for
once
or
twice
he
paused
and
glanced
around
the
apartment
,
as
if
expecting
to
behold
some
unwelcome
object
.
<EOS>
Already
had
he
asked
the
necessary
questions
,
received
the
affirmative
answers
,
and
raising
his
eyes
above
,
as
if
appealing
to
Heaven
,
the
solemn
words
,
"
I
pronounce
you
man
and
wife
,
"
were
almost
trembling
on
his
lips
,
when
,
suddenly
,
the
sharp
report
of
a
rifle
without
,
succeeded
immediately
by
a
shout
,
<EOS>
a
groan
,
and
then
by
the
most
horrible
yells
imaginable
,
caused
every
face
to
blanch
with
terror
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
there
arose
the
alarming
cry
of
"
Indians
!
<EOS>
Indians
!
"
<EOS>
accompanied
with
appalling
shricks
and
the
utmost
confusion
.
<EOS>
Maidens
threw
their
frail
arms
around
their
lovers
for
protection
,
and
the
latter
strove
to
disengage
themselves
and
rush
to
their
rifles
,
which
,
unfortunately
,
had
been
left
in
the
adjoining
cabin
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
alarming
state
of
affairs
,
Clifton
drew
his
sword
,
sprang
upon
the
table
,
and
shouted
,
"
Order
!
<EOS>
Silence
!
<EOS>
"
just
as
some
half
-
a
-
dozen
hideous
looking
savages
burst
into
the
apartment
,
uttering
terrific
yells
of
fury
.
<EOS>
Kate
,
surprised
to
bewilderment
,
had
thrown
her
arms
around
her
mother
,
who
,
completely
overcome
by
the
excitement
,
had
sunk
to
the
floor
in
a
state
of
insensibility
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
the
foremost
savage
,
who
appeared
to
be
chief
of
the
party
,
looked
hurriedly
around
him
,
as
if
in
search
of
some
victim
,
when
his
eyes
falling
upon
Kate
,
he
shouted
,
in
English
,
"
She
's
here
,
"
and
sprang
at
once
to
her
side
.
<EOS>
Clifton
saw
the
movement
,
and
in
his
haste
to
punish
the
bold
intruder
,
and
save
her
he
loved
,
he
made
an
attempt
to
leap
forward
,
when
the
table
tilted
,
upset
,
and
he
was
thrown
heavily
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
recover
his
feet
,
the
hellish
work
of
the
savage
was
completed
.
<EOS>
Tearing
Kate
rudely
from
the
embrace
of
her
mother
,
he
drew
his
knife
and
plunged
it
into
the
heart
of
the
latter
;
then
raising
the
former
in
his
arms
,
he
rushed
to
the
door
,
with
a
laugh
so
fiendish
it
made
the
blood
of
all
who
heard
it
curdle
,
and
,
bounding
into
the
open
air
,
darted
into
a
neighboring
thicket
with
his
prize
.
<EOS>
As
the
captor
of
Kate
sprang
through
the
door
,
Clifton
regained
his
feet
,
in
time
to
see
her
disappear
.
<EOS>
With
a
cry
of
vengeance
and
dispair
,
he
leaped
forward
to
her
rescue
,
when
a
blow
on
the
head
,
from
one
of
the
Indians
,
intercepted
his
progress
,
and
laid
him
senseless
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
onset
of
the
savages
had
been
terrific
.
<EOS>
With
horrible
yells
,
tomahawk
in
hand
,
they
rushed
upon
the
unarmed
whites
,
and
dealt
their
blows
on
every
side
Two
young
men
were
tomahawked
immediately
,
and
their
scalps
torn
reeking
from
their
bleeding
heads
.
<EOS>
Two
others
had
been
severely
wounded
,
and
two
females
made
prisoners
,
when
Ichabod
,
who
on
the
first
alarm
had
escaped
into
the
adjoining
cabin
,
returned
with
his
arms
loaded
with
rifles
.
<EOS>
With
a
presence
of
mind
and
dexterity
worthy
a
hero
,
he
managed
to
distribute
some
five
or
six
of
these
weapons
among
his
friends
,
ere
<EOS>
the
Indians
became
aware
of
what
was
taking
place
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
first
intimation
they
had
of
the
matter
,
was
from
the
discharge
of
one
which
the
gardener
had
reserved
for
himself
,
whereby
a
powerful
savage
,
who
was
darting
forward
to
seize
upon
a
terrified
female
,
was
shot
through
the
body
.
<EOS>
With
a
yell
of
rage
and
pain
,
he
bounded
up
from
the
ground
and
fell
back
a
corpse
.
<EOS>
This
astonished
the
dusky
warriors
pressing
on
his
rear
,
and
they
paused
in
their
work
of
carnage
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
at
a
glance
that
several
of
the
whites
had
suddenly
become
armed
,
and
were
preparing
to
deal
death
among
them
,
they
gave
vent
to
yells
of
fury
and
alarm
,
and
simultaneously
rushed
out
of
the
cottage
,
bearing
their
dead
comrade
with
them
,
but
leaving
their
prisoners
behind
.
<EOS>
With
yells
little
less
frightful
than
their
own
,
those
of
the
whites
who
were
armed
,
now
sallied
forth
to
give
chase
.
<EOS>
As
they
reached
the
door
,
they
saw
the
savages
already
dodging
among
the
trees
,
and
speeding
forward
with
a
velocity
that
destroyed
all
hope
of
overtaking
them
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
should
they
pursue
,
it
was
more
than
probable
they
would
be
drawn
into
an
ambuscade
and
all
cut
off
;
and
acting
with
more
wisdom
and
caution
than
is
usual
on
such
occasions
,
they
discharged
their
pieces
at
random
after
the
foe
,
and
retreating
into
the
house
,
instantly
closed
and
bolted
the
door
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XI.Onward

<EOS>
let
us

<EOS>
Not
,
never
,
while
we
justice
seek

them
That

done
this
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
deed
to
damn
The
doers
—
a
deed
that
Heaven
scorns
—
and
while
The
life
-
blood
warms
our
hearts
,
we
'll
falter
not

Nor
pause
;
and
peradventure
Heaven
will
send
Us

;
if
not
,
our
lives
shall
perish
in
A
just
and
worthy
cause
.
<EOS>
So
onward
!
<EOS>
onward
!
<EOS>
To
the
rescue
,
on!—Brinley
's
Rescue
.
<EOS>
Short
but
bloody
had
been
the
work
of
that
enemy
whose
heart
is
ever
shut
to
mercy
in
war
.
<EOS>
When
Ernest
regained
his
senses
,
which
happened
at
the
moment
we
have
chosen
to
close
the
preceeding
chapter
,
a
scene
was
presented
to
his
vision
,
well
calculated
to
make
the
stoutest
heart
grow
sick
and
faint
.
<EOS>
On
the
ground
,
by
his
side
,
lay
the
mangled
remains
of
Danbury
,
and
another
youth
—
who
had
come
hither
,
but
an
hour
before
,
full
of
life
,
and
hope
,
and
buoyant
feelings
—
now
fast
growing
cold
in
the
embrace
of
death
—
their
once
handsome
features
distorted
and
bloody
,
and
their
scalps
already
dangling
at
the
girdle
of
some
inhuman
monster
of
the
forest
.
<EOS>
A
little
further
on
,
half
hid
in
the
shadow
of
the
dim
light
of
the
apartment
<EOS>
,
he
saw
the
form
of
her
who
had
given
birth
to
the
idol
of
his
affections
,
now
lying
at
full
length
upon
the
ground
—
her
white
dress
frightfully
stained
with
the
red
current
of
life
,
which
had
spouted
from
her
breast
—
her
features
pale
,
and
,
save
a
slight
contraction
,
caused
by
the
deathspasm
,
looking
as
calm
and
sweet
as
if
she
had
just
sunk
into
a
gentle
sleep
.
<EOS>
Above
and
around
him
,
all
was
noise
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
Several
females
were
huddling
together
in
one
corner
,
as
if
striving
to
shrink
from
the
foe
,
still
shrieking
for
aid
,
and
apparently
not
aware
that
the
enemy
had
vanished
.
<EOS>
Some
were
groaning
with
pain
,
some
were
running
to
and
fro
completely
bewildered
,
and
some
were
shouting
for
silence
;
but
all
was
yet
Babel
-
like
commotion
.
<EOS>
Ernest
felt
a
slight
dizziness
in
his
head
,
and
the
blood
trickling
over
his
face
.
<EOS>
Raising
his
hand
to
the
wound
,
he
comprehended
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
savage
had
struck
him
with
a
tomahawk
,
which
,
instead
of
splitting
open
his
skull
,
as
intended
,
had
glanced
along
the
bone
,
and
made
a
frightful
incision
.
<EOS>
The
blow
had
stunned
and
felled
him
,
and
thus
his
life
had
been
preserved
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
wound
,
he
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
,
as
though
it
were
a
mere
scratch
,
and
in
a
voice
of
authority
,
whose
tones
were
distinctly
audible
above
all
the
tumult
,
commanded
silence
.
<EOS>
As
if
each
acknowledged
his
right
to
command
,
all
at
once
became
still
,
and
every
eye
was
turned
inquiringly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
pale
with
excitement
,
down
which
the
blood
was
trickling
in
long
,
red
streaks
,
and
dropping
upon
and
soiling
his
splendid
uniform
,
rendering
him
an
object
painful
to
behold
—
so
that
many
gazed
upon
him
with
awe
,
not
unlike
what
they
would
have
felt
on
beholding
one
rise
from
the
dead
.
<EOS>
"Friends
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
"
this
is
a
terrible
scene
,
and
must
be
avenged
.
<EOS>
She
who
was
so
late
among
you
,
almost
a
bride
,
has
been
torn
away
,
and
is
now
a
captive
to
a
merciless
foe
—
if
,
in
fact
,
the
thirsty
tomahawk
of
her
captor
has
not
already
drank
of
her
innocent
blood
.
<EOS>
Yonder
,
behold
the
gory
corpse
of
her
mother
!
<EOS>
Shall
these
inhuman
monsters
go
unpunished
?
<EOS>
Shall
we
not
start
upon
her
trail
,
swearing
to
rescue
her
if
living
,
if
dead
to
avenge
,
or
leave
our
bones
to
whiten
the
soil
of
the
red
man?"Cries
of
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
yes
!
"
<EOS>
resounded
on
all
sides
,
while
those
who
had
weapons
grasped
them
tightly
,
and
their
eyes
flashed
,
and
their
features
wore
expressions
of
the
most
resolute
determination
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
poor
body
's
devoted
to
the
rescue
of
my
last
and
only
friend
—
my
poor
,
sweet
mistress
,
"
rejoined
Ichabod
,
with
a
strong
burst
of
emotion
,
that
brought
the
tear
to
many
an
eye
.
<EOS>
"I
knew
you
were
men
!
"
<EOS>
said
Ernest
,
in
a
tone
of
decision
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
us
do
,
rather
than
say
!
<EOS>
Prepare
,
those
of
you
who
are
disposed
to
follow
me
,
and
let
us
depart
<EOS>
forthwith!""But
the
women
,
the
wounded
and
dead
—
what
of
them
?
"
asked
one
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
some
two
or
three
remain
here
,
while
one
mounts
the
fleetest
horse
and
bears
tidings
of
the
dire
calamity
to
the
village
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
danger
here
at
present
;
for
the
savages
,
having
accomplished
their
hellish
work
,
are
already
on
their
homeward
retreat
.
<EOS>
We
must
strive
to
overtake
them
on
the
way
.
<EOS>
""But
how
shall
we
follow
,
not
knowing
whither
they
went
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
same
voice
which
had
spoken
before
,
and
which
Clifton
now
became
aware
proceeded
from
the
lips
of
Danvers
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
by
their
war
-
paint
,
"
answered
the
young
officer
,
"
that
they
are
a
detachment
of
Piquas
,
and
,
if
my
eyes
did
not
deceive
me
,
were
led
by
a
white
man
.
<EOS>
""By
heavens
!
<EOS>
I
see
it
all
!
"
<EOS>
said
Danvers
,
in
reply
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
that
inhuman
wretch
,
Moody
.
<EOS>
"A
mingled
expression
of
horror
and
loathing
,
with
a
determination
to
be
revenged
,
was
now
visible
on
nearly
every
face
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
no
doubt
you
are
right
,
"
rejoined
Clifton
;
"
for
the
size
of
his
person
,
and
the
shape
of
his
features
,
as
described
to
me
,
correspond
exactly
to
the
monster
I
beheld
.
<EOS>
""He
shall
die
a
dog
's
death
!
"
shouted
one
.
<EOS>
"Hung
and
quartered
without
judge
or
jury
!
"
said
another
.
<EOS>
"Roasted
<EOS>
over
a
slow
fire
!
"
responded
a
third
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
shall
chew
his
own
heart
!
"
<EOS>
added
a
fourth
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
but
let
us
catch
him
first
,
"
timed
in
Clifton
.
"
While
we
tarry
,
he
is
fleeing
.
<EOS>
Let
us
act
at
once
.
<EOS>
""Ay
!
<EOS>
ay
!
"
<EOS>
shouted
half
-
a
-
dozen
voices

"Before
<EOS>
you
go
,
my
friends
,
upon
a
journey
that
may
be
your
last
,
let
us
unite
in
prayer
,
to
that
God
who
does
all
things
for
the
best
,
and
for
our
good
,
even
when
visiting
us
with
sore
afflictions
,
"
said
the
venerable
and
pious
clergyman
—
who
,
throughout
the
affray
,
had
been
left
unharmed
,
and
had
remained
,
so
far
,
a
quiet
and
seemingly
unmoved
spectator
,
with
his
arms
meekly
folded
on
his
breast
,
the
picture
of
humility
and
resignation
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
call
upon
our
Maker
for
aid
,
in
this
our
sorest
need
!
"
and
kneeling
upon
the
ground
,
he
extended
his
arms
aloft
,
and
made
a
most
fervent
and
eloquent
prayer
,
which
was
rendered
doubly
solemn
by
the
mournfulness
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
When
this
was
over
,
Clifton
gave
orders
for
those
who
were
to
accompany
him
,
to
prepare
themselves
and
set
forth
immediately
.
<EOS>
Some
six
or
eight
of
the
party
,
among
whom
were
Danvers
and
Ichabod
,
volunteered
their
services
at
once
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
all
were
ready
for
the
perilous
journey
.
<EOS>
The
pastor
,
and
one
or
two
others
,
remained
to
take
charge
of
the
nearly
distracted
females
,
until
aid
should
arrive
from
the
village
—
when
the
wounded
would
be
better
cared
for
,
and
the
dead
consigned
to
dust
,
with
all
due
ceremony
.
<EOS>
Collecting
what
weapons
they
could
,
together
with
a
good
supply
of
ammunition
,
the
party
in
a
few
minutes
formed
around
Clifton
as
their
leader
,
who
announced
to
the
rest
,
that
the
solemn
moment
of
separation
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
scene
which
ensued
.
<EOS>
Each
seemed
for
a
time
to
give
himself
up
to
his
strongest
feelings
.
<EOS>
Lovers
rushed
to
each
other
with
a
freedom
and
wildness
which
nothing
but
a
similar
occasion
could
justify
,
threw
themselves
into
each
other
's
arms
,
and
clung
around
each
other
's
necks
,
as
if
they
felt
the
separation
to
be
eternal
;
while
groans
,
cries
and
sobs
of
anguish
resounded
on
all
sides
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
all
was
great
commotion
;
but
gradually
the
tumult
ceased
,
until
nothing
could
be
heard
but
<EOS>
a
low
murmur
,
in
a
choked
voice
,
or
a
deep
drawn
sigh
,
or
a
half
stifled
burst
of
grief
.
"We
<EOS>
waste
time
,
"
said
Clifton
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
"Go
,
<EOS>
my
friends
,
and
God
be
with
you
,
"
said
the
preacher
,
solemnly
;
"
and
Heaven
send
you
may
return
with
the
maiden
you
seek
—
the
flower
of
the
forest!""Amen
!
<EOS>
"
responded
Clifton
,
and
two
or
three
others
;
and
throwing
open
the
door
,
the
bereaved
lover
rushed
out
,
followed
immediately
by
his
companions
.
<EOS>
"I
must
detain
you
one
moment
more
,
"
he
added
,
as
he
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
his
head
;
and
springing
back
into
the
house
,
he
called
for
a
bandage
.
<EOS>
This
was
quickly
supplied
and
bound
around
his
wound
;
then
hastily
washing
the
blood
from
his
face
,
he
rejoined
his
party
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
follow
the
Miami
,
"
he
continued
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
know
of
no
better
plan
,
and
it
is
possible
that
in
the
morning
we
may
strike
upon
their
trail
.
<EOS>
""Is
there
none
of
our
party
that
understand
trailing
the
savage
?
"
asked
one
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
fear
not
,
"
replied
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
of
an
experienced
scout
,
but
he
is
far
away
now
,
in
another
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
would
to
Heaven
he
were
here!""And
what
may
be
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
a
strange
voice
,
which
all
immediately
became
aware
proceeded
from
a
figure
,
a
few
paces
distant
,
that
was
nearing
them
with
long
and
steady
strides
.
<EOS>
"
What
may
be
the
scout
's
name
you
've
just
alluded
to
,
lieutenant
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
again
,
as
he
came
up
,
addressing
himself
to
Clifton
.
"David
<EOS>
Grant
,
"
answered
the
young
officer
,
endeavoring
to
make
out
the
features
of
the
new
comer
,
as
he
paused
in
the
shadow
cast
by
the
moon
.
<EOS>
"I'm
<EOS>
David
Grant
,
"
was
the
laconic
response
.
<EOS>
"Great
<EOS>
Heaven
!
<EOS>
David
,
what
sent
you
here
so
opportune
?
"
cried
Clifton
,
grasping
the
hard
,
weather
-
beaten
hand
of
the
other
,
with
a
pressure
of
unmistakeable
joy
.
<EOS>
"May
<EOS>
be
Heaven
did
,
"
was
the
quiet
answer
.
<EOS>
"It
would
seem
so
,
"
rejoined
Ernest
;
"
for
of
all
men
,
you
are
the
one
I
most
desired
to
see
,
at
this
momentous
crisis
.
<EOS>
""Something
's
gone
wrong
,
I
reckon
?
"
said
David
,
in
reply
.
<EOS>
Clifton
now
hurriedly
narrated
the
leading
features
of
the
events
we
have
so
feebly
described
.
<EOS>
"I'spected
as
much
,
"
rejoined
the
scout
,
when
he
had
concluded
.
"
<EOS>
He
told
me
I
'd
be
wanted
.
<EOS>
""He
!
<EOS>
whom
!
"
cried
several
of
the
party
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
know
who
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
for
he
was
a
stranger
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
like
a
man
,
but
looked
like
the
devil
.
<EOS>
""Was
<EOS>
he
tall
,
ill
-
dressed
,
rawboned
and
ugly
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ernest
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
he
was
all
that
.
<EOS>
""Had
<EOS>
a
long
,
flowing
beard?""Powerful
long
beard
he
had
.
<EOS>
""And
seemed
partly
blind?""For
the
matter
o
'
that
,
he
looked
like
he
might
be
blind
altogether
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"It
was
the
Necromancer
,
"
returned
Ernest
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"Ay
!
<EOS>
that
mysterious
Blind
Luther
,
and
none
other
,
"
said
Danvers
,
shaking
his
head
with
a
superstitious
air
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
did
you
see
him
,
and
what
did
he
say
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"I
was
scouting
in
the
forest
,
more'n
forty
miles
distant
,
"
answered
Grant
,
"
when
's
I
passed
around
a
tree
,
my
hair
riz
right
up
,
on
hearing
a
voice
say:"`Hold
,
David!'"I
tried
to
tree
,
but
<EOS>
could'nt
,
for
a
big
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
that
would'nt
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
"`Who
<EOS>
are
you
?
'
<EOS>
says
I."`A
messenger
of
fate
,
'
says
he
.
<EOS>
"`What
<EOS>
d'ye
want
with
me?'"`Hie
thee
to
Columbia
,
'
he
says
,
`
and
inquire
for
Lieutenant
Clifton
's
wedding
.
<EOS>
'"`I
<EOS>
did'nt
know
he
was
going
to
be
married
,
'
says
I."`Do
as
I
bid
thee
,
and
ask
no
questions
!
'
<EOS>
says
he
;
`
and
be
sure
you
reach
there
at
an
early
hour
,
on
such
a
night
(
this
is
the
night
)
,
when
you
'll
find
yourself
wanted
,
and
orders
will
be
given
you
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
'"Short
on't
is
,
<EOS>
gentlemen
,
I
'm
here
;
though
sometimes
I
did
quarrel
with
David
Grant
—
thinking
as
how
I
was
going
on
a
fool
's
errand
,
or
at
a
madman
's
beck
.
<EOS>
""You
could
never
have
come
at
a
better
time
,
unless
it
had
been
to
warn
us
of
danger
,
"
said
Clifton
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
David
,
I
have
told
you
the
circumstances
,
and
wait
your
advice
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
say
you
think
they
're
Piquas?""I
am
almost
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
object
had
they
in
doing
's
they
did
,
'
spect
<EOS>
you?""Their
leader
,
I
think
,
is
a
white
man
disguised
,
whose
sole
object
was
to
get
possession
of
the
girl
.
<EOS>
Some
months
ago
,
he
was
a
suitor
to
her
hand
,
and
she
rejected
him
,
and
he
swore
revenge
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
,
her
father
was
murdered
by
his
hand
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
he
has
butchered
her
mother
in
cold
blood
,
and
made
her
captive
for
some
hellish
end
,
of
which
I
groan
to
think
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
a
moment
the
scout
mused
,
as
one
in
deep
thought
,
and
then
said:"I'spect
you
're
right
,
lieutenant
,
and
that
I
know
the
party
with
him
.
<EOS>
How
'd
they
number?""Not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
,
as
near
as
I
can
judge
.
<EOS>
""It
's
them
for
a
wager
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
on
their
trail
,
not
a
week
ago
;
and
now
I
comprehend
the
spread
moccason
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
understand
you
,
"
said
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
there
was
one
moccason
among
'em
,
that
toed
out'ard
like
a
white
man
's
;
and
I
says
to
myself
then
,
`
David
Grant
,
that
's
ayther
a
pris'ner
or
a
renegade
.
'
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
you
've
told
me
of
this
,
for
now
I
reckon
to
find
'em
.
<EOS>
Nigh
's
<EOS>
I
can
come
to
it
<EOS>
,
they
do
n't
belong
to
the
regular
tribe
o
'
Piquas
,
but
are
a
kinder
o
'
outlawry
vagabonds
,
that
skulk
about
on
their
own
hook
,
and
are
most
powerful
mean
cowards
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
David
delivered
himself
of
this
,
he
strode
forward
into
the
moonlight
,
and
displayed
the
lineaments
of
a
being
well
calculated
for
a
life
in
the
woods
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
thirty
-
five
years
of
age
,
and
above
the
ordinary
stature
.
<EOS>
His
form
was
shriveled
and
sinewy
,
as
if
dried
and
contracted
by
long
exposure
to
the
weather
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
long
,
thin
and
bony
;
and
his
small
black
eyes
were
continually
rolling
about
,
with
a
nervous
motion
,
as
if
eternally
on
the
look
out
for
danger
.
<EOS>
His
long
,
shaggy
hair
was
surmounted
with
a
roughly
formed
cap
,
made
from
the
untanned
skin
of
some
wild
animal
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
hunting
-
shirt
of
linsey
-
woolsey
,
to
which
was
attached
a
large
cape
,
fringed
with
red
.
<EOS>
Around
his
waist
was
a
belt
,
in
which
were
a
scalping
-
knife
and
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
He
wore
moccasons
on
his
feet
,
and
around
his
neck
was
suspended
a
large
powder
-
horn
and
bullet
-
pouch
,
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
long
rifle
.
<EOS>
As
David
stepped
forth
,
he
immediately
began
a
survey
of
the
heavens
above
,
and
the
earth
beneath
,
with
the
air
of
one
long
practiced
in
the
art
of
reading
the
sings
of
the
forest
,
so
necessary
in
determining
the
movements
of
the
woodman
.
<EOS>
"It
's
a
going
to
be
a
foggy
night
,
"
he
said
;
"
that
a
child
could
tell
;
for
already
now
the
clouds
of
mist
are
lifting
their
heads
along
the
trail
o
'
the
rivers
,
and
rolling
out
ayther
way
,
while
a
thick
haze
's
beginning
to
darken
the
moon
.
<EOS>
I
see
,
by
the
ground
signs
,
the
varmints
have
took
up
the
river
;
and
so
I
reckon
our
best
course
is
to
follow
that
,
and
git
as
far
's
we
can
afore
daylight
;
and
it
's
not
impossible
we
'll
head
'em
off
,
or
come
upon
their
camp
.
<EOS>
""Then
let
us
go
at
once
,
"
said
Clifton
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"Don't
hurry
,
lieutenant
,
"
returned
David
,
respectfully
,
bending
down
to
examine
the
ground
at
his
feet
;
"
there
's
nothing
made
by
hurrying
—
'
specially
when
you
've
got
to
go
by
signs
.
<EOS>
Here
's
the
trail
,
sure
enough
,
"
he
continued
,
"
and
a
bloody
one
'
tis
,
too
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
there
's
been
a
scuffle
here
<EOS>
,
I
know
by
the
ground
being
trod
a
few
.
<EOS>
Any
o
'
your
party
fight
outside?""Heavens
!
<EOS>
it
is
the
sentinel
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Danvers
;
"
for
it
was
here
he
was
stationed
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
sentinel
<EOS>
it
proved
to
be
;
for
the
next
moment
the
poor
fellow
was
discovered
,
a
few
paces
distant
,
lying
on
his
breast
,
and
his
head
bloody
from
the
recent
removal
of
his
scalp
.
<EOS>
His
rifle
was
found
near
him
,
discharged
,
and
the
breach
broken
,
showing
that
he
had
done
his
best
for
himself
and
friends
.
<EOS>
Examining
the
body
,
and
finding
that
life
was
extinct
,
our
party
,
with
a
few
words
of
eulogy
and
regret
,
passed
on
,
leaving
his
remains
to
be
taken
care
of
by
those
who
remained
behind
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
they
were
swallowed
up
in
the
great
forest
;
and
silence
,
deep
and
gloomy
,
reigned
over
the
scene
so
lately
rife
with
tumult
and
blood
-
shed
.

Some
twenty
-
five
or
thirty
miles
above
the
mouth
of
the
Little
Miami
,
and
forming
the
eastern
boundary
of
a
plain
not
unlike
the
one
described
in
the
opening
pages
of
this
story
,
is
a
stony
ridge
,
to
which
we
must
now
invite
the
readers
attention
.
<EOS>
In
one
place
,
this
ridge
leaves
the
plain
abruptly
,
by
an
acelivity
so
steep
as
to
make
ascension
a
matter
of
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Huge
rocks
,
whose
fronts
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
precipices
,
here
rise
one
above
the
other
,
to
a
height
of
many
feet
,
and
altogether
present
a
very
formidable
and
imposing
appearance
.
<EOS>
Between
these
rocks
,
which
appear
to
have
been
thrown
together
by
some
great
convulsions
of
nature
,
are
many
deep
fissures
,
through
which
has
struggled
upward
a
growth
of
small
,
craggy
trees
and
shrubbery
,
that
,
instead
of
beautifying
,
only
tend
to
increase
the
wildness
and
gloominess
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
By
a
circuitous
route
,
and
careful
footsteps
,
you
can
gain
a
point
on
one
of
these
rocks
,
which
,
to
the
eye
unaccustomed
to
the
spot
,
seems
one
of
imminent
peril
.
<EOS>
The
point
alluded
to
,
is
elevated
above
the
plain
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
,
and
forms
an
area
of
not
more
than
fifty
square
yards
.
<EOS>
Immediately
in
your
front
,
as
you
face
the
west
,
the
rock
is
perpendicular
for
a
distance
of
thirty
feet
.
<EOS>
Behind
you
rises
another
perpendicular
rock
,
and
on
either
side
is
a
deep
and
gloomy
chasm
.
<EOS>
Through
one
of
these
—
that
at
your
right
hand
—
flows
a
rapid
streamlet
,
whose
waters
,
unseen
from
where
you
stand
,
gurgling
over
the
rocks
below
,
send
upward
a
hollow
,
dismal
sound
,
that
invariably
causes
the
spectator
,
who
visits
it
for
the
first
time
,
to
wish
himself
once
more
safe
on
the
plain
below
.
<EOS>
Gloomy
as
is
the
place
in
question
,
it
is
not
without
its
attractions
.
<EOS>
The
eye
here
embraces
an
extensive
scope
of
country
,
spread
before
it
like
a
map
.
<EOS>
A
large
and
well
cultivated
plain
,
of
two
or
three
miles
in
breadth
—
through
the
center
of
which
<EOS>
winds
<EOS>
the
glassy
stream
so
often
mentioned
,
interspersed
with
here
and
there
a
tidy
farm
house
,
or
a
cluster
of
white
dwellings
,
forming
a
village
,
with
the
steeple
of
its
church
overlooking
it
with
an
air
of
guardianship
—
stretches
away
to
the
north
and
south
,
and
contrasts
delightfully
with
the
rougher
and
wilder
scenery
at
hand
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
however
,
the
plain
had
none
of
the
attractions
of
civilization
it
now
presents
;
but
a
mighty
,
unbroken
forest
,
instead
,
lay
on
its
bosom
,
in
whose
dark
recesses
danger
everywhere
lurked
,
and
man
and
beast
warred
with
themselves
and
each
other
continually
.
<EOS>
It
was
late
on
the
day
succeeding
the
capture
of
Kate
Clarendon
,
that
a
tall
,
slim
figure
,
in
the
costume
of
an
Indian
,
leaped
,
with
a
light
bound
,
across
the
chasm
on
the
left
,
and
paused
,
for
a
moment
,
upon
the
platform
of
the
rock
we
have
described
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
already
sinking
in
the
west
,
and
his
rays
streamed
softly
along
the
tops
of
the
trees
,
tipping
them
with
gold
,
throwing
the
figure
into
bold
relief
,
and
burnishing
the
huge
erections
of
nature
,
until
one
could
,
with
but
little
stretch
of
the
imagination
,
fancy
them
colossal
images
of
brass
.
<EOS>
We
have
said
the
figure
was
costumed
like
an
Indian
;
but
that
he
was
not
of
this
race
,
was
evident
from
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
,
wherever
the
removal
of
the
paint
,
by
perspiration
or
otherwise
,
permitted
it
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
There
were
other
signs
going
to
prove
him
not
a
native
warrior
.
<EOS>
His
arms
seemed
tender
,
as
if
not
accustomed
to
exposure
,
and
were
scratched
in
several
places
,
by
brambles
and
thorns
,
so
as
to
render
them
swollen
and
sore
.
<EOS>
The
feathers
,
intended
as
ornaments
to
his
scalp
-
lock
,
had
also
become
disarranged
,
in
a
manner
that
the
pride
of
a
native
Indian
would
never
have
permitted
.
<EOS>
Around
his
waist
he
wore
a
wampun
belt
,
supporting
a
brace
of
pistols
,
a
tomahawk
and
scalping
-
knife
.
<EOS>
As
he
paused
upon
the
rock
,
he
ran
his
black
,
fiery
eye
over
the
plain
,
for
a
moment
,
as
if
to
be
certain
no
one
was
approaching
.
<EOS>
Then
he
glanced
cautiously
around
him
,
and
a
malignant
expression
of
triumph
lighted
up
and
gradually
settled
over
his
features
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
I
have
her
safe
now
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
with
an
oath
;
and
running
to
the
side
of
the
rock
overhanging
the
stream
,
he
began
to
let
himself
down
its
jaggy
sides
,
and
presently
disappeared
altogether
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
on
this
side
,
a
rough
kind
of
staircase
,
overhanging
the
foaming
flood
;
and
down
this
the
figure
descended
rapidly
,
taking
hold
of
the
bushes
and
projections
,
to
prevent
himself
from
falling
,
until
he
came
to
a
spot
where
the
rock
jutted
completely
over
the
stream
,
and
formed
a
sure
foundation
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Halting
here
for
a
moment
,
and
listening
the
while
,
he
turned
to
the
right
,
and
passing
under
the
rocky
bank
,
entered
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
,
which
extended
back
into
the
hill
a
considerable
distance
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
rapidly
forward
,
through
a
narrow
passage
,
he
at
last
came
to
a
stone
,
which
he
with
difficulty
removed
,
and
emerged
into
a
compartment
of
great
breadth
and
size
,
dimly
lighted
by
a
small
opening
or
fissure
in
the
rock
above
,
whence
trickled
down
,
or
rather
filtered
through
,
just
sufficient
water
to
render
the
rock
beneath
wet
and
slippery
.
<EOS>
Here
the
figure
paused
again
,
and
endeavored
to
peer
into
the
further
recesses
of
the
cave
;
but
it
was
evident
from
his
manner
,
and
the
fact
that
he
had
so
recently
come
from
the
broad
light
of
day
into
a
place
never
at
any
time
more
than
twilight
,
that
he
could
not
discern
a
single
object
.
<EOS>
Stepping
aside
somewhat
,
to
avoid
the
dripping
water
,
he
at
once
proceeded
to
strike
a
light
.
<EOS>
A
half
-
burnt
torch
lay
on
the
floor
of
the
cavern
,
which
re
-
lighting
,
he
proceeded
to
search
the
place
,
holding
this
in
his
hand
,
elevated
above
his
head
,
so
as
to
enable
him
to
discern
each
thing
distinctly
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
it
was
evident
by
his
lowering
brow
,
angry
visage
and
keen
searching
eyes
,
that
he
was
unable
to
find
the
object
sought
.
<EOS>
But
at
length
he
paused
,
uttered
a
wild
yell
,
not
unlike
an
Indian
,
and
then
sprang
forward
to
a
dark
corner
of
the
cavern
,
where
another
figure
,
arrayed
in
white
,
was
crouched
,
and
trembling
with
terror
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
I
have
thee
now
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
with
a
hoarse
burst
of
passion
,
and
a
laugh
like
a
fiend
;
and
the
next
moment
he
stood
over
the
crouching
object
,
waving
his
torch
from
side
to
side
,
and
resembling
,
as
the
ruddy
light
flashed
upon
his
dark
,
malignant
face
,
some
infernal
spirit
,
about
to
seize
upon
an
innocent
victim
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
to
what
am
I
destined
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
in
silvery
,
but
heart
-
touching
tones
,
the
voice
of
the
unhappy
object
at
the
monster
's
feet
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
the
ruddy
,
gloomy
light
fell
upon
the
pale
,
sweet
features
of
a
terrified
female
,
as
she
attempted
to
rise
and
confront
her
foe
.
"Destined
<EOS>
to
perdition
with
me
!
"
returned
the
savage
,
with
another
fiendish
laugh
,
roughly
grasping
an
arm
of
the
maiden
,
and
raising
her
to
an
upright
posture
.
<EOS>
"
Now
I
have
thee
,
Kate
Clarendon
,
and
thou
shalt
<EOS>
this
time
feel
the
vengeance
of
Rashton
Moody
.
<EOS>
""Unhand
<EOS>
and
let
me
go
,
if
thou
art
a
man
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Kate
,
in
terror
.
<EOS>
Moody
uttered
a
mocking
laugh
.
<EOS>
"Talk
to
the
wind
!
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
furiously
,
"
not
to
me
!
<EOS>
If
I
am
a
man
!
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
I
like
that
!
<EOS>
If
I
am
a
man
!
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
a
man
,
sweet
beauty
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
man
,
but
you
,
you
made
a
demon
of
me
;
and
now
my
hour
has
come
—
my
time
of
vengeance
is
at
hand!""But
what
have
I
done
to
merit
this
?
"
said
the
other
,
in
a
pleading
tone
.
<EOS>
"Done?—ha
,
ha
,
ha!—come
,
I
like
that
.
<EOS>
Done
all
that
a
woman
could
,
to
make
him
hate
who
once
loved
her
.
<EOS>
Done
,
foolish
girl
!
<EOS>
why
did
you
not
coquette
with
me
,
and
lead
me
to
believe
I
was
loved
,
that
I
might
be
a
laughing
stock
among
my
fellows?""As
God
<EOS>
is
my
judge
,
Rashton
Moody
<EOS>
,
I
did
not
.
<EOS>
""What
then?""I
explained
the
matter
to
you
once
—
have
you
forgotten
it?""And
<EOS>
are
too
proud
or
haughty
,
I
suppose
,
to
do
so
again
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
it
matters
not
;
for
now
you
are
in
my
power
,
indeed
;
and
I
will
teach
you
a
lesson
of
humility
,
ere
<EOS>
you
depart
,
that
you
will
remember
to
the
latest
moment
of
your
life
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
grasped
her
arm
tightly
,
and
peered
into
her
sweet
countenance
,
with
a
look
of
diabolical
triumph
,
that
caused
Kate
to
shudder
and
feel
sick
to
her
very
soul
.
<EOS>
"What
mean
you
by
such
language
?
<EOS>
"
she
faintly
asked
.
<EOS>
"Hark
<EOS>
you
,
Kate
Clarendon
!
<EOS>
I
told
you
once
I
loved
you
,
did
I
not?""Foolish
words
upon
a
foul
tongue
,
"
replied
Kate
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
think
so
?
"
<EOS>
sneered
Moody
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
;
it
is
of
little
importance
now
,
whether
I
told
you
true
or
not
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
wedded
you
,
but
you
refused
me
,
did
you
not?""Well?""Well
,
proud
beauty
!
<EOS>
I
'll
soon
teach
you
well!—but
to
my
story
.
<EOS>
You
refused
me
;
you
trifled
first
,
led
me
to
hope
,
and
then
refused
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
wild
with
passion
;
and
in
an
evil
moment
,
I
sought
to
bear
you
away
.
<EOS>
Had
you
left
me
to
do
as
I
pleased
,
no
wrong
would
have
followed
;
but
you
attempted
to
escape
,
and
then
I
swore
you
should
be
mine
,
living
or
dead
<EOS>
,
I
little
cared
which
.
<EOS>
I
caught
you
,
and
would
have
executed
my
design
upon
you
then
—
would
have
sent
your
soul
,
unpolluted
,
into
the
presence
of
your
Maker
—
had
I
not
been
struck
to
the
ground
by
the
only
being
on
earth
<EOS>
I
fear
.
<EOS>
Who
he
is
,
or
what
he
is
,
I
know
not
;
but
over
me
he
exercises
an
influence
beyond
my
skill
to
shake
off
or
explain
.
<EOS>
Then
came
your
father
,
and
struck
me—(here
<EOS>
Moody
paused
for
some
moments
,
during
which
his
features
worked
convulsively
,
his
hands
clenched
and
unclenched
,
his
teeth
grated
against
each
other
,
and
his
breath
came
hard
thro
'
his
expanded
nostrils
)
;
he
struck
me
!
—
<EOS>
mark
that!—disgraced
me
—
but
he
—
he
paid
for
it!—ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
—
<EOS>
the
blow
was
returned
with
interest
,
by
—
!
"
and
he
closed
with
an
oath
,
while
Kate
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
and
groaned
aloud
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
look
up
!
"
resumed
Moody
,
forcing
her
hands
from
before
her
eyes
:
"
<EOS>
Look
up
,
now
,
and
hear
me
out
!
<EOS>
That
night
I
returned
to
the
village
,
took
what
things
I
most
valued
,
and
fled
;
fled
for
my
own
safety
—
fled
to
lay
my
plan
of
revenge
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
struck
—
a
blow!—heavens!—a
blow!—by
him
—
your
father
—
and
I
wanted
revenge
.
<EOS>
Whither
should
I
seek
safety
but
among
the
Indians
—
among
the
foes
of
my
race
!
<EOS>
I
knew
if
I
came
peaceably
among
them
,
and
offered
to
join
them
,
I
should
be
accepted
.
<EOS>
Two
years
before
I
had
been
a
captive
among
the
Shawanoes
,
long
enough
to
understand
in
part
their
language
,
and
got
my
liberty
through
the
influence
of
the
Necromancer
,
who
told
me
then
,
unless
I
were
careful
,
I
should
come
to
some
base
end
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
a
fool
!
<EOS>
What
does
he
know
about
me
or
my
destiny?"I
fled
,
I
say
,
toward
an
Indian
settlement
;
but
ere
<EOS>
I
reached
one
,
I
fell
in
with
a
scouting
party
of
Piquas
.
<EOS>
I
showed
them
the
open
hand
,
told
them
my
story
,
and
they
adopted
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
taken
home
to
their
village
—
went
through
the
Indian
ceremony
—
was
shaved
,
painted
,
and
dressed
in
skins
—
and
was
,
in
short
,
made
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
I
told
them
I
wanted
one
trusty
warrior
,
and
only
one
,
to
go
with
me
on
the
war
path
—
that
I
had
a
chief
to
kill
among
the
pale
faces
,
to
prove
my
courage
and
fealty
.
<EOS>
They
consented
that
I
should
go
,
but
said
I
must
go
alone
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
why
am
I
detailing
?
<EOS>
Enough
!
<EOS>
I
went.—I
soon
reached
your
dwelling
,
and
prowled
about
the
vicinity
for
several
days
before
the
opportunity
I
sought
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
It
came
at
last
.
<EOS>
I
saw
your
father
and
his
serving
man
set
out
upon
a
hunt
.
<EOS>
I
laughed
,
and
dogged
their
footsteps
.
<EOS>
They
killed
a
deer
,
and
your
father
thought
to
bear
it
home
,
while
the
other
set
off
for
another
.
<EOS>
I
laughed
again
,
for
I
saw
my
hour
of
vengeance
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
deer
on
his
back
,
but
soon
grew
weary
with
his
burthen
,
and
paused
under
a
tree
to
rest
.
<EOS>
I
crept
up
behind
him
—
and
—
Fool
!
<EOS>
why
do
you
tremble
so
?
<EOS>
You
have
seen
it
all
once
,
and
now
you
are
only
hearing
of
it
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>
do
not
,
do
not
tell
me
more
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"O
,
hear
it
out
,
my
dear
;
it
will
do
you
good
,
and
prepare
you
for
what
is
to
come
,
"
sneered
Moody
.
<EOS>
"
I
crept
up
behind
him
,
I
say
—
<EOS>
and
he
was
sitting
so
cozily
,
too
,
under
that
tree
,
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
face
,
and
murmuring
something
about
his
wife
and
daughter
—
and
plunged
my
knife
into
his
breast
,
and—'Pon
<EOS>
my
word
,
I
believe
she
has
fainted
,
"
added
Moody
,
changing
suddenly
from
his
narrative
to
a
soliloquy
,
as
he
perceived
Kate
sink
down
upon
the
rock
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Hastily
raising
her
in
his
arms
,
he
now
bore
her
to
the
water
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
slight
hollow
in
the
rock
here
,
and
scooping
the
water
up
in
his
hand
,
he
dashed
it
in
her
face
until
she
revived
,
when
,
like
the
inquisitors
of
old
,
he
again
proceeded
with
the
torture
.
<EOS>
"I
knew
the
wounds
were
mortal
;
and
so
,
after
affixing
my
mark
,
I
left
him
,
and
,
climbing
a
tree
,
stationed
myself
where
I
could
see
the
result
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
course
you
know
,
and
so
I
shall
not
detail
it
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
returned
to
my
dusky
brethren
and
told
my
tale
.
<EOS>
They
listened
gravely
,
and
asked
me
for
the
scalp
of
my
white
foe
.
<EOS>
This
I
had
forgotten
;
and
they
laughed
at
me
,
and
told
me
I
had
killed
a
deer
,
and
thought
it
a
warrior
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
I
felt
chagrined
,
and
told
them
I
would
prove
myself
what
I
pretended
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
went
forth
again
alone
,
and
returned
with
two
white
scalps
.
<EOS>
Then
they
seemed
greatly
pleased
,
and
made
me
a
sort
of
chief
,
and
gave
me
command
of
a
scouting
party
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
it
was
,
<EOS>
I
felt
my
design
would
at
last
be
gained
,
and
you
be
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
To
this
end
all
my
thoughts
were
bent
;
and
this
your
presence
here
tells
I
have
accomplished
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
night
,
while
stealing
round
your
dwelling
,
I
saw
you
and
your
lover
issue
forth
together
,
and
I
kept
you
both
in
sight
.
<EOS>
You
paused
on
the
river
's
bank
,
and
sighed
to
each
other
your
love
-
sick
tales
.
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
how
my
blood
boiled
to
crush
you
both
together
;
but
prudence
restrained
me
.
<EOS>
I
listened
to
your
soft
words
until
I
became
tired
and
disgusted
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
last
they
came
to
an
end
,
and
I
heard
the
day
set
for
your
marriage
.
<EOS>
Then
my
plan
was
laid
;
I
would
be
there
with
my
painted
friends
;
and
in
the
height
of
your
enjoyment
,
would
make
the
scene
a
scene
of
wailing
and
woe
.
<EOS>
You
I
sought
for
my
victim
,
and
you
I
found
in
your
mother
's
arms
.
<EOS>
It
was
your
last
embrace
<EOS>
—
for
she
is
now—""Where
you
will
never
be
,
"
interrupted
Kate
,
impressively—"in
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
Then
clasping
her
hands
together
,
she
looked
upward
,
and
bursting
into
tears
,
cried
:
"
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
my
poor
,
dear
mother
!
<EOS>
thou
art
indeed
gone
!
<EOS>
God
rest
thy
soul
!
<EOS>
But
thou
art
in
Heaven
;
and
,
oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
were
with
thee
—
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
,
sainted
mother!""I
seized
and
bore
you
hence
,
"
continued
Moody
,
without
appearing
to
heed
the
interruption
of
the
other
;
"
and
as
the
first
ray
of
light
streaked
the
eastern
heavens
this
morning
,
I
placed
you
here
,
whence
you
can
not
depart
until
I
will
you
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
do
not
shrink
away
!
<EOS>
for
now
I
tell
you
plainly
,
you
are
in
my
power
,
and
beyond
the
reach
of
aid
.
<EOS>
Save
my
warriors
,
there
is
not
a
living
soul
,
besides
ourselves
,
that
knows
there
is
such
a
place
in
existence
;
and
they
have
yielded
you
up
to
me
,
and
will
not
betray
my
secret
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
returned
from
their
council
fires
,
with
their
full
consent
to
do
with
you
whatsoever
<EOS>
I
please
.
<EOS>
Now
you
know
the
story
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
do
you
propose
to
do
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Kate
,
in
trembling
tones
.
<EOS>
"Do!—ha
,
ha!—why
,
marry
you
without
a
priest
,
"
rejoined
Moody
,
tauntingly
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
kill
you
,
for
that
would
be
but
slight
revenge
.
<EOS>
""Great
<EOS>
God
!
<EOS>
you
do
not
,
can
not
mean
this
!
"
<EOS>
almost
shrieked
Kate
,
endeavoring
to
rush
past
him
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
.
"Nay
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Moody
,
seizing
hold
of
her
roughly
,
"
not
so
fast
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
let
me
go!—for
God
's
sake
,
let
me
go
!
<EOS>
and
I
will
forgive
you
all
that
is
past
.
<EOS>
""Forgive!—ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
What
think
you
I
care
for
your
forgiveness
?
<EOS>
Let
you
go
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
after
plunging
my
soul
into
crime
to
get
you
here
!
<EOS>
Why
,
girl
,
are
you
mad
,
to
talk
thus?""Then
kill
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Murder
me
,
as
you
have
murdered
my
parents
!
<EOS>
I
would
rather
die
than
be
dishonored
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
that
is
the
very
reason
why
I
let
you
live
,
"
returned
Moody
,
with
a
dark
smile
of
peculiar
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
Kate
Clarendon
,
—
haughty
,
coquetting
Kate
—
live
to
return
to
your
lover
.
<EOS>
""No
!
<EOS>
if
I
am
disgraced
,
I
never
will
return
alive
!
"
rejoined
the
fair
girl
solemnly
and
firmly
.
<EOS>
"Settle
<EOS>
that
matter
with
yourself
,
then
,
"
said
Moody
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mine
you
shall
be
,
living
or
dead!"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
the
villain
threw
his
arms
boldly
around
the
other
,
and
,
in
spite
of
her
struggles
,
pressed
her
to
his
loathsome
breast
;
while
the
torch
slipped
from
his
hand
,
fell
to
the
ground
,
and
nearly
became
extinguished
by
the
fall
—
casting
dark
,
flitting
shadows
over
the
gloomy
cavern
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
Kate
struggled
violently
,
and
uttered
one
or
two
piercing
screams
;
then
she
suddenly
became
still
,
as
though
she
thought
it
were
vain
to
longer
contend
with
her
evident
destiny
.
<EOS>
Moody
,
surprised
at
her
sudden
quietude
,
drew
back
to
learn
the
cause
,
when
the
click
of
a
pistol
,
with
the
muzzle
pointed
at
his
heart
,
warned
him
,
too
late
,
of
his
own
imprudence
.
<EOS>
Kate
had
disengaged
it
from
his
belt
during
the
souffle
,
and
now
stood
before
him
,
erect
,
with
flashing
eyes
and
dishevelled
hair
,
which
came
streaming
down
around
her
pale
features
,
whereon
was
an
expression
of
deep
resolve
,
not
to
be
mistaken
.
<EOS>
As
Moody
's
dark
,
malignant
eye
met
hers
,
it
involuntarily
quailed
before
that
sublime
gaze
of
wronged
innocence
.
<EOS>
"Villain
,
beware
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
in
a
lofty
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Move
but
a
single
step
toward
me
,
and
your
soul
is
with
its
God
.
<EOS>
""Forbear
!
"
cried
the
cowardly
wretch
,
in
a
deprecating
tone
,
fearful
that
she
might
be
tempted
to
pull
the
trigger
,
on
which
her
delicate
finger
seemed
to
rest
heavily
.
"
<EOS>
Forbear
,
Miss
Clarendon
,
and
you
shall
go
free
.
<EOS>
""Swear
it
!
<EOS>
"
said
Kate
,
solemnly
and
loftily
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
every
thing
that
yields
me
an
existence
,
by
my
hopes
of
salvation
,
I
swear
it
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Moody
.
<EOS>
"See
<EOS>
that
you
break
not
your
oath
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Kate
,
retreating
backward
,
and
still
keeping
the
pistol
elevated
in
the
same
position
.
<EOS>
"
Stand
where
you
are
,
Rashton
Moody
!
<EOS>
advance
a
single
step
,
and
I
fire
.
<EOS>
"Whether
<EOS>
it
was
that
Moody
was
afraid
of
being
deprived
of
his
own
worthless
life
—
or
whether
,
as
is
more
probable
,
he
thought
by
remaining
stationary
something
might
chance
to
his
advantage
in
disarming
his
fair
foe
—
we
do
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
certain
it
is
,
he
remained
fixed
as
a
pillar
,
while
Kate
retreated
,
until
some
fifteen
yards
divided
them
,
<EOS>
when
,
unguarded
as
to
her
course
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
other
,
she
stepped
upon
a
spot
made
slippery
by
the
dripping
water
,
and
the
next
moment
fell
heavily
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
As
she
went
down
,
the
pistol
flew
from
her
hand
several
feet
,
struck
upon
the
rock
,
and
discharged
itself
,
with
a
sound
that
ran
bellowing
to
the
remotest
corner
of
the
cavern
,
and
seemed
the
death
-
knell
of
her
hopes
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
the
pistol
was
succeeded
by
a
laugh
that
seemed
not
earthly
,
and
bounding
forward
,
Moody
stood
erect
over
his
prostrate
and
forlorn
captive
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
,
then
,
I
have
you
again
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
exultingly
.
<EOS>
"
This
time
I
will
be
more
careful
.
<EOS>
""Remember
<EOS>
your
oath
,
"
said
Kate
,
timidly
,
attempting
to
regain
her
feet
.
<EOS>
"Oath
he
d
—
d
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
Moody
,
with
another
frightful
laugh
;
and
again
his
hateful
arms
were
thrown
around
the
half
-
raised
and
trembling
form
of
the
lovely
but
helpless
Kate
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Down
!
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
hoarsely
;
and
at
the
word
he
forced
her
with
violence
back
upon
the
rock
.
"God
<EOS>
save
me
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Kate
,
terrified
nearly
out
of
her
senses
.
<EOS>
"He
ca
n't
do
it
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Moody
,
blasphemously
,
with
a
hellish
grin
of
savage
joy
.
<EOS>
"Liar
!
"
shouted
a
strange
voice
,
that
made
him
start
in
terror
,
and
Kate
scream
with
joy
,
as
a
bright
light
flashed
in
his
face
and
revealed
to
his
astonished
eyes
the
ungainly
,
and
to
him
terrible
,
form
of
the
Necromancer
,
standing
by
his
side
,
torch
in
hand
,
and
looking
downward
upon
him
with
an
awful
scowl
,
his
jaws
working
almost
convulsively
,
and
his
eyelid
quivering
like
the
leaf
of
the
aspen
;
while
several
dim
forms
were
seen
hurrying
toward
him
from
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
and
voices
,
portending
summary
punishment
,
came
to
his
frightened
ears
through
the
arches
of
the
great
cavern
in
hollow
and
unearthly
tones
,
making
his
polluted
soul
almost
shrink
from
its
frail
and
much
abused
tenement
of
clay
.

CHAPTER
<EOS>
XIII.And
<EOS>
when
they
talk
of
him
,
they
shake
their
heads
,
And
whisper
one
another
in
the
ear
;
And
he
that
speaks
doth
gripe
the
hearer
's
wrist
,
And
he
that
hears
makes
fearful
action
,
With
wrinkled
brow
,
with
nods
,
with
rolling
eyes.—Shakspeare
.
<EOS>
We
left
Ernest
Clifton
and
his
companions
,
headed
,
or
rather
led
,
by
David
Grant
,
in
pursuit
of
the
Indians
—
and
to
them
we
must
now
return
.
<EOS>
For
some
eight
or
ten
miles
,
they
pursued
their
course
up
the
Miami
in
silence
,
with
no
event
occurring
worth
being
recorded
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
mist
,
which
we
saw
rising
on
their
departure
,
had
rolled
itself
across
the
plain
,
and
enveloped
them
in
a
cloud
so
dense
,
that
not
a
single
object
about
them
was
visible
.
<EOS>
Still
the
scout
,
who
had
traveled
the
ground
frequently
,
moved
onward
,
and
the
others
,
as
best
they
could
,
followed
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
.
<EOS>
At
length
Ernest
,
who
was
next
to
David
,
struck
his
foot
against
the
half
-
decayed
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
,
and
fell
over
it
—
whereupon
the
whole
party
came
to
a
halt
.
<EOS>
"It
is
useless
to
attempt
further
progress
to
night
,
"
said
the
young
officer
,
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
;
"
for
nothing
can
be
seen
,
and
danger
may
be
in
every
step
we
take
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
you
like
,
lieutenant
,
"
returned
the
scout
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Foolisher
advice
might
be
spoke
;
though
I
'm
not
afeard
to
lead
,
if
you
arn't
to
follow
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
what
good
can
come
of
it
?
"
asked
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"
We
might
come
upon
the
camp
of
the
enemy
before
we
were
aware
of
it
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
<EOS>
truer
—
though
I
reckon
we
'd
stand
as
good
a
chance
as
they
,
"
rejoined
David
.
<EOS>
"What
say
you
,
Danvers
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ernest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
go
further
or
not?""I
would
rather
see
the
path
I
am
following
,
"
answered
the
one
addressed
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
would
I.
Let
us
camp
,
then
,
where
we
are
,
and
take
daylight
for
it
.
<EOS>
""Any
<EOS>
body
see
a
light
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
David
,
suddenly
.
<EOS>
Each
looked
about
him
,
and
several
answered
.
<EOS>
"
No!""There
's
a
sort
o
'
dim
spot
away
to
the
right
,
or
my
eyes
make
it
,
"
said
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
eyes
do
n't
make
it
,
and
that
spot
's
fire
,
"
returned
the
scout
,
laconically
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
now
I
see
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Clifton
while
his
heart
beat
quickly
,
with
the
hope
that
his
beloved
was
near
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
the
camp
-
fire
of
the
savages
.
<EOS>
""May
be
,
"
returned
the
scout
,
"
though
I
reckons
not
.
<EOS>
But
silence
,
and
let
us
diskiver
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
this
,
he
moved
slowly
and
softly
forward
,
carefully
feeling
his
way
as
he
went
,
followed
by
the
others
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
they
reached
the
Miami
,
and
,
as
its
water
was
now
in
a
moderate
stage
,
crossed
it
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
As
they
neared
the
spot
which
had
attracted
their
attention
,
the
pale
,
faint
hue
,
as
first
seen
,
assumed
a
deeper
and
redder
tinge
,
and
convinced
all
that
the
remark
of
the
scout
was
correct
.
<EOS>
Ascending
the
opposite
bank
of
the
Miami
,
they
kept
on
their
course
some
dozen
or
so
of
yards
,
when
they
came
to
a
steep
ascent
,
and
saw
the
light
but
a
short
distance
above
them
.
<EOS>
"Stand
<EOS>
here
,
with
rifles
ready
,
and
move
not
hand
nor
foot
,
while
I
go
for'ard
first
to
make
it
out
,
"
whispered
David
;
and
without
more
ado
,
and
not
even
waiting
a
reply
,
he
turned
aside
from
the
straight
line
,
and
glided
away
,
noiselessly
as
a
spirit
or
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
Some
ten
minutes
of
breathless
suspense
elapsed
,
during
which
each
of
the
party
behind
grasped
his
rifle
tightly
,
and
listened
eagerly
for
the
slightest
sound
to
decide
his
next
movement
.
<EOS>
All
was
fearfully
silent
;
for
silence
is
fearful
,
when
we
look
for
the
first
sound
to
be
one
of
danger
,
calculated
to
drive
the
blood
back
to
the
heart
—
as
when
two
armies
,
facing
each
other
,
are
quietly
preparing
the
first
terrible
volley
of
death
—
and
each
stood
fast
,
motionless
as
marble
,
and
seemed
to
feel
his
hair
fairly
rising
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
At
length
each
started
,
on
hearing
the
voice
of
David
close
at
hand
;
for
not
a
sound
of
his
approach
had
been
audible
.
<EOS>
"Follow
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
whisper
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
'll
show
you
a
curious
sight
.
<EOS>
"Obeying
<EOS>
him
in
silence
,
each
set
forward
up
the
ascent
,
and
presently
gained
the
spot
whence
the
light
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Upon
a
broad
,
flatrock
,
scarcely
elevated
above
the
ground
,
was
a
small
,
bright
fire
,
made
of
dry
sticks
,
by
the
side
of
which
,
with
his
feet
partly
drawn
under
him
,
a
bible
in
his
hand
,
on
which
his
eyes
were
intently
fixed
,
his
long
hair
,
unrestrained
,
flowing
freely
down
the
sides
of
his
coarse
,
rough
features
,
and
over
his
shoulders
,
and
swaying
backward
,
and
forward
as
one
engaged
in
profound
study
—
sat
Blind
Luther
,
the
Necromancer
,
on
whom
each
of
the
party
gazed
,
if
not
with
a
feeling
of
superstition
,
at
least
with
something
very
much
akin
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
the
picture
,
considering
the
principal
figure
and
the
mystery
connected
with
him
,
was
well
calculated
to
produce
this
effect
.
<EOS>
The
light
of
the
flame
,
as
it
flashed
and
crackled
,
formed
a
bright
circle
in
the
dense
fog
,
threw
the
dark
form
of
Luther
into
bold
relief
,
and
lent
a
ruddy
tinge
to
his
harsh
,
but
benevolent
features
—
giving
them
,
at
the
same
time
,
an
appearance
of
rapid
change
in
expression
,
by
its
flickering
shadows
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
or
two
,
Luther
sat
in
silence
—
while
silently
our
party
gazed
upon
him
—
and
then
his
voice
was
heard
reading
from
the
book
in
his
hand:"`Wo
unto
the
wicked!—it
shall
be
ill
with
him
;
for
the
reward
of
his
hands
shall
be
given
him
.
<EOS>
'"Even
<EOS>
so
,
"
he
continued
,
closing
the
book
:
"
<EOS>
Even
so
shall
it
be
:
therefore
let
them
that
are
<EOS>
evil
doers
take
heed
unto
their
ways
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
ceased
,
and
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
meet
strangely
again
,
"
said
Clifton
,
stepping
forward
into
the
circle
of
light
,
and
tapping
the
shoulder
of
Luther
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Luther
raised
his
head
,
without
any
apparent
surprise
,
and
frankly
extending
his
large
,
dark
hand
to
the
other
,
replied:"I
am
glad
to
behold
thee
,
young
man
,
safe
where
thou
art
;
for
a
narrow
chance
hast
thou
had
,
in
thy
morning
of
life
,
of
escaping
that
yawning
gulf
which
awaits
us
all
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
you
remember
,
we
should
meet
again,"When
dark
storms
should
round
us
lower
,
Or
bright
sunshine
puled
the
hour
.
<EOS>
We
meet
,
however
,
in
the
former
—
in
the
stormy
hour
of
fate
—
though
I
trust
thy
sun
of
life
may
not
set
behind
a
cloud
.
<EOS>
""God
<EOS>
send
it
may
not
!
"
rejoined
Clifton
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"I
perceive
<EOS>
you
are
wounded
,
"
pursued
Luther
,
pointing
to
the
head
of
the
other
:
"
I
hope
not
severely
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
<EOS>
alarming
,
I
think
—
though
it
does
pain
me
a
little
,
"
answered
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"A
narrow
escape
,
indeed
,
"
rejoined
Luther
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
moment
on
which
your
life
hung
suspended
by
a
thread
.
<EOS>
It
is
over
,
and
yet
your
life
is
still
in
danger
.
<EOS>
""What
mean
you
?
"
asked
our
hero
,
in
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
"God
is
great
,
"
replied
the
Necromaneer
,
solemnly
,
"
and
orders
all
things
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
When
He
made
the
stupendous
work
of
creation
,
and
set
the
great
wheels
in
motion
,
He
made
laws
to
govern
each
and
every
part
;
and
into
man
's
hand
gave
the
power
of
reading
those
laws
to
the
benefit
of
himself
and
the
glorification
of
his
Maker
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
man
telleth
the
time
of
the
seasons
,
and
looketh
for
heat
and
for
cold
,
and
knoweth
the
motion
of
the
planets
,
the
moments
of
their
revolving
,
and
the
years
of
their
cycle
;
and
the
laws
which
extend
to
them
,
do
also
unto
all
created
things
;
so
that
the
pebble
which
rolls
on
the
beach
by
the
wash
of
the
tide
,
and
the
volcano
which
belcheth
fire
and
causeth
earth
to
groan
in
her
bowels
,
are
alike
governed
by
the
fixed
and
eternal
laws
of
the
universe
;
<EOS>
therefore
,
let
not
thy
too
hastily
formed
prejudice
condemn
the
truth
,
that
the
being
and
deeds
of
man
are
overruled
by
the
same
laws
,
which
by
knowledge
he
may
read
and
understand
,
but
not
alter
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
comprehend
you
rightly
,
you
are
alluding
to
astrology
?
"
<EOS>
observed
Clifton
,
interrogatively
.
<EOS>
"Call
it
by
what
name
<EOS>
you
will
,
it
is
the
tongue
of
Heaven
,
whereby
is
spoken
the
destiny
of
nations
and
individuals
.
<EOS>
Here
,
"
and
the
Necromancer
,
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
knapsack
,
drew
forth
a
roll
of
parchment
:
"
<EOS>
Here
is
thy
past
and
future
course
,
signed
and
sealed
;
and
that
of
her
thou
lovest
best
,
and
that
of
him
thou
hatest
most
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
speak
,
for
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>
if
you
know
aught
,
and
tell
me
what
of
her
!
"
cried
Ernest
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"She
is
safe
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
be
praised
!
<EOS>
Can
you
lead
me
to
her?""I
can
,
but
not
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""O
,
yes
—
to
-
night
—
delay
not
a
moment!"By
this
time
the
party
without
,
eager
to
catch
every
look
and
tone
,
had
leaned
their
heads
forward
into
the
circle
of
light
,
while
their
bodies
remaining
concealed
entirely
,
or
showing
only
a
faint
outline
,
gave
them
the
supernatural
appearance
of
specters
,
or
spirits
,
peering
through
a
cloud
,
as
we
sometimes
see
them
represented
on
canvass
.
<EOS>
Without
making
a
direct
reply
,
Luther
pointed
around
the
circle
,
and
observed:"We
are
not
alone
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
fear
,
"
said
Ernest
;
"
they
are
all
friends
.
<EOS>
""Fear
,
Ernest
Clifton
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
"
and
he
raised
his
hand
majestically
above
his
head
,
and
with
his
fore
-
finger
pointed
upward
,
while
he
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
in
a
voice
of
great
and
impressive
solemnity
,
"
there
is
but
One
to
fear
—
fear
Him
always
,
and
Him
only
!
<EOS>
But
see
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
;
"
I
told
thee
thy
destiny
was
written
here
;
"
and
he
pointed
to
the
scroll
in
his
hand
,
which
was
covered
with
figures
,
letters
and
characters
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
thy
horoscope
—
cast
many
years
ago
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
did
you
know
me
<EOS>
then?""Ay
,
before
your
knew
yourself
.
"Heavens
!
<EOS>
explain!""Not
now
;
another
time
and
place
must
serve
me
.
<EOS>
But
you
spoke
of
her
you
love
.
<EOS>
""I
did
.
<EOS>
O
,
tell
me
where
to
find
her
,
and
if
she
be
living
and
safe!""For
to
-
night
<EOS>
she
is
safe
—
tomorrow
I
will
lead
thee
to
her
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
she
a
prisoner?""She
is
;
but
ask
me
no
more
,
for
I
am
done
.
<EOS>
To
camp
!
<EOS>
to
camp
,
all
!
<EOS>
and
be
ready
for
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
will
stand
sentinel
.
<EOS>
Yet
stay
,
Ernest
,
"
added
the
Necromancer
,
as
the
latter
turned
away
;
"
I
must
look
to
your
wound
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
a
suitable
spot
close
at
hand
,
in
this
direction
,
"
he
said
to
the
others
,
pointing
with
his
finger
;
and
as
they
departed
,
he
rose
,
and
removing
the
bandage
from
the
head
of
Clifton
,
proceeded
to
examine
his
wound
attentively
.
<EOS>
Then
taking
a
vial
from
his
knapsack
,
he
wet
the
cloth
with
the
liquid
contained
therein
,
and
rubbed
the
wound
with
it
.
<EOS>
"It
will
trouble
you
but
very
little
after
this
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
carefully
replaced
the
bandage
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
my
young
friend
,
join
your
companions
and
get
what
rest
you
may
.
<EOS>
"Ernest
would
fain
have
questioned
further
,
relative
to
her
he
loved
;
but
waving
his
hand
peremptorily
,
Blind
Luther
turned
his
back
upon
him
,
in
a
manner
to
cut
off
all
conversation
;
and
thinking
it
prudent
not
to
press
the
matter
too
much
,
he
moved
away
and
joined
his
com
panions
,
who
had
already
selected
their
place
of
encampment
,
and
started
a
fire
in
its
center
.
<EOS>
Casting
himself
upon
the
earth
,
in
a
fit
of
gloomy
abstraction
,
our
hero
sat
some
two
or
three
hours
,
watching
the
bright
flame
as
it
eagerly
devoured
the
dry
fuel
which
fed
it
.
<EOS>
During
this
time
,
one
after
another
of
the
party
gradually
fell
into
slumber
,
until
he
alone
remained
awake
.
<EOS>
Turning
his
eyes
toward
the
fire
of
Luther
,
he
could
just
perceive
the
dim
outline
of
that
mysterious
being
,
seated
upon
the
rock
,
his
elbows
resting
upon
his
nether
limbs
,
his
face
upon
his
hands
,
and
apparently
asleep
.
<EOS>
Gazing
upon
him
for
a
while
,
during
which
a
thousand
vague
thoughts
and
conjectures
passed
through
his
mind
,
as
to
who
or
what
he
was
,
what
he
knew
of
his
own
history
,
how
he
knew
,
and
what
he
knew
regarding
her
he
loved
—
he
at
last
felt
his
eyes
grow
heavy
—
strange
objects
,
of
which
he
was
in
chase
,
flitted
before
his
mind
's
vision
—
he
swayed
from
side
to
side
—
nodded
and
partly
awoke
—
saw
the
light
of
the
fire
dimly
—
nodded
a
few
times
more
—
and
then
all
became
dark
,
indistinct
and
confused
,
and
he
rolled
over
upon
the
earth
and
slept
.
<EOS>
"Up
,
and
to
thy
journey
!
"
said
a
deep
voice
that
started
Clifton
from
his
slumbers
;
and
springing
to
his
feet
,
he
found
Blind
Luther
and
the
rest
of
his
companions
ready
to
depart
.
<EOS>
It
was
already
broad
daylight
,
though
the
sun
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
,
owing
to
the
dense
fog
which
still
clouded
the
earth
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
a
brighter
spot
in
the
east
than
elsewhere
,
from
which
the
mist
seemed
hurrying
rapidly
,
and
rolling
and
tumbling
from
side
to
side
,
as
if
eager
to
escape
from
the
god
of
day
,
whose
sharp
,
hot
rays
were
troubling
severely
its
outer
borders
.
"Eat
!
"
<EOS>
said
Luther
,
emphatieally
,
to
Ernest
,
proffering
him
some
jerk
,
roots
and
fruit
,
his
own
humble
fare
.
<EOS>
Ernest
partook
lightly
of
the
first
,
but
declined
the
others
;
and
the
rest
having
eaten
previously
,
the
party
prepared
to
set
forward
under
the
guidance
of
Luther
.
<EOS>
"'Spect
<EOS>
I
'm
no
more
needed
?
"
said
David
Grant
,
in
a
dissatisfied
tone
;
for
he
was
anxious
to
make
a
display
of
his
powers
as
a
scout
in
trailing
the
foe
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
may
as
well
keep
us
company
,
at
all
events
,
"
said
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"Your
services
may
be
needed
,
"
observed
Luther
.
<EOS>
David
made
no
reply
,
and
the
party
set
forward
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
descending
to
the
valley
,
the
Necromancer
shaped
his
course
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
,
along
which
he
moved
in
silence
with
rapid
strides
,
followed
by
the
others
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
Here
the
fog
had
already
begun
to
disappear
,
and
presently
the
sun
broke
through
,
bright
and
glorious
.
<EOS>
Then
,
like
some
mighty
avalanche
,
the
mist
was
seen
rolling
down
toward
the
plain
,
over
which
it
lay
like
a
white
shroud
,
occasionally
diversified
and
rendered
doubly
interesting
by
a
beautiful
rainbow
set
on
its
brow
,
as
it
were
a
beacon
of
hope
.
<EOS>
Gradually
it
began
to
drive
and
writhe
and
scatter
,
under
the
influence
of
the
sun
and
the
morning
breeze
,
and
then
first
one
tree
and
another
began
to
show
its
leafy
top
,
as
if
rising
from
a
beautiful
lake
,
until
at
last
the
whole
vapor
was
swept
away
,
and
a
scene
resplendant
in
beauty
broke
upon
the
eye
.
<EOS>
Clifton
,
who
had
watched
it
intently
as
he
proceeded
on
his
jour
ney
,
felt
his
spirits
revive
to
a
wonderful
degree
,
while
something
within
seemed
to
say:"Behold
in
this
a
happy
angury
!
<EOS>
As
the
night
and
the
morning
,
so
has
thy
soul
been
shrouded
in
a
vapor
of
gloom
,
through
which
no
eye
could
penetrate
to
see
what
lay
beyond
.
<EOS>
As
the
mist
has
vanished
before
the
god
of
day
,
so
shall
thy
troubles
vanish
before
the
bright
star
of
thy
destiny
;
and
thy
path
shall
lead
down
to
the
grave
,
smooth
,
bright
and
unclouded
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
a
time
Clifton
was
buoyed
up
with
this
feeling
,
and
then
he
became
dejected
and
sad
;
for
he
remembered
that
she
he
loved
was
yet
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
day
,
Blind
Luther
said
little
to
any
—
his
mind
seemingly
absorbed
by
some
gloomy
meditation
.
<EOS>
When
questioned
as
to
his
course
,
he
ever
replied
that
all
was
right
.
<EOS>
About
noon
,
a
fine
buck
was
killed
,
and
the
party
halted
for
refreshment
.
<EOS>
After
a
delay
of
some
two
hours
,
they
resumed
their
journey
,
much
invigorated
.
<EOS>
Now
whether
it
was
that
Luther
had
made
a
mistake
in
regard
to
the
exact
location
of
the
cave
where
Kate
Clarendon
was
confined
—
or
whether
he
desired
,
for
somereasons
of
his
own
,
to
delay
their
arrival
to
a
given
time
—
does
not
appear
;
but
certain
it
is
,
that
though
the
cave
did
not
exceed
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
from
where
the
party
set
out
in
the
morning
,
and
though
all
traveled
hard
throughout
the
day
,
with
the
exception
of
the
delay
spoken
of
—
yet
,
from
one
reason
or
another
,
they
did
not
reach
their
journey
's
end
till
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
had
disappeared
from
the
highest
peak
of
the
eastern
ridge
.
<EOS>
"We
are
here
at
last
,
"
said
Luther
,
leaping
across
the
chasm
to
the
platform
,
over
which
,
Moody
had
passed
but
a
short
time
before
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Follow
me
,
"
he
continued
,
"
and
carefully
descend
,
or
you
will
descend
to
rise
no
more
forever
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
this
,
he
approached
the
side
next
the
stream
,
when
two
or
three
prolonged
screams
,
seemingly
issuing
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
,
greatly
accelerated
his
movements
,
and
nearly
cost
some
of
his
followers
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Hurrying
down
the
rugged
and
perilous
path
before
him
,
Luther
soon
reached
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
,
where
he
halted
a
moment
to
guide
Clifton
,
who
came
next
,
in
the
proper
direction
,
and
caution
him
to
look
to
his
weapons
.
<EOS>
He
then
set
forward
again
rapidly
,
and
,
just
as
he
reached
the
termination
of
the
passage
,
heard
the
discharge
of
a
pistol
,
and
saw
a
dark
object
flit
before
his
eyes
,
and
pause
over
something
white
lying
on
the
rock
.
<EOS>
The
torch
he
perceived
but
a
few
paces
distant
,
and
aware
of
the
value
of
light
in
a
case
of
such
emergency
he
instantly
sprang
to
this
,
and
thence
to
the
rescue
of
Kate
Clarendon
,
at
a
point
of
time
so
all
important
to
her
as
we
have
shown
in
the
preceding
chapter
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XIV.Thank
God

<EOS>

<EOS>
What
mystery
is
this

that
makes
mine

Grow
full
and
large
with
wonderment

<EOS>
In

Am
I

<EOS>

<EOS>
Go

<EOS>
and
be

Forth

<EOS>
Go
!
<EOS>
go
!
<EOS>

loathe

feel
a
nervous
itching
In

"Liar
!
"
again
shouted
Luther
,
raising
his
tremendous
frame
to
its
full
height
,
and
looking
ferociously
down
upon
Moody
,
who
stood
trembling
like
a
timid
culprit
before
his
august
judge
:
"
Liar
and
coward
!
<EOS>
how
durst
thou
so
blaspheme
,
as
to
say
the
Almighty
could
not
save
yonder
dove
from
thy
buzzard
claws
?
<EOS>
Down
with
ye
to
repentance
!
"
and
with
the
back
of
his
hand
,
Luther
struck
Moody
a
blow
in
the
face
,
that
started
forth
a
stream
of
blood
,
and
sent
him
reeling
backward
upon
the
rock
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
she
alive
<EOS>
—
is
she
safe?—great
God
!
<EOS>
is
she
safe
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
voice
of
Clifton
at
this
moment
coming
up
,
followed
closely
by
his
companions
.
<EOS>
"Ernest
,
"
screamed
Kate
,
wildly
,
and
she
attempted
to
rise
;
but
overcome
with
emotions
of
joy
,
she
failed
,
and
sank
back
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
that
voice
—
that
voice
!
"
<EOS>
almost
shrieked
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"
My
God
,
I
thank
thee
!
<EOS>
Kate
,
Kate!—my
dearest
,
darling
Kate
!
"
and
the
next
moment
he
was
by
her
side
,
and
his
lips
were
glued
to
hers
,
in
the
holy
kiss
of
love
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kate
,
"
he
continued
,
raising
her
up
to
a
sitting
posture
"
Kate
,
are
you
safe
and
well?"Kate
could
not
speak
for
joy
;
but
she
nodded
in
the
affirmative
,
and
then
her
head
sunk
against
his
breast
,
and
she
wept
freely
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
happiest
moment
of
my
life
,
"
marmured
Clifton
,
pressing
her
close
to
his
heart
—
a
noble
and
true
heart
,
that
beat
only
for
her
,
and
would
do
so
until
it
ceased
to
beat
forever
.
<EOS>
The
balance
of
the
party
had
by
this
time
come
up
and
gathered
around
the
lovers
in
joyful
silence
,
their
faces
expressive
of
the
satisfaction
they
felt
on
seeing
them
meet
again
so
happily
.
<EOS>
Luther
stood
a
little
apart
,
with
folded
arms
and
stern
countenance
,
apparently
engaged
in
deep
thought
of
a
nature
not
pleasing
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
thank
my
deliverers
,
as
well
as
you
,
dear
Ernest
,
"
whispered
Kate
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
"Ay
<EOS>
,
do
,
dearest
;
and
first
,
here
,
"
and
Ernest
pointed
to
the
tall
,
athletic
form
of
the
Necromancer
,
who
—
standing
,
as
we
have
said
,
with
folded
arms
,
from
one
hand
of
which
projected
the
burning
torch
,
its
flickering
light
casting
a
ruddy
glow
upon
his
harsh
features
—
seemed
the
personification
of
some
prophet
of
old
,
about
to
utter
words
that
should
cause
a
world
to
tremble
.
<EOS>
As
Kate
advanced
toward
him
,
he
suddenly
turned
in
an
opposite
direction
,
and
exclaimed:"Beware
,
villain
—
you
have
done
enough!"This
was
addressed
to
Moody
,
who
,
having
been
left
unnoticed
by
all
save
Luther
,
had
regained
his
feet
,
and
drawn
his
knife
,
preparatory
to
executing
some
diabolical
act
;
but
the
words
and
manner
of
Luther
arrested
and
caused
him
to
shrink
back
in
dismay
.
<EOS>
"By
heavens
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ernest
,
springing
forward
,
"
in
the
excess
of
my
joy
<EOS>
I
had
forgotten
<EOS>
there
was
a
renegade
villain
to
punish
;
"
and
drawing
his
sword
<EOS>
,
he
was
rushing
upon
his
antagonist
,
when
Luther
grasped
him
by
the
arm
,
and
exclaimed:"Hold
,
Ernest
,
it
is
not
for
thee
—
`
Vengeance
is
mine
,
saith
the
Lord
,
and
I
will
repay
.
'
"
<EOS>
"
It
's
for
me
,
then
,
"
cried
Ichabod
,
who
had
been
waiting
an
opportunity
to
greet
his
pet
,
and
who
now
remembered
his
words
to
Clifton
,
on
the
death
of
Clarendon
:
"
It
's
for
me
,
for
I
've
sworn
to
kill
him
whenever
I
found
him
;
"
and
before
any
one
could
interfere
,
he
bounded
toward
Moody
,
who
,
sullen
and
ferocious
as
a
wild
beast
at
bay
,
now
turned
upon
him
a
look
of
scorn
,
as
if
he
considered
him
beneath
his
notice
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
however
,
mistaken
the
character
of
Ichabod
entirely
,
as
he
soon
found
to
his
cost
;
for
the
next
moment
a
bright
light
flashed
in
his
eyes
,
and
the
crack
of
a
pistol
was
heard
echoing
through
the
cavern
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
I
am
shot
,
"
exclaimed
Moody
,
gnashing
his
teeth
in
fury
,
and
placing
his
hand
to
his
shoulder
,
from
which
a
stream
of
blood
could
now
be
seen
trickling
down
over
his
garments
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
yet
live
to
be
revenged
,
"
he
cried
;
and
at
the
same
moment
he
made
a
step
forward
,
and
drew
from
his
belt
his
undischarged
pistol
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
use
it
,
however
,
the
hand
of
Luther
was
upon
his
throat
,
and
the
pistol
wrenched
from
his
hand
and
sent
bounding
upon
the
rock
to
the
furthermost
part
of
the
cave
.
<EOS>
His
knife
and
tomahawk
shared
the
same
fate
,
and
Moody
stood
trembling
and
unarmed
,
while
the
rest
looked
on
in
silence
.
"Wretch
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Luther
,
raising
himself
to
his
full
height
,
and
casting
upon
Moody
a
look
of
scorn
:
"
<EOS>
Wretch
!
<EOS>
I
am
tempted
to
crush
thee
where
thou
standest
,
for
thy
villiany
and
blasphemy
;
but
I
spare
thee
now
,
and
now
only
.
<EOS>
Remember
—
remember!""Nay
,
"
interposed
Clifton
,
"
<EOS>
why
spare
him
for
other
deeds
of
villiany
?
<EOS>
Is
not
his
base
life
already
forfeited!""Ernest
Clifton
,
methinks
I
have
rendered
thee
and
thine
some
service
,
"
answered
Luther
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
—
you
have
,
sir
—
beyond
our
power
to
repay
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Clifton
,
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
perhaps
I
am
not
wrong
in
asking
a
boon?""Anything
in
my
power
to
grant
,
or
that
of
my
comrades
,
I
pledge
you
my
honor
you
shall
have
.
<EOS>
""Enough
!
'
<EOS>
tis
here
;
"
and
Luther
tapped
Moody
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
I
ask
his
life
,
to
do
with
him
as
I
may
see
proper
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
say
you
,
comrades
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Clifton
,
appealing
to
the
others
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
demurring
,
but
all
at
length
consented
to
the
request
of
Luther
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Moody
,
the
latter
said:"Villian
,
beware
,
nor
further
go
,
Or
thine
shall
be
a
doom
of
woe!From
<EOS>
all
thy
former
thoughts
relent
,
For
all
thy
deeds
how
down
,
repent
,
And
show
all
here
a
contrite
heart
,
Or
thou
and
I
<EOS>
must
ever
part
:
<EOS>
And
should
I
leave
thee
,
thou
shalt
feelDeath
and
the
Fates
have
set
their
seal
.
<EOS>
"I
await
thy
answer
,
"
added
Luther
,
in
conclusion
.
<EOS>
"Set
<EOS>
me
free
,
is
all
I
ask
,
"
growled
Moody
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
thou
wilt
seek
my
aid
no
more
!
"
returned
Luther
.
<EOS>
"I
never
did
seek
it
,
"
grumbled
Moody
;
"
and
once
free
again
,
I
will
ask
no
odds
of
any
.
<EOS>
""Be
it
so
!
"
rejoined
Luther
,
musingly
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
stay
,
"
he
added
,
laying
hold
of
Moody
as
he
turned
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
ever
loth
to
yield
up
human
nature
to
the
foul
fiend
—
the
arch
-
enemy
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
One
trial
more
,
and
perhaps
thou
wilt
repent
and
be
reclaimed
—
if
not
,
farewell
forever!Then
pausing
for
a
few
moments
,
as
if
to
collect
his
thoughts
,
he
resumed
,
in
a
grave
voice:"A
stream
there
was
,
which
long
had
rolledIts
waters
over
sands
of
gold
,
And
in
the
sportive
sunbeams
played
,
And
wantoned
in
the
pleasant
shade
—
As
full
of
active
life
and
glee
<EOS>
,
It
bent
its
course
toward
the
sea
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
stream
received
a
shock
,
Its
waters
parted
on
a
rock
,
And
so
divided
there
by
force
<EOS>
,
Each
arm
sought
out
another
course;And
miles
they
ran
o'er
sterile
ground
,
Ere
either
branch
the
other
found;At
last
they
met
,
yet
little
knewThat
from
the
self
-
same
source
they
grew
.
<EOS>
"The
stream
,
"
continued
the
Necromancer
,
looking
alternately
at
Moody
and
Clifton
,
and
addressing
himself
to
both
,
"
is
typical
of
your
ancestors
;
the
rock
is
a
quarrel
,
by
which
they
became
estranged
—
the
meeting
of
the
waters
,
the
meeting
of
the
brothers
,
the
last
of
a
noble
line
.
<EOS>
""Good
<EOS>
Heavens
!
"
exclaimed
Clifton
,
as
some
strange
thoughts
flashed
through
his
mind
;
"
<EOS>
what
do
these
words
import?""That
Ernest
Clifton
and
Rashton
Moody
are
twin
brothers
.
<EOS>
""'Tis
false
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Moody
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
some
trick
—
some
device!""The
proof
is
under
the
left
arm
of
each
,
"
returned
Luther
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Look
there
,
and
you
will
find
my
words
have
not
been
lies
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>
examination
was
instantly
made
,
and
the
result
verified
the
words
of
Luther
;
for
under
the
left
arm
of
each
was
found
,
faintly
traced
in
blue
lines
,
a
coat
of
arms
,
which
being
compared
one
with
the
other
,
proved
to
be
exactly
alike
.
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
surprise
and
astonishment
now
ran
around
the
excited
group
,
while
Kate
elasped
her
hands
together
in
a
kind
of
dreamy
bewilderment
.
<EOS>
"This
is
very
strange
—
very
strange
!
"
said
Clifton
,
fixing
his
eyes
steadily
upon
Luther
.
"
<EOS>
And
pray
,
sir
,
who
are
you?""A
man
that
is
born
of
woman
,
whose
days
are
short
and
full
of
trouble
,
"
answered
Luther
,
waving
his
hand
in
his
usually
majestic
manner
,
and
turning
his
eyes
from
Clifton
to
Moody
,
who
stood
grating
his
teeth
,
with
an
angry
frown
upon
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
he
is
my
brother
,
then
?
"
pursued
Clifton
,
musingly
,
turning
also
toward
Moody
.
<EOS>
"Brother
<EOS>
be
d
—
d
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Moody
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
,
I
'll
live
to
triumph
over
you
yet
,
Mr.
Clifton
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
"
interposed
Luther
,
sternly
,
approaching
and
laying
his
hand
upon
Moody
:
"
Nay
,
be
not
too
fast
!
<EOS>
I
was
wrong
to
think
that
he
who
could
so
act
the
villian
and
miscreant
,
had
any
right
to
the
ties
of
kindred
and
home
.
<EOS>
His
sentence
rests
with
me
,
does
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
appealing
to
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"It
does
—
it
does
,
"
cried
all
.
<EOS>
"Hear
me
then
,
"
rejoined
Luther
,
raising
his
hands
in
a
menacing
attitude
.
"
<EOS>
`
As
ye
sow
,
so
shall
ye
reap
.
<EOS>
'
<EOS>
I
banish
thee
,
Albert
Bel
lington
—
alias
,
Rashton
Moody
—
forever
from
among
the
race
of
civilized
men
.
<EOS>
I
curse
and
send
thee
forth
,
a
murderer
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
—
a
companion
for
the
savage
and
wild
beast
—
never
to
hear
the
sweet
voice
of
sympathy
more
!
<EOS>
All
trace
that
thou
wert
nobly
born
is
hereby
removed
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Luther
spoke
,
he
took
from
his
knapsack
some
thongs
of
deerskin
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
resistance
of
Moody
,
bound
him
fast
,
hand
and
foot
.
<EOS>
Then
casting
him
upon
his
side
,
he
drew
his
knife
,
and
deliberately
cut
the
tattooed
skin
from
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"Now
go
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
releasing
him
:
<EOS>
"
Go

<EOS>
be
a
murderer
and
mendicant
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
,
and
let
the
knowledge
of
thy
crimes
,
of
what
thou
hast
lost
,
and
thy
guilty
conscience
be
thy
punishment
!
<EOS>
Cross
never
my
path
again
—
or
I
will
deliver
thee
up
to
justice

<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
Henceforth
<EOS>
I
know
thee
no
more
—
no
more
!
"
<EOS>
and
waving
his
hand
,
he
turned
away
his
face
,
as
if
to
shut
the
other
from
his
sight
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Moody
stood
like
a
goaded
tiger
,
gnashing
his
teeth
in
fury
;
then
muttering
,
"
I
will
yet
be
revenged
!
"
<EOS>
he
darted
swiftly
away
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
will
trouble
us
again
,
I
fear
,
"
said
Danvers
.
<EOS>
"Then
the
consequences
rest
with
himself
,
"
rejoined
Luther
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
,
and
shall
not
interfere
again
between
him
and
justice
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
are
you
,
mysterious
being
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Ernest
,
approaching
Luther
;
"
and
whence
come
you
?
<EOS>
I
am
all
amazement
.
<EOS>
"Luther
<EOS>
drew
his
tall
,
ungainly
person
up
to
its
full
height
,
and
quietly
folding
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
replied:"Go
and
ask
the
stars
above
,
Why
their
hours
are
meet
for
love
—
Go
and
ask
the
moon
so
bright
<EOS>
,
Why
she
silvers
o'er
the
night
—
Go
and
ask
the
sun
on
high
<EOS>
,
Why
his
glories
fill
the
sky
—
If
they
answer
,
so
will
I."Like
vain
,
presumptious
mortals
,
"
continued
Luther
,
you
seek
to
know
too
much
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
I
am
,
or
whence
<EOS>
I
came
,
<EOS>
What
my
purpose
,
or
my
name
,
Matters
are
which
Fates
have
sealed
,
Not
by
me
to
be
revealed
.
<EOS>
When
the
eighth
moon
is
in
wane
,
And
the
earth
is
green
again
,
If
among
the
living
then
,
Thou
shalt
happiest
be
of
men
—
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
clasp
her
by
thy
side
,
<EOS>
Truly
thine
,
thy
wedded
bride
<EOS>
;
Then
,
I
charge
thee
,
not
before
,
Open
this
,
thou
shalt
know
more!"As
<EOS>
he
concluded
,
Luther
placed
in
the
hands
of
Ernest
a
small
silver
box
,
on
which
were
wrought
some
strange
characters
.
<EOS>
"This
is
all
very
mysterious
,
"
said
Clifton
,
gazing
first
at
the
box
,
and
then
at
the
donor
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
comprehend
it
.
<EOS>
""It
is
like
a
beautiful
dream
,
"
whispered
Kate
,
stealing
up
to
the
side
of
Ernest
,
and
laying
her
soft
,
white
hand
on
his
arm
,
with
a
look
of
affection
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
—
"
She
was
about
to
continue
her
remarks
,
but
stopped
suddenly
,
uttered
a
frightful
scream
,
and
threw
herself
in
front
of
Ernest
,
as
if
to
shield
him
from
danger
.
<EOS>
Each
started
,
and
looked
for
the
cause
of
her
alarm
,
when
crack
went
a
pistol
just
in
front
of
Clifton
,
the
ball
of
which
slightly
grazed
his
cheek
.
<EOS>
"Perdition
<EOS>
seize
ye
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
voice
of
Moody
,
hoarse
with
passion
;
and
at
the
same
moment
his
form
was
seen
disappearing
thro
'
the
narrow
passage
leading
out
of
the
cave
.
<EOS>
On
his
former
retreat
,
he
had
found
the
pistol
discharged
by
Kate
,
had
loaded
it
,
and
returned
to
take
his
last
revenge
.
<EOS>
"I
'
spected
as
much
,
"
said
Ichabod
,
snatching
up
a
rifle
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
failed
afore
,
it
's
no
sign
I
will
this
time
;
"
and
he
darted
away
in
pursuit
of
Moody
,
followed
by
most
of
the
others
,
Clifton
himself
remaining
by
the
side
of
Kate
.
<EOS>
A
short
silence
succeeded
the
tramping
of
feet
on
the
floor
of
the
cavern
,
and
then
came
the
report
of
a
rifle
.
<EOS>
Presently
Danvers
joined
the
party
in
the
cave
.
<EOS>
"Well
?
"
said
Clifton
,
addressing
him
as
he
entered
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
will
never
trouble
us
again
,
I
think
,
"
answered
Danvers
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
he
dead
?
"
asked
Ernest
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"It
is
hard
to
say
;
but
hear
and
judge
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
reached
the
rock
arching
the
stream
,
and
was
turning
to
ascend
the
rocky
bank
,
when
Ichabod
,
with
a
hasty
aim
,
fired
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
Moody
paused
,
balanced
in
the
air
,
and
then
,
with
a
horrible
yell
,
disappeared
over
the
verge
of
the
abyss
.
<EOS>
A
dull
,
hollow
sound
came
up
from
below
,
and
then
all
was
still
.
<EOS>
"A
brief
silence
succeeded
this
announcement
,
when
Ernest
said
,
solemnly:"So
perish
the
wicked
.
<EOS>
""Amen
!
<EOS>
"
responded
a
deep
,
heavy
voice
,
that
seemed
to
descend
from
the
ceiling
of
the
cave
.
<EOS>
Clifton
and
his
companions
started
,
and
looked
upward
,
but
saw
nothing
save
the
bare
rock
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
where
is
Luther
?
"
exclaimed
Kate
,
at
this
moment
,
looking
round
her
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Heavens
!
<EOS>
he
has
disappeared
again
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Clifton
,
pointing
to
the
burning
torch
,
one
end
of
which
was
sticking
fast
in
a
crevice
of
the
rock
:
"
<EOS>
I
could
have
sworn
he
was
standing
here
when
I
spoke
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
so
could
I
,
"
returned
Kate
,
shuddering
,
and
pressing
closer
to
the
side
of
Clifton
,
who
threw
his
arms
around
her
slender
form
,
and
drew
her
to
his
heart
,
with
all
the
fond
affection
of
an
ardent
lover
.
<EOS>
"Never
<EOS>
fear
,
sweet
one
<EOS>
,
"
he
whispered
,
bending
down
and
stealing
a
kiss
:
"
whatever
he
may
be
in
reality
,
he
seems
a
being
ordained
by
Heaven
to
stand
between
thee
and
harm
;
and
for
that
I
bless
him
now
and
ever
will
hereafter
.
<EOS>
"Great
<EOS>
was
the
wonder
and
excitement
of
the
rest
of
the
party
,
when
,
returning
into
the
cave
,
they
were
informed
of
the
sudden
and
mysterious
disappearance
of
Luther
;
for
none
had
seen
him
,
and
all
were
willing
to
swear
he
had
not
passed
out
the
way
he
entered
.
<EOS>
Ichabod
declared
,
however
,
that
the
smoke
of
his
rifle
,
when
he
fired
at
Moody
,
had
assumed
a
terrible
shape
;
and
now
he
remembered
it
strangely
resembled
the
Necromancer
;
though
how
the
smoke
and
that
singular
personage
could
be
in
any
wise
alike
,
or
connected
,
exceeded
his
comprehension
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
now
became
a
matter
of
grave
discussion
;
some
declaring
that
Luther
was
an
evil
spirit
,
whose
term
on
earth
expired
with
the
death
of
Moody
;
and
others
,
among
whom
were
Clifton
and
Kate
,
contending
that
both
were
bona
fide
beings
of
flesh
and
blood
,
though
the
former
was
a
very
strange
character
,
whom
they
could
not
comprehend
.
<EOS>
One
observation
brought
another
,
and
the
discussion
seemed
likely
to
be
protracted
all
night
,
when
Clifton
ordered
a
sentinel
to
be
stationed
in
the
passage
before
spoken
of
,
and
the
rest
to
retire
to
rest
,
that
they
might
be
prepared
for
their
return
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
What
took
place
during
the
night
we
shall
now
proceed
to
relate
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER

,
gloomy

of

But

Thereat

And

did

Nor

that
same
sight
,
Nor
what

,
nor
what
to
do
at
all.—Spenser

<EOS>
Aghast
he

,
Stiffened
with
fear.—Somerville
.
<EOS>
The
account
given
by
Danvers
,
of
the
disappearance
of
Moody
,
was
correct
;
but
his
conjecture
that
he
had
been
wounded
by
the
last
fire
of
Ichabod
was
not
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
when
Moody
rushed
out
of
the
cave
,
followed
by
those
who
sought
his
life
,
objects
at
a
short
distance
had
become
indistinct
,
in
the
dark
grey
twilight
which
had
already
settled
over
the
earth
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
,
the
gardener
missed
his
mark
;
but
the
report
of
the
rifle
,
and
the
whizzing
of
its
ball
within
an
inch
of
his
head
,
caused
Moody
to
start
suddenly
,
when
his
foot
slipped
,
his
balance
was
lost
,
and
he
plunged
down
the
chasm
,
with
a
horrible
yell
,
expecting
of
course
to
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
below
.
<EOS>
A
deep
pool
of
water
,
which
had
been
hollowed
out
by
the
fall
of
a
cascade
,
saved
him
.
<EOS>
Into
this
he
fell
with
a
force
that
for
a
moment
stunned
and
confused
him
;
but
quickly
regaining
his
senses
,
he
struck
out
boldly
,
and
succeeded
in
crawling
upon
a
rock
,
that
formed
a
partial
barrier
to
the
outlet
of
the
pool
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
not
affected
without
difficulty
and
repeated
trials
;
for
the
spray
from
the
cascade
,
that
tumbled
over
a
precipice
a
short
distance
behind
him
,
had
coated
the
rock
with
a
slimy
substance
,
and
made
it
slippery
as
an
iceberg
.
<EOS>
Seating
himself
at
last
upon
the
rock
,
with
as
much
composure
as
he
could
assume
,
after
having
been
so
signally
thwarted
in
his
dark
schme
,
he
instantly
set
his
head
to
plotting
the
best
means
by
which
he
could
yet
retrieve
what
he
had
lost
,
and
revenge
himself
for
the
new
indignities
that
had
been
heaped
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"They
think
me
dead
of
course
,
"
he
muttered
to
himself
;
"
and
well
they
may
,
after
pitching
me
into
such
a
dark
,
dungeon
-
like
thundering
hole
as
this
;
but
I
'll
show
them
I
am
not
thus
easily
put
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
as
it
is
,
for
now
they
will
think
themselves
safe
,
and
thus
give
me
the
better
chance
to
make
sure
plans
and
take
them
unawares
.
<EOS>
A
curse
on
that
old
juggler
,
who
has
thwarted
my
designs
so
often
!
<EOS>
By
—
!
<EOS>
I
'll
soon
have
his
old
scalp
where
it
will
not
trouble
me
again
—
that
is
if
he
is
mortal
,
"
he
added
,
in
an
under
tone
,
endeavoring
to
peer
around
him
into
the
darkness
,
as
if
fearful
that
he
of
whom
he
spoke
might
somehow
mysteriously
make
his
appearance
,
as
he
had
more
than
once
done
before
.
"Who
<EOS>
and
what
can
he
be
any
how
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
something
wonderful
about
him
,
I
must
own
;
and
even
the
savages
fear
,
and
respect
him
,
and
call
him
Great
Medicine
.
<EOS>
And
what
does
he
know
of
me
,
and
how
did
he
obtain
his
knowledge
?
<EOS>
By
heavens
!
<EOS>
the
more
I
think
and
see
of
him
,
<EOS>
the
more
mysterious
he
seems
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
that
what
he
said
was
true
?
<EOS>
I
would
not
believe
it
,
but
that
I
saw
,
with
my
own
eyes
,
the
mark
under
my
left
arm
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
denying
that
,
at
all
events
—
unless
(
and
Moody
paused
and
mused
,
as
one
who
doubts
and
yet
is
inclined
to
believe)—unless
he
by
some
strange
magic
power
made
it
to
appear
there
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
"
he
added
,
fiercely
,
"
it
is
gone
now
,
and
the
flesh
with
it
,
as
I
can
sorely
feel
;
and
man
or
devil
,
by
—
!
<EOS>
I
'll
have
my
revenge
on
him
yet
,
or
die
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
"He
says
I
am
brother
to
Clifton
—
twin
brother
,
"
resumed
the
outcast
,
after
another
short
pause
.
<EOS>
"
May
be
I
am
,
or
was—(on
the
last
word
he
laid
particular
emphasis
)
—
or
was
,
I
say
—
for
now
that
the
totem
is
removed
,
we
are
brothers
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
has
done
enough
to
alienate
me
from
him
without
this
.
<EOS>
A
curse
on
him
,
"
he
fairly
shouted
,
"
brother
or
no
brother
,
for
crossing
me
in
my
love
!
<EOS>
For
this
—
for
this
I
would
have
revenge
,
though
his
claim
to
the
fraternal
tie
were
never
so
well
proven
,
and
though
I
had
called
him
brother
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
shoulder
—
a
curse
too
,
on
that
gardener
!
<EOS>
—
<EOS>
but
I
'll
have
all
settled
ere
long
.
<EOS>
Now
to
get
out
of
this
infernal
place
;
for
infernal
it
seems
,
and
dark
as
the
regions
of
the
damned
.
<EOS>
I
am
wet
and
chilly
,
and
my
wound
feels
painful
.
<EOS>
Let
me
once
get
out
of
this
place
,
and
I
trust
my
dusky
brethren
may
be
easily
found
,
even
if
they
have
moved
their
camp
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
this
,
he
slid
down
from
the
rock
into
the
water
,
on
the
side
opposite
that
which
he
had
ascended
on
emerging
from
the
pool
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
deep
—
not
more
than
five
inches
at
the
most
—
but
a
rather
abrupt
declivity
gave
it
an
impetus
that
sent
it
foaming
and
roaring
over
the
rocks
in
its
course
to
the
plain
below
,
and
rendered
it
highly
dangerous
footing
,
even
in
daylight
;
for
a
slip
,
or
on
unguarded
step
,
would
in
all
probability
plunge
the
adventurer
down
its
jagged
path
,
and
dash
him
to
pieces
;
and
consequently
it
was
none
the
less
perilons
now
,
when
night
and
the
overhanging
cliffs
had
shrouded
it
in
darkness
,
where
nothing
could
be
seen
save
an
occasional
fire
-
like
flash
from
the
angry
,
hissing
,
boiling
,
frothy
surges
.
<EOS>
Moody
at
once
comprehended
his
danger
,
and
his
heart
beat
fast
and
hard
against
his
breast
,
and
sometimes
seemed
to
rise
in
his
very
throat
;
so
much
was
he
,
who
under
ordinary
circumstances
feared
not
death
,
awed
by
the
gloom
and
peril
of
his
present
situation
.
<EOS>
"I
should
not
boast
of
my
escape
yet
,
"
he
said
to
himself
;
"
for
death
assuredly
stares
me
in
the
face
,
and
presents
his
most
unwelcome
aspect
.
<EOS>
"Carefully
<EOS>
feeling
his
way
,
he
now
moved
to
one
side
of
the
narrow
channel
,
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
rock
,
in
hopes
of
finding
some
means
of
ascending
the
cliff
,
or
keeping
along
upon
its
bank
.
<EOS>
None
was
found
.
<EOS>
The
cliff
,
as
high
as
he
could
reach
,
was
perpendicular
,
and
slippery
as
glass
.
<EOS>
He
crossed
the
channel
,
and
found
the
opposite
cliff
the
same
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
to
go
down
the
bed
of
the
stream
,
and
accordingly
he
began
to
do
so
,
keeping
hold
of
the
rock
,
to
steady
himself
as
best
he
could
over
the
slimy
stones
and
treacherous
ground
beneath
his
feet
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
he
continued
his
descent
slowly
,
without
meeting
any
difficulty
worthy
of
notice
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
advanced
a
hundred
yards
,
and
was
beginning
to
congratulate
himself
on
his
second
escape
,
when
his
ears
were
saluted
with
a
faint
,
dull
,
roaring
sound
,
like
the
fall
of
a
heavy
body
of
water
.
<EOS>
He
paused
in
dismay
,
and
listened
.
<EOS>
He
could
hear
it
distinctly
,
above
the
more
shallow
roaring
,
if
we
may
so
express
it
,
of
the
torrent
rushing
past
.
<EOS>
He
comprehended
the
fearful
truth
,
and
again
his
heart
died
within
him
,
and
he
would
have
sunk
down
in
despair
,
had
he
not
feared
the
awful
denouement
would
be
hastened
by
quitting
his
hold
of
the
rock
.
<EOS>
Ahead
of
him
was
certainly
another
cascade
,
the
the
brow
of
which
he
was
nearing
at
every
step
,
and
down
which
he
must
assuredly
plunge
—
or
,
what
was
equally
as
terrifying
,
remain
imprisoned
where
he
was
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
he
stood
irresolute
what
to
do
,
during
which
his
extreme
agony
of
mind
caused
a
cold
perspiration
to
ooze
from
every
pore
of
his
skin
.
<EOS>
For
almost
the
first
time
in
his
life
of
guilt
he
tried
to
pray
;
but
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
,
and
seemed
to
choke
him
.
<EOS>
Death
,
now
that
he
had
felt
so
confident
of
escape
,
rose
up
before
him
in
all
its
terrors
.
<EOS>
Despair
at
last
took
the
place
of
hope
and
foar
,
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
throwing
himself
flat
-
wise
on
the
current
,
and
trusting
the
rest
to
chance
,
when
a
new
idea
struck
him
,
and
he
suddenly
exclaimed:"What
a
fool
I
am
to
get
frightened
at
imaginary
terrors
!
<EOS>
How
do
I
know
there
is
not
a
way
to
pass
these
falls
without
going
down
with
the
water?"Saying
this
,
his
courage
revived
,
and
he
again
moved
forward
with
renewed
hope
.
<EOS>
Nearer
and
nearer
he
drew
to
the
falls
,
and
louder
and
louder
came
up
the
sullen
roar
of
the
waters
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
stood
upon
the
verge
of
the
precipice
,
and
,
with
the
utmost
difficulty
,
prevented
his
feet
from
being
drawn
down
into
the
unknown
chasm
,
by
the
force
of
the
rapids
.
<EOS>
He
carefully
felt
of
the
rock
to
which
he
clung
,
but
,
to
his
disappointment
,
could
find
no
broken
or
craggy
places
to
aid
him
in
his
descent
.
<EOS>
All
,
as
before
,
was
upright
,
smooth
and
solid
,
save
occasionally
a
little
crag
that
made
a
hold
for
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
Again
hope
died
,
and
he
secretly
wished
for
that
great
change
which
his
guilty
soul
shrunk
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
What
was
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
He
could
not
long
remain
where
he
was
,
for
his
efforts
to
keep
himself
there
<EOS>
had
already
tired
his
arms
,
and
weakened
him
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
decided
to
retrace
his
steps
,
until
he
should
come
to
an
easier
footing
,
and
there
,
if
possible
,
hold
out
till
daylight
should
enable
him
to
devise
some
means
of
escape
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
with
great
caution
,
and
at
the
risk
of
his
life
,
he
moved
up
the
stream
some
fifty
yards
,
when
he
came
to
a
place
where
the
rock
slightly
jutted
out
,
so
that
he
could
place
his
body
against
it
,
and
rest
somewhat
comfortably
.
<EOS>
Here
he
determined
on
remaining
till
morning
—
or
,
at
all
events
,
until
the
moon
,
which
was
a
little
past
her
full
,
had
arisen
sufficiently
to
light
up
his
gloomy
abode
.
<EOS>
Terrible
were
the
thoughts
that
now
crowded
the
mind
of
this
dark
man
.
<EOS>
Alone
,
as
it
were
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
,
with
dangers
on
every
hand
,
he
was
thus
forced
to
think
and
feel
as
he
had
never
done
before
;
and
as
,
unless
under
similar
circumstances
,
he
might
never
do
again
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
thing
to
face
death
in
the
heat
of
strife
,
when
all
the
faculties
of
the
mind
are
turned
into
the
channel
of
self
-
defense
,
ambition
,
glory
or
revenge
—
when
thoughts
of
the
great
hereafter
are
lost
in
the
wild
,
frenzied
passions
of
the
moment
—
and
another
to
contemplate
it
in
silence
,
alone
,
away
from
aught
that
can
distract
the
mind
.
<EOS>
Men
talk
of
heroes
—
of
courage
on
the
field
of
battle
—
where
everything
is
calculated
to
excite
,
intoxicate
,
bewilder
,
and
draw
them
forward
to
<EOS>
they
know
not
what
,
nor
have
time
nor
power
to
know
;
but
this
is
no
more
to
be
compared
to
that
moral
courage
which
can
meet
death
calmly
in
solitude
,
than
is
the
wild
blustering
of
a
drunken
man
to
what
one
<EOS>
coolly
and
firmly
asserts
in
sober
reason
.
<EOS>
The
one
is
the
bravery
of
the
animal
merely
,
without
the
action
of
the
mind
;
the
other
,
the
courage
of
the
mind
,
without
the
action
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
In
proof
of
this
,
how
often
do
we
hear
of
men
,
who
,
amid
the
carnage
of
the
ensanguined
field
,
have
rushed
up
reckless
,
fearless
of
all
danger
,
to
the
belching
cannon
's
mouth
,
placing
their
lives
as
if
by
choice
in
the
greatest
jeopardry
,
and
thus
winning
laurels
of
courage
to
bind
their
brows
forever
,
and
make
them
model
heroes
for
future
ages
—
shrinking
back
in
their
calm
,
sober
moments
,
like
some
timid
boy
,
from
the
near
approach
of
death
.
<EOS>
Of
this
last
class
was
Moody
.
<EOS>
Under
the
influence
of
excitement
and
passion
,
he
was
brave
,
so
far
as
animal
courage
goes
,
as
the
bravest
;
but
take
these
away
,
as
in
the
present
instance
,
and
he
became
at
once
the
veriest
coward
on
earth
.
<EOS>
There
is
ever
something
awful
in
contemplating
death
,
when
all
the
energies
and
reasoning
powers
of
the
mind
are
in
full
blast
;
when
we
see
and
feel
that
we
are
slowly
,
but
surely
,
hastening
to
that
dread
change
which
all
must
undergo
,
but
of
which
no
one
knoweth
that
hath
a
being
in
the
mortal
state
;
when
we
are
throwing
off
this
earthly
coil
,
bidding
a
last
farewell
to
scenes
and
friends
of
which
we
have
a
knowledge
,
and
,
it
may
be
,
"
flying
to
other
ills
that
we
know
not
of
.
"Moody
<EOS>
now
had
time
for
grave
contemplation
;
and
,
moreover
,
was
forced
to
it
by
surrounding
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Cold
and
wet
,
he
leaned
against
the
rock
and
thought
of
the
past
—
of
his
life
of
sin
and
crime
—
and
something
like
remorse
harrowed
up
his
guilty
soul
.
<EOS>
How
much
better
,
he
felt
,
it
would
have
been
,
had
his
course
been
upright
and
honest
;
had
he
lived
a
life
of
virtue
,
and
,
with
the
talents
he
possessed
,
and
the
advantages
which
had
been
given
him
,
been
a
shining
ornament
to
society
,
instead
of
a
disgrace
and
curse
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
awful
fate
which
seemed
to
be
hanging
over
him
,
and
the
little
chance
he
had
of
escaping
it
;
and
his
soul
fairly
shrunk
at
the
possibility
of
what
he
might
meet
in
the
dread
Beyond
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
taught
pious
words
in
his
youth
—
he
had
read
the
Bible
—
and
,
in
spite
of
his
reckless
,
awful
career
,
he
believed
there
was
a
Heaven
for
the
good
,
and
a
Hell
for
the
wicked
;
and
it
needed
no
argument
,
he
felt
,
to
prove
to
which
he
belonged
.
<EOS>
Death
now
had
terrors
,
that
death
seemed
never
to
have
had
before
;
and
he
quaked
and
trembled
where
he
stood
like
the
guilty
thing
he
was
.
<EOS>
Minute
succeeded
minute
,
and
hours
had
already
elapsed
,
ere
the
moon
<EOS>
had
sufficiently
risen
to
throw
her
silvery
rays
down
the
steep
rocks
on
to
the
foaming
flood
in
which
Moody
still
remained
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
her
bright
light
fell
upon
the
waters
,
the
outeast
thought
best
to
make
another
trial
for
his
life
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
changed
his
position
,
and
again
descended
toward
the
cascade
.
<EOS>
When
within
ten
feet
of
the
precipice
,
over
which
the
water
tumbled
,
he
fancied
he
saw
a
ruggedness
in
the
opposite
rock
that
might
enable
him
to
climb
to
the
summit
,
and
thus
avoid
the
falls
altogether
.
<EOS>
His
heart
bounded
at
the
thought
;
and
,
regardless
of
the
risk
he
ran
,
he
at
once
set
out
to
ford
the
stream
.
<EOS>
When
about
half
way
across
,
his
feet
struck
against
a
rock
—
he
stumbled
—
fell
—
and
the
next
moment
the
boiling
surge
had
borne
him
to
the
brow
of
the
awful
precipice
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
help
now
;
all
hope
of
escape
was
cut
off
;
and
throwing
himself
as
much
as
possible
into
an
upright
position
,
as
he
passed
the
verge
,
he
uttered
one
prayer
,
"
God
save
me
!
"
and
disappeared
—
down
—
down
—
into
the
hell
of
waters
below
.
<EOS>
That
man
has
an
appointed
time
to
die
,
might
be
strongly
argued
from
the
fact
,
that
we
every
day
witness
,
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
,
what
men
undergo
and
live
;
and
yet
how
little
it
requires
,
when
their
time
has
come
,
to
cut
the
brittle
thread
of
life
,
and
launch
them
into
the
incomprehensible
eternity
.
<EOS>
Had
we
time
and
space
,
we
might
cite
numerous
instances
that
have
come
to
our
own
knowledge
,
where
men
have
undergone
tenfold
the
agonies
of
death
have
been
given
over
by
skillful
physicians
—
have
been
wept
as
dead
—
who
have
recovered
and
lived
,
as
it
were
to
show
a
miracle
to
the
world
—
and
yet
have
died
at
last
,
by
the
simplest
of
all
ailments
,
a
cold
,
or
a
scratch
of
the
finger
.
<EOS>
That
such
cases
are
of
common
occurrence
,
we
all
know
;
but
wherefore
,
is
one
of
those
great
mysteries
by
which
the
Creator
designs
to
work
out
his
own
ends
;
and
the
best
lesson
we
can
draw
from
them
is
,
that
we
should
at
all
times
be
ready
for
the
uncertainty
of
life
.
<EOS>
By
the
common
phrase
,
that
"
his
time
had
not
come
,
"
we
must
account
for
the
wonderful
preservation
of
Moody
in
the
present
instance
.
<EOS>
His
chance
of
escape
,
unharmed
,
was
in
the
ratio
of
one
to
a
million
—
and
yet
he
escaped
.
<EOS>
In
the
exact
spot
where
he
went
down
,
was
an
immense
depth
of
water
—
a
pool
,
not
unlike
the
one
above
,
though
much
smaller
;
which
,
like
that
,
too
,
had
been
hollowed
out
by
the
eternal
wear
of
the
cascade
.
<EOS>
It
was
small
,
as
we
have
said
,
and
on
every
side
surrounded
by
rocks
.
<EOS>
The
falls
were
some
thirty
feet
in
height
;
and
there
was
only
one
spot
which
presented
the
possibility
of
escape
,
and
but
one
means
of
reaching
it
.
<EOS>
This
spot
,
by
means
of
which
he
was
at
the
time
unconscious
,
Moody
gained
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
recollected
,
as
he
went
over
the
verge
of
the
precipice
,
he
managed
to
take
an
upright
position
.
<EOS>
As
luck
would
have
it
,
the
exertion
which
he
made
in
doing
so
,
sent
him
clear
of
the
main
body
of
the
stream
,
and
he
went
down
just
outside
of
the
falling
sheet
.
<EOS>
Standing
perpendicular
,
his
feet
struck
square
upon
the
surface
of
the
pool
,
while
the
force
with
which
he
descendod
instantly
buried
him
far
below
.
<EOS>
A
re
-
action
took
place
,
and
his
head
soon
rose
far
above
the
water
.
<EOS>
With
great
presence
of
mind
he
grappled
a
rock
,
and
the
next
moment
was
safe
,
and
had
an
opportunity
of
perceiving
how
near
he
had
been
to
the
jaws
of
death
.
<EOS>
Had
he
gone
down
in
the
cur
rent
instead
of
out
of
it
—
<EOS>
had
he
fallen
flatwise
—
had
he
varied
a
foot
—
or
,
in
fact
,
had
he
not
passed
over
the
falls
exactly
in
the
place
and
manner
<EOS>
he
did
,
he
must
assuredly
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
upon
the
surrounding
rocks
.
<EOS>
A
direct
Providence
,
it
seemed
,
alone
save
him
;
and
,
for
a
time
,
something
like
a
feeling
of
gratitude
to
the
Guardian
of
his
destiny
,
held
a
place
in
his
breast
;
and
he
gazed
around
him
in
silent
awe
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
generally
happens
with
those
whose
hearts
are
hardened
past
redemption
,
no
sooner
did
he
realize
that
he
was
actually
safe
,
than
his
wild
<EOS>
,
vindictive
feelings
gained
the
ascendancy
,
and
he
was
fain
to
attribute
to
his
own
presence
of
mind
,
what
should
have
been
yielded
to
a
Higher
Power
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
<EOS>
ha
,
ha
!
"
he
laughed
,
at
length
,
rather
impiously
;
"
why
should
I
fear
death
?
<EOS>
Do
I
not
always
escape
,
even
where
escape
seems
impossible
?
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
fear
—
my
good
fortune
will
carry
me
though
all
extremes
.
<EOS>
"With
this
<EOS>
he
rose
,
and
,
ascending
the
bank
,
which
was
here
not
difficult
to
climb
,
descended
to
the
plain
.
<EOS>
Pausing
a
moment
in
an
open
spot
,
where
the
moon
shone
full
upon
his
dark
countenance
,
displaying
there
a
grim
smile
,
he
turned
,
and
was
quickly
buried
in
the
surrounding
forest
.
<EOS>
Presumptuous
fool
!
<EOS>
How
little
did
he
know
of
what
the
future
had
in
store
for
him!CHAPTER

<EOS>
Some
five
miles
higher
up
the
Miami
,
and
within
a
few
yards
of
the
stream
itself
,
was
encamped
,
on
the
night
of
the
events
detailed
,
a
band
of
warriors
.
<EOS>
Their
camp
,
however
,
was
very
simple
.
<EOS>
A
small
fire
was
burning
on
a
smooth
plat
,
<EOS>
around
which
,
with
their
feet
centering
toward
the
flame
,
lay
extended
some
eight
or
ten
dark
figures
,
asleep
—
<EOS>
apparently
so
,
at
least
—
over
which
the
flickering
and
sombre
light
cast
wild
,
fantastic
shadows
.
<EOS>
The
party
had
not
even
taken
the
precaution
to
station
sentinels
—
a
proof
that
they
felt
themselves
perfectly
secure
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
the
Indian
country
,
where
all
the
tribes
were
friendly
to
each
other
,
and
afar
,
as
they
imagined
,
from
the
whites
,
their
only
enemies
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
,
true
,
they
had
been
on
the
war
-
path
against
the
latter
,
and
some
of
their
garments
were
yet
stained
with
the
blood
of
recent
victims
;
while
,
at
the
girdles
of
two
,
hung
fresh
scalps
.
<EOS>
It
was
natural
to
suppose
they
would
be
followed
,
yet
they
seemed
to
have
no
fears
—
fancying
doubtless
,
that
they
were
now
either
too
far
distant
to
be
overtaken
immediately
,
or
that
their
foes
were
too
unskillful
on
the
trail
to
find
them
;
and
the
more
so
,
that
they
had
broken
it
for
miles
by
passing
up
the
bed
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
Thus
they
slept
in
security
—
not
as
soundly
,
perhaps
,
as
they
would
have
done
in
their
own
cabins
,
but
sufficiently
sound
to
answer
all
the
purposes
of
nature
,
in
refreshing
their
wearied
bodies
—
while
the
waning
moon
,
riding
high
in
the
heavens
,
poured
down
over
all
her
flood
of
mellow
light
,
and
partially
dimmed
the
glare
of
the
fire
of
their
camp
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
far
from
the
meridian
of
night
when
a
tall
figure
glided
among
the
trees
,
and
stealthily
approached
them
.
<EOS>
When
within
ten
yards
,
he
halted
,
examined
them
at
tentively
,
and
then
,
as
if
satisfied
all
was
right
,
advanced
boldly
toward
the
circle
.
<EOS>
Even
this
last
movement
seemed
unheeded
,
tho
'
one
or
two
turned
and
moved
their
limbs
,
as
if
troubled
by
some
unpleasant
dream
;
and
one
actually
went
through
the
motions
of
taking
the
scalp
.
<EOS>
"Warriors
<EOS>
on
the
war
-
path
,
"
said
the
voice
of
the
figure
,
speaking
in
the
Shawance
dialect
,
"
I
am
surprised
to
find
you
sleeping
without
a
sentinel!"At
the
first
sound
of
the
speaker
's
voice
,
each
Indian
sprang
to
his
feet
in
surp
rise
,
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
rifle
by
his
side
,
ready
for
defense
.
<EOS>
"Ugh
!
"
ejaculated
most
of
the
warriors
,
as
their
eyes
fell
upon
the
speaker
,
while
the
grasp
upon
their
weapons
gradually
relaxed
,
and
they
stood
still
,
as
if
waiting
to
hear
further
.
<EOS>
"Brothers
,
"
continued
Moody
,
for
he
it
was
,
"
you
sleep
too
soundly
on
the
war
-
path
,
and
might
have
been
surprised
by
the
pale
-
faces
.
<EOS>
""Does
<EOS>
my
brother
know
of
danger
,
that
he
thus
chides
us
?
"
<EOS>
asked
a
tall
,
fierce
looking
savage
,
who
appeared
to
be
one
possessed
of
authority
.
<EOS>
"There
is
always
danger
when
foes
are
in
pursuit
,
"
replied
Moody
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
the
pale
-
faces
then
on
our
trail
?
"
inquired
the
other
,
a
fierce
gleam
of
satisfaction
shooting
athwart
his
dark
visage
.
<EOS>
"They
are
within
five
miles
of
us
?
"
answered
Moody
,
"
and
have
possessed
themselves
of
the
bird
which
I
caught
in
my
snare
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
hand
of
each
was
again
placed
upon
a
weapon
,
and
each
turned
to
the
other
a
startled
look
of
inquiry
,
but
no
one
replied
.
<EOS>
After
a
silence
of
perhaps
a
minute
,
the
one
who
had
first
addressed
Moody
,
rejoined:"Will
<EOS>
my
brother
explain
?
<EOS>
or
does
danger
press?"As
Moody
apprehended
no
danger
himself
,
he
briefly
narrated
such
of
the
events
already
known
to
the
reader
as
he
thought
most
likely
to
rouse
the
ire
of
his
swarthy
companions
,
and
induce
them
to
enter
into
his
plans
—
carefully
avoiding
,
however
,
any
mention
of
Luther
,
who
was
known
personally
,
or
by
report
,
to
all
present
,
and
feared
as
a
Great
Medicine
,
to
contend
with
whom
would
be
useless
—
their
superstitious
fears
magnifying
him
into
a
supernatural
being
,
directly
under
the
influence
and
guidance
of
the
Great
Spirit
.
<EOS>
"You
have
heard
,
"
said
Moody
,
in
conclusion
,
glancing
round
upon
his
auditors
,
and
noting
with
satisfaction
,
the
involuntary
tightening
of
their
hands
upon
their
rifles
,
the
gleaming
of
their
eyes
,
and
the
dilating
of
their
mostrils
,
the
only
signs
,
indicative
of
their
intense
interest
in
his
recital
.
<EOS>
No
one
replied
;
and
after
a
silence
of
some
moments
,
Moody
resumed
,
in
a
rather
impatient
tone:"I
trust
,
my
brothers
,
you
are
not
turning
squaws
.
<EOS>
That
you
have
been
brave
,
these
eyes
have
seen
,
and
this
tongue
can
bear
witness
.
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
for
the
war
-
path
again?—or
<EOS>
are
your
knives
and
hatchets
dull
,
and
your
powder
wet
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
for
Posetha
would
know
.
<EOS>
""My
brother
,
"
replied
Mugwa
,
the
spokesman
on
the
part
of
the
Indians
,
"
is
hasty
.
<EOS>
Posetha
should
remember
an
Indian
must
always
take
time
to
consider
before
he
adopts
a
new
plan
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
on
the
war
-
path
toward
the
south
,
and
our
faces
are
now
set
to
the
north
.
<EOS>
Before
we
change
our
course
,
we
must
hold
council
.
<EOS>
""Then
,
by
—
!
<EOS>
let
it
be
speedily
!
"
<EOS>
growled
Moody
,
in
English
,
making
use
of
an
oath
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
choose
to
accompany
me
soon
,
I
shall
go
alone
;
for
be
revenged
I
will
,
though
it
cost
me
my
life
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
this
was
said
in
a
low
tone
,
and
in
a
language
which
the
best
among
them
but
imperfectly
understood
,
it
of
course
elicited
no
remark
.
<EOS>
Each
,
however
,
noted
the
manner
of
Moody
,
and
saw
that
he
was
dissatisfied
;
but
even
this
failed
to
bring
out
a
single
comment
,
so
accustomed
were
the
Indians
to
silence
,
when
any
important
question
was
pending
.
<EOS>
Having
seated
themselves
around
the
fire
,
Mugwa
now
slowly
produced
a
pipe
,
which
he
filled
,
and
lighted
,
smoked
a
short
time
in
silence
,
and
passed
to
his
neighbor
;
who
,
imitating
his
example
,
smoked
and
passed
it
to
the
next
;
and
thus
it
went
around
the
circle
,
Moody
merely
drawing
a
few
whiffs
,
to
comply
as
briefly
as
possible
with
the
Indian
council
custom
.
<EOS>
When
the
last
smoker
had
done
,
and
a
sufficient
pause
had
succeeded
,
Mugwa
rose
and
said:"The
ears
of
the
Piquas
are
now
open
to
the
words
of
the
pale
-
face
chief
.
<EOS>
Let
my
brother
lay
before
them
his
plans
,
that
they
may
consider
if
they
be
wise
.
<EOS>
""Brothers
,
"
rejoined
Moody
,
rising
as
the
other
sat
down
,
"
my
words
shall
be
few
,
and
to
the
point
;
for
my
tongue
is
parched
and
thirsty
for
blood
,
and
my
limbs
are
weary
and
stiff
with
long
watching
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Brothers
,
I
was
made
your
chief
,
and
we
have
been
upon
the
war
-
path
together
—
not
unsuccessfully
,
as
yonder
trophies
bear
witness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
he
pointed
to
the
two
scalps
before
mentioned
,
one
of
which
was
dangling
from
the
belt
of
Mugwa
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Brothers
,
"
he
continued
,
"
on
that
war
-
path
all
were
brave
,
and
fought
as
became
warriors
,
until
prudence
,
the
gift
of
the
wise
,
bade
them
retire
.
<EOS>
On
that
war
-
path
Posetha
caught
a
dove
,
and
had
her
caged
,
and
then
went
and
consulted
his
brothers
,
and
asked
,
and
they
generously
gave
him
,
permission
to
do
with
her
as
he
might
see
proper
.
<EOS>
Brothers
,
Posetha
returned
to
the
cage
where
he
had
left
his
dove
,
and
there
he
found
her
,
and
was
happy
,
until
the
vultures
of
pale
-
faces
came
and
snatched
her
away
,
and
set
upon
him
,
and
nearly
picked
out
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Brothers
,
Posetha
would
have
revenge!—he
would
have
the
bones
of
the
pale
-
faces
whiten
in
the
open
air
,
while
their
scalps
dry
in
the
cabins
of
his
red
friends
!
<EOS>
Brothers
,
if
you
are
ambitious
,
now
is
the
time
to
distinguish
yourselves
,
and
carry
home
trophies
that
shall
please
the
Great
Spirit
,
and
send
your
names
down
by
tradition
to
far
posterity
.
<EOS>
The
pale
-
faces
will
be
unguarded
;
they
think
the
"
Cat
"
is
dead
;
and
they
can
be
taken
unawares
,
and
conquered
without
a
blow
.
<EOS>
Brothers
,
if
you
are
willing
,
Posetha
will
lead
you
to
a
cover
,
where
your
enemies
will
pass
unguarded
,
and
can
all
be
made
your
prisoners
for
the
torture
,
or
their
scalps
can
be
taken
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
Brothers
,
I
have
only
one
reserve
to
make
:
the
dove
must
not
be
harmed
;
she
is
mine
,
and
I
must
have
her
to
coo
in
my
wigwam
.
<EOS>
Brothers
,
I
am
done
,
and
wait
your
answers
.
<EOS>
"Moody
sat
down
,
and
a
deep
silence
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Each
savage
remained
as
stern
and
motionless
as
marble
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
,
apparently
in
a
dreamy
,
con
templative
mood
.
<EOS>
At
length
Mugwa
motioned
for
the
pipe
;
and
on
its
being
handed
him
,
he
refilled
it
,
smoked
a
little
,
and
passed
it
to
his
neighbor
;
and
thus
it
went
around
the
circle
again
,
in
silence
,
not
a
single
warrior
having
opened
his
lips
.
<EOS>
After
another
brief
pause
,
whereby
each
seemed
determined
to
give
his
neighbor
a
chance
,
Mugwa
,
chief
of
the
Indians
,
arose
.
<EOS>
We
say
chief
,
for
although
Moody
was
nominally
so
,
yet
Mugwa
had
more
direct
command
over
the
savages
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
or
two
,
Mugwa
ran
his
eyes
over
the
group
before
him
,
as
we
sometimes
see
an
orator
,
when
he
desires
to
make
an
impression
,
and
draw
exclusive
attention
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
powerful
warrior
,
and
in
his
paint
looked
sufficiently
ferocious
to
entitle
him
to
his
appellation
of
the
"
Bear
,
"
or
please
the
vanity
of
a
savage
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
black
and
fiery
,
and
a
look
of
cunning
and
brutality
formed
the
prevailing
expression
of
his
features
.
<EOS>
"Brothers
,
"
he
said
at
length
,
"
you
have
heard
the
words
of
Posetha
;
to
Mugwa
they
seem
wise
and
good
.
<EOS>
There
seems
a
chance
for
more
trophies
.
<EOS>
A
chance
to
take
new
vengeance
on
this
hated
race
,
that
are
fast
usurping
our
own
and
the
hunting
grounds
of
our
fathers
.
<EOS>
Soon
shall
we
be
forced
toward
the
setting
sun
,
unless
our
hands
are
continually
died
in
their
blood
.
<EOS>
They
will
over
-
run
and
cover
the
land
we
tread
on
as
the
leaves
in
the
autumn
.
<EOS>
If
a
viper
creep
into
our
wigwam
,
do
we
not
crush
it
,
lest
it
do
us
harm?—and
yet
were
the
ground
thick
with
vipers
,
instead
of
pale
-
faces
,
we
should
have
reason
to
rejoice
.
<EOS>
Brothers
,
on
this
war
-
path
we
have
done
well
—
shall
we
not
do
better
?
<EOS>
Shall
we
not
please
our
squaws
and
young
men
,
by
bringing
them
prisoners
to
torture
?
<EOS>
When
we
take
the
scalps
of
our
enemies
,
the
Great
Spirit
is
pleased
—
shall
we
not
,
then
,
please
the
Great
Spirit
?
<EOS>
The
voice
of
Mugwa
says
`
Yes
!
'
<EOS>
Who
says
`
No
?
'
<EOS>
Let
me
hear?"Here
Mugwa
sat
down
,
amid
grunts
of
approbation
from
his
savage
auditors
.
<EOS>
Another
profound
silence
of
some
minutes
succeeded
,
when
a
warrior
rose
.
<EOS>
"Unkee
,
"
he
said
,
"
has
heard
the
words
of
the
great
chiefs
,
and
he
thinks
them
wise
.
<EOS>
In
the
lodge
of
Unkee
are
a
squaw
and
three
pappooses
.
<EOS>
When
he
returns
,
they
will
ask
to
see
his
trophies
.
<EOS>
Unkee
has
nothing
to
show
.
<EOS>
Their
faces
will
be
sad
.
<EOS>
Unkee
would
have
them
glad
.
<EOS>
The
great
chiefs
have
pointed
out
a
way
.
<EOS>
Unkee
is
pleased
,
and
he
thinks
the
chiefs
wise
.
<EOS>
He
is
done
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
this
,
the
last
speaker
quietly
resumed
his
seat
.
<EOS>
But
enough
had
been
said
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
further
need
of
grave
deliberation
.
<EOS>
The
minds
of
all
had
become
fully
settled
.
<EOS>
Their
passions
had
been
wrought
upon
,
and
they
were
ready
for
deeds
of
blood
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
some
two
or
three
warriors
sprang
to
their
feet
,
and
uttered
the
scalp
halloo
.
<EOS>
Others
followed
their
example
.
<EOS>
The
matter
was
soon
decided
,
and
the
council
over
.
<EOS>
Water
was
now
brought
and
thrown
upon
the
fire
;
belts
were
tightened
;
weapons
put
in
their
proper
places
;
and
the
announcement
was
made
that
all
was
ready
.
"Follow
!
<EOS>
"
said
Moody
;
and
taking
his
way
across
a
small
open
plat
,
he
was
soon
buried
in
a
dense
thicket
.
<EOS>
One
after
another
,
to
the
number
of
ten
dark
warriors
,
trod
in
his
steps
,
and
,
disappearing
,
left
the
scene
of
the
late
council
silent
and
deserted
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XVII.Still

perplexed

Brinley

Rescue
.
"Daylight
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
voice
of
the
sentinel
,
who
had
been
stationed
to
keep
watch
in
the
cave
;
and
the
word
was
heard
echoing
far
away
to
the
most
distant
recesses
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
signal
for
the
party
to
be
astir
;
and
Clifton
,
who
was
encamped
upon
the
ground
nearest
the
speaker
,
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
,
without
communicating
with
any
,
at
once
took
his
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
morning
,
and
,
unlike
the
one
preceding
it
,
the
atmosphere
was
clear
and
without
mist
.
<EOS>
A
few
crimson
streaks
in
the
east
,
and
a
dull
,
leaden
gray
color
that
had
settled
over
the
earth
,
announced
that
day
was
already
dawning
.
<EOS>
In
the
west
,
the
waning
moon
could
still
be
seen
;
but
its
light
appeared
pale
and
sickly
,
as
it
mingled
with
that
of
the
coming
day
,
which
was
soon
to
supersede
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
All
was
pleasant
and
serene
,
with
no
cloud
to
mar
the
broad
,
blue
canopy
above
.
<EOS>
A
heavy
dew
had
fallen
during
the
night
,
and
was
now
reposing
,
in
silvery
drops
,
upon
the
rocks
,
and
the
leaves
of
a
few
bushes
which
grew
around
the
entrance
of
the
cave
,
and
overhung
the
stream
that
roared
and
foamed
far
below
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
cool
and
bracing
,
and
a
light
breeze
hore
to
the
ear
of
our
hero
the
songs
of
several
warblers
,
which
had
commenced
their
morning
's
roundelay
.
<EOS>
As
Clifton
stood
and
gazed
around
him
in
the
pale
light
,
and
saw
the
beauties
of
the
morning
,
he
could
not
shake
off
a
feeling
of
sadness
that
had
taken
possession
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
The
events
of
the
already
departing
night
,
now
came
up
before
him
like
a
dream
.
<EOS>
His
mind
instantly
reverted
to
the
strange
revelations
of
Luther
,
and
he
thought
how
mysterious
were
the
ways
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
that
Moody
was
his
brother?—and
<EOS>
if
so
,
how
wonderful
that
they
should
meet
as
foes
in
the
great
wilderness
!
<EOS>
Could
it
be
,
too
,
that
both
were
nobly
born!—and
if
so
,
how
singular
that
he
should
be
thus
left
to
grow
up
in
ignorance
of
a
fact
so
important
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
true
,
he
felt
for
he
had
never
known
father
nor
mother
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
reared
and
educated
by
a
New
England
family
,
until
the
age
of
eighteen
,
when
he
had
been
told
it
rested
with
him
to
choose
his
occupation
for
life
.
<EOS>
He
had
chosen
the
army
,
and
had
been
placed
in
a
military
school
;
since
when
,
by
the
aid
of
some
unknown
friend
,
he
had
been
advanced
to
the
rank
and
station
he
now
held
.
<EOS>
He
had
often
made
inquiries
concerning
his
parents
,
but
could
never
learn
further
,
than
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
dead
,
and
that
he
was
indebted
for
all
his
favors
to
a
strange
benefactor
,
whom
he
had
never
seen
,
and
perhaps
never
would
.
<EOS>
Might
not
this
benefactor
be
Luther
?
<EOS>
He
had
let
fall
words
to
such
an
effect
,
by
stating
that
he
knew
him
before
he
knew
himself
.
<EOS>
The
secret
was
doubtless
contained
in
the
silver
box
which
that
wonderful
being
had
placed
in
his
hands
,
and
he
was
sorely
tempted
to
break
it
open
and
know
at
once
;
but
the
request
to
the
contrary
,
until
Kate
should
have
become
his
wife
,
restrained
him
.
<EOS>
Who
was
Luther
?
<EOS>
and
how
did
he
manage
to
make
all
fear
him
,
and
bring
about
his
purposes
so
mysteriously
?
<EOS>
What
did
his
last
strange
words
portend
?
<EOS>
And
Moo
dy
,
too
—
if
he
was
indeed
his
brother
,
although
he
amply
merited
death
,
how
much
rather
he
would
have
had
him
live
,
perhaps
to
repent
and
reform
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
late
now
.
<EOS>
He
was
gone
.
<EOS>
He
had
perished
by
the
hand
of
another
;
and
even
now
his
mutilated
remains
might
,
perchance
,
be
laying
on
the
rocks
below
.
<EOS>
As
these
thoughts
passed
rapidly
through
the
mind
of
Clifton
,
he
approached
the
spot
where
Moody
was
last
seen
by
the
party
at
the
cave
,
and
,
taking
hold
of
some
stunted
bushes
that
grew
upon
the
verge
of
the
chasm
,
endeavored
to
peer
down
into
the
gloomy
abyss
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
too
dark
to
see
aught
,
save
here
and
there
a
fire
-
flash
of
the
water
,
as
it
dashed
over
the
rocks
,
and
sent
up
its
hollow
roar
;
and
Clifton
quickly
drew
back
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
a
soft
hand
was
laid
upon
his
arm
.
<EOS>
He
turned
,
and
beheld
the
idol
of
his
heart
,
the
lovely
Kate
Clarendon
,
standing
by
his
side
,
her
features
pale
and
sad
,
and
her
eyes
slightly
dimmed
by
a
pearly
tear
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
dearest
,
"
exclaimed
Ernest
,
throwing
an
arm
around
,
and
drawing
her
to
his
beating
heart
;
"
you
are
troubled
;
I
can
see
it
in
your
sweet
countenance
.
<EOS>
""I
was
thinking
of
my
dear
,
dear
mother
,
"
returned
Kate
,
simply
;
and
unable
to
control
her
emotion
longer
,
she
buried
her
head
upon
the
breast
of
him
she
loved
and
wept
freely
.
<EOS>
Clifton
was
moved
,
and
it
was
sometime
ere
he
could
command
his
own
feelings
so
as
to
answer
calmly
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
weep
,
dearest
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
;
"
your
mother
is
now
an
angel
in
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
know
it
,
"
rejoined
Kate
,
with
a
fresh
burst
of
grief
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
better
off
now
,
than
when
in
this
cold
world
of
sorrow
;
but
then
it
is
so
hard
to
part
from
those
we
love
.
<EOS>
""It
is
,
indeed
,
"
returned
Clifton
,
sadly
,
gazing
upon
her
with
a
look
of
affection
,
and
thinking
of
the
moment
when
he
might
be
called
to
part
from
her
,
or
she
from
him
,
by
the
same
woful
messenger
,
death
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
indeed
hard
to
part
from
those
we
love
,
dear
Kate
;
and
God
send
the
time
be
far
distant
,
ere
it
be
the
trial
of
either
of
us
again
!
<EOS>
But
,
dearest
Kate
,
"
he
pursued
,
consolingly
,
"
even
had
nature
taken
its
course
,
you
would
soon
have
been
an
orphan
;
and
you
should
try
to
be
resigned
,
that
your
mother
has
escaped
all
the
anguish
of
a
lingering
death
of
pain
.
<EOS>
Though
horrible
,
her
death
was
easy
;
and
her
sweet
spirit
winged
its
flight
,
without
knowing
the
cause
that
separated
it
from
its
clayey
tenement
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
try
to
be
resigned
,
"
Kate
replied
;
"
but
still
,
dear
Ernest
,
I
must
grieve
,
and
weep
,
for
I
am
only
a
poor
human
being
after
all
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
that
,
of
course
,
you
do
but
what
is
right
,
"
said
Ernest
,
tenderly
;
"
and
<EOS>
tears
are
a
great
relief
to
the
overcharged
spirit
.
"
<EOS>
Then
,
musing
for
a
moment
,
he
resumed
:
"
I
,
too
,
feel
somewhat
sad
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
pondering
over
various
matters
,
and
at
the
moment
when
you
touched
my
arm
,
I
was
peering
down
the
chasm
,
expecting
to
behold
my
brother
's
remains
—
but
it
was
too
dark
.
<EOS>
""O
,
do
not
call
him
brother
,
"
said
Kate
,
earnestly
;
do
not
,
dear
Ernest
!
<EOS>
for
he
was
everything
that
is
wicked
and
base
;
while
you
,
on
the
contrary
,
are
everything
that
is
noble
and
good
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
can
not
be
brothers
;
I
will
not
have
you
so
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
know
,
"
replied
Clifton
,
musingly
,
;
"
it
is
all
very
mysterious
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
dark
man
,
it
is
true
—
a
terrible
man
—
a
man
,
in
fact
,
of
crime
and
blood
;
<EOS>
but
,
whatever
his
crimes
,
he
is
now
most
probably
before
that
Great
Tribunal
,
where
he
will
have
to
answer
for
himself
,
and
be
judged
accordingly
.
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
forgive
him
,
and
yet
my
heart
rather
yearns
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
last
night
in
my
dreams
,
and
methought
he
had
repented
and
called
me
brother
.
<EOS>
I
awoke
feeling
sad
,
and
without
saying
a
word
to
any
,
I
arose
and
came
hither
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
saw
you
,
"
replied
Kate
;
"
for
when
the
sentinel
spoke
,
I
had
been
long
awake
;
and
I
rose
and
followed
you
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
did
not
rest
well
,
then
,
my
dearest
Kate?""But
indifferently
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
for
,
between
my
hard
bed
and
ten
thousand
thoughts
that
came
crowding
one
after
another
upon
me
,
I
was
not
long
in
the
arms
of
Morpheus
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
you
will
not
be
able
to
endure
the
journey
,
after
such
a
feverish
rest
.
<EOS>
""O
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
shall
,
for
I
am
strong
and
well
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
the
way
,
dearest
,
tell
me
how
you
came
here
,
what
became
of
the
savages
,
and
what
happened
after
I
saw
you?""I
was
conducted
here
by
Moody
;
what
became
of
the
Indians
,
I
do
not
know
;
and
what
happened
,
I
will
tell
you
some
other
time
;
for
I
see
our
friends
are
coming
this
way
.
<EOS>
"As
she
spoke
,
Kate
pointed
toward
the
mouth
of
the
cave
;
and
turning
,
Clifton
perceived
Danvers
,
David
and
Ichabod
issuing
therefrom"A
beautiful
day
,
for
our
homeward
journey
,
"
remarked
Danvers
,
approaching
the
lovers
.
<EOS>
"It
is
indeed
,
"
answered
Clifton
;
`
and
I
trust
,
ere
night
<EOS>
,
we
shall
once
more
be
safe
among
our
friends
.
<EOS>
""Had
we
not
better
partake
of
some
refreshment
,
and
set
out
as
soon
as
possible
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Danvers
,
in
reply
.
<EOS>
"There
is
a
very
heavy
dew
,
"
answered
the
young
officer
,
"
and
the
bushes
are
very
wet
;
so
that
perhaps
we
had
better
wait
until
the
sun
has
well
risen
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
shall
then
have
sufficient
time
;
for
although
Luther
led
us
a
long
way
,
I
do
not
think
we
are
more
than
twenty
-
five
,
or
at
most
thirty
,
miles
from
the
settlement
,
by
the
course
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
as
you
like
,
"
rejoined
Danvers
;
"
though
,
for
one
,
I
am
anxious
to
be
moving
;
for
we
do
not
know
what
may
happen
if
we
stay
here
.
<EOS>
""Have
you
any
reason
to
think
the
place
unsafe
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Kate
,
rather
anxiously
.
"Why
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
Danvers
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
most
probably
known
to
the
Indians
,
and
they
may
come
hither
in
search
of
Moody
—
which
result
,
to
say
the
least
,
would
be
unpleasant
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
answered
Clifton
,
musingly
:
"
<EOS>
You
are
right
,
Danvers
;
I
did
not
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
Upon
second
thoughts
,
perhaps
we
had
better
leave
at
once
.
<EOS>
""Second
thoughts
is
generally
the
wisest
,
"
put
in
David
,
coming
up
to
the
party
,
in
company
with
Ichabod
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
you
,
too
,
think
it
not
safe
here
?
"
said
Kate
,
addressing
the
scout
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
know
,
o
'
course
,
"
replied
David
;
"
but
some
how
I
ca
n't
git
it
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
head
,
that
Moody
arn't
dead
.
<EOS>
"Each
started
,
and
turned
to
ward
the
speaker
a
look
of
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"Fact
!
"
returned
David
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"What
reason
have
you
for
so
thinking
?
"
<EOS>
queried
Clifton
,
in
a
manner
that
showed
he
,
too
,
might
think
it
possible
.
<EOS>
"Can't
<EOS>
give
no
reason
,
"
answered
David
;
"
unless
it
's
cause
he
seemed
to
have
as
many
lives
as
a
cat
,
and
that
I
dreampt
about
'
i
m
last
night
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
pray
what
did
you
dream?""That
<EOS>
he
'd
got
away
,
and
had
all
the
Injins
arter
us
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
think
that
can
be
,
"
rejoined
Danvers
;
"
for
if
not
mortally
wounded
by
the
fire
of
Ichabod
,
I
think
his
fall
must
have
done
the
rest
.
<EOS>
""May
<EOS>
be
you
forgit
how
he
's
mixed
up
with
the
Necromancer
,
"
observed
the
scout
,
glancing
round
him
cautiously
,
in
a
way
to
show
that
he
at
least
was
not
devoid
of
a
feeling
of
superstition
common
to
most
,
particularly
the
uneducated
,
of
that
day
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Blind
Luther
,
you
know
,
wanted
to
save
him
;
and
I
'
spect
,
from
what
I
seed
of
him
,
that
he
could
do
it
easy
enough
.
"Clifton
<EOS>
smiled
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
give
him
more
power
than
he
would
claim
for
himself
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
tone
calculated
to
dispel
all
fears
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
"
Luther
has
said
he
was
nothing
more
than
mortal
,
and
I
believe
him
;
though
I
own
some
of
his
doings
look
a
little
mysterious
;
but
doubtless
they
could
all
be
accounted
for
very
simply
.
<EOS>
""May
<EOS>
be
<EOS>
you
can
account
for
'em
,
then
,
"
rejoined
David
,
somewhat
testily
:
"
<EOS>
I
can't
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
said
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
rest
of
the
party
had
joined
the
speakers
,
and
learning
the
subject
of
their
conversation
,
most
of
them
took
sides
with
the
scout
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
all
events
,
"
said
Danvers
,
who
seemed
a
little
staggered
,
and
hardly
knowing
which
side
to
join
,
though
rather
inclined
to
take
part
with
Clifton
:
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
if
we
can
see
his
body
lying
on
the
rocks
below
,
we
may
believe
our
eyes
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
if
you
can
find
'
i
m
there
,
I
'll
gin
in
,
"
returned
David
;
"
but
take
my
word
for't
,
you
won't
.
<EOS>
""I
looked
down
a
short
time
since
,
"
observed
Clifton
,
"
but
it
was
then
too
dark
<EOS>
—
it
is
lighter
now
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
fact
day
had
been
steadily
advancing
,
and
the
dull
gray
of
morning
had
already
given
place
to
a
clear
,
sober
light
,
by
which
each
object
could
be
distinctly
seen
.
<EOS>
The
crimson
of
the
east
had
gradually
changed
to
a
more
bright
and
yellow
hue
,
and
there
was
conclusive
evidence
that
the
great
luminary
of
the
day
would
soon
show
his
welcome
visage
above
the
eastern
horizon
.
<EOS>
Each
of
the
party
,
Kate
excepted
,
now
approached
the
verge
of
the
abyss
,
and
cautiously
peered
down
into
the
chasm
.
<EOS>
The
light
here
was
dim
,
but
still
sufficient
for
the
purpose
required
.
<EOS>
A
small
pool
was
immediately
under
them
,
into
one
part
of
which
fell
the
cascade
before
mentioned
,
with
a
sort
of
gloomy
roar
.
<EOS>
The
outlines
of
the
rock
,
on
which
Moody
had
held
his
soliloquy
,
could
also
be
traced
—
appearing
in
the
meagre
light
,
to
the
excited
imaginations
of
most
,
as
the
demon
or
evil
genii
of
the
place
—
beyond
which
the
water
foamed
,
and
rushed
,
and
roared
continually
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
nothing
of
importance
could
be
noted
,
save
that
the
rocks
on
either
side
were
almost
smooth
,
perpendicular
,
and
slimy
.
<EOS>
"He
is
not
there
,
at
all
events
,
"
said
Danvers
,
as
,
after
gazing
down
some
five
minutes
,
he
,
with
most
of
the
party
,
drew
back
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
told
ye
<EOS>
so
,
"
returned
David
,
triumphautly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
gone
,
and
afore
you
know
it
,
will
have
the
Injins
upon
us
,
sure
as
cats
jump
for
game
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
think
so
,
"
said
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"
That
we
can
not
see
his
body
,
is
no
evidence
he
is
not
dead
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
'
sposing
we
could
see
his
body
there
,
it
'd
be
the
best
evidence
that
he
arn't
no
where
else
,
"
rejoined
David
—
who
,
having
got
the
notion
in
his
head
,
and
being
of
a
rather
dogged
disposition
,
was
now
fully
determined
that
Moody
should
be
alive
,
that
he
might
prove
himself
correct
in
his
surmises
.
<EOS>
We
see
a
great
many
David
Grants
every
day
.
<EOS>
"You
say
true
,
David
,
"
answered
Clifton
,
smiling
,
"
that
if
the
body
of
my
brother
,
as
Luther
called
him
,
was
there
,
it
would
not
be
elsewhere
;
but
I
am
astonished
,
David
,
that
a
man
of
your
reputation
as
a
scout
,
should
resort
to
a
logic
so
shallow
,
to
conceal
what
your
good
sense
tells
you
is
the
true
state
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
That
Moody
is
not
there
,
every
one
can
see
;
and
that
he
could
not
be
there
,
you
know
as
well
as
I
;
for
no
dead
body
could
long
remain
stationary
in
that
rushing
current
.
<EOS>
If
you
follow
down
the
stream
,
you
will
doubtless
find
his
remains
somewhere
,
and
dead
enough
in
all
conscience
.
"David
<EOS>
hung
his
head
,
a
little
ashamed
;
for
he
saw
at
once
that
his
shallow
reasoning
was
not
likely
to
give
him
any
extra
reputation
for
wisdom
;
yet
determined
not
to
yield
the
point
too
easy
,
or
,
in
sooth
,
until
forced
from
it
by
stubborn
fact
,
he
replied
,
a
little
sullenly:"As
I
'd
like
to
be
sure
he
's
dead
,
may
be
it
'd
be
no
harm
in
looking
along
further
down
.
<EOS>
""Agreed
,
"
said
Clifton
;
who
,
for
two
reasons
,
wished
to
find
the
body
of
his
brother
.
<EOS>
First
,
to
destroy
that
superstitious
fear
,
which
he
now
,
to
his
regret
,
perceived
was
fast
getting
a
hold
on
the
minds
of
all
,
Danvers
not
excepted
;
and
secondly
,
that
he
might
,
in
a
rude
way
,
give
him
Christian
burial
.
<EOS>
"Kate
<EOS>
,
"
he
continued
,
turning
to
her
,
"
you
had
better
go
into
the
cave
and
take
some
refreshment
.
<EOS>
""But
,
dear
Ernest
—
"
began
Kate
,
timidly
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
no
fears
,
sweet
one
<EOS>
;
we
are
only
going
a
short
distance
,
to
search
for
the
body
of
Moody
,
and
will
soon
return
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Ichabod
,
here
,
will
stay
and
keep
you
company
.
<EOS>
""O
,
most
sartinly
,
"
answered
the
gardener
,
his
small
eyes
brightening
with
delight
;
"
nothing
could
n't
suit
me
better
;
and
I
'll
go
with
my
litle
pet
straightway
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
no
further
objection
was
preferred
by
Kate
,
Clifton
now
ascended
the
difficult
path
,
which
led
up
the
brow
of
the
cliff
,
followed
by
David
,
Danvers
,
and
the
others
,
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Reaching
the
platform
before
noticed
,
the
party
at
once
leaped
across
the
narrowchasm
on
the
opposite
side
,
and
kept
along
the
hill
for
some
two
hundred
yards
,
when
they
came
to
a
spot
sufficiently
shelving
to
enable
them
to
descend
to
the
plain
below
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
not
their
immediate
design
—
that
being
to
approach
the
stream
at
the
foot
of
the
precipice
,
and
continue
,
if
possible
,
along
its
margin
,
so
as
to
note
distinctly
every
object
in
its
bed
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
brink
of
the
stream
was
gained
,
at
the
point
where
the
second
cascade
was
formed
,
and
where
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
Moody
had
such
a
narrow
escape
.
<EOS>
A
large
rock
,
which
here
jutted
in
toward
the
opposite
bank
,
almost
over
the
falls
,
allowed
such
as
chose
to
venture
out
upon
it
,
a
complete
view
of
the
current
from
the
lower
to
the
upper
cascade
,
and
also
the
whole
extent
of
the
stream
below
the
falls
to
the
plain
,
where
it
again
became
lost
in
its
serpentine
course
toward
the
Little
Miami
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
what
do
you
think
now
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Clifton
of
the
scout
,
as
with
the
latter
he
ventured
upon
the
rock
,
and
made
an
examination
with
his
eyes
in
both
directions
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
I
think
we
han't
found
the
body
yet
,
"
replied
David
,
laconically
.
<EOS>
"True
<EOS>
;
but
do
n't
you
see
there
was
no
chance
for
Moody
to
escape
with
life
.
<EOS>
The
rocks
above
here
are
precipitious
and
slippery
,
so
that
it
is
impossible
he
should
have
ascended
them
,
even
if
he
escaped
with
life
in
the
first
instance
;
and
certainly
no
sensible
man
would
contend
that
he
could
go
over
this
fall
and
not
be
dashed
to
pieces
on
those
frowning
rocks
.
<EOS>
"It
did
in
truth
appear
,
viewing
the
spot
from
where
our
party
stood
,
as
if
no
being
could
pass
the
cascade
and
survive
the
fall
;
for
the
pool
,
into
which
it
will
be
remembered
Moody
descended
,
was
very
small
—
the
depth
they
could
not
know
—
and
entirely
surrounded
by
black
rocks
,
on
which
much
of
the
water
fell
with
a
force
sufficient
to
throw
a
fine
spray
to
the
distance
of
several
feet
.
<EOS>
We
can
only
account
for
this
small
,
deep
pool
,
by
supposing
that
,
at
one
time
,
the
water
fell
directly
into
it
;
and
the
earth
just
at
that
spot
,
not
being
protected
by
rocks
,
as
was
the
case
elsewhere
,
had
gradually
been
hollowed
out
,
and
so
remained
;
while
the
running
water
,
wearing
away
the
precipice
over
which
it
tumbled
,
had
thus
caused
it
to
recede
several
inches
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
know
about
passing
the
falls
,
"
said
David
,
rather
doggedly
,
in
reply
to
Clifton
,
after
having
gazed
upon
the
spot
until
he
felt
satisfied
himself
that
the
young
officer
was
right
:
"
Do
n't
know
about
the
falls
,
one
way
or
t'other
<EOS>
;
but
all
I
've
got
to
say
is
,
I
'd
just
like
to
see
the
body
.
<EOS>
""Do
you
know
,
David
,
"
said
Clifton
,
smiling
,
"
that
I
think
you
would
make
a
good
preacher
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
so
,
lieutenant?""Because
you
would
be
bound
to
stick
to
your
text
.
<EOS>
Why
,
man
,
if
you
had
never
shown
any
more
sense
in
the
forest
,
than
you
have
in
this
matter
,
instead
of
being
called
a
great
scout
,
you
would
have
been
devoured
by
wolves
.
<EOS>
"Several
of
the
party
<EOS>
laughed
,
at
David
's
expense
,
who
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
You
will
see
in
time
who
is
right
.
<EOS>
""Well
<EOS>
,
"
answered
Clifton
,
"
as
the
body
is
not
hereabouts
,
we
will
search
for
it
below
,
on
the
plain
;
and
speedily
,
too
—
for
I
see
the
sun
is
peeping
over
the
hill
yonder
,
and
we
must
soon
be
on
our
journey
homeward
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
party
now
descended
to
the
plain
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
deeply
engaged
in
searching
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
,
for
the
body
of
one
,
who
,
even
at
that
moment
,
was
plotting
their
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
They
had
entered
a
swampy
thicket
,
where
the
water
moved
sluggishly
,
and
each
was
engaged
with
a
pole
in
raking
the
bottom
for
the
body
,
which
they
supposed
must
have
sunk
there
—
when
suddenly
a
faint
scream
was
heard
in
the
distance
,
and
,
at
the
same
moment
,
ere
any
one
had
time
for
thought
or
action
,
fierce
yells
resounded
on
all
sides
,
and
each
found
himself
in
the
grasp
of
a
powerful
savage
.

<EOS>
We
left
the
Indians
,
on
their
return
to
harrass
,
murder
,
or
capture
the
whites
,
under
the
guidance
of
Moody
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
course
the
latter
party
would
take
,
on
leaving
the
cave
—
though
in
all
probability
they
would
forthwith
seek
the
plain
—
Moody
at
once
led
his
warriors
to
a
dense
thicket
,
where
they
might
be
able
to
watch
the
movements
of
their
foes
,
and
shape
their
proceedings
accordingly
.
<EOS>
As
chance
would
have
it
,
he
had
selected
the
very
thicket
where
we
have
seen
our
friends
venture
to
search
for
his
body
—
<EOS>
little
dreaming
,
at
the
time
,
that
they
were
entering
an
ambuscade
.
<EOS>
This
thicket
,
Moody
and
his
party
had
reached
,
stealthily
,
some
two
hours
before
day
-
break
,
when
,
in
company
with
Unkee
,
a
renowned
scout
or
runner
,
he
had
left
the
main
body
there
,
and
set
off
to
reconnoiter
,
and
gain
intelligence
that
should
determine
his
future
movements
.
<EOS>
Fearfullest
his
intended
victims
might
have
already
escaped
,
he
had
,
at
some
risk
,
approached
the
cave
,
and
even
ventured
into
it
far
enough
to
hear
the
tread
of
the
sentinel
,
as
he
paced
to
to
and
fro
on
his
patrol
of
duty
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
all
was
working
to
his
desire
,
he
had
then
noiselessly
glided
away
,
and
,
with
his
Indian
companion
,
had
sought
out
a
convenient
cover
to
await
daylight
,
and
take
advantage
of
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Unlike
the
Indians
,
who
in
general
have
little
to
say
,
Moody
knew
that
the
whites
,
feeling
perfectly
secure
,
would
naturally
talk
over
their
plans
,
before
proceeding
to
put
them
in
execution
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
he
been
mistaken
.
<EOS>
From
his
place
of
concealment
,
on
the
brow
of
the
upper
precipice
,
which
the
reader
will
remember
walled
the
platform
on
the
east
,
he
had
been
enabled
,
by
being
exactly
over
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
not
only
to
see
every
one
that
came
out
,
but
also
to
understand
every
word
that
had
been
spoken
outside
.
<EOS>
With
infinite
delight
he
had
heard
the
remarks
of
David
,
and
watched
the
party
searching
for
his
remains
in
the
chasm
below
;
and
when
the
proposition
had
been
made
to
continue
down
the
stream
until
his
body
should
be
found
,
his
exultation
knew
no
bounds
.
<EOS>
"They
shall
find
my
body
,
"
he
said
to
himself
;
"
but
in
a
different
form
and
place
from
what
they
expect
.
<EOS>
"Then
turning
to
Unkee
,
he
briefly
recounted
,
in
a
whisper
;
the
substance
of
what
he
had
overheard
,
and
dispatched
him
to
inform
the
Indians
,
and
caution
them
to
remain
concealed
where
they
were
,
until
the
whites
,
as
he
foresaw
they
would
,
should
have
put
themselves
in
their
power
.
<EOS>
Just
as
Unkee
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
,
Moody
heard
Clifton
request
Kate
to
enter
the
cave
,
with
only
Ichabod
for
her
companion
;
and
turning
once
more
to
the
savage
,
while
his
eyes
gleamed
like
two
balls
of
fire
at
his
anticipated
feast
of
vengeance
,
he
gave
him
orders
to
avoid
the
whites
,
and
return
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
there
to
await
a
signal
from
him
,
or
be
guided
by
circumstances
—
but
do
what
he
might
,
in
no
case
to
harm
the
pale
-
face
maiden
.
<EOS>
Had
Moody
been
granted
the
privilege
and
power
of
arranging
every
thing
for
his
premeditated
vengeance
to
suit
himself
,
he
felt
confident
he
would
have
failed
in
fixing
matters
as
satisfactorily
as
a
simple
train
of
circumstances
had
now
done
for
him
.
<EOS>
Not
the
least
important
of
all
,
was
the
absence
of
Luther
,
which
he
had
learned
from
the
conversation
,
and
which
otherwise
must
have
disconcerted
his
plans
materially
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Unkee
was
gone
,
and
he
had
seen
the
party
of
Clifton
on
the
point
of
starting
,
he
withdrew
from
his
place
of
concealment
,
and
moving
along
the
ridge
of
the
hill
a
short
distance
,
descended
on
the
eastern
side
,
some
seventy
-
five
or
a
hundred
yards
,
or
until
he
came
to
a
small
cluster
of
bushes
.
<EOS>
Here
he
paused
for
a
moment
,
while
a
grim
smile
played
over
his
features
—
and
then
parting
the
bushes
with
his
hands
,
he
exposed
to
view
a
hole
of
some
two
feet
in
diameter
,
that
apparently
led
deep
into
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Without
stopping
to
examine
this
,
Moody
threw
himself
flatwise
upon
the
ground
,
and
soon
disappeared
into
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
The
descent
of
the
hole
was
just
sufficient
to
render
his
movements
easy
,
and
in
less
than
two
minutes
,
he
had
penetrated
the
hill
some
fifty
feet
.
<EOS>
Here
the
aperture
gradually
enlarged
,
and
he
was
shortly
enabled
to
crawl
along
upon
his
hands
and
knees
.
<EOS>
This
he
did
,
some
ten
feet
further
,
when
he
came
to
a
sort
of
window
<EOS>
,
that
looked
directly
into
the
cavern
so
lately
occupied
by
our
friends
.
<EOS>
Here
,
then
,
was
an
access
to
the
cave
,
of
which
Clifton
and
his
party
knew
nothing
—
otherwise
,
the
disappearance
of
Luther
might
have
been
accounted
for
without
setting
the
natural
laws
of
reason
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
Luther
,
who
took
advantage
of
every
circumstance
calculated
to
heighten
the
superstitious
feeling
which
he
was
aware
pervaded
the
minds
of
most
,
had
doubtless
visited
this
place
before
,
and
knowing
of
this
outlet
,
had
taken
this
means
,
when
the
attention
of
each
was
drawn
in
another
direction
,
to
leave
his
friends
in
his
usually
abrupt
and
mysterious
manner
.
<EOS>
Had
he
not
known
of
this
outlet
,
it
is
hardly
probable
<EOS>
he
would
have
found
it
so
opportunely
;
for
being
in
a
distant
and
dark
corner
of
the
cave
,
ten
chances
to
one
<EOS>
but
it
had
been
completely
overlooked
by
any
one
on
the
search
for
it
—
<EOS>
so
nicely
did
the
aperture
,
which
was
some
four
feet
above
the
floor
of
the
cave
,
blend
in
color
and
appearance
with
the
solid
rocks
surrounding
it
.
<EOS>
How
this
became
known
to
both
Luther
and
Moody
,
will
perhaps
forever
remain
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
Stopping
at
this
aperture
or
window
—
as
,
from
its
shape
,
we
have
perhaps
more
appropriately
named
it
—
the
keen
eyes
of
Moody
roved
around
the
dark
vault
,
in
search
of
Kate
and
the
gardener
,
neither
of
whom
had
as
yet
made
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
From
his
position
,
Moody
could
now
see
everything
in
the
cave
,
and
yet
himself
remain
unseen
.
<EOS>
This
was
owing
to
the
feeble
light
,
which
,
coming
through
the
fissure
of
the
cave
,
was
sufficient
to
illume
somewhat
its
immediate
vicinity
,
but
insufficient
to
remove
the
dense
vail
of
darkness
behind
which
he
was
concealed
.
<EOS>
Nearly
half
an
hour
elapsed
,
and
Moody
was
becoming
impatient
,
when
voices
were
heard
,
and
presently
Kate
and
Ichabod
appeared
,
entering
the
cave
from
the
larger
and
more
usual
outlet
.
<EOS>
"O
,
the
torch
is
out
,
"
exclaimed
Kate
,
as
she
came
in
view
of
the
interior
;
"
and
it
seems
so
dark
and
gloomy
here
—
let
us
go
back
,
Icha
.
<EOS>
""Better
<EOS>
stay
here
,
my
little
pet
,
until
they
comes
back
,
"
answered
the
gardener
;
"
'cause
he
said
so
,
and
I
know
as
how
you
'd
like
to
mind
him
;
and
besides
,
I
reckon
'
t
an't
burnt
out
,
and
I
can
light
it
agin
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
""Never
<EOS>
mind
,
Icha
;
I
can
soon
get
used
to
the
darkness
;
in
fact
,
I
can
see
a
little
now
;
and
it
is
better
,
perhaps
,
that
we
remain
concealed
,
in
case
anything
should
happen
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
do
n't
think
there
's
any
danger
,
my
little
pet
?
"
rejoined
Ichabod
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
no
,
I
hope
there
is
none
—
<EOS>
but
then
you
heard
what
David
said
.
<EOS>
""True
,
replied
Ichabod
,
who
was
strongly
inclined
to
believe
in
the
marvelous
:
"
<EOS>
True
,
Miss
Kate
,
I
heerd
what
he
said
,
and
it
made
me
feel
queer
at
the
time—'cause
<EOS>
I
remembered
as
how
,
when
I
fired
,
the
smoke
took
the
shape
of
Luther
,
and
I
thought
maybe
he
was
a
spirit
,
and
got
away
in
that
way
,
and
had
something
to
do
with
Moody
.
<EOS>
But
since
I
've
thought
it
all
over
,
I
know
it
<EOS>
could'nt
<EOS>
ha
'
been
so
;
<EOS>
for
if
ever
I
shot
any
body
in
my
life
,
it
was
that
same
infernal
scoundrel
Moody
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
superstitious
,
Icha
,
"
answered
Kate
,
"
and
consequently
do
not
fear
the
interference
of
Luther
in
any
unnatural
manner
;
though
,
I
must
own
,
he
did
leave
here
mysteriously
;
but
then
,
in
all
probability
,
there
was
a
way
for
him
to
get
out
in
a
very
simple
manner
;
and
<EOS>
when
dear
Ernest
returns
(
Kate
did
not
fear
to
apply
endearing
epithets
before
the
simple
-
minded
gardener
)
,
I
intend
he
shall
search
the
cave
for
another
outlet
.
<EOS>
All
I
fear
is
,
that
Moody
might
,
somehow
,
have
managed
to
escape
alone
and
unaided
,
and
that
he
will
return
with
the
Indians
to
murder
or
make
us
prisoners
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
generally
miss
my
mark
,
"
said
Ichabod
,
in
reply
;
"
and
if
that
Necromancer
did
n't
interfere
,
I
'm
sartain
<EOS>
I
killed
him
—
just
as
sartain—""Hark
!
<EOS>
"
interrupted
Kate
,
holding
up
her
plump
,
snowy
hand
,
and
bending
her
head
forward
in
a
listening
attitude
<EOS>
;
"
methought
I
heard
a
noise
.
<EOS>
""It
was
n't
nothing
<EOS>
,
I
reckons
,
"
returned
the
gardener
,
after
a
short
pause
,
during
which
he
had
listened
and
peered
cautiously
about
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
nothing
,
I
reckons
,
but
your
fears
.
<EOS>
I
've
often
got
skeered
the
same
way
,
when
I
've
been
alone
,
and
a
thinking
about
danger
—
though
I
never
knowed
anything
to
come
on't
.
<EOS>
Well
,
as
I
's
a
saying
'bout
that
villain
Moody
,
I
know
I
killed
him
,
just
as
sartain
as—""I
kill
you
now
,
"
said
a
deep
voice
in
his
ear
;
and
at
the
same
moment
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
head
laid
the
gardener
senseless
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Kate
uttered
a
terrible
scream
,
and
sprang
back
in
real
terror
.
"Moody
!
<EOS>
"
she
shrieked
,
"
can
the
grave
give
up
its
dead
?
<EOS>
are
you
really
flesh
and
blood
?
<EOS>
or
do
you
hold
a
charmed
life?""Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
laughed
Moody
,
triumphantly
;
"
and
so
,
my
pretty
bird
<EOS>
,
I
have
caught
you
again
,
have
I
?
<EOS>
Well
,
`
every
dog
must
have
his
day
,
'
you
know
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Moody
said
this
,
he
walked
forward
,
as
if
to
take
hold
of
Kate
,
who
retreated
,
screaming
,
"
Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
"
<EOS>
in
the
most
piteous
tones
imaginable
.
<EOS>
"Spare
<EOS>
your
lungs
,
my
pretty
dove
,
"
said
Moody
,
with
a
coarse
laugh
;
"
for
you
will
need
them
to
plead
for
your
friends
;
besides
,
screaming
is
hard
work
,
and
can
do
you
no
good
.
"
<EOS>
Saying
which
,
he
darted
quickly
forward
and
grasped
her
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
"Villain
!
<EOS>
unhand
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
terrified
and
indignant
.
"
<EOS>
Unhand
me
,
and
begone
!
<EOS>
or
there
will
soon
be
those
here
to
make
you
tremble
.
<EOS>
""Never
<EOS>
you
fear
for
me
,
my
pretty
one
;
I
am
perfectly
aware
of
what
I
am
doing
,
"
replied
Moody
,
with
another
coarse
laugh
;
"
and
as
for
your
friends—""Well
,
well
—
what
of
them
?
"
cried
Kate
,
breathlessly
,
as
the
other
paused
.
<EOS>
"They
are
by
this
time
all
dead
,
or
prisoners
,
"
concluded
Moody
,
with
another
laugh
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
poor
Kate
,
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
,
while
her
whole
frame
shook
convulsively
.
<EOS>
Moody
now
released
his
hold
,
and
folding
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
stood
,
for
some
moments
,
regarding
his
terrified
captive
in
stern
silence
—
during
which
time
,
many
wild
,
dark
thoughts
,
concerning
the
punishment
of
her
and
her
lover
,
passed
through
his
mind
.
<EOS>
These
moments
had
nigh
proved
his
last
;
for
,
regaining
his
senses
,
and
perceiving
how
matters
were
,
Ichabod
had
drawn
his
knife
from
its
sheath
,
and
creeping
up
stealthily
behind
Moody
,
was
just
in
the
act
of
plunging
it
into
his
back
,
when
his
arms
were
suddenly
grasped
from
behind
,
the
knife
was
wrenched
from
his
hands
,
and
he
found
himself
the
prisoner
of
a
fierce
savage
.
<EOS>
Moody
started
,
turned
,
and
comprehending
all
at
a
glance
,
said
,
quietly
,
in
Shawanoe:"Unkee
,
you
have
saved
my
life
,
and
I
shall
not
soon
forget
it
.
""Ugh
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
Indian
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Unkee
always
thought
great
chief
more
guarded
.
<EOS>
""He
's
only
a
squaw
,
"
returned
Moody
,
contemptuously
,
pointing
to
Ichabod
.
<EOS>
"
I
knocked
him
down
first
and
then
forgot
him
.
<EOS>
True
,
he
might
have
taken
my
life
;
and
so
might
a
squaw
,
with
the
same
opportunity
.
<EOS>
I
must
deal
with
him
,
nevertheless
;
for
twice
has
he
shot
at
me
before
this
,
and
wounded
me
once
in
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Bind
him
,
Unkee!"The
Indian
proceeded
to
obey
his
superior
,
with
that
sort
of
dogged
coolness
,
if
we
may
so
express
it
,
which
one
might
be
supposed
to
exercise
in
fastening
a
rope
to
a
log
.
<EOS>
Once
,
and
once
only
,
when
Ichabod
had
nearly
effected
his
escape
,
the
eyes
of
the
Indian
brightened
with
a
fierce
gleam
,
and
his
hand
,
involuntarily
as
it
were
,
sought
his
tomahawk
;
but
the
next
moment
his
countenance
assumed
its
wonted
,
stolid
expression
,
and
he
continued
his
occupation
as
coolly
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Since
quitting
Moody
,
Unkee
had
obeyed
his
orders
,
and
returned
some
minutes
before
.
<EOS>
On
cautiously
making
his
appearance
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cave
,
he
had
discovered
Kate
and
Ichabod
conversing
together
outside
—
for
,
as
the
reader
is
aware
,
they
did
not
immediately
enter
the
cave
on
the
departure
of
Clifton
—
and
as
he
knew
that
to
be
seen
was
to
give
the
alarm
,
he
instantly
concealed
himself
where
he
could
secretly
watch
their
movements
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
them
enter
at
last
,
and
,
after
waiting
what
he
conceived
to
be
a
sufficient
length
of
time
,
had
stealthily
approached
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
when
he
gained
the
mouth
of
the
cave
,
the
scream
of
Kate
reached
his
ears
.
<EOS>
The
rest
the
reader
knows
.
<EOS>
Having
crossed
the
arms
of
Ichahod
on
his
back
,
secured
them
there
with
strong
ligatures
of
deerskin
,
and
disarmed
him
altogether
,
Unkee
turned
to
Moody
,
with
a
grunt
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
What
next?"So
at
least
the
latter
interpreted
it
,
and
answered:"Keep
him
a
close
prisoner
,
Unkee
,
and
we
will
presently
join
our
companions
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
turning
to
Kate
,
who
still
stood
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
,
regardless
of
what
was
taking
place
around
her
,
he
added
,
in
English
,
somewhat
sternly:"Come
,
my
fair
beauty
,
and
I
will
conduct
you
to
your
friends
,
and
then
I
will
tell
you
more
.
<EOS>
"Kate
,
who
knew
that
resistance
would
be
of
no
avail
,
as
would
neither
sighs
,
tears
nor
prayers
,
raised
her
face
,
and
exhibited
features
as
calm
,
and
apparently
as
rigid
,
as
marble
.
<EOS>
As
her
eye
for
the
first
time
fell
upon
the
savage
,
there
was
a
slight
start
,
and
look
of
alarm
;
but
this
quickly
passed
;
and
she
again
appeared
as
cold
and
indifferent
as
a
bronze
statue
.
<EOS>
Moody
gazed
upon
her
with
surprise
,
for
he
had
expected
to
hear
her
shriek
in
terror
;
and
from
that
moment
,
all
his
former
plans
of
vengeance
were
changed
to
others
,
that
would
,
perhaps
,
prove
none
the
less
agreeable
to
the
fair
being
before
him
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
,
heightened
as
it
was
by
the
excitement
under
which
she
was
inwardly
laboring
,
and
her
strong
mind
,
as
shown
in
her
manner
of
concealing
her
feelings
,
revived
his
old
passion
,
and
he
had
already
determined
that
she
should
grace
his
wigwam
in
the
capacity
of
a
wife
or
squaw
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
in
real
beauty
,
that
rarely
fails
to
appeal
to
the
passions
,
if
not
to
the
heart
,
of
those
who
oppress
it
;
and
to
this
it
is
more
than
probable
that
Kate
Clarendon
owed
her
honor
,
if
not
her
life
.
<EOS>
Nothing
of
this
,
however
,
was
told
to
Kate
,
who
,
in
consequence
,
remained
in
terrible
suspense
as
to
what
would
be
her
doom
.
<EOS>
Turning
to
the
Indian
,
Moody
motioned
him
to
follow
with
his
prisoner
;
and
then
taking
Kate
by
the
hand
,
with
something
of
more
respect
than
he
had
formerly
displayed
,
he
quietly
led
her
out
of
the
cave
—
she
making
not
the
least
resistance
.
<EOS>
When
the
captors
and
their
captives
had
gained
the
clear
sunlight
—
which
now
fell
warmly
over
the
earth
,
drying
up
the
dew
,
and
silvering
the
streams
,
kissing
the
flowers
,
and
making
the
earth
appear
beautiful
—
Moody
motioned
with
one
hand
for
Kate
to
ascend
the
rude
staircase
to
the
platform
above
;
and
still
keeping
his
hold
with
the
other
,
he
assisted
her
up
the
difficult
acclivity
.
<EOS>
Unkee
and
his
prisoner
followed
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
both
parties
stood
upon
the
point
whence
they
could
command
a
view
of
all
below
.
<EOS>
Gazing
around
him
,
and
settling
his
eye
at
last
upon
a
particular
spot
,
Moody
stood
for
a
moment
,
and
then
pointing
forward
with
his
finger
,
as
if
to
indicate
the
way
,
he
led
Kate
across
the
chasm
,
accompanied
by
the
other
two
,
and
all
together
descended
the
ridge
in
silence
.

<EOS>
We
left
Clifton
and
his
friends
in
a
rather
serious
predicament
,
and
to
them
we
must
now
return
.
<EOS>
The
attention
of
the
whites
,
as
the
reader
is
aware
,
was
solely
directed
to
finding
the
body
of
Moody
;
and
this
will
account
for
their
being
taken
so
wholly
unguarded
;
though
it
may
be
questioned
if
they
would
not
have
been
taken
equally
by
surprise
,
had
they
been
keenly
on
the
look
-
out
for
savages
—
so
effectually
had
the
latter
secreted
themselves
in
the
thicket
.
<EOS>
Had
they
suspected
an
ambuscade
,
however
,
their
hands
and
weapons
would
have
been
ready
for
the
conflict
,
and
the
result
would
have
been
widely
different
from
what
it
was
in
the
present
case
.
<EOS>
There
were
nine
savages
in
all
,
Unkee
being
away
,
and
seven
whites
—
every
one
of
whom
was
engaged
with
a
pole
in
raking
the
river
at
the
moment
when
he
was
captured
.
<EOS>
This
the
Indians
,
from
the
information
given
by
Unkee
,
had
anticipated
,
and
had
laid
their
plans
accordingly
.
<EOS>
As
the
whites
approached
,
each
Indian
singled
out
his
man
,
leaving
two
of
their
party
in
readiness
to
close
in
,
in
case
any
one
should
meet
with
more
than
his
match
—
or
fire
upon
and
follow
the
fugitive
,
in
case
one
of
the
other
party
made
his
escape
.
<EOS>
At
a
preconcerted
signal
,
each
sprang
forward
,
and
throwing
his
arms
around
his
antagonist
,
secured
him
,
with
but
one
exception
,
without
a
single
blow
being
struck
in
defense
,
and
at
the
precise
moment
,
too
,
when
the
scream
of
Kate
announced
her
,
as
was
afterward
ascertained
,
a
prisoner
also
.
<EOS>
The
exception
alluded
to
,
was
Clifton
.
<EOS>
Quick
witted
,
and
possessed
of
great
presence
of
mind
,
no
sooner
did
he
hear
the
yells
,
and
feel
his
arms
grasped
from
behind
,
than
,
comprehending
how
matters
were
,
he
made
a
feint
to
yield
,
which
threw
the
Indian
somewhat
off
his
guard
,
and
then
suddenly
bounding
forward
,
cleared
himself
of
his
captor
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
the
tomahawk
of
the
savage
was
gleaming
before
his
eyes
,
and
the
next
moment
it
would
have
been
buried
in
his
skull
,
had
not
his
great
dexterity
again
saved
him
.
<EOS>
Drawing
his
knife
,
bending
his
head
forward
,
and
springing
to
the
Indian
all
at
the
same
time
,
he
avoided
the
weapon
of
the
latter
,
which
struck
beyond
him
,
and
buried
his
own
in
the
heart
of
his
foe
.
<EOS>
The
Indian
uttered
a
groan
,
and
sunk
down
a
corpse
.
<EOS>
Turning
as
quick
as
lightning
,
our
hero
saw
the
two
others
rushing
toward
him
,
weapons
in
hand
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
was
two
paces
in
advance
of
his
companion
;
and
hastily
drawing
his
pistol
,
he
shot
him
through
the
breast
.
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
left
to
contend
with
—
for
the
rest
were
engaged
in
mastering
the
whites
,
who
,
perceiving
his
successful
resistance
,
had
become
very
refractory
—
and
taking
a
hasty
aim
with
his
other
pistol
,
the
young
officer
pulled
the
trigger
.
<EOS>
A
flash
in
the
pan
saved
the
life
of
his
adversary
;
and
the
next
moment
the
long
war
-
club
carried
by
Mugwa
laid
him
prostrate
on
the
earth
.
"Ugh
!
"
<EOS>
grunted
the
chief
,
as
he
bent
over
Clifton
to
secure
his
hands
,
speaking
in
tolerable
English
;
"
great
warrior
—
make
good
Indian
;
"
and
instead
of
a
cloud
of
anger
,
the
face
of
this
savage
dis
played
an
expression
of
admiration
,
at
the
successful
daring
and
firmness
of
his
captive
.
<EOS>
For
a
minute
or
two
,
Clifton
lay
stunned
by
the
blow
;
and
then
regained
his
senses
,
only
to
find
himself
and
friends
disarmed
and
bound
,
with
their
hideous
captors
standing
around
,
and
gazing
upon
them
with
looks
of
savage
exultation
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
he
thought
of
Kate
,
and
his
anguish
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
now
conducted
their
prisoners
out
of
the
thicket
,
and
selecting
a
spot
in
the
woods
,
a
few
yards
distant
,
where
there
chanced
to
be
but
little
underbush
,
made
them
fast
,
each
to
a
separate
tree
,
and
then
collected
together
by
themselves
,
apparently
to
take
council
regarding
their
next
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Presently
four
of
the
party
repaired
to
the
thicket
,
and
returned
with
the
two
dead
bodies
—
the
Indian
shot
by
Clifton
having
just
breathed
his
last
.
<EOS>
Placing
the
dead
upon
the
ground
,
side
by
side
,
the
whole
company
formed
a
circle
round
them
,
and
taking
hold
of
hands
,
commenced
chanting
words
wholly
unintelligible
to
our
friends
,
who
gazed
upon
them
with
a
sort
of
painful
curiosity
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
some
five
minutes
passed
,
without
a
word
being
spoken
on
the
part
of
the
whites
,
when
suddenly
David
called
out:"I
say
,
Lieutenant!""Well
?
"
answered
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"What
d
'
<EOS>
ye
think
'bout
the
business
now?""Why
,
what
should
I
think?""Do
n't
know
—
know
best
yourself
;
but
have
ye
concluded
that
Moody
's
living
yet?""Of
course
not
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
he
should
have
escaped
the
peril
I
pointed
out
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
then
,
all
I
've
got
to
say
is
,
that
his
ghost
's
got
a
powerful
flesh
and
blood
look
.
<EOS>
""Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
mean
,
David
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Clifton
,
quickly
,
while
every
one
turned
his
head
—
the
only
part
of
his
person
now
at
liberty
—
toward
the
scout
,
anxious
for
an
explanation
of
his
startling
words
.
<EOS>
David
replied
only
by
nodding
his
head
mysteriously
,
in
a
certain
direction
;
and
following
that
direction
with
their
eyes
,
the
faces
of
all
suddenly
blanched
,
and
each
tongue
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
Within
full
view
appeared
Moody
,
approaching
the
Indians
,
leading
Kate
by
the
hand
,
and
followed
by
Unkee
and
the
gardener
.
<EOS>
"Good
God
!
"
groaned
Clifton
,
"
can
it
be
possible
that
my
eyes
do
not
deceive
me
—
that
Moody
is
still
living
—
and
Kate
,
sweet
Kate
,
again
in
his
power!""'Spect
if
you
do
n't
believe
your
eyes
,
you
'll
soon
have
some
other
sense
that
'll
give
you
a
powerful
inclination
that
way
,
"
remarked
David
,
rather
drily
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
understand
the
affair
,
"
said
Danvers
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
something
very
mysterious
in
his
escape
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
jest
believe
it
's
the
devil
's
work
,
"
observed
another
;
"
and
that
's
the
reason
Icha
's
balls
would
n't
kill
.
<EOS>
If
ever
I
git
a
chance
at
him
,
I
'll
put
in
some
silver
slugs
,
and
try
the
virtue
of
them
.
<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
such
and
similar
remarks
were
passing
among
the
whites
,
Moody
and
his
party
approached
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
As
he
came
up
,
they
made
a
halt
in
their
ceremony
,
and
uttering
grunts
of
approbation
at
his
success
,
opened
the
ring
for
him
to
enter
.
<EOS>
As
Kate
,
whom
he
still
held
by
the
hand
,
came
suddenly
upon
the
dead
and
bloody
bodies
of
the
Indians
,
slain
by
the
hand
of
her
lover
,
she
gave
an
involuntary
start
,
and
uttered
a
slight
exclamation
of
horror
.
<EOS>
Moody
seemed
taken
equally
by
surprise
,
for
his
features
slightly
paled
,
and
he
turned
his
face
quickly
toward
the
chief
with
a
look
of
inquiry
.
<EOS>
With
Unkee
,
however
,
it
was
different
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
Indian
out
and
out
,
and
had
been
taught
to
school
his
feelings
and
passions
,
so
as
not
to
betray
surprise
at
any
thing
—
a
custom
which
is
held
by
the
savages
to
be
a
great
virtue
.
<EOS>
As
he
came
up
to
his
dead
companions
,
therefore
,
he
looked
down
upon
them
calmly
,
without
changing
a
muscle
,
as
though
it
were
the
most
common
-
place
sight
in
the
world
,
and
one
he
had
expected
to
behold
.
<EOS>
"Who
has
done
this
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Moody
,
in
the
Indian
dialect
,
after
waiting
a
sufficient
time
for
Mugwa
to
make
an
opening
remark
.
<EOS>
"The
chief
of
the
pale
-
faces
,
"
replied
the
latter
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
gleam
of
ferocity
now
shot
athwart
the
dark
features
of
the
questioner
,
and
laying
his
hand
upon
a
weapon
in
his
belt
,
he
rejoined
,
quickly:"Then
he
must
die
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
my
brother
be
not
hasty
,
"
returned
Mugwa
;
"
for
the
fates
of
all
must
be
decided
by
council
.
<EOS>
If
the
pale
-
face
chief
be
doomed
to
die
,
it
must
not
be
by
the
tomahawk
.
<EOS>
""True
,
chief
<EOS>
,
"
answered
Moody
,
with
a
grim
smile
,
"
I
had
nigh
forgotten
your
pleasant
Indian
customs
of
the
stake
and
torture
.
<EOS>
""Mugwa
<EOS>
deems
him
worthy
of
them
all
,
"
pursued
the
chief
;
"
for
he
is
a
great
brave
,
and
no
Indian
warrior
could
have
done
more
.
<EOS>
The
chief
of
the
Piquas
could
almost
call
him
brother
,
too
.
<EOS>
"This
was
alluding
in
a
rather
obscure
manner
to
the
design
which
had
previously
entered
the
head
of
the
"
Bear
,
"
of
making
an
Indian
of
Clifton
,
and
was
thus
thrown
out
as
a
sort
of
feeler
,
to
learn
the
impression
it
would
produce
upon
Moody
.
<EOS>
As
he
heard
it
,
the
outcast
started
,
and
exclaimed
vehemently:"No
,
Mugwa
,
he
must
die
!
"
<EOS>
The
next
moment
a
new
idea
took
possession
of
his
brain
,
and
he
added
,
immediately
,
in
a
lower
tone—"That
is
,
perhaps
<EOS>
;
I
will
see
;
I
will
consider
,
Mugwa
.
<EOS>
But
go
on
with
your
ceremony
.
<EOS>
I
would
join
you
,
only
that
I
have
important
matters
to
which
I
must
attend
;
and
turning
away
abruptly
<EOS>
,
he
led
Kate
out
of
the
circle
,
and
some
distance
apart
from
all
.
<EOS>
"You
have
seen
,
"
he
began
,
addressing
himself
to
our
heroine
,
and
nodding
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
circle
of
savages
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
,
"
answered
Kate
calmly
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
still
see
,
"
pursued
Moody
,
pointing
his
finger
in
the
opposite
direction
,
and
toward
the
captives
.
<EOS>
Kate
followed
the
motion
with
her
eyes
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
became
aware
of
the
capture
of
her
friends
—
of
the
complete
triumph
of
her
foes
—
and
in
a
moment
her
heart
sunk
,
her
features
grew
deadly
pale
,
a
sudden
nervous
weakness
seized
her
,
and
,
but
for
the
support
of
Moody
,
she
would
have
fallen
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Finding
the
Indians
by
themselves
,
around
the
dead
bodies
of
their
late
comrades
,
and
no
new
scalps
at
their
belts
,
Kate
had
believed
that
a
skirmish
had
ensued
in
which
her
friends
had
been
victorious
,
and
that
she
might
look
for
a
rescue
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
case
was
different
;
the
horrible
reality
had
broken
upon
her
like
a
thunder
-
bolt
;
they
were
all
prisoners
—
reserved
perhaps
for
the
torture
—
and
all
in
the
power
of
the
archdemon
by
her
side
,
from
whom
she
could
hope
for
no
mercy
.
<EOS>
Moody
watched
the
painful
expression
of
her
lovely
countenance
with
a
grim
smile
of
satisfaction
;
and
after
waiting
till
she
had
somewhat
recovered
her
composure
,
he
resumed:"You
see
I
am
now
master
of
all
.
<EOS>
Were
you
in
the
infernal
regions
of
the
damned
,
you
would
not
be
more
fully
in
the
power
of
the
arch
-
fiend
,
than
you
and
your
friends
are
now
in
mine
.
<EOS>
""I
am
aware
of
that
,
"
replied
Kate
.
"
<EOS>
and
more
<EOS>
—
I
think
the
comparison
aptly
made
.
<EOS>
""That
may
or
may
not
be
,
as
matters
turn
out
,
"
rejoined
Moody
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
led
you
hither
,
away
from
the
others
,
to
tell
you
something
of
importance
,
regarding
yourself
and
friends
,
and
from
your
replies
to
take
my
cue
of
conduct
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
on
,
"
returned
Kate
.
<EOS>
"You
noticed
those
dead
bodies?""I
did
.
<EOS>
""They
were
slain
by
the
hand
of
your
lover
,
Lieutenant
Clifton
,
and
,
according
to
old
Luther
's
story
,
my
once
brother
.
"Again
<EOS>
Kate
trembled
,
her
features
grew
deadly
pale
,
and
she
fairly
gasped
for
breath
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
see
you
comprehend
,
"
resumed
Moody
,
after
another
short
pause
;
"
and
I
am
glad
you
do
,
as
it
will
save
me
much
circumlocution
in
my
remarks
.
<EOS>
Now
mark
my
words
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
you
ceremony
of
the
Indians
is
over
and
their
dead
are
buried
from
their
sight
,
they
will
proceed
to
hold
council
,
regarding
the
disposal
of
their
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Now
you
know
something
of
Indian
nature
—
or
ought
to
,
at
least
—
and
are
doubtless
well
aware
that
,
when
they
are
angry
,
they
are
not
altogether
the
most
mild
and
placid
creatures
which
the
world
has
ever
produced
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
their
customs
are
somewhat
rough
—
particularly
when
they
decide
on
putting
a
captive
through
the
interesting
ceremony
of
being
roasted
alive
by
a
slow
fire
,
with
various
little
et
ceteras
,
in
the
way
of
amusement
—
such
as
shooting
powder
into
his
naked
body
—
filling
the
flesh
with
resinous
splinters
and
setting
fire
to
them
—
cutting
off
his
ears
and
tongue
—
punching
out
his
eyes
,
and—""For
God
's
sake
,
hold
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
covering
her
face
,
and
shuddering
with
horror
,
at
the
terrible
picture
of
torture
drawn
by
the
outcast
.
<EOS>
"I
merely
wished
you
to
comprehend
the
matter
in
full
force
,
"
pursued
Moody
;
"
and
as
I
perceive
you
do
—
why
,
I
will
sketch
no
further
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
your
lover
has
been
guilty
of
a
certain
breach
of
etiquette
<EOS>
(
Moody
spoke
in
an
ironical
tone
)
,
namely
,
killing
two
Indians
,
after
being
seized
as
a
prisoner
himself
,
it
is
more
than
probable
that
they
,
on
trial
,
will
sentence
him
to
the
interesting
little
proceeding
I
just
mentioned
,
and
at
which
you
thought
proper
to
turn
away
your
face
in
holy
horror
.
<EOS>
""In
the
name
of
that
God
before
whom
you
must
soon
be
judged
!
<EOS>
tell
me
what
you
ask
—
what
you
seek
—
that
you
thus
mentally
torture
me
?
"
cried
Kate
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
now
you
speak
to
the
point
,
"
replied
Moody
,
with
a
grim
smile
;
"
and
I
will
answer
you
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
know
that
your
lover
will
assuredly
be
condemned
to
the
torture
;
and
that
I
,
and
I
alone
can
save
him
.
<EOS>
""Well
?
"
ejaculated
Kate
,
breathlessly
,
fixing
her
eyes
intently
upon
the
other
.
<EOS>
"I
say
,
"
pursued
Moody
,
"
I
can
save
him
,
and
,
on
one
condition
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
""Name
it
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
the
maiden
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
you
will
swear
to
become
my
wife
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
now
,
I
make
a
distinction
:
wife
,
not
mistress
,
I
ask
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
too
,
before
you
decide
,
that
not
only
Clifton
,
but
all
your
friends
here
are
in
my
power
as
well
as
yourself
;
and
that
if
I
choose
,
I
can
have
them
put
to
the
torture
before
your
eyes
,
and
you
dishonored
before
theirs
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
the
alternative
before
you
is
terrible
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
further
.
<EOS>
If
you
become
my
wife
,
by
your
own
free
consent
,
you
shall
always
be
treated
with
respect
,
and
shall
be
provided
for
comfortably
during
my
life
,
and
at
my
death
shall
have
the
privilege
to
go
whither
,
and
marry
whom
,
you
please
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
I
make
you
this
proposal
,
which
yesterday
I
would
have
scorned
;
and
the
whole
secret
lies
in
the
revival
of
my
love
,
or
my
passion
(
call
it
which
you
will
)
,
for
you
.
<EOS>
Do
not
decide
hastily
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
a
few
minutes
,
alone
,
to
think
upon
it
;
but
if
you
decide
in
my
favor
,
one
thing
you
must
bear
in
mind
:
You
will
have
to
swear
,
by
all
your
hopes
of
salvation
hereafter
—
by
all
you
love
and
hold
sacred
—
by
everything
,
in
fact
,
that
can
make
your
oath
binding
—
that
you
will
be
mine
,
rescue
or
no
rescue
;
that
,
in
short
,
come
what
will
,
you
will
follow
me
and
my
fortunes
through
life
,
and
that
,
in
the
event
of
your
breaking
this
oath
,
you
solemnly
pray
the
Ruler
of
the
universe
to
condemn
you
to
eternal
torments
in
the
world
to
come
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
this
,
Moody
turned
abruptly
away
,
leaving
Kate
standing
alone
,
stupified
with
horror
at
the
words
she
had
just
heard
him
utter
.

give
you
a

hearty

<EOS>
my
old
comrades
,
to
your
new
abode
in
the
forest
of
my
red
brethren
,
"
said
Moody
,
with
mock
cordiality
,
as
he
approached
the
captives
,
waving
his
hand
in
a
salutary
manner
,
and
smiling
hypocritically
.
<EOS>
"Ah
<EOS>
,
my
dear
brother
,
how
fare
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
coming
up
to
Clifton
,
and
extending
his
hand
,
apparently
unmindful
that
the
other
could
not
return
the
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
delighted
to
see
you
—
upon
my
word
I
am
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
wo
n't
you
shake
hands
with
your
brother
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
in
pretended
reproach
,
stepping
back
a
pace
,
and
sighing
sorrowfully
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
such
is
the
way
of
the
world
—
this
wicked
world
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
me
!
<EOS>
ah
,
me
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
shook
his
head
,
and
sighed
again
.
<EOS>
"Taunt
on
—
taunt
on
!
"
replied
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
am
in
your
power
,
and
of
course
I
expect
no
mercy
at
the
hands
of
so
base
a
coward
.
<EOS>
""Now
<EOS>
you
wrong
me
,
dear
brother
—
upon
my
word
you
do
,
"
rejoined
Moody
,
laying
his
hand
in
mock
humility
upon
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
you
well
,
I
assure
you
.
""Cut
<EOS>
these
cords
,
then
,
and
let
me
go
,
"
said
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
now
you
touch
a
tender
point
.
<EOS>
Really
,
nothing
would
delight
me
more
—
but
,
pardon
me
,
<EOS>
you
see
I
have
to
consult
my
friends
yonder
<EOS>
(
here
he
pointed
toward
the
Indians
)
,
whom
I
am
sorry
to
say
you
have
injured
—
doubtless
unintentionally
—
to
quite
an
alarming
extent
.
<EOS>
""Two
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
,
have
been
slightly
injured
by
my
hand
,
"
returned
Clifton
,
pointedly
,
with
a
curl
of
his
lip
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
yes
—
true
.
<EOS>
Really
,
I
am
delighted
to
perceive
you
comprehend
my
meaning
—
indeed
I
am
,
"
pursued
Moody
,
with
the
gravity
of
a
parson
.
<EOS>
"You're
<EOS>
a
devil
in
human
shape
,
if
ever
there
was
one
,
"
called
out
David
,
from
a
neighboring
tree
,
where
he
had
overheard
the
taunts
of
Moody
.
"Better
<EOS>
keep
us
safe
while
you
've
got
us
,
"
put
in
another
:
"
<EOS>
for
if
ever
we
get
clear
agin
,
with
you
in
our
power
,
I
swear
to
you
the
nearest
tree
shall
serve
you
for
a
gallows
.
<EOS>
""Really
,
gentleman
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
outcast
,
turning
to
them
,
smiling
maliciously
,
but
continuing
his
hypocritical
ca
nt
;
"
you
do
me
too
much
honor
—
indeed
you
do
.
<EOS>
All
I
fear
is
,
that
you
will
not
beable
to
carry
your
sage
plans
into
execution
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
I
will
assist
you
all
I
can
;
but
then
,
you
know
,
I
am
only
a
poor
,
weak
,
human
being
after
all
,
and
am
liable
to
fail
.
<EOS>
"A
few
muttered
maledictions
was
the
only
response
to
these
taunting
gibes
;
and
turning
again
to
Clifton
,
Moody
resumed:"Time
wears
,
my
dear
brother
,
and
I
have
come
to
speak
with
you
on
matters
of
the
most
grave
importance
,
touching
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
on
,
"
replied
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
stands
one
yonder
,
"
continued
Moody
,
pointing
to
Kate
,
who
still
remained
where
he
had
left
her
,
motionless
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
;
"
<EOS>
whom
,
I
doubt
not
,
you
highly
esteem
.
<EOS>
There
,
there
,
dear
brother
,
do
n't
contradict
me
—
I
may
say
,
I
know
you
prize
her
highly
.
<EOS>
Well
,
in
that
you
are
certainly
right
,
for
she
is
worthy
of
much
esteem
,
and
I
assure
you
she
has
mine
to
the
full
.
<EOS>
Now
life
,
I
have
been
led
to
believe
,
is
sweet
to
every
one
;
and
I
venture
to
say
you
are
not
an
exception
to
this
rule
.
<EOS>
In
consideration
of
this
,
I
have
been
making
some
proposals
to
yonder
fair
maiden
,
which
,
if
she
accept
,
I
trust
,
by
my
influence
,
to
save
yours
—
<EOS>
although
,
as
you
are
well
aware
,
it
has
been
forfeited
by
your
imprudent
conduct
,
in
killing
two
of
my
friends
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
well
,
what
did
you
propose
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Clifton
,
quickly
.
"Why
,
dear
brother
—
and
in
consideration
that
you
are
my
brother
—
which
I
verily
believe
,
otherwise
you
could
not
be
so
good
and
amiable
—
as
I
wish
to
have
no
secrets
that
you
can
not
share
with
me
,
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Know
then
,
and
therefore
,
that
my
former
passion
for
yonder
fair
maiden
—
which
I
believe
is
antecedent
to
yours
,
and
consequently
righteous
by
priority
—
has
again
revived
in
a
wonderful
degree
,
and
I
am
extremely
anxious
to
call
her
mine
by
marriage
.
<EOS>
Now
as
an
inducement
for
her
to
take
this
step
—
to
yield
her
consent
freely
,
and
espouse
me
through
life
as
her
lawful
husband
—
I
have
promised
to
save
your
life
,
and
set
you
free
.
<EOS>
""Villain
!
"
cried
Clifton
,
his
features
glowing
with
proud
indignation
;
"
base
,
cowardly
,
doubly
damned
villain
!
<EOS>
Sooner
would
I
suffer
death
a
thousand
times
,
than
have
her
united
,
or
even
think
of
uniting
herself
with
such
as
<EOS>
you!"As
Clifton
uttered
these
words
,
in
a
fierce
,
loud
tone
—
which
distinctly
reached
Kate
,
roused
her
from
her
revery
,
and
decided
her
course
of
action
—
Moody
started
,
a
terrible
expression
passed
over
his
countenance
,
his
eyes
gleamed
like
an
angry
serpent
's
,
and
instinctively
his
hand
sought
a
weapon
in
his
belt
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
by
a
sudden
and
powerful
effort
,
he
partially
succeeded
in
suppressing
this
show
of
passion
,
and
resuming
his
former
hypocritical
look
and
ca
nt
.
<EOS>
We
say
partially
;
for
so
much
of
passion
was
mingled
with
the
effort
to
appear
perfectly
serene
and
unmoved
,
as
to
render
his
appearance
somewhat
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
forget
,
dear
brother
,
"
he
said
,
with
something
between
a
sneer
and
a
smile
,
"
that
the
death
you
so
nobly
speak
of
suffering
,
will
be
attended
with
considerable
inconvenience
,
not
to
say
pain
;
for
the
death
at
the
stake
,
which
I
assure
you
will
be
yours
,
is
not
the
easiest
imaginable
,
as
doubtless
you
are
well
aware
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
die
so
young
,
and
with
such
brilliant
prospects
before
you
;
for
I
see
,
by
your
glittering
uniform
,
you
are
already
on
the
road
to
fame
.
<EOS>
If
the
words
of
Blind
Luther
be
true
,
fortune
,
and
some
great
name
,
are
perhaps
within
your
grasp
also
;
and
is
it
not
a
pity
to
exchange
all
these
for
the
burning
stake
—
to
have
your
ashes
scattered
to
the
winds
—
simply
for
a
trifling
matter
of
will
,
or
because
you
can
not
deny
yourself
the
charms
of
one
simple
maiden
?
<EOS>
as
though
the
world
could
not
substitute
thousands
more
fair
and
lovely
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
is
it
<EOS>
you
aim
at
?
<EOS>
what
would
you
have
?
"
asked
Clifton
,
angrily
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
not
the
girl
,
as
well
as
myself
,
in
your
power?""True
,
but
I
wish
your
consent
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
by
force
,
I
can
do
with
you
both
whatsoever
<EOS>
I
please
;
<EOS>
but
I
do
not
wish
to
resort
to
compulsion
.
<EOS>
A
few
words
from
you
can
persuade
Kate
to
become
my
wife
;
and
I
swear
to
you
the
marriage
shall
be
solemnized
by
a
priest
.
<EOS>
""I
thought
,
"
said
Clifton
,
fastening
his
eye
sternly
upon
Moody
,
"
I
thought
,
at
first
,
that
you
were
simply
trying
to
taunt
me
with
the
words
you
have
uttered
;
but
<EOS>
I
feel
convinced
now
,
that
you
are
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
listen
!
<EOS>
I
have
weighed
the
matter
fully
,
while
you
have
been
speaking
,
and
this
is
my
decision
:
Sooner
than
ask
,
or
allow
Kate
Clarendon
to
become
your
wife
,
I
would
suffer
patiently
all
the
tortures
you
,
or
the
red
heathen
yonder
,
can
inflict
—
so
help
and
support
me
God
!
<EOS>
Go
!
<EOS>
you
are
answered
,
and
your
presence
offends
my
sight
.
<EOS>
""Ernest
,
dear
Ernest
,
"
now
cried
the
sweet
voice
of
Kate
,
who
had
silently
approached
the
party
,
unseen
by
either
Moody
or
Clifton
;
and
rushing
forward
as
she
spoke
<EOS>
,
she
threw
her
arms
around
the
neck
of
her
lover
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"God
bless
you
,
dearest
!
"
said
the
young
officer
,
with
emotion
,
pressing
his
lips
to
her
brow
,
and
making
a
bold
but
vain
attempt
to
free
his
arms
.
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
Kate
,
for
this
!
<EOS>
though
I
am
pained
to
meet
you
here
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
face
of
Moody
,
who
now
stood
glaring
upon
the
two
,
grew
black
with
passion
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
spoke
,
in
a
husky
voice
.
<EOS>
"I
have
yet
to
hear
your
decision
,
"
he
said
,
striding
up
to
the
grief
-
stricken
maiden
,
and
laying
his
hand
somewhat
roughly
upon
her
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Kate
started
,
looked
around
,
trembled
,
grew
deadly
pale
,
and
then
turned
her
eyes
inquiringly
upon
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
yield
to
his
base
proposal
?
"
said
the
latter
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"It
is
to
save
your
life
,
dear
Ernest
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
if
I
had
ten
thousand
lives
to
lay
down
in
such
a
cause
,
"
exclaimed
Clifton
,
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
hold
life
as
utterly
worthless
,
gained
at
such
a
sacrifice
,
dear
Kate
.
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
!
<EOS>
do
not
yield
to
such
a
monster!""But
<EOS>
the
torture
,
dear
,
dearest
Ernest?""The
torture
—
the
rack
—
any
thing
—
<EOS>
every
thing
—
I
would
bear
all
a
thousand
times
,
rather
than
hear
you
answer
so
base
a
villain
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
my
decision
is
made
.
<EOS>
""Your
answer
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Moody
,
almost
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"I
refuse
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
never
will
be
yours
!
<EOS>
God
shield
the
right
,
and
help
me
through!""God
bless
you
for
those
cheering
words
,
Kate
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Clifton
,
joyfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
let
the
monsters
do
their
worst
;
I
can
die
content
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
countenance
of
Moody
now
assumed
the
look
of
a
foiled
demon
.
<EOS>
No
hypocritical
smile
was
there
now
—
<EOS>
no
ca
nt
upon
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"Away
!
"
he
shouted
,
fiercely
,
his
eyes
gleaming
with
rage
,
stamping
his
foot
upon
the
ground
,
and
fairly
foaming
at
the
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
Away
!
<EOS>
and
meet
the
doom
you
seek!"As
he
spoke
,
he
rudely
tore
the
arms
of
Kate
from
around
the
neck
of
Clifton
,
and
half
dragged
her
to
a
neighboring
tree
,
to
which
he
hurriedly
bound
her
delicate
limbs
—
<EOS>
she
uttering
no
scream
,
nor
a
single
word
of
complaint
.
<EOS>
When
done
,
Moody
turned
abruptly
around
,
and
strode
directly
toward
the
Indians
,
who
,
their

being

,
were
now
engaged
in
the
solemn
rite
of
burying
their
dead
forever
from
their
sight

<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
,
and
still
the
captives
,
each
to
his
tree
,
stood
fast
bound
,
in
awful
suspense
regarding
their
fate
,
undergoing
a
mental
torture
second
only
to
that
of
the
stake
—
when
the
whole
party
of
savages
,
Moody
on
the
lead
,
was
seen
approaching
them
.
<EOS>
As
the
Indians
neared
the
prisoners
,
the
latter
could
discover
—
by
the
dark
,
angry
,
sinister
looks
of
all
—
that
mercy
,
that
diviner
attribute
of
the
brave
and
good
,
formed
no
part
of
their
rude
and
barbarous
creed
.
<EOS>
When
they
had
attained
a
close
vicinity
to
their
captives
,
they
came
to
a
halt
,
and
for
a
moment
gazed
around
with
savage
ferocity
.
<EOS>
Without
going
nearer
,
or
saying
a
word
to
any
of
the
whites
,
who
stood
regarding
them
in
gloomy
silence
,
they
began
to
collect
some
dry
sticks
,
which
they
threw
into
a
pile
and
set
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Then
seating
themselves
around
it
,
the
pipe
,
the
unfailing
accompaniment
of
an
Indian
council
,
was
produced
and
lighted
,
and
passed
around
the
circle
as
on
the
occasion
previously
described
.
<EOS>
When
this
part
of
the
ceremony
was
over
,
Moody
arose
and
said:"Brothers
,
when
last
we
met
in
council
,
it
was
at
the
request
of
him
who
now
addresses
you
.
<EOS>
He
then
told
you
a
good
tale
,
which
you
yourselves
have
proved
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
He
told
you
,
that
many
scalps
or
many
prisoners
were
on
the
southern
path
.
<EOS>
You
believed
him
,
and
you
turned
back
;
for
the
rest
,
look
around
you
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
he
paused
,
and
slowly
pointed
to
each
of
the
prisoners
,
individually
,
beginning
with
Clifton
,
and
ending
with
the
gardener
,
who
now
stood
bound
to
a
tree
,
some
distance
from
the
others
,
his
Indian
captor
having
joined
the
council
.
<EOS>
When
done
,
Moody
resumed:"Brothers
,
behold
your
triumph
!
<EOS>
There
they
stand
,
bound
captives
.
<EOS>
In
all
,
Posetha
counts
nine
heads
,
or
nine
scalps
.
<EOS>
He
looks
around
this
circle
,
and
,
including
himself
,
can
only
count
nine
warriors
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
more
when
his
red
brothers
turned
back
.
<EOS>
Where
are
they
now
?
<EOS>
In
the
Indian
's
Heaven
.
<EOS>
Who
sent
them
there
before
their
time
?
<EOS>
Yonder
pale
-
face
chief
.
<EOS>
Posetha
thinks
this
enough
.
<EOS>
He
should
die
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
long
enough
upon
the
war
-
path
,
and
he
should
die
.
<EOS>
The
shoulder
of
Posetha
pains
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
wounded
.
<EOS>
Who
did
it
?
<EOS>
Yonder
miscreant
(
pointing
to
the
gardener
)
.
<EOS>
Three
times
has
yonder
wretch
sought
Posetha
's
life
.
<EOS>
He
still
lives
to
boast
it
.
<EOS>
Posetha
thinks
he
should
die
also
.
<EOS>
This
will
make
his
party
the
strongest
.
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
there
will
be
a
pale
-
face
to
every
red
-
man
.
<EOS>
There
will
still
be
left
enough
to
amuse
the
young
men
,
the
squaws
and
papposes
of
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
Posetha
gives
his
voice
for
the
speedy
torture
of
the
two
he
has
named
.
<EOS>
His
ears
are
open
to
hear
their
cries
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
His
heart
is
shut
to
that
mercy
.
<EOS>
It
will
please
him
.
<EOS>
It
will
please
the
Great
Spirit
.
<EOS>
Brothers
,
Posetha
has
spoken
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
a
ready
tact
,
peculiar
to
his
nature
<EOS>
Moody
had
learned
to
adapt
himself
to
the
manners
and
mode
of
speaking
of
the
Indians
.
<EOS>
When
harranguing
in
council
unlike
his
usual
method
in
English
,
he
made
his
sentences
simple
and
short
,
and
spoke
directly
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
His
Indian
dialect
was
not
spoken
with
ease
,
nor
very
fluently
;
but
,
with
short
sentences
,
he
always
managed
to
make
himself
distinctly
understood
.
<EOS>
As
he
took
his
seat
upon
the
ground
he
ran
his
eye
around
the
circle
,
and
perceived
,
by
their
looks
of
ferocity
,
their
flashing
eyes
,
that
his
sentiments
were
echoed
in
the
breasts
of
nearly
every
savage
.
<EOS>
We
say
nearly
—
we
might
say
all
with
the
exception
of
Mugwa
,
the
chief
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
recollected
,
that
the
bravery
of
Clifton
,
even
in
slaying
a
part
of
his
band
,
had
won
his
admiration
;
and
a
design
of
saving
his
life
,
of
transforming
him
into
an
Indian
,
had
then
entered
his
head
,
and
had
not
yet
been
eradicated
.
<EOS>
With
regard
to
the
others
,
he
was
ready
to
give
his
voice
for
death
;
but
Clifton
,
from
some
strange
fancy
,
he
wished
spared
.
<EOS>
Moody
saw
at
a
glance
,
that
on
this
point
he
would
meet
with
decided
opposition
;
but
he
trusted
to
a
majority
in
his
favor
to
carry
the
day
.
<EOS>
Mugwa
was
the
next
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Slowly
,
with
dignity
,
he
rose
,
and
gazing
round
upon
the
circle
of
warriors
,
whom
he
saw
were
all
attention
,
at
length
began
.
<EOS>
"Brothers
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
have
heard
the
words
of
Posetha
.
<EOS>
To
Mugwa
they
seem
wise
,
and
not
wise
.
<EOS>
Wise
,
when
they
tell
us
we
must
make
our
party
the
strongest
—
not
wise
when
they
bid
us
sacrifice
the
pale
-
face
chief
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
Mugwa
,
although
no
one
interrupted
him
,
saw
by
the
change
in
the
countenances
of
his
hearers
,
that
he
had
touched
upon
an
unpopular
theme
;
but
nothing
daunted
,
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"True
,
he
continued
,
"
he
has
slain
two
of
my
braves
,
and
menaced
the
life
of
Mugwa
himself
—
But
<EOS>
was
not
this
done
in
his
own
defense
?
<EOS>
Who
can
blame
him
?
<EOS>
What
warrior
among
you
does
not
admire
bravery
?
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
virtue
.
<EOS>
It
comes
directly
from
the
Great
Spirit
.
<EOS>
Had
he
turned
like
a
coward
to
fly
,
Mugwa
would
have
sent
a
ball
to
bid
him
tarry
.
<EOS>
Mugwa
would
ere
this
have
had
his
scalp
drying
on
his
belt
and
the
wolves
should
have
fattened
on
his
carcass
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
do
this
,
though
surrounded
by
enemies
he
knew
he
could
not
conquer
.
<EOS>
He
acted
the
hero
and
the
man
.
<EOS>
Mugwa
admires
heroism
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
a
great
many
moons
upon
the
war
-
path
.
<EOS>
His
own
hand
has
slain
a
great
many
pale
-
faces
.
<EOS>
He
is
brave
.
<EOS>
He
is
their
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
proof
of
both
is
in
his
lodge
.
<EOS>
Who
thinks
Mugwa
boasts
without
cause
—
that
his
tongue
is
forked
—
can
go
there
and
see
.
<EOS>
Mugwa
loves
a
hero
,
be
he
redman
or
pale
-
face
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
thing
to
be
brave
.
<EOS>
Yonder
pale
-
face
chief
is
brave
.
<EOS>
Mugwa
would
not
see
him
bound
to
the
stake
,
and
die
like
a
dog
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
squaw
in
.
<EOS>
There
is
squaw
in
his
follower
.
<EOS>
Take
them
.
<EOS>
There
are
enough
and
to
spare
.
<EOS>
Mugwa
is
willing
.
<EOS>
But
why
select
the
bravest
?
<EOS>
Why
select
him
who
fears
not
death
?
<EOS>
Mugwa
does
not
ask
to
set
him
free
.
<EOS>
He
would
take
him
home
to
his
nation
,
and
let
them
decide
.
<EOS>
He
would
in
short
make
him
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
He
is
worthy
to
be
an
Indian
.
<EOS>
He
would
teach
our
young
men
courage
—
our
warriors
wisdom
.
<EOS>
Spare
him
,
and
Mugwa
sanctions
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
He
has
spoken
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
the
chief
gravely
took
his
seat
,
amid
a
profound
silence
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
to
Moody
,
who
watched
the
faces
of
all
attentively
,
that
the
arguments
of
the
Bear
had
made
a
deep
impression
upon
their
minds
,
and
that
the
scale
would
assuredly
turn
against
him
,
unless
the
weight
of
the
next
speaker
's
argument
was
thrown
in
his
favor
.
<EOS>
With
some
anxiety
,
therefore
,
he
waited
the
rising
of
the
next
orator
.
<EOS>
On
him
,
doubtless
,
would
depend
the
triumph
of
himself
or
Mugwa
.
<EOS>
At
length
Unkee
started
to
his
feet
,
and
Moody
at
once
felt
satisfied
by
the
gleam
of
his
eye
,
that
he
would
side
with
him
,
and
thus
his
triumph
would
be
complete
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
mistaken
.
"Brothers
<EOS>
,
"
began
Unkee
,
"
you
have
heard
.
<EOS>
The
words
of
the
great
chiefs
have
found
your
ears
open
.
<EOS>
They
have
entered
your
brains
,
and
,
not
being
alike
,
have
become
confused
.
<EOS>
You
do
not
know
which
has
spoken
most
wise
.
<EOS>
You
wish
to
hear
the
opinion
of
another
before
you
decide
.
<EOS>
Unkee
will
give
you
his
.
<EOS>
Unkee
is
not
an
orator
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
of
many
words
.
<EOS>
He
is
more
for
action
.
<EOS>
Hear
his
counsel
.
<EOS>
The
pale
-
face
is
many
—
the
red
-
man
is
few
.
<EOS>
Unless
the
red
-
man
destroy
the
pale
-
face
,
he
will
over
-
run
him
.
<EOS>
All
should
die
.
<EOS>
The
voice
of
Unkee
joins
Posetha
's
.
<EOS>
The
pale
-
face
chief
should
die
now
.
<EOS>
First
,
because
he
is
brave
,
and
the
more
to
be
feared
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
because
the
spirits
of
our
friends
call
for
his
blood
.
<EOS>
They
can
not
rest
in
peace
,
knowing
their
murderer
fills
their
wigwam
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
last
was
an
argument
so
forcible
,
so
conclusive
to
an
Indian
mind
,
that
nothing
but
the
mighty
force
of
habit
,
restrained
the
dark
warriors
from
interrupting
the
speaker
with
fierce
yells
of
coin
ciding
opinions
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
their
faces
instantly
grew
savagely
ferocious
;
their
eyes
gleamed
like
balls
of
fire
;
their
nostrils
expanded
,
and
their
hands
nervously
clutched
their
weapons
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
complete
triumph
.
<EOS>
A
thousand
words
could
not
add
to
or
destroy
the
force
of
that
single
,
simple
sentence
.
<EOS>
Even
Mugwa
seemed
astonished
and
taken
aback
,
as
though
the
idea
were
new
,
and
had
struck
him
,
too
,
with
force
.
<EOS>
Moody
,
with
a
thrill
of
savage
joy
,
now
saw
that
his
end
was
gained
.
<EOS>
A
direct
Providence
could
alone
save
the
victims
of
his
hate
from
their
impending
doom
.
<EOS>
Unkee
,
too
,
saw
that
the
effect
he
sought
was
wrought
,
and
he
was
cunning
enough
to
pause
and
give
it
full
sway
.
<EOS>
Simply
adding
,
"
Unkee
has
spoken
,
"
he
resumed
his
seat
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
the
savages
perceive
that
he
was
done
,
than
springing
to
their
feet
,
they
uttered
the
most
terrific
yells
imaginable
—
yells
which
went
to
the
hearts
of
the
prisoners
,
and
told
them
,
alas
!
<EOS>
to
fear
the
worst
.
<EOS>
As
for
Moody
,
he
fairly
shouted
with
ferocious
delight
,
and
danced
around
in
a
wild
ecstasy
of
joy
.
<EOS>
Revenge
he
felt
was
in
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
yells
and
rapid
gesticulations
of
the
savages
subsided
,
after
which
several
minutes
were
occupied
in
settling
the
time
and
place
where
the
horrid
rite
should
come
off
,
and
the
manner
in
which
it
should
be
conducted
.
<EOS>
After
some
discussion
in
the
Indian
fashion
,
it
was
finally
agreed
that
Clifton
and
Ichabod
should
be
put
to
the
tortures
on
the
very
ground
where
the
council
had
been
held
which
had
decreed
them
to
death
,
and
in
full
view
of
all
the
prisoners
,
who
would
thereby
be
witnesses
of
what
,
sooner
or
later
,
they
would
have
to
undergo
themselves
.
<EOS>
This
suited
the
purpose
of
Moody
exactly
;
and
while
the
Indians
set
about
preparing
for
the
work
of
death
,
he
repaired
to
Clifton
,
to
let
him
know
the
result
,
taunt
him
all
he
could
,
and
,
in
fact
,
enjoy
to
the
full
his
own
hellish
triumph
.
<EOS>
"I
have
come
,
my
dear
brother
,
"
he
said
,
ironically
,
"
to
inform
you
what
my
friends
propose
to
do
for
your
benefit
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
however
,
you
can
judge
for
yourself
,
by
simply
watching
their
motions
.
<EOS>
""I
suppose
I
am
to
be
tortured
,
"
an
swered
Clifton
,
compressing
his
lips
,
and
slightly
turning
pale
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
you
have
made
a
very
good
guess
,
for
the
first
one
,
"
replied
Moody
,
with
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
about
to
reap
the
benefit
of
your
obstinacy
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
""Do
your
worst
,
"
rejoined
Clifton
;
"
for
sooner
would
I
die
,
than
sacrifice
the
happiness
of
yonder
maiden
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
,
think
you
,
you
save
her
by
this
?
<EOS>
Strange
fancy
you
have
got
in
your
head
,
and
one
which
I
will
now
remove
,
for
your
especial
benefit
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
is
not
the
girl
in
my
power?""I
suppose
she
is
.
<EOS>
""Well
<EOS>
,
then
,
what
think
you
it
will
matter
with
me
,
or
with
her
,
whether
she
refuse
to
be
my
lawful
wife
or
not
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
compel
her
to
marry
me
,
it
is
true
;
but
I
can
compel
her
to
do
worse
.
<EOS>
""Good
<EOS>
God
!
<EOS>
Moody
,
what
do
you
mean
?
"
cried
Clifton
,
as
a
vague
suspicion
of
something
terrible
crossed
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"I
leave
you
to
judge
what
I
mean
,
for
the
present
,
as
I
see
a
warrior
coming
to
prepare
you
for
the
trial
that
awaits
you
,
"
answered
Moody
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
are
burning
at
the
stake
,
and
your
flesh
cracking
with
the
heat
,
I
will
come
,
and
hiss
my
meaning
in
your
ear
,
that
your
spirit
may
have
a
knowledge
in
the
world
beyond
,
of
what
she
you
love
is
bound
to
suffer
in
this
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
this
Moody
turned
upon
his
heel
and
strode
away
toward
Kate
,
while
the
savage
approached
,
and
simply
giving
a
grunt
,
drew
his
knife
and
cut
the
thongs
which
bound
Ernest
to
the
tree
,
but
without
cutting
those
which
bound
his
hands
.
<EOS>
He
then
took
hold
of
his
arm
,
and
pointing
in
a
significant
manner
toward
the
main
body
of
his
companions
,
conducted
him
away
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
noted
by
the
friends
of
Clifton
,
with
feelings
peculiar
to
each
,
but
which
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
describe
.
<EOS>
Meantime
Moody
approached
Kate
,
who
stood
bound
to
the
tree
,
her
features
pale
as
death
,
and
a
look
of
alarmed
inquiry
upon
her
sweet
countenance
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
said
the
outcast
,
coming
up
,
a
dark
smile
playing
over
his
sinister
features
,
"
you
are
now
about
to
experience
the
result
of
your
decision
.
<EOS>
Look
yonder
,
and
yon
,
"
and
he
pointed
first
toward
Clifton
,
and
then
toward
the
savages
,
who
were
in
the
act
of
driving
a
large
stake
deep
into
the
earth
.
<EOS>
"What
mean
these
fearful
signs
?
"
asked
Kate
,
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"Their
<EOS>
meaning
,
methinks
,
is
very
apparent
,
"
answered
Moody
.
<EOS>
"
Your
lover
is
about
to
pass
the
ordeal
of
fire
,
on
a
journey
from
which
he
will
never
return
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
Moody
,
you
can
not
be
so
base
—
so
cruel
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
in
terrible
agony
,
little
heeding
that
she
might
as
well
have
attempted
to
move
a
savage
to
tears
,
<EOS>
as
him
she
addressed
to
mercy
.
<EOS>
—
"
Oh
,
save
him
!
<EOS>
save
him!—he
is
your
brother!""Not
if
he
were
ten
times
my
brother
,
and
it
were
in
my
power
,
"
returned
Moody
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
You
plead
too
late
,
Kate
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
Once
I
sought
to
save
him
,
on
the
easy
condition
that
you
became
my
wife
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
of
the
consequences
,
if
you
refused
,
and
yet
refuse
you
did
.
<EOS>
His
doom
is
now
past
recall
.
<EOS>
He
must
die
.
<EOS>
And
you
,
"
added
Moody
,
tauntingly
,
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
pretty
Miss
Kate
—
do
not
think
by
this
that
you
will
escape
me
!
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
swear
to
you
your
doom
shall
be
no
better
than
his!"Kate
shut
her
eyes
and
groaned
.
<EOS>
"One
thing
,
"
she
cried
,
suddenly
,
"
do
me
one
favor
,
and
I
will
ask
no
more
!
<EOS>
Do
not
let
him
writhe
at
the
stake
!
<EOS>
In
mercy
take
your
rifle
,
and
—
and—(she
paused
,
and
shuddered
,
and
her
voice
sunk
to
an
almost
inaudible
whisper
)
—
and
—
end
—
his
—
misery
,
"
she
gasped
,
at
last
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
"Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
Moody
,
"
you
must
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
me
,
to
think
I
would
condescend
to
save
him
from
his
red
friends
yonder
;
"
and
again
he
pointed
toward
the
savages
.
<EOS>
"Farewell
,
dearest
!
"
said
a
deep
,
solemn
voice
at
this
moment
,
that
made
the
blood
retreat
to
the
heart
of
Kate
,
leaving
her
pale
,
agonized
features
bloodless
;
and
looking
round
<EOS>
,
she
saw
her
lover
being
led
to
his
place
of
torture
.
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
dearest
!
"
<EOS>
again
spoke
Ernest
,
in
solemn
tones
.
<EOS>
"
On
earth
we
may
never
meet
again
;
but
in
God
put
your
trust
,
and
meet
me
soon
in
the
land
of
spirits!"Kate
could
hear
no
more
,
but
uttered
one
fearful
scream
of
anguish
,
that
penetrated
the
hearts
of
all
her
friends
,
and
made
the
brave
young
officer
tremble
as
a
child
.
<EOS>
"You
see
!
"
said
Moody
,
coolly
,
pointing
toward
the
already
retreating
form
of
Clifton
,
as
his
Indian
conductor
hurried
him
forward
:
<EOS>
"
You
see!"But
he
was
mistaken
;
Kate
did
not
see
;
she
had
fainted
;
and
with
a
deep
malediction
on
her
tender
heart
,
Moody
turned
away
,
and
strode
on
after
his
intended
victim
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
that
he
had
come
up
to
the
Indians
,
the
driving
of
the
stake
was
completed
,
and
the
savages
were
already
placing
sticks
around
it.—These
were
put
end
-
wise
to
the
stake
,
some
three
feet
distant
,
so
as
to
form
a
complete
circle
,
and
give
the
condemned
the
benefit
of
a
slow
fire
.
<EOS>
To
the
stake
the
prisoner
was
to
be
bound
,
so
as
to
leave
him
a
little
freedom
,
and
then
the
sticks
were
to
be
fired
.
<EOS>
Clifton
,
as
he
neared
the
spot
,
noticed
all
these
preparations
with
a
shudder
,
and
with
a
sinking
spirit
;
but
nerving
himself
with
as
much
stoicism
as
he
could
assume
,
he
in
wardly
called
upon
his
Maker
to
aid
him
,
and
prepared
himself
to
undergo
the
trial
before
him
with
manly
fortitude
.
<EOS>
And
a
terrible
trial
<EOS>
it
was
to
one
like
him
,
in
the
very
prime
of
life
,
with
every
inducement
to
live
—
<EOS>
just
,
too
,
on
the
verge
of
happiness
—
to
be
thus
snatched
away
from
all
he
loved
and
held
dear
,
and
slowly
tortured
out
of
existence
into
the
dread
,
unknown
Beyond
.
<EOS>
But
most
terrible
of
all
,
was
the
maddening
thought
of
the
dear
one
he
loved
,
who
would
be
left
behind
in
the
power
of
the
most
inhuman
monster
on
earth
.
<EOS>
Were
Kate
at
liberty
and
safe
,
he
felt
he
could
die
comparatively
happy
.
<EOS>
The
suffering
of
the
body
alone
,
he
fancied
,
could
be
borne
;
but
the
suffering
of
body
and
mind
together
,
was
a
something
to
sap
his
courage
,
and
make
the
man
a
child
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
his
feeling
of
despair
lessened
,
as
he
turned
his
gaze
upward
toward
the
glorious
sun
,
(
that
now
ascending
the
heavens
,
poured
his
light
and
warmth
upon
the
great
earth
)
then
around
upon
the
beauties
of
nature
everywhere
displayed
before
him
—
felt
the
soft
,
balmy
breeze
upon
his
cheek
,
and
remembered
that
he
was
about
to
bid
adieu
to
all
these
bright
things
forever
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
decided
by
the
Indians
,
that
Clifton
should
suffer
first
,
and
therefore
only
one
place
of
torture
had
been
prepared
,
which
was
afterward
to
serve
for
the
gardener
,
who
,
in
consequence
,
still
remained
bound
to
his
tree
.
<EOS>
The
spot
chosen
for
the
horrid
rite
,
was
a
little
open
patch
of
ground
,
near
which
grew
a
cluster
of
bushes
,
forming
part
of
a
thicket
that
stretched
away
to
the
Little
Miami
,
but
not
so
as
to
obstruct
the
view
of
the
other
prisoners
—
it
being
the
policy
of
the
Indians
to
have
them
spectators
of
the
awful
spectacle
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
Clifton
upon
the
ground
,
was
the
signal
for
the
savages
to
set
up
a
series
of
horrid
yells
,
to
dance
around
him
in
brutal
triumph
,
and
pinch
,
beat
and
otherwise
maltreat
him
with
their
hands
and
fists
.
<EOS>
This
lasted
some
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
,
and
was
borne
by
the
prisoner
without
a
word
of
complaint
.
<EOS>
In
this
savage
custom
,
in
justice
be
it
said
,
Moody
did
not
join
;
but
folding
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
he
stood
a
little
apart
,
regarding
his
brother
in
stern
silence
.
<EOS>
When
they
had
amused
themselves
sufficiently
in
this
way
,
the
Indians
began
stripping
their
victim
of
his
apparel
,
preparatory
to
binding
him
to
the
stake
.
<EOS>
First
his
coat
,
then
his
vest
,
and
then
piece
after
piece
of
his
other
garments
,
theytore
rudely
from
him
,
and
with
some
of
them
decorated
their
own
hideous
persons
.
<EOS>
As
they
rent
the
bosom
of
his
shirt
,
the
silver
box
presented
him
by
Luther
,
which
had
been
placed
there
for
safe
keeping
,
rolled
out
and
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
,
Moody
,
who
had
so
far
been
only
a
spectator
,
sprang
forward
,
and
seized
it
with
avidity
.
<EOS>
"What
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
turning
it
over
and
over
,
and
noting
with
wonder
the
strange
characters
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
,
sirrah
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
pursued
,
addressing
himself
to
Clifton
.
<EOS>
But
the
lat
ter
deigned
him
no
answer
;
and
muttering
,
"
Take
that
for
your
silence
,
"
Moody
struck
him
with
his
fist
a
violent
blow
upon
the
side
of
his
head
,
and
coolly
hid
the
box
under
his
vestments
to
be
examined
at
some
future
time
.
<EOS>
Having
at
length
stripped
Clifton
entirely
,
the
Indians
proceeded
to
attach
him
to
the
stake
,
by
means
of
a
rope
made
of
deer
-
skin
,
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
him
a
little
play
round
the
circle
,
but
not
enough
to
reach
the
fire
.
<EOS>
They
then
had
another
dance
around
him
,
accompanied
with
horrible
yells
,
when
a
warrior
suddenly
appeared
with
a
burning
brand
,
and
applied
it
to
the
combustible
pile
.
<EOS>
The
sticks
,
many
of
them
being
small
and
dry
,
were
very
ignitable
,
and
in
a
moment
the
red
flames
shot
upward
,
and
flashed
,
and
crackled
and
crept
around
the
circle
,
until
the
prisoner
,
to
those
at
a
little
distance
,
appeared
enveloped
in
fire
and
smoke
.
<EOS>
Gradually
the
heat
became
more
and
more
intense
,
untill
the
position
of
Clifton
,
who
kept
himself
close
to
the
stake
,
was
rendered
not
a
little
painful
,
and
already
a
few
blisters
began
to
make
their
appearance
on
his
tender
skin
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
for
the
burnt
powder
,
"
cried
Moody
,
with
a
horrid
laugh
;
and
pointing
his
rifle
toward
the
naked
body
of
Clifton
,
he
was
already
in
the
act
of
pullinh
the
trigger
,
when
suddenly
the
muzzle
dropped
to
the
ground
,
and
its
owner
,
turning
ghastly
pale
,
stood
,
with
mouth
distended
,
and
<EOS>
eyes
half
starting
from
their
sockets
,
gazing
in
the
direction
of
the
thicket
,
and
trembling
with
very
fear
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
,
too
,
suddenly
halted
in
their
savage
rite
,
and
uttering
the
single
word
"
Kitcho
-
chobeka
,
"
shrank
cowering
back
,
with
looks
expressive
of
surprise
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
a
powerful
figure
rushed
through
the
flames
,
and
cutting
the
bonds
of
the
prisoner
,
raised
and
bore
him
to
a
safe
distance
beyond
the
fatal
circle
.
<EOS>
Turning
with
a
look
of
unspeakable
grattitude
to
his
deliverer
,
Clifton
,
to
his
amazement
and
joy
,
beheld
in
him
the
tall
,
ungainly
,
but
commanding
form
of
Blind
Luther
,
the
Necromancer
.
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXII.They
spake
not
a
word
,
But
like
dumb
statues
,
or
breathless
stones
,
Stared
on
each
other
,
and
looked
deadly
pale.[Shakspeare
.
<EOS>
His
hand
did
quake
,
And
tremble
like
a
leaf
of
aspen
green
,
And
troubled
blood
through
his
pale
face
was
seen
To
come
and
go
,
with
tidings
from
the
heart
,
As
it
a
running
messenger
had
been
.
<EOS>
[
Shakspeare

<EOS>
O
!

how
glorious

To

and
bring

vile
To
just
disgrace![Somerville
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
let
the
traitor
die
,
For
sparing
justice
feeds

<EOS>
.
<EOS>
Without
waiting
to
receive
his
thanks
,
and
in
fact
scarcely
noticing
Clifton
at
all
,
Luther
made
a
single
bound
forward
,
and
seizing
the
trembling
Moody
by
the
throat
,
bore
him
violently
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Then
hastily
disarming
him
,
he
set
his
foot
upon
his
heaving
breast
and
shouted:"Villain
,
thy
hour
has
come!"By
this
time
the
Indians
had
recovered
somewhat
from
their
astonishment
,
and
seeing
their
victim
at
liberty
,
and
one
of
their
own
party
in
such
imminent
danger
,
began
to
rally
and
collect
around
the
Necromancer
,
with
menacing
gestures
.
<EOS>
"Sons
of
the
forest
,
"
cried
Luther
,
addressing
them
in
their
own
dialect
,
"
away
,
and
leave
the
misereant
to
his
fate!""Kitcho
-
chobeka
is
great
,
"
answered
Mugwa
;
"
but
why
does
he
interfere
here?""The
<EOS>
Great
Spirit
is
offended
,
"
rejoined
Luther
solemnly
,
pointing
upward
.
<EOS>
"You
have
aided
Watchemenetoc
in
his
hellish
work
,
"
and
he
pointed
downward
to
Moody
.
"
<EOS>
Begone
!
<EOS>
ere
you
behold
the
Great
Spirit
's
anger!"The
Indians
,
judging
by
their
looks
,
were
now
evidently
alarmed
,
but
not
satisfied
,
and
loth
to
depart
without
further
proof
of
the
Great
Spirit
's
anger
,
through
His
instrument
,
as
they
superstitiously
believed
Luther
to
be
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
have
our
prisoner
and
our
chief
,
"
grumbled
Mugwa
,
"
and
we
will
go
.
<EOS>
""Touch
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
"
replied
Luther
,
fiercely
,
straightening
his
ugly
form
to
its
full
height
,
and
rolling
his
restless
eye
from
one
to
the
other
with
an
angry
expression
:
"
Touch
one
of
them
again
,
and
perdition
go
with
you
!
<EOS>
Watchemenetoc
is
not
your
chief
;
he
is
a
devil
in
human
form
.
<EOS>
Away
!
<EOS>
begone
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
waved
his
hand
majestically
.
<EOS>
But
still
the
Indians
lingered
;
and
fearful
they
might
,
in
spite
,
of
their
fears
,
veriture
upon
a
rescue
,
Luther
suddenly
thrust
his
hand
into
his
bosom
,
and
drew
forth
a
ball
,
some
three
inches
in
diameter
,
which
he
had
previously
prepared
for
such
an
emergency
.
<EOS>
This
proceeding
was
noted
by
the
savages
with
deep
interest
,
and
they
would
instantly
have
crowded
around
him
,
had
not
their
fours
restrained
them
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
however
,
they
approached
within
a
few
feet
,
and
got
between
Luther
and
the
fire
,
their
eyes
the
while
fixed
intently
on
the
ball
,
which
the
Necromancer
,
to
puzzle
them
,
now
commenced
turning
rapidly
over
and
over
in
his
hands
.
<EOS>
This
was
exactly
what
he
desired
;
and
muttering
some
unintelligible
words
,
and
looking
upward
,
as
if
appealing
to
Heaven
,
he
suddenly
,
and
by
a
dexterous
movement
,
cast
it
beyond
them
,
into
the
flames
,
at
the
same
time
shouting:"Behold
and
tremble
,
ye
sons
of
the
forest
,
and
revere
the
tongue
of
the
Great
<EOS>
Spirit!"The
Indians
,
all
amazement
,
followed
the
ball
with
their
eyes
,
and
,
as
it
touched
the
fire
,
beheld
first
a
red
and
then
a
blue
flame
shoot
upward
with
a
hissing
sound
.
<EOS>
The
words
of
the
Necromancer
now
fell
with
startling
effect
upon
their
ears
,
and
were
scarcely
concluded
,
ere
a
tremend
explosion
took
place
,
which
shook
the
ground
beneath
their
feet
,
and
scattered
the
burning
brands
in
every
direction
,
leaving
the
space
lately
occupied
by
the
fire
black
and
smoking
.
<EOS>
The
brands
,
too
,
many
of
them
,
striking
against
the
almost
naked
bodies
of
the
Indians
,
increased
their
terror
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
Mugwa
and
another
savage
were
knocked
down
,
and
all
were
more
or
less
bruised
and
injured
by
the
explosion
.
<EOS>
Springing
to
his
feet
,
the
chief
of
the
Piquas
uttered
a
frightful
yell
of
terror
,
and
darted
toward
the
thicket
,
followed
closely
by
his
yelling
and
no
less
terrified
companions
,
leaving
the
Necromancer
master
of
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Clifton
,
who
had
been
an
inactive
spectator
of
the
whole
,
now
sprang
to
Luther
,
and
grasping
him
by
the
hand
,
while
tears
of
joy
filled
his
eyes
,
said
,
with
emotion:"My
more
than
friend
,
my
kind
benefactor
,
how
can
I
ever
sufficiently
thank
you
for
this
timely
interference
and
preservation
of
my
life?""Ernest
Bellington
,
"
answered
Luther
,
warmly
pressing
the
hand
of
the
young
officer
,
"
you
owe
me
no
thanks
,
nor
do
I
need
them
.
<EOS>
When
I
do
a
good
deed
,
I
know
it
is
registered
there
,
"
and
he
slowly
and
impressively
pointed
upward
;
"
there
—
there
—
beyond
that
sky
of
blue
,
where
I
humbly
hope
and
pray
my
spirit
will
one
day
wing
its
flight
,
and
find
more
good
than
evil
recorded
of
my
doings
while
a
tenant
here
below
.
<EOS>
Here
,
"
added
Luther
,
pointing
downward
to
Moody
,
who
as
yet
had
made
no
effort
to
rise
;
"
Here
is
a
painful
task
for
me
to
perform
.
<EOS>
I
must
yield
him
up
to
justice
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
,
and
I
will
do
it
,
for
I
always
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
he
deserves
it
,
"
returned
Clifton
;
"
for
if
ever
there
was
a
black
-
hearted
villain
on
earth
,
he
is
one
.
<EOS>
But
Kate
,
and
my
friends
—
I—"Here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
report
of
firearms
;
and
wheeling
suddenly
in
the
direction
of
his
fettered
comrades
,
whom
he
expected
to
behold
sinking
under
the
weapons
of
the
savages
,
judge
of
his
astonishment
,
on
seeing
them
already
in
pursuit
of
the
latter
,
armed
to
the
teeth
.
<EOS>
"Good
<EOS>
Heaven
!
<EOS>
what
magic
is
this
?
"
he
cried
,
turning
to
Luther
,
all
amazement
.
<EOS>
"Simply
<EOS>
that
before
I
liberated
you
,
I
took
all
means
of
precaution
to
render
my
work
sure
,
"
replied
the
other
modestly
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
fact
;
and
an
unusual
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
Indians
,
had
aided
him
most
essentially
.
<EOS>
Feeling
perfectly
secure
,
and
not
wishing
uselessly
to
encumber
themselves
,
they
had
placed
most
of
the
weapons
taken
from
the
whites
in
a
pile
by
themselves
,
near
the
thicket
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
intently
occupied
in
council
,
Luther
had
managed
to
get
possession
of
these
,
and
afterward
distribute
them
among
their
owners
,
cautioning
them
,
ere
<EOS>
he
cut
their
cords
,
not
to
stir
,
unless
they
were
attacked
,
or
heard
a
signal
from
him
.
<EOS>
Then
approaching
Kate
in
a
noiseless
manner
,
just
as
she
,
regaining
consciousness
,
was
looking
about
her
in
alarm
,
he
whispered
a
few
words
of
hope
and
consolation
in
her
ear
,
and
freed
her
also
,
with
the
same
injunction
as
to
remaining
stationary
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
had
regained
the
thicket
,
and
appeared
before
the
savages
in
the
manner
already
shown
.
<EOS>
Terrified
at
the
feats
of
the
Necromancer
,
but
maddened
at
the
release
of
their
prisoner
,
<EOS>
no
sooner
had
the
Indians
fairly
hid
themselves
in
the
thicket
,
than
thoughts
of
vengeance
took
possession
of
their
half
crazy
brains
,
and
they
paused
for
consultation
.
<EOS>
Under
the
excitement
they
were
laboring
,
this
was
very
short
,
and
resulted
in
their
decision
to
steal
upon
the
bound
prisoners
,
tomahawk
and
scalp
them
,
and
return
to
their
homes
.
<EOS>
Led
by
the
now
infuriated
Mugwa
,
they
made
a
sally
for
the
purpose
,
and
were
bearing
kown
upon
their
supposed
victims
,
when
,
suddenly
,
to
their
unbounded
astonishment
,
dismay
,
and
terror
,
each
captive
sprang
behind
his
tree
,
and
sent
the
contents
of
his
rifle
among
them
.
<EOS>
This
,
to
the
Indians
,
was
a
work
of
magic
indeed
;
and
overpowered
by
amazement
and
terror
,
they
paused
for
a
moment
irresolute
.
<EOS>
The
next
they
turned
and
darted
away
,
uttering
horrible
yells
,
followed
by
the
whites
.
<EOS>
Three
of
their
number
had
been
wounded
,
but
not
so
as
to
prevent
their
flight
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
all
had
gained
the
cover
of
the
thicket
.
<EOS>
Into
this
the
whites
were
prudent
enough
not
to
venture
,
but
turned
back
,
congratulating
themselves
upon
their
fortunate
and
timely
escape
.
<EOS>
Their
first
move
was
to
reload
their
rifles
,
and
thus
be
prepared
for
a
second
attack
,
in
case
the
savages
should
desire
to
renew
the
contest
—
a
proceeding
,
however
,
which
was
looked
upon
as
highly
improbable
.
<EOS>
They
then
repaired
to
where
Kate
was
standing
,
and
all
in
a
body
proceeded
toward
the
Necromancer
.
<EOS>
In
their
flight
,
the
Indians
had
thrown
away
most
of
the
garments
taken
from
Clifton
,
who
hastily
recovering
these
meantime
,
was
now
enabled
to
appear
before
his
friends
,
decently
clad
.
<EOS>
Seeing
Kate
approaching
,
he
made
one
bound
forward
,
caught
her
in
his
arms
,
and
pressed
her
to
his
heart
in
silence
.
<EOS>
The
emotion
of
both
was
too
deep
for
words
.
<EOS>
His
friends
now
crowded
around
him
,
and
seizing
his
hand
,
one
after
another
,
they
allowed
their
tearful
eyes
to
say
what
their
tongues
had
not
power
to
utter
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
solemn
,
but
joyful
meeting
.
<EOS>
"Now
,
"
exclaimed
Danvers
,
who
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
,
"
let
us
attempt
to
express
our
gratitude
to
this
noble
being
;
"
and
he
pointed
toward
Luther
,
who
was
quietly
standing
a
few
paces
distant
,
holding
the
outcast
Moody
by
a
firm
grasp
upon
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
a
thousand
times
bless
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Kate
,
rushing
forward
and
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
the
Necromancer
.
<EOS>
"Up
,
girl
!
<EOS>
"
said
Luther
,
solemnly
.
"
<EOS>
Kneel
to
thy
God
,
and
not
to
frail
mortality
like
me
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
we
must
bless
you
,
nevertheless
,
"
returned
Danvers
,
grasping
the
hand
unoccupied
,
"
as
the
instrument
of
the
Almighty
,
used
in
the
preservation
of
our
lives
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
ay
!
<EOS>
"
cried
several
voices
;
and
each
proceeded
to
express
his
thanks
in
his
own
peculiar
way
.
<EOS>
"God
bless
you
!
"
said
one
.
<EOS>
"May
<EOS>
you
live
a
thousand
years
!
"
said
another
.
<EOS>
"Forever
!
<EOS>
"
put
in
a
third
.
<EOS>
"May
<EOS>
flowers
ever
lie
in
your
path
,
and
the
hand
of
innocence
and
virtue
,
and
the
blessings
of
all
who
know
you
,
smooth
the
passage
of
your
noble
spirit
to
the
vale
of
eternal
Eden
!
"
<EOS>
added
Kate
,
enthusiastically
.
"Enough
!
enough
!
"
rejoined
Luther
,
waving
his
hand
and
turning
away
his
head
:
As
he
did
this
,
his
eye
fell
upon
Moody
,
who
,
pale
as
a
corpse
,
stood
trembling
and
abashed
,
although
not
one
of
the
party
had
as
yet
appeared
to
notice
his
pres
ence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
"
he
added
,
quickly
,
"
take
him
,
or
peradventure
I
repent
and
set
him
free
.
<EOS>
"A
howl
of
indignation
escaped
two
or
three
of
the
party
,
as
they
sprang
forward
and
seized
him
roughly
.
"Mercy
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
now
terrified
outcast
,
who
,
since
the
appearance
of
Luther
,
seemed
to
have
become
changed
entirely
,
from
a
reckless
,
boasting
bully
,
to
the
veriest
poltroon
on
earth
.
"
<EOS>
Mercy
!
<EOS>
I
will
repent
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
such
mercy
's
you
gave
,
you
'll
git
,
"
replied
one
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
that
'll
be
a
high
tree
and
short
prayers
,
"
said
another
.
<EOS>
"Hist
!
<EOS>
d'ye
<EOS>
see
anything
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
David
,
at
this
moment
,
pointing
toward
Ichabod
,
who
,
from
some
oversight
,
had
been
neglected
,
and
was
still
bound
to
his
tree
,
patiently
waiting
to
be
set
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
good
heavens
!
<EOS>
there
is
the
gardener
,
quite
forgotten
,
"
rejoined
Clifton
,
taking
a
step
forward
to
release
him
.
<EOS>
"Hist
!
"
said
David
again
,
detaining
Clifton
with
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
next
instant
his
rifle
was
to
his
eye
,
and
before
any
one
could
comprehend
what
it
meant
,
the
piece
belched
forth
its
deadly
contents
.
<EOS>
A
cry
of
mortal
agony
now
rang
upon
the
air
,
proceeding
from
a
cluster
of
bushes
near
which
Ichabod
stood
bound
.
<EOS>
"You'll
find
him
there
all
right
,
"
said
David
,
coolly
,
as
some
two
or
three
of
the
party
set
off
to
learn
the
result
of
his
shot
.
<EOS>
On
coming
up
to
the
place
,
they
were
astonished
at
seeing
an
Indian
lying
life
-
less
upon
his
face
.
<EOS>
Turning
him
over
,
they
recognised
the
grim
features
of
Unkee
.
<EOS>
More
blood
-
thirsty
and
daring
than
his
companions
,
he
had
stealthily
ventured
hither
to
take
the
scalp
of
his
prisoner
;
but
the
quick
ears
and
keen
eyes
of
David
had
been
too
much
for
him
,
and
he
had
met
his
fate
in
the
manner
shown
.
<EOS>
Releasing
Ichabod
,
the
party
now
returned
,
leaving
the
dead
Indian
to
be
devoured
by
the
beasts
of
the
wilderness
.
<EOS>
The
manner
of
Luther
,
as
they
came
up
to
the
others
,
arrested
the
attention
of
all
.
<EOS>
He
had
turned
his
face
toward
the
west
,
placed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
,
and
now
stood
swaying
to
and
fro
like
some
strong
oak
shaken
by
the
blast
—
or
,
like
one
whose
mind
is
racked
by
some
powerful
thought
.
<EOS>
No
one
ventured
to
address
him
,
and
all
stood
regarding
him
with
awe
and
silence
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
removed
his
hands
slowly
,
and
turned
his
face
toward
the
group
.
<EOS>
Each
started
as
they
saw
that
countenance
,
over
which
,
in
so
short
a
time
,
had
come
a
fearful
change
.
<EOS>
His
dark
features
were
pale
,
and
seemed
bloodless
;
his
eye
rolled
more
rapidly
than
usual
in
its
socket
;
the
lid
quivered
more
nervously
,
and
the
whole
face
was
uncommonly
agitated
,
as
if
by
some
inward
struggle
.
<EOS>
"It
is
over
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
,
in
a
deep
,
guttural
voice
,
recovering
himself
,
and
assuming
his
wonted
composure
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
are
surprised
,
my
friends
,
to
behold
me
thus
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
cause
for
it
—
but
that
cause
you
will
never
know
.
<EOS>
My
time
has
now
come
to
bid
you
farewell
.
<EOS>
Many
of
you
—
perhaps
all
—
will
never
behold
me
more
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
nay
,
"
cried
Ernest
and
Kate
,
both
in
a
breath
,
springing
forward
,
and
each
grasping
a
hand
of
the
Necromancer
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
do
not
leave
us!—why
<EOS>
should
you
not
go
with
us
,
and
be
provided
for
the
remainder
of
your
days?""Ay
,
do
accept
their
offer
,
"
added
Danvers
.
<EOS>
Luther
shook
his
head
sadly
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
friends
,
"
he
said
,
"
it
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
I
thank
you
none
the
less
,
however
,
for
your
kind
offer
—
but
it
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
My
road
lies
yonder
;
"
and
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
west
,
as
if
to
comprehend
the
whole
great
forest
,
which
then
stretched
over
a
vast
and
unexplored
territory
.
<EOS>
"
My
task
here
,
peradventure
,
is
ended
.
<EOS>
A
restless
something
within
,
tells
me
I
must
go
—
<EOS>
go
—
go
—
<EOS>
till
I
come
to
my
last
haven
of
rest
—
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Will
you
forget
me
when
I
am
gone
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
with
some
emotion
.
"Never
!
<EOS>
never
!
"
cried
all
together
.
<EOS>
Luther
remained
mute
a
moment
,
and
then
turning
to
Clifton
,
<EOS>
resumed:"Remember
what
I
told
you
concerning
the
box
!
<EOS>
It
is
all
important
.
<EOS>
When
she
is
thy
wife
(
motioning
his
hand
toward
Kate
)
,
then
,
and
not
before
,
know
its
contents
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Clifton
,
"
I
had
forgotten
;
it
is
in
the
possession
of
Moody
;
"
and
advancing
at
once
to
the
outcast
,
who
was
still
held
by
the
three
young
men
,
he
took
it
from
him
,
adding
,
as
he
returned
to
the
side
of
Luther
,
"
I
shall
remember
.
<EOS>
""Let
it
not
pass
from
you
again
with
life
,
"
said
the
Necromancer
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
friends
,
let
me
bid
you
a
long
adieu
;
"
and
beginning
with
Danvers
,
he
shook
each
warmly
by
the
hand
—
leaving
Ernest
and
Kate
to
the
last
—
giving
each
a
warm
"
God
bless
you
!
"
and
receiving
a
similar
blesisng
from
lips
that
trembled
,
and
eyes
that
grew
moist
,
in
return
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
,
he
strode
up
to
Moody
,
and
said
,
in
a
deep
,
solemn
voice
:
"
`
The
way
of

<EOS>
I
had
hoped
this
to
be
otherwise
—
but
a
Higher
Power
has
willed
it
so
,
and
overruled
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
enough
.
<EOS>
With
a
sad
heart
I
consign
thee
to
the
fate
thou
deservest
.
<EOS>
I
have
warned
thee
,
and
spared
thee
,
and
given
thee
chances
to
repent
—
but
all
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
we
may
never
meet
again
—
neither
in
this
world
,
nor
that
which
lies
beyond
the
tomb
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
save
me
this
time
—
this
once
,
"
cried
the
cowardly
villian
,
imploringly
,
"
and
,
by
all
I
hold
sacred
<EOS>
,
I
swear
to
you
I
will
repent
and
reform
.
<EOS>
""Too
<EOS>
late
,
"
returned
Luther
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
When
last
I
saved
thy
life
,
I
said
I
would
never
interfere
again
.
<EOS>
My
word
I
never
break
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
forever
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
turned
away
abruptly
.
<EOS>
Approaching
Ernest
and
Kate
,
he
once
more
grasped
them
by
the
hand
,
and
said
:
"
'
T
is
hard
to
leave
you
,
but
I
must
do
it

<EOS>
"The

<EOS>
"Farewell

behold
me
again

or
(
he
paused
,
and
concluded
impressively
)
eternity

<EOS>
"Without
looking
round
,
or
saying
more
,
he
now
strode
steadily
to
the
thicket
,
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
parting
the
bushes
with
his
hands
,
disappeared
,
from
many
there
present
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
For
something
like
a
minute
,
the
silence
was
unbroken
.
<EOS>
All
were
mute
and
sad
,
and
stood
like
statues
,
with
their
eyes
fixed
upon
the
spot
where
the
Necromancer
was
last
seen
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
"
said
Clifton
,
"
time
wears
,
and
we
have
a
long
journey
before
us
.
<EOS>
We
must
,
God
willing
,
reach
the
settlement
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""D'ye
<EOS>

?
<EOS>
"
said
one
addressing
Moody
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
got
a
short
job
with
you
first
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
are
you
going
to
do
?
"
asked
Clifton
.
<EOS>
"Keep
<EOS>
our
oath
,
"
replied
one
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
sworn
to
hang
this
villian
,
if
ever
we
got
him
in
our
power
agin
.
<EOS>
We
've
got
him
now
,
and
wo
n't
be
apt
to
forget
it
.
<EOS>
""Had
<EOS>
you
not
better
take
him
to
some
settlement
—
to
Cincinnati
—
and
have
him
tried
legally
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
favor
the
movement
of
taking
vengeance
into
our
own
hands
.
<EOS>
""It
's
no
use
for
you
to
trouble
yourself
'bout
the
matter
,
lieutenant
,
axing
your
pardon
!
"
replied
David
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
got
to
die
,
that
's
the
short
on't
;
and
sooner
nor
he
'
scapes
agin
,
I
'll
give
him
the
contents
<EOS>
o
this
;
"
and
he
held
up
his
long
rifle
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
dearest
,
"
said
Clifton
,
who
saw
it
would
be
useless
to
parley
louger
with
men
who
had
been
so
deeply
wronged
:
"
<EOS>
Come
,
Kate
,
let
us
away
;
we
must
leave
him
to
his
fate
;
"
and
taking
her
hand
,
he
set
forward
,
followed
by
Danvers
only
,
the
others
remaining
with
Moody
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
young
officer
and
his
party
were
fairly
out
of
sight
,
Grant
turned
to
Moody
and
said:"Come
,
wretch
,
down
and
say
your
prayers
—
if
you
've
got
any
to
say
—
and
make
'em
short
;
for
the
rope
's
ready
,
and
the
tree
's
waiting
to
blossom
with
your
carcass
.
<EOS>
We
'll
see
you
dead
this
time
,
anyhow
,
whether
you
come
to
life
agin
or
not
.
<EOS>
"Moody
,
<EOS>
instead
of
complying
,
began
to
remonstrate
and
beg
for
his
life
,
which
so
enraged
the
party
,
that
without
waiting
to
listen
,
they
began
to
drag
him
for
ward
to
the
thicket
,
where
lay
his
dead
Indian
companion
.
<EOS>
"Here
's
company
for
you
,
"
said
Ichabod
;
"
and
as
you
plotted
together
in
this
world
,
it
'll
be
as
well
for
ye
to
jine
him
straightway
,
and
keep
him
company
in
the
next
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
so
chanced
that
a
strong
sapling
was
growing
exactly
over
the
body
of
the
savage
;
and
laying
hold
of
this
,
three
of
of
the
party
without
ceremony
pulled
the
top
down
to
the
ground
,
while
the
rest
employed
themselves
in
putting
one
end
of
a
rope
round
the
neck
of
the
outcast
,
and
fastening
the
other
to
it
.
<EOS>
Then
seeing
that
all
was
fast
and
ready
,
one
of
the
party
said
to
Moody
,
whose
very
teeth
were
chattering
with
terror:"Now
<EOS>
you
're
about
to
reap
the
reward
of
your
crimes
.
<EOS>
""Mercy
!
"
gasped
the
guilty
one
.
<EOS>
"Git
<EOS>
it
after
death
,
then
,
"
was
the
bitter
reply
.
<EOS>
"Ready
<EOS>
all
!
<EOS>
Let
her
go!"At
<EOS>
the
word
,
the
sapling
sprang
upward
nearly
to
its
former
place
,
jerking
Moody
up
with
it
by
the
neck
,
and
there
holding
him
,
choking
and
struggling
in
mid
air
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
the
party
remained
,
watching
the
struggles
and
awful
contortions
of
visage
of
the
victim
to
Lynch
law
,
until
they
gradually
subsided
,
and
one
long
,
violent
spasm
,
succeeded
by
a
straightening
of
the
limbs
,
and
perfect
quiet
—
announced
that
the
erring
and
criminal
Moody
was
still
in
death
.
<EOS>
"Let
's
go
!
"
<EOS>
said
David
,
briefly
,
turning
away
with
a
shudder
of
disgust
.
<EOS>
No
answer
was
returned
;
but
as
he
left
the
thicket
,
he
found
each
of
his
companions
at
his
heels
,
eager
to
quit
the
place
of
a
sight
so
horrible
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
the
party
overtook
the
one
in
advance
,
when
all
pushed
forward
in
a
body
together
.
<EOS>
No
questions
were
asked
concerning
the
fate
of
Moody
,
and
no
remarks
made
—
each
satisfied
,
apparently
,
to
leave
the
outcast
to
his
fate
.
<EOS>
Without
incident
worthy
of
note
,
the
whole
company
reached
the
settlement
that
night
,
and
joined
their
anxious
friends
.

has
been
effected
by

arch

enchanter
Time

in

<EOS>
Where
is
now
the
Indian

with
his
terrible
war
-
cry
,
his
deadly
rifle
,
his
murderous
tomahawk
,
and
his
mutilating
scalping

knife
—
which
so
troubled
the
peace
of
our

,
and
made
wailing

and
wo

terror
among
the

Where
are
now

the

the
bear

the
catamount

the
buffalo

the

the
copper

which
held
their

Where

are
those

which
stretched
far
away
,
from
east

Gone

all
gone

vanished

Who

hears

beholds

barely
sixty
years

—
only
sixty
years
—
in
the
memory
of
many
now
living
—
on
this
very
ground
swayed
the
inter
locking
branches
of
a
great
forest
,
unseen
by
the

untouched
by
the

of
an
Anglo

Who

winding
like
a
belt

mirroring
hundreds

and
parting
its
waters
to
the
gliding
motion

hundreds

magnificent

can
realize
that
sixty

the
tall
old

wilderness
threw
their
cool
shadows
far
over
its
glassy
tide

then
disturbed

like
movements

Who

<EOS>
Strangely
have
the
predictions
of
Blind
Luther
,
the
Necromancer
,
been
verified
.
<EOS>
The
fifty
years
opening
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
been
pregnant
with
events
that
have
caused
a
world
to
wonder
,
until
wonder
has
ceased
altogether
,
and
man
now
looks
upon
things
beyond
his
first
comprehension
as
things
which
are
to
be
.
<EOS>
The
city
which
Luther
beheld
in
his
vision
,
with
the
eye
of
the
mind
,
we
behold
with
the
naked
eye
of
corporeal
substance
.
<EOS>
The
great
beast
that
was
to
be
formed
from
the
dust
of
the
earth
,
by
the
mechanism
of
man
,
with
rolling
legs
,
with
speed
beyond
the
speed
of
the
deer
,
and
with
strength
exceeding
an
hundred
horse
—
we
now
behold
daily
.
<EOS>
The
great
leviathans
that
were
to
plow
foaming
channels
in
the
mighty
deep
,
rush
against
wind
and
tide
,
and
carry
the
sons
of
earth
in
their
great
bosoms
—
are
already
upon
our
waters
.
<EOS>
The
red
lightning
from
the
thunder
-
car
of
heaven
has
already
been
drawn
and
sent
courier
throughout
the
civilized
earth
;
and
tho
'
ships
do
not
yet
sail
in
the
blue
ether
above
us
,
and
though
tyranny
still
exists
,
and
liberty
is
not
every
where
triumphant
—
yet
we
must
remember
the
prediction
was
made
for
the
nineteenth
century
,
of
which
more
than
half
is
yet
to
appear
,
and
we
little
know
what
is
written
in
the
yet
unopened
book
of
time
.
<EOS>
Well
may
we
of
the
present
day
exclaim
,
in
the
language
of
Scripture
:
"
What
shall
be
the
end
of
these
things
,
and
what
the
sign
of
their
coming
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
the
opening
chapter
of
this
history
<EOS>
,
we
presented
a
contrast
between
the
ancient
and
modern
appearance
of
Columbia
—
which
,
in
itself
,
has
altered
less
,
perhaps
,
than
in
the
improvements
that
environ
it
.
<EOS>
In
place
of
the
rough
and
serpentine
horse
-
path
,
that
connected
it
with
its
sister
village
,
Cincinnati
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
solitary
traveler
upon
it
<EOS>
—
we
have
now
a
broad
,
smooth
and
beautiful
turnpike
,
shooting
away
from
a
thronged
city
,
through
the
pleasant
hamlet
of
Fulton
—
since
sprung
into
existence
—
and
winding
round
the
base
of
Bald
-
Hill
,
at
a
height
sufficient
to
overlook
the
quiet
dwellings
reposing
below
,
as
also
the
broad
plain
so
often
mentioned
—
over
which
roll
teams
of
burden
,
stages
and
omnibuses
for
travelers
and
citizens
,
and
carriages
for
pleasure
;
while
along
its
side
can
be
traced
the
dark
lines
of
a
railway
,
on
which
to
and
fro
rush
the
"
iron
horses
"
with
great
velocity
,
dragging
their
weighty
burdens
over
three
hundred
miles
of
territory
,
and
connecting
this
point
with
the
great
lakes
of
the
north
by
a
journey
of
only
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
At
the
precise
spot
where
the
turnpike
,
winding
around
the
base
of
Bald
-
Hill
,
takes
a
more
northern
course
,
you
have
a
delightful
view
of
the
little
knoll
so
frequently
mentioned
in
these
pages
,
as
the
ground
on
which
stood
the
first
building
erected
solely
to
the
worship
of
God
by
the
pioneers
of
the
Miami
Valley
.
<EOS>
This
knoll
is
only
a
few
yards
from
the
base
of
the
hill
on
which
you
stand
,
and
is
a
spot
well
calculated
to
arrest
the
gaze
of
the
observant
traveler
.
<EOS>
In
appearance
,
it
much
resembles
an
Indian
mound
,
being
somewhat
oval
and
smooth
.
<EOS>
No
building
now
adorns
its
summit
;
but
the
ruins
of
one
can
there
be
seen
,
around
which
,
covered
with
green
sward
,
are
scattered
the
graves
of
many
who
worshiped
within
its
walls
in
times
gone
by
,
whose
names
,
half
obliterated
from
the
crumbling
stones
above
them
,
speak
the
vanity
and
decay
of
earthly
things
,
and
the
dirge
to
whose
memories
is
now
only
sung
by
the
wailing
wind
,
as
it
sighs
through
the
branches
of
the
willow
,
the
beach
and
the
locust
,
waving
above
and
shadowing
their
last
remains
.
<EOS>
To
this
knoll
,
then
—
not
as
it
appears
now
,
but
as
it
appeared
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
,
with
its
neat
,
but
humble
,
building
of
worship
peeping
through
the
grove
that
covered
it
—
we
must
once
more
call

It
was
a
beautiful
Sabbath
morning
in
the
spring
of
1792
.
<EOS>
All
nature
seemed
rejoicing
and
full
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
The
icy
hand
of
winter
had
been
lifted
from
the
seemingly
desolate
earth
,
and
everything
appeared
as
joyous
as
on
the
departure
of
a
tyrannical
ruler
.
<EOS>
The
trees
had
put
,
or
were
putting
,
forth
their
buds
,
their
blossoms
and
leaves
,
and
checkering
the
forest
with
that
beautiful
variety
of
color
,
which
renders
it
so
enchanting
;
while
the
earth
had
sent
up
her
blade
and
her
flowers
of
all
hues
,
until
her
surface
seemed
a
carpet
too
rich
almost
to
be
pressed
by
the
foot
of
man
.
<EOS>
The
warblers
of
the
forest
had
already
returned
from
their
journey
to
the
sunny
south
,
and
now
thronged
the
trees
,
and
made
"
earth
vocal
with
their
melody
.
"
<EOS>
Already
had
the
husbandman
put
his
seed
into
the
teeming
earth
,
and
the
result
was
now
visible
in
broad
,
green
squares
of
corn
and
wheat
,
destined
,
by
the
process
of
a
few
short
months
,
to
be
greeted
as
the
golden
harvest
of
plenty
.
<EOS>
We
have
said
it
was
a
beautiful
Sabbath
morning
.
<EOS>
The
sun
,
slowly
ascending
to
the
zenith
of
his
glory
,
rolled
over
an
ocean
of
ethereal
blue
,
wherein
not
a
cloud
floated
to
mar
its
beauty
,
or
check
for
an
instant
his
warmth
,
or
cast
a
single
shadow
over
the
scene
before
us
.
<EOS>
A
gentle
southern
breeze
swept
down
the
hills
of
old
Kentucky
,
rippled
the
bosom
of
the
Ohio
,
and
came
up
the
valley
,
freighted
with
the
sweets
of
a
thousand
flowers
bearing
to
the
ear
the
hum
of
ten
thousand
insects
,
and
the
songs
of
a
thousand
warblers
.
<EOS>
Save
these
,
all
sounds
were
hushed
.
<EOS>
It
was
Sabbath
—
the
day
set
apart
by
Him
who
made
the
world
,
for
rest
—
and
the
weekly
toil
of
the
husbandman
had
ceased
.
<EOS>
Toward
the
little
sanctuary
so
often
mentioned
,
a
long
line
of
villagers
,
male
and
female
,
were
taking
their
way
,
dressed
in
the
simple
costume
of
the
time
,
with
no
ostentatious
display
of
fashion
to
rank
one
superior
in
point
of
wealth
to
another
.
<EOS>
No
solemn
bell
was
sending
its
vibrations
upon
the
balmy
air
,
to
call
them
to
the
church
of
God
.
<EOS>
They
knew
it
was
the
hour
bordering
upon
worship
,
and
they
set
forth
from
their
peaceful
dwelling
places
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Among
them
were
all
classes
—
from
the
youth
to
the
grey
-
beard
—
from
the
maidon
of
a
few
summers
,
to
the
hoary
matron
whose
feet
already
pressed
the
verge
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Some
were
grave
,
and
some
were
gay
—
for
all
of
course
did
not
feel
the
solemnity
of
the
day
—
yet
none
behaved
with
indecorum
.
<EOS>
In
the
front
and
rear
of
the
church
were
stationed
sentinels
,
with
their
rifles
upon
their
shoulders
,
past
which
the
male
portion
of
the
villagers
bore
their
own
arms
,
and
,
ascending
the
little
knoll
,
disappeared
one
after
another
,
within
the
rude
walls
consecrated
to
the
worship
of
the
Most
High
.
<EOS>
Around
the
door
of
the
church
,
however
,
a
small
group
of
youths
and
maidens
lingered
,
with
their
eyes
mostly
bent
in
one
direction
,
as
if
expecting
some
person
or
persons
from
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
At
length
one
exclaimed
,
"
They
come
;
"
and
the
speaker
pointed
with
his
finger
to
a
man
of
venerable
appearance
,
some
fifty
rods
distant
,
who
was
seen
coming
up
the
valley
,
accompanied
by
two
couple
of
both
sexes
.
<EOS>
As
this
party
ascended
the
knoll
,
the
sentinels
they
passed
,
paused
,
touched
their
hats
respectfully
,
and
resumed
their
patrol
,
while
the
group
at
the
door
disappeared
within
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
,
the
last
party
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
church
,
amid
a
profound
silence
,
and
were
met
on
all
sides
by
an
artillery
of
eager
eyes
,
from
those
already
there
assembled
.
<EOS>
A
rude
altar
at
the
farther
end
of
the
church
,
overlooked
the
rough
benches
in
front
,
on
which
the
congregation
was
seated
—
and
toward
this
the
venerable
pastor
and
his
young
companions
directed
their
steps
.
<EOS>
At
the
place
mentioned
,
the
man
of
God
paused
,
and
facing
the
assemblage
,
raised
his
hands
aloft
.
<EOS>
Simultaneously
all
rose
to
their
feet
,
and
,
after
a
short
silence
,
his
tremulous
voice
was
heard
in
solemn
prayer
.
<EOS>
This
ended
,
the
assemblage
,
with
the
exception
of
the
pious
pastor
and
the
group
which
had
accompanied
him
to
the
altar
,
resumed
their
seats
.
<EOS>
Glancing
round
him
for
a
moment
,
the
divine
said:"Friends
,
it
now
becomes
my
pleasant
but
solemn
duty
,
to
unite
in
the
holy
rite
of
marriage
,
Ernest
Clifton
and
Kate
Clarendon
,
Albert
Danvers
and
Mary
Argate
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
this
,
he
addressed
himsef
to
the
party
before
him
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
hands
which
were
clasped
together
,
clasped
those
of
partners
for
life
.
<EOS>
The
ceremony
over
,
the
newly
married
took
seats
arranged
behind
them
,
while
the
pastor
,
ascending
the
pulpit
,
read
a
text
suitable
to
the
occasion
,
from
which
he
delivered
a
most
eloquent
and
able
discourse
.
<EOS>
On
the
return
of
Kate
from
captivity
,
she
,
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
young
Danvers
and
his
sister
,
had
taken
up
her
abode
in
their
father
's
dwelling
,
where
for
many
weeks
she
labored
under
a
strong
nervous
affection
,
caused
by
the
many
exciting
events
which
we
have
chronicled
,
among
the
most
prominent
of
which
was
the
horrible
death
of
her
mother
.
<EOS>
Grief
,
violent
,
and
some
feared
fatal
,
for
a
long
time
rankled
deeply
in
her
affectionate
breast
,
and
hours
,
and
days
,
and
weeks
of
anguish
had
been
apportioned
her
.
<EOS>
But
Time
,
the
great
healer
or
destroyer
of
hearts
diseased
,
had
gradually
softened
and
soothed
her
feelings
,
and
taught
her
the
vanity
of
mourning
so
severely
an
earthly
loss
,
which
a
few
short
years
,
at
the
most
,
would
repay
in
the
gain
of
a
never
ending
eternity
,
and
a
meeting
with
those
she
loved
,
to
part
no
more
forever
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
all
she
loved
were
not
gone
Around
,
on
every
side
<EOS>
,
she
felt
she
had
kind
,
sympathizing
friends
,
for
whose
sakes
it
was
her
duty
to
appear
somewhat
resigned
and
cheerful
;
but
,
above
all
others
,
for
the
sake
of
one
,
dear
and
beloved
,
whose
happiness
depended
upon
her
own
,
and
to
whom
she
now
felt
her
own
,
drawn
with
a
peculiar
,
sublime
and
almost
idolatrous
affection
,
which
she
had
never
before
known
for
earthly
being
.
<EOS>
She
still
had
something
to
live
for
;
an
object
to
love
,
and
feel
that
in
turn
she
was
loved
;
and
the
thought
of
the
living
gradually
took
the
place
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
Spring
came
,
and
she
was
happy
in
the
embrace
of
one
she
could
call
her
own
forever
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
winter
,
Ernest
had
remained
in
the
fort
at
Cincinnati
,
though
his
visits
to
Columbia
,
on
one
pretense
or
another
,
had
not
been
like
angels
'
visits
,
"
few
and
far
between
;
"
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
been
almost
of
daily
occurrence
.
<EOS>
The
many
mysterious
words
of
Luther
had
made
a
deep
impression
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
of
them
by
day
,
and
dreamed
of
them
by
night
.
<EOS>
Could
they
have
any
meaning
?
<EOS>
were
they
true
?
<EOS>
A
thousand
times
had
he
been
tempted
to
open
the
mysterious
box
in
his
possession
,
and
know
for
a
certainty
;
but
as
often
a
moral
sense
of
obligation
to
the
commands
of
one
who
had
so
befriended
,
restrained
him
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
not
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
until
the
time
set
for
the
purpose
has
expired
,
and
then
I
will
know
all
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
was
late
on
the
evening
succeeding
the
marriage
of
Clifton
,
and
in
a
rude
apartment
of
a
dwelling
,
in
the
village
so
often
named
,
sat
the
young
officer
,
by
the
side
of
a
table
on
which
stood
a
light
,
throwing
its
gleams
upon
his
noble
and
manly
countenance
,
as
,
with
the
chin
resting
on
his
hand
<EOS>
,
he
contemplated
in
silence
several
manuscript
papers
lying
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
door
opened
,
and
a
bright
,
fairy
-
like
being
glided
up
to
his
side
,
and
a
soft
,
white
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Ernest
started
,
and
looking
up
,
exclaimed
,
in
rapture:"Bless
you
,
my
own
,
dearest
Kate
—
<EOS>
my
wife!—now
I
can
make
you
happy
;
"
and
as
he
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
,
a
tear
of
joy
stood
in
his
eye
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
dear
Ernest
,
"
answered
Kate
in
a
silvery
voice
,
gazing
tenderly
upon
him
,
and
parting
the
hair
from
his
forehead
;
"
why
do
you
say
now
?
<EOS>
Could
you
not
always
make
me
happy
?
<EOS>
Could
I
be
otherwise
with
you?""But
now
more
than
ever
!
<EOS>
You
remember
the
words
and
the
gift
of
Luther
,
dearest?""I
do
:
<EOS>
the
latter
a
silver
box
.
<EOS>
""Aye
,
and
the
contents
of
that
box
are
now
before
you
.
<EOS>
First
,
here
,
"
continued
Ernest
,
taking
up
a
scroll
;
"
on
this
are
my
horoscope
and
destiny
written
.
<EOS>
It
looks
old
,
and
bears
date
1770
.
<EOS>
In
it
I
am
styled
Ernest
Bellington
,
son
of
Arthur
Lord
Bellington
,
twin
brother
of
Albert
Bellington
,
and
grandson
of
Edgar
,
Earl
of
Killingworth
.
<EOS>
The
next
,
in
like
manner
,
is
the
horoscope
of
my
brother
,
since
my
foe
,
in
the
person
of
Rashton
Moody
.
<EOS>
The
third
is
your
own
,
and
your
destiny
is
marked
to
run
parallel
to
mine
.
<EOS>
But
most
important
of
all
,
"
pursued
Ernest
,
with
sparkling
eyes
,
"
is
this
;
"
and
he
held
aloft
a
parchment
;
"
this
,
which
proves
to
my
satisfaction
my
birthright
.
<EOS>
""O
,
read
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Kate
,
with
interest
,
seating
herself
by
his
side
,
and
looking
fondly
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"A
kiss
first
,
my
little
wife
.
<EOS>
There
,
now
listen
!
"
<EOS>
and
Ernest
began
the
unraveling
of
a
tale
of
mystery
.
<EOS>
The
story
purported
to
be
written
by
Luther
Boreancy
,
othewise
Blind
Luther
.
<EOS>
It
was
long
,
sometimes
so
metaphorical
as
to
render
the
sense
almost
obscure
,
and
was
altogether
a
remarkable
document
.
<EOS>
We
shall
not
follow
it
in
detail
,
but
will
give
the
contents
in
brief
,
in
our
own
language
.
<EOS>
It
stated
that
Arthur
Lord
Bellington
,
son
of
Edgar
Earl
of
Killingworth
,
being
an
only
son
,
married
,
contrary
to
his
father
's
desire
,
an
accomplished
lady
of
small
fortune
and
inferior
birth
.
<EOS>
A
quarrel
ensued
,
father
and
son
became
estranged
,
and
finally
,
after
the
birth
of
twin
sons
,
the
latter
determined
to
embark
for
America
.
<EOS>
Before
he
quitted
the
country
,
however
,
he
took
his
infants
to
a
magistrate
,
and
had
tattooed
in
his
presence
,
and
in
the
presence
of
many
witnesses
,
under
the
left
arm
of
each
,
the
armorial
bearings
of
his
house
,
and
the
initial
letters
of
their
names
.
<EOS>
Papers
,
stating
the
whole
affair
,
were
then
drawn
up
,
and
signed
by
all
present
,
of
which
a
copy
was
taken
and
deposited
in
the
archives
of
the
capital
.
<EOS>
This
accomplished
,
he
embarked
for
America
with
his
family
.
<EOS>
On
board
the
same
vessel
which
carried
him
out
,
was
one
who
had
made
the
tour
of
the
world
,
and
learned
astrology
and
the
occult
sciences
of
the
Egyptions
.
<EOS>
He
was
consulted
,
and
he
in
turn
consulted
the
stars
,
and
predicted
the
sudden
death
of
the
young
lord
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
It
came
.
<EOS>
Ship
fever
broke
out
,
and
Lady
Bellington
sickened
and
died
.
<EOS>
Lord
Bellington
was
attacked
,
and
on
his
death
-
bed
he
called
the
astrologer
to
him
,
and
gave
his
infants
into
his
charge
,
with
all
the
proofs
concerning
them
,
together
with
a
large
purse
of
money
,
and
begged
that
he
would
have
them
educated
and
brought
up
separately
,
neither
to
know
of
his
birthright
until
the
Earl
of
Killingworth
should
be
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
astrologer
promised
,
Lord
Bellington
died
,
and
the
former
kept
his
word
.
<EOS>
By
a
train
of
circumstances
useless
for
us
to
mention
,
all
came
to
the
West
,
and
the
rest
the
reader
knows
.
<EOS>
Such
,
in
short
,
was
the
substance
of
the
document
which
Ernest
now
read
to
his
bride
;
and
accompanying
it
were
all
the
proofs
,
and
<EOS>
a
statement
that
the
old
peer
was
now
deceased
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
,
I
suppose
,
the
astrologer
here
mentioned
is
none
other
than
our
Necromancer
?
"
said
Kate
inquiringly
.
<EOS>
"I
infer
,
from
what
I
have
read
,
"
answered
Ernest
,
"
they
are
one
and
the
same
;
but
further
than
that
,
the
mystery
seems
as
dark
as
ever
.
<EOS>
God
bless
him
,
though
,
whoever
he
is
!
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
behold
him
once
again
,
whether
mortal
or
spirit!""Behold
,
then
!
<EOS>
for
he
is
mortal
and
here
,
"
said
a
deep
voice
,
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Ernest
sprang
to
his
feet
,
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
while
Kate
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
stood
Luther
,
quietly
leaning
on
his
stick
of
witchhazel
,
and
the
door
,
through
which
he
had
softly
entered
,
was
partly
ajar
.
<EOS>
"Good
heavens
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Ernest
,
fastening
his
eyes
steadily
upon
Luther
,
with
an
expression
of
awe
,
"
are
you
really
flesh
and
blood?""Feel
and
have
faith
!
"
<EOS>
said
Luther
,
advancing
and
extending
his
dark
hand
to
the
young
officer
.
<EOS>
Ernest
touched
,
pressed
it
in
his
own
,
and
replied:"There
is
no
doubting
that
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
,
mysterious
being
,
who
art
thou?""All
thou
knowest
is
thine
,
"
replied
Luther
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
thou
knowest
not
,
is
shut
from
thee
forever
.
<EOS>
Question
no
further
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
thou
didst
obey
my
request
;
"
and
he
pointed
to
the
papers
on
the
table
.
"
<EOS>
How
like
you
your
destiny?""It
is
better
than
I
ever
hoped
for
in
my
dreams
,
"
replied
Clifton
rapturouslv
.
<EOS>
"Wear
<EOS>
well
thy
honors
,
and
when
thou
art
rich
,
forget
not
the
poor
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
past
may
have
been
,
the
future
promises
everything
.
<EOS>
With
thy
new
fortunes
and
bride
,
thou
must
become
the
envied
of
mortals
.
<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
I
bid
thee
farewell
,
and
go
forever
from
thy
sight
.
<EOS>
Sweet
lady
(
turning
to
Kate
)
<EOS>
,
we
shall
meet
no
more
on
earth
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
thee
to
be
true
and
loyal
to
thy
husband
,
nor
him
to
do
the
like
by
thee
.
<EOS>
I
make
one
prediction
more
.
<EOS>
The
world
shall
yet
praise
the
wealth
,
the
bounty
,
the
beauty
and
virtue
of
the
Earl
and
the
Countess
of
Killingworth
.
<EOS>
Farewell!"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
he
turned
and
strode
out
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
"Stay
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Clifton
,
who
had
yet
many
questions
to
ask
—
but
Luther
paused
not
.
<EOS>
Ernest
and
Kate
sprang
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
moon
,
already
on
the
wane
,
faintly
traced
the
outline
of
a
tall
figure
,
gliding
toward
the
wood
.
<EOS>
One
moment
,
and
it
disappeared
,
and
blind
Luther
was
seen
nevermore
by
those
who
looked
upon
him
as
a
guardian
angel
and
benefactor
.
<EOS>
Many
long
years
after
these
events
,
however
,
a
strange
figure
,
answering
his
description
,
was
discovered
in
the
wood
by
an
old
hunter
.
<EOS>
He
was
lying
on
his
side
,
his
head
resting
upon
an
old
knapsack
.
<EOS>
On
examination
,
it
was
found
that
he
had
been
a
long
time
dead
.
<EOS>
On
the
spot
where
he
ceased
to
breathe
,
a
little
rise
of
earth
,
and
two
rough
stones
at
his
head
and
feet
,
mark
out
the
last
earthly
resting
place
of
a
once
mysterious
being
.
<EOS>
About
his
person
were
found
some
old
papers
,
so
worn
and
soiled
by
time
,
that
the
writing
thereof
was
mostly
illegible
.
<EOS>
From
what
little
could
be
deciphered
,
it
was
conjectured
by
some
that
he
was
once
a
nobleman
of
distinction
,
whom
one
cause
or
another
had
driven
to
this
country
,
and
that
,
becoming
partially
deranged
,
he
had
conducted
himself
in
the
manner
we
have
shown
.
<EOS>
Others
believed
him
possessed
of
supernatural
powers
,
and
there
were
various
opinions
and
conjectures
;
but
all
amounted
to
surmises
only
;
for
none
ever
knew
who
he
was
,
or
whence
he
came
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
his
marriage
,
Ernest
threw
up
his
commission
in
the
army
,
and
,
with
his
lovely
wife
,
and
her
faithful
serving
man
,
Ichabod
Longtree
,
set
out
for
Ireland
,
his
ancestral
home
.
<EOS>
The
old
peer
was
dead
,
and
the
young
lord
had
but
little
difficulty
in
proving
his
identity
,
and
taking
his
place
among
the
proudest
of
the
realm
.
<EOS>
A
long
rent
-
roll
secured
him
a
vast
income
,
and
he
lived
in
lordly
splendor
,
the
happiest
of
mortals
.
<EOS>
The
Countess
of
Killingsworth
proved
a
dutiful
and
loving
wife
;
and
the
old
Earl
was
heard
in
after
years
to
tell
his
grandchildren
,
he
blessed
the
hour
when
first
his
eyes
beheld
the
fainting
form
of
the
lovely
Kate
Clarendon
.
<EOS>
THE
END
