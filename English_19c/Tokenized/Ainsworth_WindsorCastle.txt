Of
the
Earl
of
Surrey
's
solitary
Ramble
in
the
Home
Park
--
<EOS>
Of
the
Visionbeheld
by
him
in
the
Haunted
Dell
--
And
of
his
Meeting
with
MorganFenwolf
,
the
Keeper
,
beneath
Herne
's
Oak
.
<EOS>
In
the
twentieth
year
of
the
reign
of
the
right
high
and
puissant
KingHenry
the
Eighth
,
namely
,
in
1529
,
on
the
21st
of
April
,
and
on
one
ofthe
loveliest
evenings
that
ever
fell
on
the
loveliest
district
in
England
,
a
fair
youth
,
having
somewhat
the
appearance
of
a
page
,
was
leaningover
the
terrace
wall
on
the
north
side
of
Windsor
Castle
,
and
gazing
atthe
magnificent
scene
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
right
stretched
the
broadgreen
expanse
forming
the
Home
Park
,
studded
with
noble
trees
,
chiefly
consisting
of
ancient
oaks
,
of
which
England
had
already
learntto
be
proud
,
thorns
as
old
or
older
than
the
oaks
,
wide
-
spreadingbeeches
,
tall
elms
,
and
hollies
.
 
<EOS>
The
disposition
of
these
trees
waspicturesque
and
beautiful
in
the
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
at
the
end
of
asweeping
vista
,
and
in
the
midst
of
an
open
space
covered
with
thegreenest
sward
,
stood
a
mighty
broad
-
armed
oak
,
beneath
whoseample
boughs
,
though
as
yet
almost
destitute
of
foliage
,
while
the
sodbeneath
them
could
scarcely
boast
a
head
of
fern
,
couched
a
herd
ofdeer
.
 
<EOS>
There
lay
a
thicket
of
thorns
skirting
a
sand
-
bank
,
burrowed
byrabbits
,
on
this
hand
grew
a
dense
and
Druid
-
like
grove
,
into
whoseintricacies
the
slanting
sunbeams
pierced
;
on
that
extended
a
longglade
,
formed
by
a
natural
avenue
of
oaks
,
across
which
,
at
intervals
,
deer
were
passing
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
were
human
figures
wanting
to
give
life
andinterest
to
the
scene
.
 
<EOS>
Adown
the
glade
came
two
keepers
of
the
forest
,
having
each
a
couple
of
buckhounds
with
them
in
leash
,
whose
bayingsounded
cheerily
amid
the
woods
.
 
<EOS>
Nearer
the
castle
,
and
bending
theirway
towards
it
,
marched
a
party
of
falconers
with
their
well
-
trainedbirds
,
whose
skill
they
had
been
approving
upon
their
fists
,
their
jessesringing
as
they
moved
along
,
while
nearer
still
,
and
almost
at
the
foot
ofthe
terrace
wall
,
was
a
minstrel
playing
on
a
rebec
,
to
which
a
keeper
,
in
a
dress
of
Lincoln
green
,
with
a
bow
over
his
shoulder
,
a
quiver
ofarrows
at
his
back
,
and
a
comely
damsel
under
his
arm
,
was
listening
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
,
a
view
altogether
different
in
character
,
though
scarcelyless
beautiful
,
was
offered
to
the
gaze
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
formed
by
the
town
ofWindsor
,
then
not
a
third
of
its
present
size
,
but
incomparably
morepicturesque
in
appearance
,
consisting
almost
entirely
of
a
longstraggling
row
of
houses
,
chequered
black
and
white
,
with
tall
gables
,
and
projecting
storeys
skirting
the
west
and
south
sides
of
the
castle
,
by
the
silver
windings
of
the
river
,
traceable
for
miles
,
and
reflecting
theglowing
hues
of
the
sky
,
by
the
venerable
College
of
Eton
,
emboweredin
a
grove
of
trees
,
and
by
a
vast
tract
of
well
-
wooded
and
well
-
cultivated
country
beyond
it
,
interspersed
with
villages
,
churches
,
oldhalls
,
monasteries
,
and
abbeys
.
<EOS>
Taking
out
his
tablets
,
the
youth
,
after
some
reflection
,
traced
a
fewlines
upon
them
,
and
then
,
quitting
the
parapet
,
proceeded
slowly
,
andwith
a
musing
air
,
towards
the
north
west
angle
of
the
terrace
.
 
<EOS>
Hecould
not
be
more
than
fifteen
,
perhaps
not
so
much
,
but
he
was
talland
well
-
grown
,
with
slight
though
remarkably
well
-
proportioned
limbs;and
<EOS>
it
might
have
been
safely
predicted
that
,
when
arrived
at
years
ofmaturity
,
he
would
possess
great
personal
vigour
.
 
<EOS>
His
countenancewas
full
of
thought
and
intelligence
,
and
he
had
a
broad
lofty
brow
,
shaded
by
a
profusion
of
light
brown
ringlets
,
a
long
,
straight
,
andfinely
-
formed
nose
,
a
full
,
sensitive
,
and
well
-
chiselled
mouth
,
and
apointed
chin
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
large
,
dark
,
and
somewhat
melancholy
inexpression
,
and
his
complexion
possessed
that
rich
clear
brown
tintconstantly
met
with
in
Italy
or
Spain
,
though
but
seldom
seen
in
anative
of
our
own
colder
clime
.
 
<EOS>
His
dress
was
rich
,
but
sombre
,
consisting
of
a
doublet
of
black
satin
,
worked
with
threads
of
Venetiangold
;
hose
of
the
same
material
,
and
similarly
embroidered
;
a
shirtcuriously
wrought
with
black
silk
,
and
fastened
at
the
collar
with
blackenamelled
clasps
;
a
cloak
of
black
velvet
,
passmented
with
gold
,
andlined
with
crimson
satin
;
a
flat
black
velvet
cap
,
set
with
pearls
andgoldsmith
's
work
,
and
adorned
with
a
short
white
plume
;
and
blackvelvet
buskins
.
 
<EOS>
His
arms
were
rapier
and
dagger
,
both
having
gilt
andgraven
handles
,
and
sheaths
of
black
velvet
.
<EOS>
As
he
moved
along
,
the
sound
of
voices
chanting
vespers
arose
fromSaint
George
's
Chapel
;
and
while
he
paused
to
listen
to
the
solemnstrains
,
a
door
,
in
that
part
of
the
castle
used
as
the
king
's
privylodgings
,
opened
,
and
a
person
advanced
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
-
comerhad
broad
,
brown
,
martial
-
looking
features
,
darkened
still
more
by
athick
coal
-
black
beard
,
clipped
short
in
the
fashion
of
the
time
,
and
apair
of
enormous
moustachios
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
accoutred
in
a
habergeon
,
which
gleamed
from
beneath
the
folds
of
a
russet
-
coloured
mantle
,
andwore
a
steel
cap
in
lieu
of
a
bonnet
on
his
head
,
while
a
long
sworddangled
from
beneath
his
cloak
.
 
<EOS>
When
within
a
few
paces
of
the
youth
,
whose
back
was
towards
him
,
and
who
did
not
hear
his
approach
,
heannounced
himself
by
a
loud
cough
,
that
proved
the
excellence
of
hislungs
,
and
made
the
old
walls
ring
again
,
startling
the
jackdawsroosting
in
the
battlements
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
composing
a
vesper
hymn
,
my
lord
of
Surrey
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
with
alaugh
,
as
the
other
hastily
thrust
the
tablets
,
which
he
had
hitherto
heldin
his
hand
,
into
his
bosom
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
inquired
the
Earl

,
with
a
significant
smile
.
<EOS>
"Assuredly

""It

bowed
.
<EOS>
"And

pursued
the

The
captain
bowed
again
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
save
your

<EOS>
the
necessity
of
asking
any
further
questions,"he
said
,
"
I
may
state
briefly
that

<EOS>
""Be

"Willingly

was

"I

But
I

caution

<EOS>
In
sober
sooth

I
haveheard
strange
stories

his
appearance

should
not

near

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
earl
laughed
somewhat
sceptically
,
and
the
captain
reiterating
hiscaution
,
they
separated
--
<EOS>
Bouchier
returning
the
way
he
came
,
andSurrey
proceeding
towards
a
small
drawbridge
crossing
the
ditch
onthe
eastern
side
of
the
castle
,
and
forming
a
means
of
communicationwith
the
Little
Park
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
challenged
by
a
sentinel
at
thedrawbridge
,
but
on
giving
the
password
he
was
allowed
to
cross
it
,
andto
pass
through
a
gate
on
the
farther
side
opening
upon
the
park
.
<EOS>
Brushing
the
soft
and
dewy
turf
with
a
footstep
almost
as
light
andbounding
as
that
of
a
fawn
,
he
speeded
on
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
amile
,
when
he
reached
a
noble
beech
-
tree
standing
at
the
end
of
aclump
of
timber
.
 
<EOS>
A
number
of
rabbits
were
feeding
beneath
it
,
but
at
hisapproach
they
instantly
plunged
into
their
burrows
.
<EOS>
Here
he
halted
to
look
at
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
had
sunk
behind
it
,
dilating
its
massive
keep
to
almost
its
present
height
and
tinging
thesummits
of

whole
line

,
with

.
<EOS>
Flinging
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
beech
-
tree
,
the
youthful
earl
indulgedhis
poetical
reveries
for
a
short
time
,
and
then
,
rising
,
retraced
hissteps
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
of
the
south
side
of
the
castle
laybefore
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
view
comprehended
the
two
fortifications
recentlyremoved
to
make
way
for
the
York
and
Lancaster
Towers
,
betweenwhich
stood
a
gate
approached
by
a
drawbridge
;
the
Earl
Marshal'sTower
,
now
styled
from
the
monarch
in
whose
reign
it
was
erected
,
Edward

;
the

;
the

the

tenanted
by

and
still
allotted

and
the

<EOS>
A
few
rosy
beams
tipped
the
pinnaclesof
Saint
George
's
Chapel
,
seen
behind
the
towers
above
-
mentioned
,
with
fire
;
but
,
with
this
exception
,
the
whole
of
the
mighty
fabric
lookedcold
and
grey
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
the
upper
gate
was
opened
,
and
Captain
Bouchier
andhis
attendants
issued
from
it
,
and
passed
over
the
drawbridge
.
 
<EOS>
Thecurfew
bell
then
tolled
,
the
drawbridge
was
raised
,
the
horsemendisappeared
,
and
no
sound
reached
the
listener
's
ear
except
themeasured
tread
of
the
sentinels
on
the
ramparts
,
audible
in
theprofound
stillness
.
<EOS>
The
youthful
earl
made
no
attempt
to
join
his
followers
,
but
havinggazed
on
the
ancient
pile
before
him
till
its
battlements
and
towersgrew
dim
in
the
twilight
,
he
struck
into
a
footpath
leading
across
thepark
towards
Datchet
,
and
pursued
it
until
it
brought
him
near
a
dellfilled
with
thorns
,
hollies
,
and
underwood
,
and
overhung
by
mightyoaks
,
into
which
he
unhesitatingly
plunged
,
and
soon
gained
thedeepest
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
owing
to
the
thickness
of
the
hollies
and
theprojecting
arms
of
other
large
overhanging
timber
,
added
to
theuncertain
light
above
,
the
gloom
was
almost
impervious
,
and
he
couldscarcely
see
a
yard
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
he
pressed
on
unhesitatingly
,
andwith
a
sort
of
pleasurable
sensation
at
the
difficulties
he
wasencountering
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
however
,
he
was
startled
by
a
bluephosphoric
light
streaming
through
the
bushes
on
the
left
,
and
,
lookingup
,
he
beheld
at
the
foot
of
an
enormous
oak
,
whose
giant
rootsprotruded
like
twisted
snakes
from
the
bank
,
a
wild
spectral
-
lookingobject
,
possessing
some
slight
resemblance
to
humanity
,
and
habited
,
so
far
as
it
could
be
determined
,
in
the
skins
of
deer
,
strangelydisposed
about
its
gaunt
and
tawny
-
coloured
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
On
its
head
wasseen
a
sort
of
helmet
,
formed
of
the
skull
of
a
stag
,
from
whichbranched
a
large
pair
of
antlers
;
from
its
left
arm
hung
a
heavy
andrusty
-
looking
chain
,
in
the
links
of
which
burnt
the
phosphoric
firebefore
mentioned
;
while
on
its
right
wrist
was
perched
a
large
hornedowl
,
with
feathers
erected
,
and
red
staring
eyes
.
<EOS>
Impressed
with
the
superstitious
feelings
common
to
the
age
,
theyoung
earl
,
fully
believing
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
supernaturalbeing
,
could
scarcely
,
despite
his
courageous
nature
,
which
noordinary
matter
would
have
shaken
,
repress
a
cry
.
 
<EOS>
Crossing
himself
,
herepeated
,
with
great
fervency
,
a
prayer
,
against
evil
spirits
,
and
as
heuttered
it
the
light
was
extinguished
,
and
the
spectral
figure
vanished
.
<EOS>
The
clanking
of
the
chain
was
heard
,
succeeded
by
the
hooting
of
theowl
;
then
came
a
horrible
burst
of
laughter
,
then
a
fearful
wail
,
and
allwas
silent
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
moment
the
young
earl
had
stood
still
,
as
if
spell
-
bound
;
butbeing
now
convinced
that
the
spirit
had
fled
,
he
pressed
forward
,
and
,
ere
many
seconds
,
emerged
from
the
brake
.
 
<EOS>
The
full
moon
was
risingas
he
issued
forth
,
and
illuminating
the
glades
and
vistas
,
and
thecalmness
and
beauty
of
all
around
seemed
at
total
variance
with
thefearful
vision
he
had
just
witnessed
.
 
<EOS>
Throwing
a
shuddering
glance
atthe
haunted
dell
,
he
was
about
to
hurry
towards
the
castle
,
when
alarge
,
lightning
-
scathed
,
and
solitary
oak
,
standing
a
little
distance
fromhim
,
attracted
his
attention
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
very
tree
connected
with
the
wild
legend
of
Herne
theHunter
,
which
Captain
Bouchier
had
warned
him
not
to
approach
,
andhe
now
forcibly
recalled
the
caution
.
 
<EOS>
Beneath
it
<EOS>
he
perceived
a
figure
,
which
he
at
first
took
for
that
of
the
spectral
hunter
;
but
his
fears
wererelieved
by
a
shout
from
the
person
,
who
at
the
same
moment
appearedto
catch
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
,
in
the
present
instance
,
he
had
to
do
with
a
being
of
this
world
,
Surrey
ran
towards
the
tree
,
and
on
approaching
it
perceived
that
the
object
of
his
alarm
was
a
young
man
of
very
athletic
proportions
,
and
evidently
,
from
his
garb
,
a
keeper
of
the
forest
.
<EOS>
He
was
habited
in
a
jerkin
of
Lincoln
green
cloth
,
with
the
royal
badgewoven
in
silver
on
the
breast
,
and
his
head
was
protected
by
a
flatgreen
cloth
cap
,
ornamented
with
a
pheasant
's
tail
.
 
<EOS>
Under
his
right
armhe
carried
a
crossbow
;
a
long
silver
-
tipped
horn
was
slung
in
hisbaldric
;
and
he
was
armed
with
a
short
hanger
,
or
wood
-
knife
.
 
<EOS>
Hisfeatures
were
harsh
and
prominent
;
and
he
bad
black
beetling
brows
,
alarge
coarse
mouth
,
and
dark
eyes
,
lighted
up
with
a
very
sinister
andmalignant
expression
.
<EOS>
He
was
attended
by
a
large
savage
-
looking
staghound
,
whom
headdressed
as
Bawsey
,
and
whose
fierceness
had
to
be
restrained
asSurrey
approached
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
anything
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
of
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
seen
Herne
the
Hunter
himself
,
or
the
fiend
in
his
likeness,"replied
Surrey
.
<EOS>
And
he
briefly
related
the
vision
he
had
beheld
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
ay
,
you
have
seen
the
demon
hunter
,
no
doubt
,
"
replied
the
keeperat
the
close
of
the
recital
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
neither
saw
the
light
,
nor
heard
thelaughter
,
nor
the
wailing
cry
you
speak
of
;
but
Bawsey
crouched
at
myfeet
and
whined
,
and
I
knew
some
evil
thing
was
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Heavenshield
us
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
the
hound
crouched
at
his
feet
,
anddirected
her
gaze
towards
the
oak
,
uttering
a
low
ominous
whine
,
"
sheis
at
the
same
trick
again
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
earl
glanced
in
the
same
direction
,
and
half
expected
to
see
theknotted
trunk
of
the
tree
burst
open
and
disclose
the
figure
of
thespectral
hunter
.
 
<EOS>
But
nothing
was
visible
--
at
least
,
to
him
,
though
itwould
seem
from
the
shaking
limbs
,
fixed
eyes
,
and
ghastly
visage
ofthe
keeper
,
that
some
appalling
object
was
presented
to
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
not
see
him
?
"
cried
the
latter
at
length
,
in
thrilling
accents
;
"
heis
circling
the
tree
,
and
blasting
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
he
passes
us
now
--
do
you
notsee
him?""No
,
"
replied
Surrey
;
"
but
do
not
let
us
tarry
here
longer
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
keeper
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
The
touch
seemed
torouse
him
to
exertion
:
He
uttered
a
fearful
cry
,
and
set
off
at
a
quickpace
along
the
park
,
followed
by
Bawsey
,
with
her
tail
between
herlegs
.
 
<EOS>
The
earl
kept
up
with
him
,
and
neither
halted
till
they
had
left
thewizard
oak
at
a
considerable
distance
behind
them
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
you
did
not
see
him
?
"
said
the
keeper
,
in
a
tone
of
exhaustion
,
as
he
wiped
the
thick
drops
from
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
did
not
,
"
replied
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"That
is
passing
strange
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
myself
have
seen
himbefore
,
but
never
as
he
appeared
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""You
are
a
keeper
of
the
forest
,
I
presume
,
friend
?
"
said
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Howare
you
named?""I
am
called
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
"
replied
the
keeper
;
"
and
you?""I
am
the
Earl
of
Surrey
;
'
returned
the
young
noble
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Fenwolf
,
making
a
reverence
,
"
the
son
to
his
graceof
Norfolk?"The
earl
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
then
,
you
must
be
the
young
nobleman
whom
I
used
to
see
sooften
with
the
king
's
son
,
the
Duke
of
Richmond
,
three
or
four
yearsago
,
at
the
castle
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Fenwolf
<EOS>
"
You
are
altogether
grown
out
ofmy
recollection
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
unlikely
,
"
returned
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
at
Oxford
,
and
have
onlyjust
completed
my
studies
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
first
time
I
have
been
at
Windsorsince
the
period
you
mention
.
<EOS>
""I
have
heard
that
the
Duke
of
Richmond
was
at
Oxford
likewise,"observed
<EOS>
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"We
were
at
Cardinal
College
together
,
"
replied
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
duke'sterm
was
completed
before
mine
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
my
senior
by
three
years
.
<EOS>
"I
suppose
your
lordship
is
returning
to
the
castle
?
"
said
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
attendants
are
waiting
for
me
at
the
Garter
,
and
if
you
will
accompany
me
thither
,
I
will
bestow
a
cup
of
good
aleupon
you
to
recruit
you
after
the
fright
you
have
undergone
.
<EOS>
"Fenwolf
signified
his
graceful
acquiescence
,
and
they
walked
on
insilence
,
for
the
earl
could
not
help
dwelling
upon
the
vision
he
hadwitnessed
,
and
his
companion
appeared
equally
abstracted
.
 
<EOS>
In
thissort
they
descended
the
hill
near
Henry

Eighth

Curfew
Tower
.
<EOS>
Turning
off
on
the
right
,
the
earl
and
his
companion
continued
todescend
the
hill
until
they
came
in
sight
of
the
Garter
--
a
snug
littlehostel
,
situated
immediately
beneath
the
Curfew
Tower
.
<EOS>
Before
the
porch
were
grouped
the
earl
's
attendants
,
most
of
whom
haddismounted
,
and
were
holding
their
steeds
by
the
bridles
.
 
<EOS>
At
thisjuncture
the
door
of
the
hostel
opened
,
and
a
fat
jolly

lookingpersonage
,
with
a
bald
head
and
bushy
grey
beard
,
and
clad
in
a

issued
forth

bearing
a

<EOS>
His
appearance
was
welcomed
by
a
joyful
shoutfrom
the
attendants
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
my
masters
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
filling
the
horn
,
"
here
is
a

there

<EOS>
""Marry

"
cried
the
foremost
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
spokeof
him
as
such
in
his

not
long

he
laughed

<EOS>
I
love

<EOS>
asked
the
host
,
againfilling
the
horn
,
and
handing
it
to
another
attendant
.
<EOS>
The
person
addressed
nodded
,
but
he
was
too
much
engrossed
by
thehorn
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"Then
there
will
be
rare
doings
in
the
castle

chuckled
the
host
;
"
andmany
<EOS>
a
lusty

be

<EOS>
Alack
-
a

day
!
<EOS>
how
timesare
changed
since
I
,
Bryan
Bowntance
,
first
stepped
into
my
father'sshoes
,
and
became
host
of
the
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
1501
-
-twenty
-
eightyears
ago
--
when
King
Henry
the
Seventh
,
of
blessed
memory
,
ruled
theland
,
and
when
his
elder
son
,
Prince
Arthur
,
was
alive
likewise
.
 
<EOS>
In
thatyear
the
young
prince
espoused
Catherine
of
Arragon
,
our
presentqueen
,
and
soon
afterwards
died
;
whereupon
the
old
king
,
not
liking
--
forhe
loved
his
treasure
better
than
his
own
flesh
--
to
part
with
her
dowry
,
gave
her
to
his
second
son
,
Henry
,
our
gracious
sovereign
,
whom
Godpreserve
!
<EOS>
Folks
said
then
the
match
would
n't
come
to
good
;
and
nowwe
find
they
spoke
the
truth
,
for
it
is
likely
to
end
in
a
divorce
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
loud
,
mine
host
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
foremost
attendant
;
"
here
comes
ouryoung
master
,
the
Earl
of
Surrey
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
care
not
,
"
replied
the
host
bluffly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
've
spoken
no
treason
.
 
<EOS>
Ilove
my
king
;
and
if
he
wishes
to
have
a
divorce
,
I
hope
his
holiness
thePope
will
grant
him
one
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
said
this
,
a
loud
noise
was
heard
within
the
hostel
,
and
a
manwas
suddenly
and
so
forcibly
driven
forth
,
that
he
almost
knocked
downBryan
Bowntance
,
who
was
rushing
in
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
Theperson
thus
ejected
,
who
was
a
powerfully
-
built
young
man
,
in
aleathern
doublet
,
with
his
muscular
arms
bared
to
the
shoulder
,
turnedhis
rage
upon
the
host
,
and
seized
him
by
the
throat
with
a
grip
thatthreatened
him
with
strangulation
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
but
for
the
intervention
ofthe
earl
's
attendants
,
who
rushed
to
his
assistance
,
such
might
havebeen
his
fate
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
liberated
,
Bryan
cried
in
a
voice
ofmingled
rage
and
surprise
to
his
assailant
,
"
<EOS>
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
,
Mark
Fytton?--are
<EOS>
you
gone
mad
,
or
do
you
mistake
me
for
a
sheep
or
abullock
,
that
you
attack
me
in
this
fashion
?
<EOS>
My
strong
ale
must
havegot
into

with
a

<EOS>
"The

knave
has
been
speaking
treason
of
the

's
highness

"
said
thetall
man
,
whose
doublet
and
hose
of
the
finest
green
cloth
,
as
well
asthe
<EOS>
how
and
quiverful
of
arrows
at
his
back
,
proclaimed
him
an
archer--"and
<EOS>
therefore
we
turned
him
out!""And
<EOS>
you
did
well
,
Captain
Barlow

"
cried
the
host
.
<EOS>
"Call
me
rather
<EOS>
the
Duke
of
Shoreditch
,
"
rejoined
the
tall
archer
;
"
forsince
his
majesty
conferred
the
title
upon
me
,
though
it
were
but
in
jest
,
when
I
won
this
silver
bugle
<EOS>
,
I
shall
ever
claim
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
alwaysdesignated
by
my
neighbours
in
Shoreditch
as
his

and
I
requirethe

attention
at

<EOS>
To

<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
crave
your
grace
's
pardon
for
my
want
of
respect

"
replied
the
host
.
<EOS>
"I
am
not
ignorant
of
the
distinction
conferred
upon
you
at

<EOS>
But
to
the
matter
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Whattreason
hath
Mark
Fytton
,
the
butcher
,
been
talking?""I
care
not
to
repeat
his
words
,
mine
host

"
replied
the
duke
;
"
but
hehath
spoken
in
unbecoming
terms
of
his
highness
and
Mistress
AnneBoleyn
.
<EOS>
""He
means
not
what
he
says
,
"
rejoined
the
host
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
loyal
subjectof
the
king
;
but
he
is
apt
to
get
quarrelsome
over
his
cups
.
<EOS>
""Well
said
,
honest
Bryan
,
"
cried
the
duke
;
"
you
have
one
quality
of
agood
landlord
--
that
of

peacemaker

<EOS>
Give
the
knave
a
cup
of
ale

andlet
him
wash
down
his
foul

<EOS>
""I
do
not

to

dubbed

<EOS>
rejoined
Mark;"but
<EOS>
if
you
will
doff
your

up

Iwill
give

<EOS>
""Well

<EOS>
cried
one
of
Surrey

attendants
.
 
<EOS>
"
Youshall
be
made
a

yourself

<EOS>
""Or

a

cried
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
""He

"
<EOS>
cried
theduke
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
blasphemer
as
well
as

<EOS>
""Drink
<EOS>
the
king
's
health
in
a
full
cup
,
Mark
,
"
interposed
the
host
,
anxious
to
set
matters
aright
,
"
and
keep
your
mischievous
tonguebetween
your

<EOS>
""Beshrew

cried
Mark
boldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
tell

<EOS>
I

the

I

a

faster

<EOS>
""A
foolish
wish
,
"
cried
Bryan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mark
,
you
are
clean
crazed!""It
<EOS>
is
the
king
who
is
crazed
,
not
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
would
sacrificehis
rightful
consort
to
his
unlawful
passion
;
and
you

base
hirelings

support
the
tyrant
in
his
wrongful
conduct
<EOS>
I""Saints
protect
us

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Bryan
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
this
is
flat
treason
.
 
<EOS>
Mark
,
I
can
no
longer
uphold
you
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
if
you
do
not
desire
to
share
his
prison
,
mine
host
,
"
cried
the
Dukeof
Shoreditch
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
all
heard
him
call
the
king
a
tyrant
.
 
<EOS>
Seize
him
,
my
masters!""Let
<EOS>
them
lay
hands
upon
me
if

"
<EOS>
cried
the
butcher
resolutely
.
<EOS>
"I
have
felled
an
ox
with
a
blow
of
my
fist
before
this
,
and
I
promise
youI
will
show
them
no
better
treatment
.
<EOS>
"Awed
by
Mark
's
determined
manner
,
the
bystanders
kept
aloof
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
command
you
,
in
the
king
's
name
,
to
seize
him
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Shoreditch
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
he
offers
resistance
he
will
assuredly
be
hanged
.
<EOS>
""No
one
shall
touch
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mark
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"That
remains
to
be
seen
,
"
said
the
foremost
of
the
Earl
of
Surrey'sattendants
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yield
,
fellow!""Never
!
"
replied
Mark
;
"
and
I
warn
you
to
keep
off
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
attendant
,
however
,
advanced
;
but
before
he
could
lay
hands
onthe
butcher
he
received
a
blow
from
his
ox
-
like
fist
that
sent
him
reelingbackwards
for
several
paces
,
and
finally
stretched
him
at
full
lengthupon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
His
companions
drew
their
swords
,
and
would
haveinstantly
fallen
upon
the
sturdy
offender
,
if
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
who
,
withthe
Earl
of
Surrey
,
was
standing
among
the
spectators
,
had
not
rushedforward
,
and
,
closing
with
Mark
before
the
latter
could
strike
a
blow
,
grappled
with
him
,
and
held
him
fast
till
he
was
secured
,
and
his
armstied
behind
him
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
it
is
you
,
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
who
have
served
me
this
ill
turn
,
eh?"cried
<EOS>
the
butcher
,
regarding
him
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
now
believe
all
I
haveheard
of
you
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
have
you
heard
of
him
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Surrey
,
advancing
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
he
has
dealings
with
the
fiend
--
with
Herne
the
Hunter
,
"
repliedMark
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
hanged
for
a
traitor
,
he
ought
to
be
burnt
for
a
wizard
.
<EOS>
""Heed
<EOS>
not
what
the
villain
says
,
<EOS>
my
good
fellow
,
"
said
the
Duke
ofShoreditch
;
"
you
have
captured
him
bravely
,
and
I
will
take
<EOS>
care
yourconduct
is
duly
reported
to
his
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
castle
with
him
!
<EOS>
To

<EOS>
He
will
lodge
to
-
night
in
the
deepest
dungeon
of
yonfortification
,
"
pointing
to
the
Curfew
Tower
above
them
,
"
there
to
awaitthe
king
's
judgment
;
and
to
-
morrow
night
it
will
be
well
for
him
if
he
isnot
swinging
from
the
gibbet
near
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
him
along
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
followed
by
Morgan
Fenwolf
and
the
others
,
with
the
prisoner
,
hestrode
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Long
before
this
Captain
Bouchier
had
issued
from
the
hostel
andjoined
the
earl
,
and
they
walked
together
after
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
fewminutes
the
Duke
of
Shoreditch
reached
Henry
the
Eighth
's
Gate
,
wherehe
shouted
to
a
sentinel
,
and
told
him
what
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
After
somedelay
a
wicket
in
the
gate
was
opened
,
and
the
chief
persons
of
theparty
were
allowed
to
pass
through
it
with
the
prisoner
,
who
wasassigned
to
the
custody
of
a
couple
of
arquebusiers
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
an
officer
had
arrived
,
and
it
was
agreed
,
at
the
suggestionof
the
Duke
of
Shoreditch
,
to
take
the
offender
to
the
Curfew
Tower
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
crossed
the
lower
ward
,
and
passing
beneath
anarchway
near
the
semicircular
range
of
habitations
allotted
to
the
pettycanons
,
traversed
the
space
before
the
west
end
of
Saint
George'sChapel
,
and
descending
a
short
flight
of
stone
steps
at
the
left
,
andthreading
a
narrow
passage
,
presently
arrived
at
the
arched
entrancein
the
Curfew
,
whose
hoary
walls
shone
brightly
in
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
They
had
to
knock
for
some
time
against
the
stout
oak
door
before
anynotice
was
taken
of
the
summons
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
an
old
man
,
who
acted
asbellringer
,
thrust
his
head
out
of
one
of
the
narrow
pointed
windowsabove
,
and
demanded
their
business
.
 
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
the
reply
,
hedescended
,
and
,
opening
the
door
,
admitted
them
into
a
lofty
chamber
,
the
roof
of
which
was
composed
of
stout
planks
,
crossed
by
heavyoaken
rafters
,
and
supported
by
beams
of
the
same
material
.
 
<EOS>
On
theleft
a
steep
ladder
-
like
flight
of
wooden
steps
led
to
an
upper
room
,
andfrom
a
hole
in
the
roof
descended
a
bell
-
rope
,
which
was
fastened
toone
of
the
beams
,
showing
the
use
to
which
the
chamber
was
put
.
<EOS>
Some
further
consultation
was
now
held
among
the
party
as
to
thepropriety
of
leaving
the
prisoner
in
this
chamber
under
the
guard
of
thearquebusiers
,
but
it
was
at
last
decided
against
doing
so
,
and
the
oldbellringer
being
called
upon
for
the
keys
of
the
dungeon
beneath
,
hespeedily
produced
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
went
forth
,
and
descending
a
flightof
stone
steps
on
the
left
,
came
to
a
low
strong
door
,
which
theyunlocked
,
and
obtained
admission
to
a
large
octangular
chamber
with
avaulted
roof
,
and
deep
embrasures
terminated
by
narrow
loopholes
.
<EOS>
The
light
of
a
lamp
carried
by
the
bellringer
showed
the
dreary
extent
ofthe
vault
,
and
the
enormous
thickness
of
its
walls
.
<EOS>
"A
night
's
solitary
confinement
in
this
place
will
be
of
infinite
service
toour
prisoner
,
"
said
the
Duke
of
Shoreditch
,
gazing
around
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
swornhe
<EOS>
is
ready
to
bite
off
the
foolish
tongue
that
has
brought
him
to
such
apass
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
butcher
made
no
reply
,
but
being
released
by
the
arquebusiers
,
satdown
upon
a
bench
that
constituted
the
sole
furniture
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
I
leave
him
the
lamp
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
bellringer
;
"
he
may
beguile
thetime
by
reading
the
names
of
former
prisoners
scratched
on
the
wallsand
in
the
embrasures
.
<EOS>
""No
;
he
shall
not
even
have
that
miserable
satisfaction
,
"
returned
theDuke
of
Shoreditch
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
be
left
in
the
darkness
to
his
own
badand
bitter
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
the
party
withdrew
,
and
the
door
was
fastened
upon
theprisoner
.
 
<EOS>
An
arquebusier
was
stationed
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
;
and
theEarl
of
Surrey
and
Captain
Bouchier
having
fully
satisfied
their
curiosity
,
shaped
their
course
towards
the
castle
gate
.
 
<EOS>
On
their
way
thither
theearl
looked
about
for
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
but
could
nowhere
discern
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
passed
through
the
wicket
with
Bouchier
,
and
proceeding
tothe
Garter
,
they
mounted
their
steeds
,
and
galloped
off
towardsDatchet
,
and
thence
to

and

<EOS>
A
joyous
day
was
it
for
Windsor
and
great
<EOS>
were
the
preparations
made
by
its
loyal
inhabitants
for
a
suitable
reception
to
their
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
At
an
early
hour
the
town
was
thronged
with
strangers
from
the
neighbouring
villages
,
and
later
on
crowds
began
to
arrive
from
London
,
some
having
come
along
the
highway
on
horseback
,
and
others
having
rowed
in
various
craft
up
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
All
were
clad
in
holiday
attire
,
and
the
streets
presented
an
appearance
of
unwonted
bustle
and
gaiety
.
 
<EOS>
The
Maypole
in
Bachelors
'
Acre
was
hung
with
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
Several
booths
,
with
flags
floating
above
them
,
were
erected
in
the
same
place
,
where
ale
,
mead
,
and
hypocras
,
together
with
cold
pasties
,
hams
,
capons
,
and
large
joints
of
beef
and
mutton
,
might
be
obtained
.
 
<EOS>
Mummers
and
minstrels
were
in
attendance
,
and
every
kind
of
diversion
was
going
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
one
party
wrestling
;
there
another
,
casting
the
bar
;
on
this
side
a
set
of
rustics
were
dancing
a
merry
round
with
a
bevy
of
buxom
Berkshire
lasses
;
on
that
stood
a
fourth
group
,
listening
to
a
youth
playing
on
the
recorders
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
end
of
the
Acre
large
fires
were
lighted
,
before
which
two
whole
oxen
were
roasting
,
provided
in
honour
of
the
occasion
by
the
mayor
and
burgesses
of
the
town
;
at
the
other
,
butts
were
set
against
which
the
Duke
of
Shoreditch
and
his
companions
,
the
five
marquises
,
were
practising
.
 
<EOS>
The
duke
himself
shot
admirably
,
and
never
failed
to
hit
the
bulls
-
eye
;
but
the
great
feat
of
the
day
was
performed
by
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
who
thrice
split
the
duke
's
shafts
as
they
stuck
in
the
mark
.
<EOS>
"Well
done
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
duke
,
as
he
witnessed
the
achievement
;
"
why
,
you
shoot
as
bravely
as
Herne
the
Hunter
.
 
<EOS>
Old
wives
tell
us
he
used
tosplit
the
arrows
of
his
comrades
in
that
fashion
.
<EOS>
""He
must
have
learnt
the
trick
from
Herne
himself
in
the
forest
,
"
criedone
of
the
bystanders
.
<EOS>
Morgan
Fenwolf
looked
fiercely
round
in
search
of
the
speaker
,
butcould
not
discern
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
shot
no
more
,
and
refusing
a
cupof
hypocras
offered
him
by
Shoreditch
,
disappeared
among
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
the
booths
were
emptied
,
the
bar
thrown
down
,
theMaypole
and
the
butts
deserted
,
and
the
whole
of
Bachelors
'
Acrecleared
of
its
occupants
--
except
those
who
were
compelled
to
attendto
the
mighty
spits
turning
before
the

--
by
the
loud
discharge
ofordnance
from
the
castle
gates
,
accompanied
by
the
ringing
of
bells
,
announcing
that
the

and
burgesses
of
Windsor

with
theofficers
of
the
Order
of
the
Garter
,
were

forth
to
Datchet
Bridgeto
<EOS>

the
royal
procession
.
<EOS>
Those
who
most
promptly
obeyed
this
summons
beheld
the
lowercastle
gate
,
built
by
the
then
reigning
monarch
,
open
,
while
from
itissued
four
trumpeters
clad
in
emblazoned
coats
,
with
silken
bandrolsdepending
from
their
horns
,
blowing
loud
fanfares
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
followedby
twelve
henchmen
,
walking
four
abreast
,
arrayed
in
scarlet
tunics
,
with
the
royal
cypher
H.R.
 
worked
in
gold
on
the
breast
,
and
carryinggilt
poleaxes
over
their
shoulders
.
 
<EOS>
Next
came
a
company
of
archers
,
equipped
in
helm
and
brigandine
,
and
armed
with
long
pikes
,
glittering
,
as
did
their
steel
accoutrements
,
in
the
bright
sunshine
.
 
<EOS>
They
weresucceeded
by
the
bailiffs
and
burgesses
of
the
town
,
riding
threeabreast
,
and
enveloped
in

of
scarlet

;
after
which
rode
themayor

in
a
gown
of
crimson
velvet
,
and
attended
by
twofootmen
,
in
white

red
damask
,
carrying
white
wands
.
 
<EOS>
The
mayorwas
followed
by
a
company
of
the
town

,
with
partisans
over
theshoulders
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
sheriff
of
the
county
and
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
Next
followed
the
twenty

six

and
wearing
red
mantles
,
with
a
scutcheon
ofSaint

on
the
shoulder
,
but
without
the

surrounding
it
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
thirteen
petty
canons
,

coloured

,
withthe

of
Saint

wrought

;
then
thetwelve
canons
,
similarly
attired
;
and
lastly
the
dean
of
the
college
,
inhis
cope
.
<EOS>
A
slight
pause
ensued
,
and
the
chief
officers
of
the
Garter
made
theirappearance
.
 
<EOS>
First
walked
the
Black
Rod
,
clothed
in
a
russet
-
colouredmantle
,
faced
with
alternate
panes
of

emblazoned

He

,

of
his

,
surmounted

<EOS>
After
the
Black
Rod
came
the
Garter
,
habited
in
a
gown
of
crimsonsatin
,
paned
and
emblazoned

with
a

upon
it
,
and
having
a
gilt
crown
inlieu
of
a

upon

.
 
<EOS>
The

followed
by
the

,
agrave

,
in
a
black
gown
,
with
a
surplice
over
it
,
covered
by

.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
chancellor
of
the
Order
,
in
his
robe
ofmurrey

coloured

lined
with

,
with
a

<EOS>
Lastly

of

,
encompassed
with
theGarter
,
and
adorned
with

of
blue

mingled
with

.
<EOS>
Brought
up
by
a
rear
guard
of
halberdiers
,
the
procession
moved
slowlyalong
Thames
Street
,
the
houses
of
which
,
as
well
as
those
in
PeascodStreet
,
were
all
more
or
less
decorated
--
the
humbler
sort
being
coveredwith
branches
of
trees
,
intermingled
with
garlands
of
flowers
,
while
thebetter
description
was
hung
with
pieces
of
tapestry
,
carpets
,
and
richstuffs
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
should
it
pass
unnoticed
that
the
loyalty
of
BryanBowntance
,
the
host
of
the
Garter
,
had
exhibited
itself
in
an
archthrown
across
the
road
opposite
his
house
,
adorned
with
variouscoloured
ribbons
and
flowers
,
<EOS>
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
large
shield
,
exhibiting
the
letters
,
b.
 
and
h.
 
(
in
mystic
allusion
to
Henry
and
AnneBoleyn
)
intermingled
and
surrounded
by
love
-
knots
.
<EOS>
Turning
off
on
the
left
into
the
lower
road
,
skirting
the
north
of
thecastle
,
and
following
the
course
of
the
river
to
Datchet
,
by
which
it
wasunderstood
the
royal
cavalcade
would
make
its
approach
,
theprocession
arrived
at
an
open
space
by
the
side
of
the
river
,
where
itcame
to
a
halt
,
and
the
dean
,
chancellor
,
and
prelate
,
together
<EOS>
withother
officers
of
the
Garter
,
embarked
in
a
barge
moored
to
the
bank
,
which
was
towed
slowly
down
the
stream
in
the
direction
of
DatchetBridge
--
a
band
of
minstrels
stationed
within
it
playing
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
rest
of
the
cavalcade
,
having
again
set
for
ward
,
pursued
their
course
along
the
banks
of
the
river
,
proceeding
at
a
foot'space
,
and
accompanied
by
crowds
of
spectators
,
cheering
them
asthey
moved
along
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
was
bright
and
beautiful
,
and
nothing
waswanting
to
enhance
the
beauty
of
the
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
left
flowed
thesilver
Thames
,
crowded
with
craft
,
filled
with
richly
-
dressed
personagesof
both
sexes
,
amid
which
floated
the
pompous
barge
appropriated
tothe
officers
of
the
Garter
,
which
was
hung
with
banners
and
streamers
,
and
decorated
at
the
sides
with
targets
,
emblazoned
with
the
arms
<EOS>
ofSt
.
 
George
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
greensward
edging
the
stream
marched
a
brilliantcavalcade
,
and
on
the
right
lay
the
old
woods
of
the
Home
Park
,
withlong
vistas
opening
through
them
,
giving
exquisite
peeps
of
the
towersand
battlements
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
brought
the
cavalcade
to
Datchet
Bridge
,
at
the
foot
ofwhich
a
pavilion
was
erected
for
the
accommodation
of
the
mayor
andburgesses
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
,
having
dismounted
,
they
awaited
the
king'sarrival
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
a
cloud
of
dust
on
the
Staines
Road
seemed
toannounce
the
approach
of
the
royal
party
,
and
all
rushed
forth
and
heldthemselves
in
readiness
to
meet
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
dust
appeared
to
havebeen
raised
by
a
company
of
horsemen
,
headed
by
Captain
Bouchier
,
who
rode
up
the
next
moment
.
 
<EOS>
Courteously
saluting
the
mayor
,
Bouchier
informed
him
that
Mistress
Anne
Boleyn
was
close
behind
,
and
that
it
was
the
king
's
pleasure
that
she
should
be
attended
in
allstate
to
the
lower
gate
of
the
castle
,
there
to
await
his
coming
,
as
hehimself
intended
to
enter
it
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
mayor
replied
that
thesovereign
's
behests
should
be
implicitly
obeyed
,
and
he
thereuponstationed
himself
at
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
in
expectation
ofAnne
Boleyn
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
Presently
the
sound
of
trumpets
smote
his
ear
,
and
a
numerous
andsplendid
retinue
was
seen
advancing
,
consisting
of
nobles
,
knights
,
esquires
,
and
gentlemen
,
ranged
according
to
their
degrees
,
and
allsumptuously
apparelled
in
cloths
of
gold
and
silver
,
and
velvets
ofvarious
colours
,
richly
embroidered
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
were
pagesand
other
attendants
in
the
liveries
of
their
masters
,
together
withsergeants
of
the
guard
and
henchmen
in
their
full
accoutrements
.
<EOS>
Among
the
nobles
were
the
Dukes
of
Norfolk
and
Suffolk
--
the
king
beingdesirous
of
honouring
as
much
as
possible
her
whom
he
had
resolvedto
<EOS>
make
his
queen
.
 
<EOS>
The
former
was
clothed
in
tissue
,
embroidered
withroses
of
gold
,
with
a
baldric
across
his
body
of
massive
gold
,
and
wasmounted
on
a
charger
likewise
trapped
in
gold
;
and
the
latter
wore
amantle
of
cloth
of
silver
,
pounced
in
the
form
of
letters
,
and
lined
withblue
velvet
,
while
his
horse
was
trapped
bardwise
in
harnessembroidered
with
bullion
gold
curiously
wrought
.
 
<EOS>
Both
also
wore
thecollar
of
the
Order
of
the
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
Near
them
rode
Sir
Thomas
Boleyn
,
who
,
conscious
of
the
dignity
to
which
his
daughter
was
to
beadvanced
,
comported
himself
with
almost
intolerable
haughtiness
.
<EOS>
Immediately
behind
Sir
Thomas
Boleyn
came
a
sumptuous
littercovered
with
cloth
of
gold
,
drawn
by
four
white
palfreys
<EOS>
caparisoned
inwhite
damask
down
to
the
ground
,
and
each
having
a
page
in
white
andblue
satin
at
its
head
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
litter
was
borne
a
canopy
of
cloth
ofgold
supported
by
four
gilt
staves
,
and
ornamented
at
the
corners
withsilver
bells
,
ringing
forth
sweet
music
as
it
moved
along
.
 
<EOS>
Each
staffwas
borne
by
a
knight
,
of
whom
sixteen
were
in
attendance
to
relieveone
another
when
fatigued
.
<EOS>
In
this
litter
sat
Anne
Boleyn
.
 
<EOS>
She
wore
a
surcoat
of
white
tissue
,
and
amantle
of
the
same
material
lined
with
ermine
.
 
<EOS>
Her
gown
,
which
,
however
,
was
now
concealed
by
the
surcoat
,
was
of
cloth
of
goldtissue
,
raised
with
pearls
of
silver
damask
,
with
a
stomacher
of
purplegold
similarly
raised
,
and
large
open
sleeves
lined
with
chequeredtissue
.
 
<EOS>
Around
her
neck
she
wore
a
chain
of
orient
pearls
,
from
whichdepended
a
diamond
cross
.
 
<EOS>
A
black
velvet
cap
,
richly
embroidered
withpearls
and
other
precious
stones
,
and
ornamented
with
a
small
whiteplume
,
covered
her
head
;
and
her
small
feet
were
hidden
in
blue
velvetbrodequins
,
decorated
with
diamond
stars
.
<EOS>
Anne
Boleyn
's
features
were
exquisitely
formed
,
and
though
notregular
,
far
more
charming
than
if
they
had
been
so
.
 
<EOS>
Her
nose
wasslightly
aquiline
,
but
not
enough
so
to
detract
from
its
beauty
,
and
hada
little
retrousse
;
point
that
completed
its
attraction
.
 
<EOS>
The
restof
<EOS>
her
features
were
delicately
chiselled
:
the
chin
being
beautifullyrounded
,
the
brow
smooth
and
white
as
snow
,
while
the
rose
could
notvie
with
the
bloom
of
her
cheek
.
 
<EOS>
Her
neck
--
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
that
the
fell
hand
ofthe
executioner
should
ever
touch
it
--
was
long
and
slender
,
her
eyeslarge
and
blue
,
and
of
irresistible
witchery
--
sometimes
scorching
thebeholder
like
a
sunbeam
,
anon
melting
him
with
soul
-
subduing
softness
.
<EOS>
Of
her
accomplishments
other
opportunities
will
be
found
to
speak
;
butit
may
be
mentioned
that
she
was
skilled
on
many
instruments
,
dancedand
sang
divinely
,
and
had
rare
powers
of
conversation
and
wit
.
 
<EOS>
If
tothese
she
had
not
added
the
dangerous
desire
to
please
,
and
the
wishto
hold
other
hearts
than
the
royal
one
she
had
enslaved
,
in
thraldom
,
all
might
,
perhaps
,
have
been
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
alas
like
many
other
beautifulwomen
,
she
had
a
strong
tendency
to
coquetry
.
 
<EOS>
How
severely
shesuffered
for
it
,
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
history
to
relate
.
 
<EOS>
An
excellentdescription
of
her
has
been
given
by
a
contemporary
writer
,
the
Comtede
Chateaubriand
,
who
,
while
somewhat
disparaging
her
personalattractions
,
speaks
in
rapturous
terms
of
her
accomplishments
:
"
Anne,"writes
the
Comte
,

Such
was
theopinion
of
one
who
knew
her
well
during
her
residence
at
the
Frenchcourt
,
when
in
attendance
on
Mary
of
England
,
consort
of
Louis
XII.,and
afterwards
Duchess
of
Suffolk
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Anne
's
eyes
were
fixed
with
some
tenderness
upon
oneof
the
supporters
of
her
canopy
on
the
right
--
a
very
handsome
youngman
,
attired
in
a
doublet
and
hose
of
black
tylsent
,
paned
and
cut
,
andwhose
<EOS>
tall
,
well
-
proportioned
figure
was
seen
to
the
greatestadvantage
,
inasmuch
as
he
had
divested
himself
of
his
mantle
,
for
hisbetter
convenience
in
walking
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
me
you
will
fatigue
yourself
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
"
said
Anne
Boleyn
,
in
tones
of
musical
sweetness
,
which
made
the
heart
beat
and
thecolour
mount
to
the
cheeks
of
him
she
addressed
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
betterallow
Sir

Arundel

John
Hulstone

<EOS>
""I
can
feel
no
fatigue
when
near
you
,
madam
,
"
replied
Wyat
,
in
a
lowtone
.
<EOS>
A
slight
blush
overspread
Anne
's
features
,
and
she
raised
herembroidered
kerchief
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
I
had
that
kerchief
I
would
wear
it
at
the
next
lists
,
and
defy
allcomers

"
said
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
have
it
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
love
all
chivalrous
exploits
,
and
will
do
my

to

<EOS>
""Take

said
Sir

the

heldthe

""No

rejoined
Wyat
,
recovering
himself
;
"
I

come
tothe

<EOS>
""You
are
in
no

said
Anne
petulantly

<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
you

cried
Sir

eagerly

"What

<EOS>
he
shouted
to

at

,
"

authority
behindthe

What
if

of
his
companions
,
is
that
a
reason
he
shouldbe
relieved
?
<EOS>
Of
a
surety
not
--
go
on
,
I
say!"The
person
who
thus
spoke
then
stepped
forward
,
and
threw
a
glanceso
full
of
significance
at
Anne
Boleyn
that
she
did
not
care
to
disputethe
order
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
laughingly
acquiesced
in
it
.
<EOS>
Will
Sommers
--
the
king
's
jester
,
as
he
described
himself
--
was
a
smallmiddle
-
aged
personage
,
with
a
physiognomy
in
which
good
nature
andmalice
,
folly
and
shrewdness
,
were
so
oddly
blended
,
that
it
wasdifficult
to
say
which
predominated
.
 
<EOS>
His
look
was
cunning
andsarcastic
,
but
it
was
tempered
by
great
drollery
and
oddity
of
manner
,
and
he
laughed
so
heartily
at
his
own
jests
and
jibes
,
that
it
wasscarcely
possible
to
help
joining
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
attire
consisted
of
a
longloose
gown
of
spotted
crimson
silk
,
with
the
royal
cipher
woven
in
frontin
gold
;
hose
of
blue
cloth
,
guarded
with
red
and
black
cloth
;
and
redcordovan
buskins
.
 
<EOS>
A
sash
tied
round
his
waist
served
him
instead
of
agirdle
,
and
he
wore
a
trencher
-
shaped
velvet
cap
on
his
head
,
with
awhite
tufted
feather
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
hand
he
carried
a
small
horn
.
 
<EOS>
He
wasgenerally
attended
by
a
monkey
,
habited
in
a
crimson
doublet
andhood
,
which
sat
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
played
very
diverting
tricks
<EOS>
,
butthe
animal
was
not
with
him
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
Will
Sommers
was
a
great
favourite
with
the
king
,
and
ventured
uponfamiliarities
which
no
one
else
dared
to
use
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
favour
inwhich
he
stood
with
his
royal
master
procured
him
admittance
to
hispresence
at
all
hours
and
at
all
seasons
,
and
his
influence
,
thoughseldom
exerted
,
was
very
great
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
especially
serviceable
inturning
aside
the
edge
of
the
king
's
displeasure
,
and
more
frequentlyexerted
himself
to
allay
the
storm
than
to
raise
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
principal
hostilitywas
directed
against
Wolsey
,
whose
arrogance
and
grasping
practiceswere
the
constant
subjects
of
his
railing
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
seldom
,
such
was
hisprivileged
character
,
and
the
protection
he
enjoyed
from
the
sovereign
,
that
any
of
the
courtiers
resented
his
remarks
;
but
Sir
Thomas
Wyat'sfeelings
being
now
deeply
interested
,
he
turned
sharply
round
,
andsaid
,
"
How
now
,
thou
meddling
varlet
,
what
business
hast
thou
tointerfere?""I
interfere
to
prove
my
authority
,
gossip
Wyat
,
"
replied
Sommers
,
"
andto
show
that
,
varlet
as
I
am
,
I
am
as
powerful
as
Mistress
Anne
Boleyn
--
nay
,
that
I
am
yet
more
powerful
,
because
I
am
obeyed
,
while
she
isnot
.
<EOS>
""Were
<EOS>
I
at
liberty
,
"
said
Sir
Thomas
angrily
,
"
I
would
make
thee
repentthine
insolence
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
thou
art
not
at
liberty
,
good
gossip
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
jester
,
screamingwith
laughter
;
"
thou
art
tied
like
a
slave
to
the
oar
,
and
can
not
freethyself
from
it
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
<EOS>
Having
enjoyed
the
knight
's
discomposure
for
afew
seconds
,
he
advanced
towards
him
,
and
whispered
in
his
ear,"Don't
mistake
me
,
gossip
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
thee
good
service
in
preventingthee
from
taking
that
kerchief
.
 
<EOS>
Hadst
thou
received
it
in
the
presenceof
these
witnesses
,
thou
wouldst
have
been
lodged
in
the
Round
Towerof
Windsor
Castle
to
-
morrow
,
instead
of
feasting
with
the
knights
-
companions
in
Saint
George
's
Hall
.
<EOS>
""I
believe
thou
art
right
,
gossip,"said
<EOS>
Wyat
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
Rest
assured
I
am
,
"
replied
Sommers
;
"
and
I
further
more
counsel
theeto
decline
this
dangerous
gift
altogether
,
and
to
think
no
more
of
thefair
profferer
,
or
if
thou
must
think
of
her
,
let
it
be
as
of
one
beyond
thyreach
.
 
<EOS>
Cross
not
the
lion
's
path
;
take
a
friendly
hint
from
the
jackal
.
"And
<EOS>
without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
he
darted
away
,
and
mingled
with
thecavalcade
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Immediately
behind
Anne
Boleyn
's
litter
rode
a
company
of
henchmenof
the
royal
household
,
armed
with
gilt
partisans
.
 
<EOS>
Next
succeeded
achariot
covered
with
red
cloth
of
gold
,
and
drawn
by
four
horses
richlycaparisoned
,
containing
the
old
Duchess
of
Norfolk
and
the
oldMarchioness
of
Dorset
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
king
's
natural
son
,
the
Duke
ofRichmond
--
a
young
man
formed
on
the
same
large
scale
,
anddistinguished
by
the
same
haughty
port
,
and
the
same
bluff
manner
,
ashis
royal
sire
.
 
<EOS>
The
duke
's
mother
was
the
Lady
Talboys
,
esteemed
oneof
the
most
beautiful
women
of
the
age
,
and
who
had
for
a
long
timeheld
the
capricious
monarch
captive
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
was
warmly
attached
tohis
son
,
showered
favours
without
number
upon
him
,
and
might
havedone
yet
more
if
fate
had
not
snatched
him
away
at
an
early
age
.
<EOS>
Though
scarcely
eighteen
,
the
Duke
of
Richmond
looked
more
thantwenty
,
and
his
lips
and
chin
were
clothed
with
a
well
-
grown
thoughclosely
-
clipped
beard
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
magnificently
habited
in
a
doublet
ofcloth
of
gold
of
bawdekin
,
the
placard
and
sleeves
of
which
werewrought
with
flat
gold
,
and
fastened
with
aiglets
.
 
<EOS>
A
girdle
of
crimsonvelvet
,
enriched
with
precious
stones
,
encircled
his
waist
,
andsustained
a
poniard
and
a
Toledo
sword
,
damascened
with
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Overall
he
wore
a
loose
robe
,
or
housse
,
of
scarlet
mohair
,
trimmed
withminever
,
and
was
further
decorated
with
the
collar
of
the
Order
of
theGarter
.
 
<EOS>
His
cap
was
of
white
velvet
,
ornamented
with
emeralds
,
<EOS>
andfrom
the
side
depended
a
small
azure
plume
.
 
<EOS>
He
rode
a
magnificentblack
charger
,
trapped
in
housings
of
cloth
of
gold
,
powdered
withermine
.
<EOS>
By
the
duke
's
side
rode
the
Earl
of
Surrey
attired
--
as
upon
the
previousday
,
and
mounted
on
a
fiery
Arabian
,
trapped
in
crimson
velvet
fringedwith
Venetian
gold
.
 
<EOS>
Both
nobles
were
attended
by
their
esquires
intheir
liveries
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
came
a
chariot
covered
with
cloth
of
silver
,
and
drawn
,
like
the
first
,
by
four
horses
in
rich
housings
,
containing
two
verybeautiful
damsels
,
one
of
whom
attracted
so
much
of
the
attention
ofthe
youthful
nobles
,
that
it
was
with
difficulty
they
could
preserve
dueorder
of
march
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
dame
in
question
was
about
seventeen
;
herface
was
oval
in
form
,
with
features
of
the
utmost
delicacy
andregularity
.
 
<EOS>
Her
complexion
was
fair
and
pale
,
and
contrasted
strikinglywith
her
jetty
brows
and
magnificent
black
eyes
,
of
oriental
size
,
tenderness
,
and
lustre
.
 
<EOS>
Her
dark
and
luxuriant
tresses
were
confinedby
a
cap
of
black
velvet
faced
with
white
satin
,
and
ornamented
withpearls
.
 
<EOS>
Her
gown
was
of
white
satin
worked
with
gold
,
and
had
longopen
pendent
sleeves
,
while
from
her
slender
and
marble
neck
hung
acordeliere
--
a
species
of
necklace
imitated
from
the
cord
worn
byFranciscan
friars
,
and
formed
of
crimson
silk
twisted
with
threads
ofVenetian
gold

<EOS>
This
fair
creature
was
the
Lady
Elizabeth
Fitzgerald
,
daughter
of
GeraldFitzgerald
,
ninth
Earl
of
Kildare
,
who
claimed
descent
from
the
Geraldifamily
of
Florence
;
but
she
was
generally
known
by
the
appellation
ofthe
Fair
Geraldine
--
a
title
bestowed
upon
her
,
on
account
of
her
beauty
,
by
the
king
,
and
by
which
she
still
lives
,
and
will
continue
to
live
,
aslong
as
poetry
endures
,
in
the
deathless
and
enchanting
strains
of
herlover
,
the
Earl
of
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
instance
of
her
mother
,
Lady
Kildare
,
the
Fair
Geraldine
was
brought
up
with
the
Princess
Mary
,
afterwardsQueen
of
England
;
but
she
had
been
lately
assigned
by
the
royal
orderas
one
of
the
attendants
--
a
post
equivalent
to
that
of
maid
of
honour
--
toAnne
Boleyn
.
<EOS>
Her
companion
was
the
Lady
Mary
Howard
,
the
sister
of
the
Earl
ofSurrey
,
a
nymph
about
her
own
age
,
and
possessed
of
great
personalattractions
,
having
nobly
-
formed
features
,
radiant
blue
eyes
,
lighttresses
,
and
a
complexion
of
dazzling
clearness
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Mary
Howardnourished
a
passion
for
the
Duke
of
Richmond
,
whom
she
saw
withsecret
chagrin
captivated
by
the
superior
charms
of
the
Fair
Geraldine
.
<EOS>
Her
uneasiness
,
however
,
was
in
some
degree
abated
by
theknowledge
,
which
as
confidante
of
the
latter
she
had
obtained
,
that
herbrother
was
master
of
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Lady
Mary
was
dressed
in
blue
velvet
,
cut
and
lined
with
cloth
of
gold
,
and
wore
a
headgear
of
white
velvet
,
ornamented
with
pearls
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
cavalcade
came
in
sight
of
Datchet
Bridge
,
the
Duke
ofRichmond
turned
his
horse
's
head
,
and
rode
up
to
the
side
of
thechariot
on
which
the
Fair
Geraldine
was
sitting
.
<EOS>
"I
am
come
to
tell
you
of
a
marvellous
adventure
that
befell
Surrey
inthe
Home
Park
at
Windsor
last
night
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
declares
he
hasseen
the
demon
hunter
,
Herne
.
<EOS>
""Then
pray
let
the
Earl
of
Surrey
relate
the
adventure
to
us
himself,"replied
<EOS>
the
Fair
Geraldine
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
can
tell
a
story
so
well
as
the
heroof
it
.
<EOS>
"The
duke
signed
to
the
youthful
earl
,
who
was
glancing
rather
wistfullyat
them
,
and
he
immediately
joined
them
,
while
Richmond
passed
overto
the
Lady
Mary
Howard
.
 
<EOS>
Surrey
then
proceeded
to
relate
what
hadhappened
to
him
in
the
park
,
and
the
fair
Geraldine
listened
to
hisrecital
with
breathless
interest
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
shield
us
from
evil
spirits
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
crossing
herself
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
what
is
the
history
of
this
wicked
hunter
,
my
lord
?
<EOS>
and
why
did
heincur
such
a
dreadful
doom?""I
know
nothing
more
than
that
he
was
a
keeper
in
the
forest
,
who
,
having
committed
some
heinous
crime
,
hanged
himself
from
a
branchof
the
oak
beneath
which
I
found
the
keeper
,
Morgan
Fenwolf
<EOS>
,
andwhich
still
bears
his
name
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
this
unrighteous
acthe
can
not
obtain
rest
,
but
is
condemned
to
wander
through
the
forestat
midnight
,
where
he
wreaks
his
vengeance
in
blasting
the
trees
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
legend
<EOS>
I
have
heard
differs
from
yours
,
"
observed
the
Duke
ofRichmond
:
"
<EOS>
it
runs
that
the
spirit
by
which
the
forest
is
haunted
is
awood
-
demon
,
who
assumes
the
shape
of
the
ghostly
hunter
,
and
seeksto
tempt
or
terrify
the
keepers
to
sell
their
souls
to
him
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
grace
's
legend
is
the
better
of
the
two
,
"
said
Lady
Mary
Howard,"or
<EOS>
rather
,
I
should
say
,
the
more
probable
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
the
evil
spirit

any
such

,
brother

earl
gravely
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"If
I
were

meet
him
,
and
he
offered
me
my
heart
's
dearest

I
fearhe
would
prevail

"
observed
the
duke
,
glancing
tenderly
at
theFair
Geraldine
.
<EOS>
"Tush!--the
<EOS>
subject
is
too
serious
for
jesting

Richmond

"
said
Surreyalmost
sternly
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
grace
,
as
is
usual
in
compacts
with
the

,
might
have
reason
torue
his

"
observed
Lady
Mary
Howard
peevishly
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Surrey
were
my
brother
,
"
remarked
the
Fair
Geraldine
tothe
Lady
Mary
,
"
I
would
interdict
him
from
roaming
in
the
park
afternightfall

<EOS>
""He

very
wilful

said
Lady

smiling
,
"

<EOS>
""Let

rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
I
must
interpose
to
prevent

utterance

cried
Richmond
,
with
asomewhat
jealous
look
at
his

"
for
I
have
determined
to
knowmore
of

<EOS>
I
think
I
remember
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
the
keeper
,
and
will
send
for
himto
the

and
question
him

<EOS>
But
in
any

I

Surrey

"The
<EOS>
remonstrances

at

the

obeyed
it

,
bending
almost
to

bow
to

resumed
their
posts

<EOS>
The
concourse
assembled
on
Datchet
Bridge
welcomed
Anne

with
loud
acclamations
,
while
joyous
strains
proceeded
fromsackbut
and
psaltery

and
echoing
blasts
from

<EOS>
Capswere
flung
into

a
piece

ordnance
was
fired
from
thebarge

which
was
presently
afterwards
answered
by
the
castle
guns

<EOS>
Having
paid
his
homage
to
Anne

the

rejoined

slowly
along

thebarge

with
the
minstrels
playing
in

Inthis
way
they
reached
Windsor

as
Anne

gazed
up
at
thelordly
castle
above
which
the
royal
standard
now
floated

proud

thoughts
swelled
her
heart

<EOS>
Leaving
the
barge

thecavalcade
ascended

Bryan

who
had
stationedhimself
on
the
right
of
the
arch
in
front
of
his
house
,
attempted
toaddress
Anne
Boleyn
,
but
could
not
bring
forth
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
His
failure
,
however
,
was
more
successful
than
his
speech
might
have
been
,
inasmuchas
it
excited
abundance
of
merriment
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
area
in
front
of
the
lower
gateway
,
<EOS>
Anne
Boleyn
's
litterwas
drawn
up
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
the
whole
of
the
cavalcadegrouping
around
her
,
presented
a
magnificent
sight
to
the
archers
andarquebusiers
stationed
on
the
towers
and
walls
.
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
a
signal
gun
was
heard
from
Datchet
Bridge
,
announcing
that
the
king
had
reached
it
,
and
the
Dukes
of
Suffolk
,
Norfolk
,
and
Richmond
,
together
with
the
Earl
of
Surrey
,
Sir
ThomasWyat
,
and
a
few
of
their
gentle
men
,
rode
back
to
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
hadscarcely
,
however
,
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
when
the
royal
partyappeared
in
view
,
for
the
king
with
his
characteristic
impatience
,
ondrawing
near
the
castle
,
had
urged
his
attendants
quickly
forward
.
<EOS>
First
came
half
a
dozen
trumpeters
,
with
silken
bandrols
fluttering
inthe
breeze
,
blowing
loud
flourishes
.
 
<EOS>
Then
a
party
of
halberdiers
,
whoseleaders
had
pennons
streaming
from
the
tops
of
their
tall
pikes
.
 
<EOS>
Nextcame
<EOS>
two
gentlemen
ushers
bareheaded
,
but
mounted
and
richlyhabited
,
belonging
to
the
Cardinal
of
York
,
who
cried
out
as
theypressed
forward
,
"
On
before
,
my
masters
,
on
before!--make
way
for
mylord
's
grace
.
<EOS>
"Then
came
a
sergeant
-
of
-
arms
bearing
a
great
mace
of
silver
,
and
twogentlemen
carrying
each
a
pillar
of
silver
.
 
<EOS>
Next
rode
a
gentlemancarrying
the
cardinal
's
hat
,
and
after
him
came
Wolsey
himself
,
mounted
on
a
mule
trapped
in
crimson
velvet
,
with
a
saddle
coveredwith
the
same
stuff
,
and
gilt
stirrups
.
 
<EOS>
His
large
person
was
arrayed
inrobes
of
the
finest
crimson
satin
engrained
,
and
a
silk
cap
of
the
samecolour
contrasted
by
its
brightness
with
the
pale
purple
tint
of
hissullen
,
morose
,
and
bloated
features
.
 
<EOS>
The
cardinal
took
no
notice
ofthe
clamour
around
him
,
but
now
and
then
,
when
an
expression
ofdislike
was
uttered
against
him
,
for
he
had
already
begun
to
beunpopular
with
the
people
,
he
would
raise
his
eyes
and
direct
awithering
glance
at
the
hardy
speaker
.
 
<EOS>
But
these
expressions
werefew
,
for
,
though
tottering
,
Wolsey
was
yet
too
formidable
to
be
insultedwith
impunity
.
 
<EOS>
On
either
side
of
him
were
two
mounted
attend
ants
,
each
caring
a
gilt
poleaxe
,
who
,
if
he
had
given
the
word
,
would
haveinstantly
chastised
the
insolence
of
the
bystanders
,
while
behind
himrode
his
two
cross
-
bearers
upon
homes
trapped
in
scarlet
.
<EOS>
Wolsey
's
princely
retinue
was
followed
by
a
litter
of
crimson
velvet
,
inwhich
lay
the
pope
's
legate
,
Cardinal
Campeggio
,
whose
infirmitieswere
so
great
that
he
could
not
move
without
assistance
.
 
<EOS>
Campeggiowas
likewise
attended
by
a
numerous
train
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
line
of
lords
,
knights
,
and
esquires
,
came
Henry
the
Eighth
.
<EOS>
He
was
apparelled
in
a
robe
of
crimson
velvet
furred
with
ermines
,
andwore
a
doublet
of
raised
gold
,
the
placard
of
which
was
embroideredwith
diamonds
,
rubies
,
emeralds
,
large
pearls
,
and
other
preciousstones
.
 
<EOS>
About
his
neck
was
a
baldric
of
balas
rubies
,
and
over
his
robehe
wore
the
collar
of
the
Order
of
the
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
His
horse
,
a
charger
of
thelargest
size
,
and
well
able
to
sustain
his
vast
weight
,
was
trapped
incrimson
velvet
,
purfled
with
ermines
.
 
<EOS>
His
knights
and
esquires
wereclothed
in
purple
velvet
,
and
his
henchmen
in
scarlet
tunics
of
thesame
make
as
those
worn
by
the
warders
of
the
Tower
at
the
presentday
.
<EOS>
Henry
was
in
his
thirty
-
eighth
year
,
and
though
somewhat
overgrownand
heavy
,
had
lost
none
of
his
activity
,
and
but
little
of
the
grace
of
hisnoble
proportions
.
 
<EOS>
His
size
and
breadth
of
limb
were
well
displayed
inhis
magnificent
habiliment
.
 
<EOS>
His
countenance
was
handsome
andmanly
,
with
a
certain
broad
burly
look
,
thoroughly
English
in
itscharacter
,
which
won
him
much
admiration
from
his
subjects
;
andthough
it
might
be
objected
that
the
eyes
were
too
small
,
and
themouth
somewhat
too
diminutive
,
it
could
not
be
denied
that
the
generalexpression
of
the
face
was
kingly
in
the
extreme
.
 
<EOS>
A
prince
of
a
more"royal
presence
"
than
Henry
the
Eighth
was
never
seen
,
and
though
hehad
many
and
grave
faults
,
want
of
dignity
was
not
amongst
thenumber
.
<EOS>
Henry
entered
Windsor
amid
the
acclamations
of
the
spectators
,
thefanfares
of
trumpeters
,
and
the
roar
of
ordnance
from
the
castle
walls
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Anne
Boleyn
,
having
descended
from
her
litter
,
whichpassed
through
the
gate
into
the
lower
ward
,
stood
with
her
ladiesbeneath
the
canopy
awaiting
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
A
wide
clear
space
was
preserved
before
her
,
into
which
,
however
,
Wolsey
penetrated
,
and
,
dismounting
,
placed
himself
so
that
he
couldwitness
the
meeting
between
her
and
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
him
stood
thejester
,
Will
Sommers
,
who
was
equally
curious
with
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
litterof
Cardinal
Campeggio
passed
through
the
gateway
and
proceeded
tothe
lodgings
reserved
for
his
eminence
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
Wolsey
taken
up
his
station
than
Henry
rode
up
,
and
,
alighting
,
consigned
his
horse
to
a
page
,
and
,
followed
by
the
Duke
ofRichmond
and
the
Earl
of
Surrey
,
advanced
towards
Anne
Boleyn
,
whoimmediately
stepped
forward
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
"Fair
mistress
,
"
he
said
,
taking
her
hand
,
and
regarding
her
with
a
lookof
passionate
devotion
,
"
I
welcome
you
to
this
my
castle
of
Windsor
,
and
trust
soon
to
make
you
as
absolute
mistress
of
it
as
I
am
lord
andmaster
.
<EOS>
"Anne
<EOS>
Boleyn
blushed
,
and
cast
down
her
eyes
,
and
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
who
stood
at
some
little
distance
with
his
hand
upon
his
saddle
,
regarding
her
,
felt
that
any
hopes
he
might
have
entertained
wereutterly
annihilated
.
<EOS>
"Heard
<EOS>
you
that
,
my
lord
cardinal
?
<EOS>
"
said
Will
Sommers
to
Wolsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shewill
soon
be
mistress
here
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
comes
in
,
you
go
out
--
<EOS>
mind
<EOS>
that!"The
cardinal
made
no
answer
further
than
was
conveyed
by
thedeepened
colour
of
his
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Amid
continued
fanfares
and
acclamations
,
Harry
then
led
Anne
Boleynthrough
the
gateway
,
followed
by
the
ladies
in
waiting
,
who
were
joinedby
Richmond
and
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
The
prelate

,
and
other
officers
of
the
Garter
,
together
with
the
whole
of
the
royalretinue
who
had
dismounted
,
came
after
them
.
 
<EOS>
A
vast
concourse
ofspectators
,
extending
almost
as
far
as
the
Lieutenant
's
Tower
,
wascollected
in
front
of
the
alms
-
knights
'
houses
;
but
a
wide
space
hadbeen
kept
clear
by
the
henchmen
for
the
passage
of
the
sovereign
andhis
train
,
and
along
this
Henry
proceeded
with
Anne
Boleyn
,
in
thedirection
of
the
upper
ward
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
he
reached
the
Norman
Tower
,
and
passed
the
entrance
to
the
keep
,
the
Duke
of
Shoreditch
,
who
wasstanding
beneath
the
gateway
,
advanced
towards
him
and
prostratedhimself
on
one
knee
.
<EOS>
"May
<EOS>
it
please
your
majesty
,
"
said
Shoreditch
,
"
I
last
night
arrested
abutcher
of
Windsor
for
uttering
words
highly
disrespectful
of
yourhighness
,
and
of
the
fair
and
virtuous
lady
by
your
side
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
God

"
exclaimed
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
traitor
?
<EOS>
Bring
himbefore
us
.
<EOS>
""He
is
here

"
replied
Shoreditch
.
<EOS>
And
immediately
Mark
Fytton
was
brought
forward
by
a
couple
ofhalberdiers
.
 
<EOS>
He
still
preserved
his
undaunted
demeanour
,
and
gazedsternly
at
the
king
.
<EOS>
"So
,
fellow
,
thou
hast
dared
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
us
--
ha
!
"
criedHenry
.
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
the
truth
,
"
replied
the
butcher
fearlessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
saidyou
were
about
to
divorce
your
lawful
consort
,
Catherine

Arragon
,
and
to
take
the
minion
,
Anne
Boleyn
,
who
stands
beside
you
,
to
yourbed
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
added
,
it
was
a
wrongful
act
.
<EOS>
""Foul
<EOS>
befall
thy
lying
tongue
for
saying
so
!
<EOS>
"
replied
Henry
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ihave
a
mind
to
pluck
it
from
thy
throat
,
and
cast
it
to
the
dogs

<EOS>
Whatho

<EOS>
guards

take
this
caitiff
to
the
summit

the
highest
tower

the
Curfew
Tower

hang
him
from
it

so
that
all

may
see
how
traitors
are
served

<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
highness
has
judged

justly

said
Anne

<EOS>
"
You
say

Mistress

rejoined
the
butcher

<EOS>
you

You

"Away

cried
Henry

<EOS>
"
I
myself
will
go
to

Garter
Tower

it

<EOS>
Farewell
for

short
while

sweetheart

<EOS>
I
will
read

a
terrible
lesson

<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
the
butcher
was
hurried
off
to
the
Curfew
Tower
,
the
king
proceededwith
his
attendants
to
the
Garter
Tower
,
and
ascended
to
its
summit
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
ten
minutes
a
stout
pole
,
like
the
mast
of
a
ship
,
was
thrustthrough
the
battlements
of
the
Curfew
Tower
,
on
the
side
lookingtowards
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
pole
<EOS>
a
rope
,
of
some
dozen
feet
in
length
,
and
having
a
noose
at
one
end
,
was
firmly
secured

<EOS>
The
butcher
wasthen
brought
forth
,
bound
hand

foot
,
and
the
noose
was
thrownover
his
neck

<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
the
wretched
man
descried
a
person
looking
athim
from
a
window
in
a
wooden
structure
projecting
from
the
side
ofthe
tower
.
<EOS>
"What

<EOS>
he
cried

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
You

interposedone
of
the
halberdiers
.
<EOS>
"I
have
no
shrift
to
make
,
"
rejoined
the
butcher
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
settledmy
account
with
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
God
preserve
Queen
Catherine!"As
<EOS>
he
uttered
these
words
,
he
was
thrust
off
from
the
battlements
bythe
halberdiers
,
and
his
body
swung
into
the
abyss
amid
the
hootingsand
execrations
of
the
spectators
below
.
<EOS>
Having
glutted
his
eyes
with
the
horrible
sight

descended

How
King

in

And

Hall

<EOS>
From
a
balcony
overlooking
the
upper
ward
,
Anne
Boleyn
beheld
theking
's
approach
on
his
return
from
the
Garter
Tower
,
and
waving
herhand
smilingly
to
him
,
she
withdrew
into
the
presence
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Hastening
to
her
,
Henry
found
her
surrounded
by
her
ladies
of
honour
,
by
the
chief
of
the
nobles
and
knights
who
had
composed
her
train
fromHampton
Court
,
and
by
the
Cardinals
Wolsey
and
Campeggio
;
andhaving
exchanged
a
few
words
with
her
,
he
took
her
hand
,
and
led
herto
the
upper
part
of
the
chamber
,
where
two
chairs
of
state
were
setbeneath
<EOS>
a
canopy
of
crimson
velvet
embroidered
with
the
royal
arms
,
and
placed
her
in
the
seat
hitherto
allotted
to
Catherine
of
Arragon
.
 
<EOS>
Asmile
of
triumph
irradiated
Anne
's
lovely
countenance
at
this
mark
ofdistinction
,
nor
was
her
satisfaction
diminished
as
Henry
turned
toaddress
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
lords
,
"
he
said
,
"
ye
are
right
well
aware
of
the
scruples
ofconscience
<EOS>
I
entertain
in
regard
to
my
marriage
with

,
Catherine
of
Arragon
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
I
weigh
the
matter
,
the
moreconvinced
am
I
of
its
unlawfulness
;
and
were
it
possible
to
blind
myselfto
<EOS>
my
sinful
condition
,
the
preachers
,
who
openly
rebuke
me
from
thepulpit

would
take
care
to
remind
me
of
it

<EOS>
Misunderstand
me
not

mylords

<EOS>
I
have
no
ground
of
complaint
against
the
queen

<EOS>
Far
otherwise

<EOS>
She
is
a
lady
of
most
excellent
character
--
full
of
devotion
,
loyalty
,
nobility
,
and
gentleness

<EOS>
And
if
I
could
divest
myself
of
my
misgivings
,
so
far
from
seeking
to
put
her
from
me
,
I
should
cherish
her
with
thegreatest
tenderness
.
 
<EOS>
Ye
may
marvel
that
I
have
delayed
the
divorcethus
long
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
only
of
late
that
my
eyes
have
been
opened
;
and
thestep
was
hard
to
take
.
 
<EOS>
Old
affections
clung
to
me
--
old
chainsrestrained
me

nor
could
I
,
without
compunction

separate
myself
fromone

""Thou

"Ye

my

<EOS>
What
wouldbefall
this
realm
if
my
marriage
were
called
in
question
after

<EOS>
The

trouble
and
confusion
would
ensue
that
followedon
the
death
of
my
noble
grandfather
,
King
Edward
the
Fourth
.
 
<EOS>
Toprevent
<EOS>
such

<EOS>
I
have
resolved

most
reluctantly

to

I
trust
to
raiseup
a

<EOS>
A
murmur
of
applause
followed
this
speech
,
and
the
two
cardinals
exchanged
significant
glances
,
which
were
not
unobserved
by
the
king

<EOS>
"I
<EOS>

all

at

turned

<EOS>
"

""Your

bending

his

<EOS>
"
Not

replied
Henry

tenderly
raising

<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
received
the
thanks
and
homage
of
the
newly
-
created
noble
,
Henry
descended
from
the
canopy
,
and
passed
into
an
inner
room
withthe
Lady
Anne
,
where
a
collation
was
prepared
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
Their
slightmeal
over
<EOS>
,
Anne
took
up
her
lute
,
and
playing
a
lively
prelude
,
sang
twoor
three
French
songs
with
so
much
skill
and
grace
,
that
Henry
,
whowas
passionately
fond
of
music
,
was
quite
enraptured
.
 
<EOS>
Two
delightfulhours
having
passed
by
,
almost
imperceptibly
,
an
usher
approachedthe
king
,
and
whispering
a
few
words
to
him
,
he
reluctantly
withdrew
,
and
Anne
retired
with
her
ladies
to
an
inner
apartment
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
his
closet
,
the
king
's
attendants
proceeded
to
array
him
ina
surcoat
of
crimson

embroidered
in

with
the
motto
--

<EOS>
Over
the

was
thrown
a

The

were
completed
by

decorated
like

with
small

Meanwhile

his

the

,
the
Duke

the
chief
officers

The

then
made
their
salutation
to
him
,
whichhe
returned
by
removing
his
jewelled

with
infinite
grace
anddignity
,
and
as

they
put

,
and
ranging
themselves
in

,
set

<EOS>
Quitting

The

the

where
a

seating

and
those

The

<EOS>
As

was
givenby
an
usher
to
the
black

rod
that
the
newly

,
LordRochford
,

<EOS>
The
intelligence
being
communicated
to

,
he
ordered
the
Dukes
of
Suffolk

Norfolk
to
bring
him

.
 
<EOS>
The
injunction
was
obeyed
,
and
the

presentlymade
his

,
the
Garter
marching

him
to
the

.
<EOS>
Bowing
reverently
to
the

,
Rochford
,
in
a
brief
speech
,
expressed
his
gratitude
for
the
signal
honour
conferred
upon

,
andat
its
close
set
his
left
foot
upon
a
gilt
stool
,
placed
for
him
by
theGarter
,
who
pronounced
the
following
admonition:--
"
My

In

<EOS>
"Meanwhile
<EOS>
the
garter
was
girded
on
the
leg
of
the
newly
-
elected
knight
,
and
buckled
by
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
knelt
before
the
king
,
who
hung
a
gold
chain
,
with
the
image
of
Saint

attached
to
it
,
about
his
neck
,
while
another
admonition
was
pronounced
by
thechancellor

<EOS>
Rochford
then
arose
,
bowed
to
the
monarch
,
to
the
knights
-
companions
,
who
returned
his
salutations
,
and
the
investiture
wascomplete
.
<EOS>
Other
affairs
of
the
chapter
were
next
discussed
.
 
<EOS>
Certain
officersnominated
since
the
last
meeting
,
were
sworn
;
letters
from
absentknights

companions
,
praying
to
be
excused
from

,
wereread
--
and
their
pleas
,
except
in
the
instance
of
Sir
Thomas
Cheney
,
allowed
.
 
<EOS>
After
reading
the
excuse
of
the
latter
,
Henry
uttered
an
angryoath
,
declaring
he
would
deprive
him
of
his
vote
in
the
chapter
-
house
,
banish
him
from
his
stall
,
and
mulct
him
a
hundred
marks
,
to
be
paid
atSaint
George
's
altar
,
when
Will
Sommers
,
who
was
permitted
to
bepresent
,
whispered
in
his
ear
that
the
offender
was
kept
away
by
thedevices
of
Wolsey
,
because
he
was
known
to
be
friendly
to
the
divorce
,
and
to
the
interests
of
the
lady
Anne
.
"Aha
!
<EOS>
by
Saint
Mary
,
is
it
so
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Henry
,
knitting
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"This
shall
be
looked
into
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
hanged
a
butcher
just

.
 
<EOS>
Let

warning
by

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
See
that
Sir

sent
for
with
all
despatch
.
 
<EOS>
Iwill
hear
the
truth
from
his
own
lips
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
then
arose
,
and
quitting
the
chapter
-
house
,
proceeded
with
theknights
-
companions
to
the
choir
--
the
roof
and
walls
of
the
sacredstructure
resounding
with
the
solemn
notes
of
the
organ
as
theytraversed
the
aisle
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
to
enter
the
choir
were
the
aIms
-
knights
,
who
passed
through
the
door
in
a
body
,
and
making
low
obeisancestoward
the
altar
and
the
royal
stall
,
divided
into
two
lines
.
 
<EOS>
They
weresucceeded
by
the
prebends
of
the
College
,
who
,
making
similarobeisances
,
stationed
themselves
in
front
of
the
benches
before
thestalls
of
the
knights

companions
.
 
<EOS>
Next
followed
the
pursuivants
,
heralds
,
and
provincial
kings
-
of

arms
,
making
like
reverences
,
andranging
themselves
with
the
alms

knights
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
knights
-
companions
,
who
performed
double
reverences
like
the
others
,
andtook
their
stations
under
their
stalls
;
then
came
the
black

rod
,
Garter
,
and
register
,
who
having
gone
through
the
same
ceremony
as
theothers
,
proceeded
to
their
form
,
which
was
placed
on
the
south
side
ofthe
choir
before
the
sovereign
's
stall
;
then
came
the
chancellor
andprelate
,
whose
form
was
likewise
placed
before
the
royal
stall
,
butnearer
to
it
than
that
<EOS>
allotted
to
the
other
officers
;
and
,
lastly
,
Henryhimself
,
with
the
sword
borne
before
him
by
the
Duke
of
Richmond
,
whoas
he
approached
the
steps
of
his
stall
bowed
reverently
towards
thealtar
,
and
made
another
obeisance
before
seating
himself
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
Duke
of
Richmond
posted
himself
in
front
of
the
royalstall
,
the
Earl
of
Oxford
,
as

,
taking
his
station
on

and
the
Earl

,
as

on

<EOS>
Asthese
arrangements
were
made
,
the
two
cardinals
arrived
,
andproceeded
to
the
altar
.
<EOS>
Mass
was
then
said
,
and
nothing
could
be
more
striking
than
theappearance
of
the
chapel
during
its
performance
.
 
<EOS>
The
glorious
choirwith
its
groined
and
pendent
roof
,
its
walls
adorned
with
the
richeststuffs
,
its
exquisitely
carved
stalls
,
above
which
hung
the
banners
<EOS>
ofthe
knights

companions
,
together
with
their
helmets
,

,
andswords
,
its
sumptuously

glittering
with
costly

interwoven
with

,
themagnificent
and
varied

--
<EOS>
all
theseconstituted
a
picture
of
surpassing
splendour
.
<EOS>
Vespers
over
,
the
king
and
his
train
departed
with
the
sameceremonies
and
in
the
same
order
as
had
been
observed
on
theirentrance
to
the
choir
.
<EOS>
On
returning
to
the
royal
lodgings
,
Henry
proceeded
to
his
closet
,
where
having
divested
himself
of
his
mantle
,
he
went
in
search
of
theLady
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
her
walking
with
her
dames
on
the
stately
terraceat
the
north
of
the
castle
,
and
the
attendants
retiring
as
he
joined
her
,
he
was
left
at
full
liberty
for
amorous
converse
.
 
<EOS>
After
pacing
theterrace
for
some
time
,
he
adjourned
with
Anne
to
her
own
apartments
,
where
he
remained
till
summoned
to
supper
with
the
knights
-
companions
in
Saint
George
's
Hall
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
betimes
,
it
being
the
day
of
the
Patron
Saint
of
theOrder
of
the
Garter
,
a
numerous
cavalcade
assembled
in
the
upperward
of
the
castle
,
to
conduct
the
king
to
hear
matins
in
Saint
George'sChapel
.
 
<EOS>
In
order
to
render
the
sight
as
imposing
as
possible
,
Henry
hadarranged
that
the
procession
should
take
place
on
horseback
,
and
thewhole
of
the
retinue
were
accordingly
mounted
.
 
<EOS>
The
large
quadranglewas
filled
with
steeds
and
their
attendants
,
and
the
castle
wallsresounded
with
the
fanfares
of
trumpets
and
the
beating
ofkettledrums
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
attractive
feature
of
the
procession
in
the
eyesof
<EOS>
the
beholders
was
the
Lady
Anne
,
who
,
mounted
on
a

on

right
of
the

cloth
of
gold
;
and
had
a
coronet
of
black
velvet
,
decorated
with
orient
pearls
,
on
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
Never
had
she
looked
solovely
as
on
this
occasion
,
and
the
king
's
passion
increased
as
hegazed
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
himself
was
more
sumptuously
attired
than
onthe
preceding
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
wore
a

If

""Well

anddrained
the

<EOS>
"Would

<EOS>
""Why

so

asked

""Whom

inquired
the

angrily
.
<EOS>
The
jester
nodded
at
Surrey
,
and
laughed
maliciously
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>

<EOS>
On
that

night

and
just
as
the

clock
was
on
the
stroke
oftwelve
,
the
Earl
of
Surrey
and
the
Duke
of
Richmond
issued
from

and
took
their
way
towards
Herne

Oak
.
 
<EOS>
The
moon
wasshining
brightly
,
and
its
beams
silvered
the
foliage
of
the
noble
treeswith
which
the
park
was
studded
.
 
<EOS>
The
youthful
friends
soon
reachedthe
blasted
tree
;
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
near
it
,
and
all
looked
sotranquil
,
so
free
from
malignant
influence
,
that
the
Duke
of
Richmondcould
not
help
laughing
at
his
companion
,
telling
him
that
the
supposedvision
must
have
been
the
offspring
of
his
over
-
excited
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
Angry
atbeing
thus
doubted
,
the
earl
walked
off
,
and
plunged
into
the
haunteddell

<EOS>
The
duke
followed

but
though
they
paused
for
some

beneaththe
gnarled

the
spirit
did
not
appear

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
thus
ends
the
adventure

<EOS>
laughed
the

as
they
emerged
from
the
brake

<EOS>
"
By
my
halidom
,
Surrey
,
I
amgrievously
disappointed

<EOS>
You
must
have
mistaken
some
large
stag

caught
by
its
antlers
in
the
branches
of
the
oak

tree
,
for
the
demon

<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
told
you
precisely
what
occurred

"
replied
Surrey
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ha!there
he
is
--
look
!
<EOS>
look!"And
<EOS>
he
pointed
to
a
weird
figure
,
mounted
on
a
steed
as
weird
-
lookingas
itself
,
galloping
through
the
trees
with
extraordinary
swiftness
,
at
alittle
distance
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
This
ghostly
rider
wore
the
antlered
helmetdescribed
by
Surrey
,
and
seemed
to
be
habited
in
a
garb
of
deer
-
skins
.
<EOS>
Before
him
flew
a
large
owl
,
and
a
couple
of
great
black
dogs
ranbeside
him

<EOS>
Staring
in
speechless
wonder
at
the
sight
,
the
two
youthswatched
the
mysterious

being
scour
a
glade
brightly
illumined
by
themoon
,
until
,
reaching
the
pales
marking
the
confines
of
the
Home
Park
<EOS>
,
he
leaped
them
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
"What
think
you
of
that
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Surrey
,
as
soon
as
he
had
recoveredfrom
his
surprise
,
glancing
triumphantly
at
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Was
that
theoffspring
of
my
fancy?""It
was
a
marvellous
sight

truly

exclaimed
Richmond

<EOS>
"
Would
we
hadour
steeds
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
""We
can
follow
him
on
foot
,
"
replied
the
earl--
<EOS>
"
he
is
evidently
gone
intothe
forest
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
they
set
off
at
a
quick
pace
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
ghostlyrider
.
 
<EOS>
Clambering
the
park
pales
,
they
crossed
the
road
leading
to
OldWindsor
,
and
entered
that
part
of
the
forest
which
,
in
more
recenttimes
,
has
been
enclosed
and
allotted
to
the
grounds
of
Frogmore

<EOS>
Tracking
a
long
vista
,
they
came
to
a
thick
dell
,
overgrown
with
largeoaks
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
a
small
pool

<EOS>
Fleeter
than

and
<EOS>
therefore
somewhat
in
advance
of
him
,
the
Earl
ofSurrey
,
as
he
approached
this
dell
,
perceived
the
spectral
huntsmanand
his
dogs
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
water

<EOS>
The
earl
instantlyshouted
to
him

and
the
horseman
turning
his

shook
his
handmenacingly
,
while
the
hounds
glared
fiercely
at
the
intruder
,
anddisplayed
their
fangs
,
but
did
not
bark

As
Surrey
,
however

despite

continued
to

the
huntsman
took

presently
issued
from
it
,
and
before
the
vapour
had
cleared
off
,
he
and
his
dogs
had
disappeared
..
 
<EOS>
The
witnesses
of
this
marvellousspectacle
crossed
themselves
reverently
,
and
descended
to
the
brinkof
the
pool
;
but
the
numerous
footprints
of
deer
,
that
came
there
todrink
,
prevented
them
from
distinguishing
any
marks
of
the
steed
of
theghostly
hunter
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
we
return
,
Surrey
?
"
asked
the
duke
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
persuaded
we
shall
see
the
mysterioushuntsman
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
return
,
if
you
think
proper
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
on
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
leave
you
,
"
rejoined
Richmond
.
<EOS>
And
they
set
off
again
at
the
same
quick
pace
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
Mounting
ahill
covered
with
noble
beeches
and
elms
,
a
magnificent
view
of
thecastle
burst
upon
them
,
towering
over
the
groves
they
had
tracked
,
andlooking
almost
like
the
work
of
enchantment
.
 
<EOS>
Charmed
with
the
view
,
the
young
men
continued
to
contemplate
it
for
some
time
.
 
<EOS>
They
thenstruck
off
on
the
right
,
and
ascended
still
higher
,
until
they
came
to
abeautiful
grove
of
beeches
cresting
the
hill
where
the
equestrian
statueof
George
the
Third
is
now
placed
.
 
<EOS>
Skirting
this
grove
,
they
disturbed
aherd
of
deer
,
which
started
up
,
and
darted
into
the
valley
below
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
two
fine
beech
-
trees
lay
another
small
pool
,
and
Surreyalmost
expected
to
see
the
spectral
huntsman
beside
it
.
<EOS>
From
this
spot
they
could
discern
the
whole
of
the
valley
beyond
,
andthey
scanned
it
in
the
hope
of
perceiving
the
object
of
their
search
.
<EOS>
Though
not
comparable
to
the
view
on
the
nearer
side
,
the
prospectwas
nevertheless
exceedingly
beautiful
.
 
<EOS>
Long
vistas
and
gladesstretched
out
before
them
,
while
in
the
far
distance
might
be
seenglittering
in
the
moonbeams
the
lake
or
mere
which
in
later
days
hasreceived
the
name
of
Virginia
Water
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
gazing
at
this
scene
,
a
figure
habited
like
a
keeper
ofthe
forest
suddenly
emerged
from
the
trees
at
the
lower
end
of
one
ofthe
glades
.
 
<EOS>
Persuaded
that
this
person
had
some
mysteriousconnection
with
the
ghostly
huntsman
,
the
earl
determined
to
followhim
,
and
hastily
mentioning
his
suspicions
and
design
to
Richmond
,
hehurried
down
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
But
before
he
accomplished
the
descent
,
thekeeper
was
gone
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
on
looking
about
,
they
perceived
him
mounting
therising
ground
on
the
left
,
and
immediately
started
after
him
,
taking
careto
keep
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
The
policy
of
this
course
was
soon
apparent
.
<EOS>
Supposing
himself
no
longer
pursued
,
the
keeper
relaxed
his
pace
,
andthe
others
got
nearer
to
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
both
parties
went
on
,
the
keeper
still
hurrying
forward
,
every
now
and
then
turning
his
head
to
see
whether
any
one
was
on
histrack
,
until
he
came
to
a
road
cut
through
the
trees
that
brought
him
tothe
edge
of
a
descent
leading
to
the
lake
.
 
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
a
cloudpassed
over
the
moon
,
burying
all
in
comparative
obscurity
.
 
<EOS>
Thewatchers
,
however
,
could
perceive
the
keeper
approach
an
ancientbeech
-
tree
of
enormous
growth
,
and
strike
it
thrice
with
the
shorthunting
-
spear
which
he
held
in
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
The
signal
remaining
unanswered
,
he
quitted
the
tree
,
and
shaped
hiscourse
along
the
side
of
a
hill
on
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
Keeping
under
the
shelter
<EOS>
ofthe
thicket
on
the
top
of
the
same
hill
<EOS>
,
Surrey
and
Richmond
followed
,
and
saw
him
direct
his
steps
towards
another
beech
-
tree
of
almostdouble
the
girth
of
that
he
had
just
visited
.
 
<EOS>
Arrived
at
this
mighty
tree
,
he
struck
it
with
his
spear
,
while
a
large
owl
,
seated
on
a
leaflessbranch
,
began
to
hoot
;
a
bat
circled
the
tree
;
and
two
large
snakes
,
glistening
in
the
moonlight
,
glided
from
its
roots
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
tree
wasstricken
for
the
third
time
,
the
same
weird
figure
that
the
watchers
hadseen
ride
along
the
Home
Park
burst
from
its
riften
trunk
,
andaddressed
its
summoner
in
tones
apparently
menacing
and
imperious
,
but
whose
import
was
lost
upon
the
listeners
.
 
<EOS>
The
curiosity
of
thebeholders
was
roused
to
the
highest
pitch
,
but
an
undefinable
aweprevented
them
from
rushing
forward
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
demon
hunter
waved
a
pike
with
which
he
was
armed
,
and
uttered
a
peculiar
cry
,
resembling
the
hooting
of
an
owl
.
 
<EOS>
At
thissound
,
and
as
if
by
magic
,
a
couple
of
steeds
,
accompanied
by
the
twohounds
,
started
from
the
brake
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
instant
the
demon
huntsmanvaulted
upon
the
hack
of
the
horse
nearest
to
him
,
and
the
keeperalmost
as
quickly
mounted
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
pair
then
galloped
offthrough
the
glen
,
the
owl
flying
before
them
,
and
the
hounds
coursingby
their
side
.
<EOS>
The
two
friends
gazed
at
each
other
,
for
some
time
,
in
speechlesswonder
.
 
<EOS>
Taking
heart
,
they
then
descended
to
the
haunted
tree
,
butcould
perceive
no
traces
of
the
strange
being
by
whom
it
had
beenrecently
tenanted
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
they
retraced
their
course
towards
thecastle
,
hoping
they
might
once
more
encounter
the
wild
huntsman
.
 
<EOS>
Norwere
they
disappointed
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
crossed
a
glen
,
a
noble
stag
dartedby
.
 
<EOS>
Close
at
its
heels
came
the
two
black
hounds
,
and
after
them
theriders
hurrying
forward
at
a
furious
pace
,
their
steeds
appearing
tobreathe
forth
flame
and
smoke
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
the
huntsmen
and
hounds
were
gone
,
and
the
trampling
ofthe
horses
died
away
in
the
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
a
low
sound
,
like
the
winding
of
a
horn
,
broke
upon
the
ear
,
and
the
listeners
had
nodoubt
that
the
buck
was
brought
down
.
 
<EOS>
They
hurried
in
the
direction
ofthe
sound
,
but
though
the
view
was
wholly
unobstructed
for
aconsiderable
distance
,
they
could
see
nothing
either
of
horsemen
,
hounds
,
or
deer
.

How
the
Fair
Geraldine
bestowed
a
Relic
upon
her
Lover
--
HowSurrey
and
Richmond
rode
in
the
Forest
at
Midnight
--
<EOS>
And
where
theyfound
the
Body
of
Mark
Fytton
,
the
Butcher
.
<EOS>
Surrey
and
Richmond
agreed
to
say
nothing
for
the
present
of
theirmysterious
adventure
in
the
forest
;
but
their
haggard
looks
,
as
theypresented
themselves
to
the
Lady
 
Anne
Boleyn
in
the
reception
-
chamber
on
the
following
morning
,
proclaimed
that
something
hadhappened
,
and
they
had
to
undergo
much
questioning
from
the
FairGeraldine
and
the
Lady
Mary
Howard
.
<EOS>
"I
never
saw
you
so
out
of
spirits
,
my
lord
,
"
remarked
the
Fair
Geraldineto
Surrey
;
"
you
must
have
spent
the
whole
night
in
study
--
or
what
ismore
probable
,
you
have
again
seen
Herne
the
Hunter
.
 
<EOS>
Confess
now
,
you
have
been
in
the
forest
.
<EOS>
""I
will
confess
anything
you
please
,
"
replied
Surrey
evasively
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
what
have
you
<EOS>
seen?--a
stranger
vision
than
the
first
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
rejoinedthe
Fair
Geraldine
.
<EOS>
"Since
<EOS>
your
ladyship
answers
for
me
,
there
is
no
need
for
explanationon
<EOS>
my
part
,
"
rejoined
Surrey
,
with
a
faint
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
know
you
not
,
that
those
who
encounter
super
natural
beings
are
generally
bound
toprofound
secrecy?""Such
,
I
hope
,
is
not
your
case
,
Henry
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
Lady
Mary
Howard
,
inalarm;--
"
nor
yours
,
my
lord
?
"
<EOS>
she
added
to
the
Duke
of
Richmond
.
<EOS>
"I
am
bound
equally
with
Surrey
,
"
returned
the
duke
mysteriously"You
pique
<EOS>
my
curiosity
,
my
lords
,
"
said
the
Fair
Geraldine
;
"
and
sincethere
is
no
other
way
of
gratifying
it
,
<EOS>
if
the
Lady
Mary
Howard
willaccompany
me
,
we
will
ourselves
venture
into
the
forest
,
and
trywhether
<EOS>
we
can
not
have
a
meeting
with
this
wild
huntsman
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
wego
to
-
night?"Not
for
worlds
,
"
replied
the
Lady
Mary
,
shuddering
;
"
were
I
to
seeHerne
,
I
should
die
of
fright
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
alarm
is
groundless
,
"
observed
Richmond
gallantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thepresence
of
two
beings
,
fair
and
pure
as
yourself
and
the
LadyElizabeth
Fitzgerald
,
would
scare
away
aught
of
evil
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Lady
Mary
thanked
him
with
a
beaming
smile
,
but
the
FairGeraldine
could
not
suppress
a
slight
laugh
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
grace
is
highly
flattering
,
"
she
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
,
with
all
faith
in
beautyand
purity
,
I
should
place
most
reliance
in
a
relic
<EOS>
I
possess
--
<EOS>
the
virtue
ofwhich
has
often
been
approved
against
evil
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
given
by
amonk-
who
had
been
sorely
tempted
by
a
demon
,
and
who
owed
hisdeliverance
to
it
--
to
my
ancestor
,
Luigi
Geraldi
of
Florence
;
and
fromhim
<EOS>
it
descended
to
me
.
<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
I
had
an
opportunity
of
proving
its
efficacy
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
Earlof
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"You
shall
prove
it
,
if
you
choose
,
"
rejoined
the
Fair
Geraldine
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
willgive
you
the
relic
on
condition
that
you
never
part
with
it
to
friend
orfoe
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
detaching
a
small
cross
of
gold
,
suspended
by
a
chain
from
herneck
,
she
presented
it
to
the
Earl
of
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"This
cross
encloses
the
relic
,
"
she
continued
;
"
wear
it
,
and
may
itprotect
you
from
all
ill!"Surrey
's
pale
cheek
<EOS>
glowed
as
he
took
the
gift
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
past
with
itbut
with
life
,
"
he
cried
,
pressing
the
cross
to
his
lips
,
and
afterwardsplacing
it
next
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"I
would
have
given
half
my
dukedom
to
be
so
favoured
,
"
said
Richmondmoodily
.
<EOS>
And
quitting
the
little
group
,
he
walked
towards
the
Lady
Anne
.
<EOS>
"Henry,"said
<EOS>
the
Lady
Mary
,
taking
her
brother
aside
,
you
will
lose
your
friend
.
<EOS>
""I
care
not
,
"
replied
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
may
incur
his
enmity
,
"
pursued
the
Lady
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
theglance
he
threw
at
you
just
now
,
and
it
was
exactly
like
the
king'sterrible
look
when
offended
.
<EOS>
""Again
<EOS>
I
say
I
care
not
,
"
replied
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Armed
with
this
relic
,
I
defy
allhostility

<EOS>
""It
will
avail
little
against
Richmond

opposition

"
rejoinedhis

"We

retorted
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were

""Bravely

said
Sir

advanced
towards

rejoined

<EOS>
"
I
would

and
yet
under
such
circumstances--""What
would

"
<EOS>
interrupted
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>

but
a
hasty

not

interposed
the
Lady

,
trying
by
a
significant
glance
toimpose
silence
on
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Young
<EOS>
as

"
remarked
Wyat
,
in
a
sombretone
.
<EOS>
"What
is
all
this
?
"
inquired
the
Fair
Geraldine
,
who
had
been
gazingthrough
the
casement
into
the
court
below
.
<EOS>
"I
was
merely
expressing
a
wish
that
Surrey
may
never
have
a
monarchfor
<EOS>
a

,
fair

"
replied
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"It
matters
little
who

"
rejoined
Geraldine
,
"
providedshe

<EOS>
""Right

right

"
said
Wyat
,
with
great
bitterness
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
moment
WillSommers
approached
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
bid
you
to

Sir

said
thejester

<EOS>
"
I
noticed
what

he
remarked
to
the
latter
,
as
they
proceeded
towards
the
royal
canopy
,
beneath
which
Henry
andthe
Lady
Anne
Boleyn
were
seated
;
"
but
Richmond
will
not
relinquishher
tamely
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
"Anne
Boleyn
had
summoned
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
in
order
to
gratify
hervanity
by
showing
him
the
unbounded
influence
she
possessed
over
hisroyal
rival
;
and
the
half
-
suppressed
agony
displayed
by
the
unfortunatelover
at
the
exhibition
afforded
her
a
pleasure
such
as
only
the
mostrefined
coquette
can
feel

<EOS>
Surrey
was
sent
for
by
the
king
to
receive
instructions
,
in
his
quality
ofvice
-
chamberlain
,
respecting
a
tilting
-
match
and
hunting
-
party
to
beheld
on
successive
days
--
the
one
in
the
upper
quadrangle
of
the
castle
,
the
other
in
the
forest
.
<EOS>
Anxious
,
now
that
he
was
somewhat
calmer
,
to
avoid
a
rupture
withRichmond
,
Surrey
,
as
soon
as
he
had
received
the
king

instructions
,
drew
near
the
duke
;
and
the
latter
,
who
had
likewise
reasoned
himselfout
of
his
resentment
,
was
speedily
appeased
,
and
they
became
,
to
allappearance
,
as
good
friends
as
ever

<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
the
Lady
Anne
and
her
dames
retired
,
and
the
courtbreaking
up
,
the
two
young
nobles
strolled
forth
to
the
stately
terraceat
the
north
of
the
castle
,
where
,
while
gazing
at
the
glorious
view
itcommanded

they
talked
over
the
mysterious
event
of
the
previousnight
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
help
suspecting
that
the
keeper
we
beheld
with
the
demonhunter
was
Morgan
Fenwolf

remarked
the
earl

<EOS>
"
Suppose

whether

night

<EOS>
We

readily
find
out
hisdwelling

Bryan
Bowntance

the
host

"Richmond
<EOS>
acquiesced
in
the
proposal
,
and
they
accordingly
proceededto
the
cloisters
of
Saint
George
's
Chapel
,
and
threading
some
tortuouspassages
contrived
among
the
canons
'
houses

passed
through

smallporch
,
guarded
by
a
sentinel
,
and
opening
upon
a
precipitous
andsomewhat
dangerous
flight
of
steps
,
hewn
out
of
the
rock
and
leadingto
the
town
.
<EOS>
None
except
the
more
important
members
of
the
royal
household
wereallowed
to
use
this
means
of
exit
from
the
castle
,
but
,
of
course
,
theprivilege
extended
to
Richmond
and
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
Here
in
later
times
,
andwhen
the
castle
was
not
so
strictly
guarded
,
a
more
convenientapproach
was
built
,
and
designated
,
from
the
number
of
its
stairs
,
"
TheHundred
Steps
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
accomplished
the
descent
in
safety
,
and
given
the
password
tothe
sentinel
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
,
the
two
young
nobles
emerged
intothe
street
,
and
the
first
object
they
beheld
was
the
body
of
themiserable
butcher
swinging
from
the
summit
of
the
Curfew
Tower
,
where
it
was
left
by
order
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
Averting
their
gaze
from
this
ghastly
spectacle
,
they
took
their
way
upThames
Street
,
and
soon
reached
the
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
Honest
Bryan
was
seatedon
<EOS>
a
bench
before
the
dwelling
,
with
a
flagon
of
his
own
ale
beside
him
,
and
rising
as
he
saw
the
others
approach
<EOS>
,
he
made
them
a
profoundsalutation
.
<EOS>
Upon
leaning
what
they
sought
,
he
told
them
that
Morgan
Fenwolfdwelt
in
a
small
cottage
by
the
river
-
side
not
far
from
the
bridge
,
and
ifit
pleased
them
,
he
would
guide
them
to
it
himself
--
an
offer
which
theygladly
accepted
.
<EOS>
"Do
you
know
anything
of
this
Fenwolf
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Surrey
,
as
theyproceeded
on
their
way
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
particular
,
"
replied
Bryan
,
with
some
hesitation
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
aresome
strange
reports
about
him
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
'
em
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
reports
are
they
,
friend
?
"
asked
the
Duke
of
Richmond
.
"Why
,
your
grace
,
one
ought
to
be
cautious
what
one
says
,
for
fear
ofbringing
an
innocent
man
into
trouble
,
"
returned
the
host
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
thetruth
must
be
spoken
,
people
do
say
that
Morgan
Fenwolf
is
in
leaguewith
the
devil
--
or
with
Herne
the
Hunter
,
which
is
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
"Richmond
exchanged
a
look
with
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"Folks
say
strange
sights
have
been
seen
in
the
forest
of
late
,
"
pursuedBryan--
"
and
it
may
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
myself
have
seen
nothing
--
but
then
,
tobe
sure
,
I
never
go
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
keepers
used
to
talk
of
Herne
the
Hunterwhen
<EOS>
I
was
a
lad
,
but
I
believe
it
was
only
a
tale
to
frighten
deer
-
stealers
;
and
I
fancy
<EOS>
it
's
much
the
same
thing
now
.
<EOS>
"Neither
<EOS>
Surrey
nor
Richmond
made
any
remark
,
and
they
presentlyreached
the
keeper
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
wooden
tenement
standing
,
as
the
host
had
stated
,
onthe
bank
of
the
river
,
about
a
bow
-
shot
from
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
wasopened
by
Bryan
,
and
the
party
entered
without
further
ceremony
.
<EOS>
They
found
no
one
within
except
an
old
woman
,
with
harsh
,
wrinkledfeatures
,
and
a
glance
as
ill
-
omened
as
that
of
a
witch
,
whom
BryanBowntance
told
them
was
Fenwolf
's
mother
.
 
<EOS>
This
old
crone
regardedthe
intruders
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
your
son
,
dame
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
duke
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
his
walk
in
the
forest
,
"
replied
the
old
crone
bluntly
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
time
did
he
go
forth
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"An
hour
before
daybreak
,
as
is
his
custom
,
"
returned
the
woman
,
in
thesame
short
tone
as
before
.
<EOS>
"You
are
sure
he
slept
at
home
last
night
,
dame
?
"
said
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
sure
as
l
am
that
the
question
is
asked
me
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
canshow
you
the
very
bed
on
which
he
slept
,
if
you
desire
to
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
Heretired
soon
after
sunset
--
slept
soundly
,
as
he
always
sleeps
--
and
aroseas
I
have
told
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
lighted
a
fire
,
and
made
him
some
hot
pottagemyself
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
she
speaks
the
truth
,
you
must
be
mistaken
,
"
observed
Richmond
ina
whisper
to
his
friend
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
believe
her
,
"
replied
Surrey
,
in
the
same
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Show
us
hischamber
,
dame
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
old
crone
sullenly
complied
,
and
,
throwing
open
a
side
door
,
disclosed
an
inner
apartment
,
in
which
there
was
a
small
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Therewas
nothing
noticeable
in
the
room
except
a
couple
of
fishing
-
nets
,
ahunting
-
spear
,
and
an
old
cross
-
bow
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
open
casement
lookedupon
the
river
,
whose
clear
sparkling
waters
flowed
immediatelybeneath
it
.
<EOS>
Surrey
approached
the
window
,
and
obtained
a
fine
view
of
the
Brocasmeads
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
embowered
college
of
Eton
on
theother
.
 
<EOS>
His
attention
,
however
,
was
diverted
by
a
fierce
barking
without
,
and
<EOS>
the
next
moment
,
in
spite
of
the
vociferations
of
the
old
woman
,
alarge
black
staghound
,
which
Surrey
recognised
as
Fenwolf
's
dog
,
Bawsey
,
burst
through
the
door
,
and
rushed
furiously
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Surrey
drew
his
dagger
to
defend
himself
from
the
hound
's
attack
,
butthe
precaution
was
needless
.
 
<EOS>
Bawsey
's
fierceness
changed
suddenlyto
the
most
abject
submission
,
and
with
a
terrified
howl
,
she
retreatedfrom
the
room
with
'
her
tail
between
her
legs
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
old
womanuttered
a
cry
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Lord
help
us
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Bryan
;
"
was
ever
the
like
o
'
<EOS>
that
seen
?
<EOS>
Yourlordship
must
have
a
strange
mastery
over
dogs
.
 
<EOS>
That
hound
<EOS>
,
"
headded
,
in
a
whisper
,
"
is
said
to
be
a
familiar
spirit
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
virtue
of
the
relic
is
approved
,
"
observed
Surrey
to
Richmond
,
inan
undertone
.
<EOS>
"It
would
seem
so
,
"
replied
the
duke
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
now
thought
proper
to
assume
a
more
respectfuldemeanour
towards
her
visitors
,
and
inquired
whether
her
son
shouldattend
upon
them
on
his
return
from
the
forest
,
but
they
said
it
wasunnecessary
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
king
is
about
to
have
a
grand
hunting
-
party
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
"
observed
Surrey
,
"
and
we
wished
to
give
your
son
someinstructions
respecting
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
,
however
,
be
delivered
to
anotherkeeper
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
they
departed
with
Bryan
,
and
returned
to
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
At
midnightthey
again
issued
forth
.
 
<EOS>
Their
steeds
awaited
them
near
the
uppergate
,
and
,
mounting
,
they
galloped
across
the
greensward
in
thedirection
of
Herne
's
Oak
.
 
<EOS>
Discerning
<EOS>
no
trace
of
the
ghostly
huntsman
<EOS>
,
they
shaped
their
course
towards
the
forest
.
<EOS>
Urging
their
steeds
to
their
utmost
speed
,
and
skirting
the
long
avenue
,
they
did
not
draw
the
rein
till
they
reached
the
eminence
beyond
it;having
climbed
which
,
they
dashed
down
the
farther
side
at
the
sameswift
pace
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
ride
greatly
excited
them
,
but
they
sawnothing
of
the
wild
huntsman
;
nor
did
any
sound
salute
their
earsexcept
the
tramp
of
their
own
horses
,
or
the
occasional
darting
forth
ofa
startled
deer
.
<EOS>
Less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
brought
them
to
the
haunted
beech
-
tree;but
<EOS>
all
was
as
silent
and
solitary
here
as
at
the
blasted
oak
.
 
<EOS>
In
vainSurrey
smote
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
No
answer
was
returned
to
the
summons
;
and
,
finding
all
efforts
to
evoke
the
demon
fruitless
<EOS>
,
they
quitted
the
spot
,
and
,
turning
their
horses
'
heads
to
the
right
,
slowly
ascended
the
hill
-
side
.
<EOS>
Before
they
had
gained
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
faint
blast
of
a
hornsaluted
their
ears
,
apparently
proceeding
from
the
valley
near
the
lake
.
<EOS>
They
instantly
stopped
and
looked
in
that
direction
,
but
could
seenothing
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
however
,
the
blast
was
repeated
more
loudly
thanbefore
,
and
,
guided
by
the
sound
<EOS>
,
they
discerned
the
spectral
huntsmanriding
beneath
the
trees
at
some
quarter
of
a
mile
's
distance
.
<EOS>
Striking
spurs
into
their
steeds
,
they
instantly
gave
him
chase
;
butthough
he
lured
them
on
through
thicket
and
over
glade
--
now
climbinga
hill
,
now
plunging
into
a
valley
,
until
their
steeds
began
to
showsymptoms
of
exhaustion-
<EOS>
they
got
no
nearer
to
him
;
and
at
length
,
asthey
drew
near
the
Home
Park
,
to
which
he
had
gradually
led
them
,
hedisappeared
from
view
.
<EOS>
"I
will
take
my
station
near
the
blasted
oak
,
"
said
Surrey
,
gallopingtowards
it
<EOS>
:
"
the
demon
is
sure
to
revisit
his
favourite
tree
before
cock
-
crowing
.
<EOS>
""What
is
that
?
"
cried
the
Earl
of
Surrey
,
pointing
to
a
strange
andghastly
-
looking
object
depending
from
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
"
Some
one
has
hangedhimself
!
<EOS>
It
may
be
the
caitiff
,
Morgan
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"With
one
accord
they
dashed
forward
,
and
as
they
drew
nearer
the
tree
,
they
perceived
that
the
object
that
had
attracted
their
attention
wasthe
body
of
Mark
Fytton
,
the
butcher
,
which
they
had
so
recently
seenswinging
from
the
summit
of
the
Curfew
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
suspendedfrom
an
arm
of
the
wizard
oak
.
<EOS>
A
small
scroll
was
stuck
upon
the
breast
of
the
corpse
,
and
,
taking
itoff
<EOS>
,
Surrey
read
these
words
,
traced
in
uncouth
<EOS>
characters--"MarkFytton
is
now
one
of
the
band
of
Herne
the
Hunter
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
my
fay
,
this
passes
all
comprehension
,
"
said
Richmond
,
after
a
fewmoments
'
silence
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
castle
and
forest
seem
under
the
sway
of
thepowers
of
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
return
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
enough
of
adventure
forto
-
night
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
rode
towards
the
castle
,
followed
more
slowly
by
the
earl
.
<EOS>
VII
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
Earl
of
Surrey
and
the
Fair
Geraldine
plighted
their
troth
inthe
Cloisters
of
Saint
George
's
Chapel
.
<EOS>
Barriers
were
erected
on
the
following
day
in
the
upper
ward
of
thecastle
,
and
the
Lady
Anne
and
her
dames
assembled
in
the
balcony
infront
of
the
royal
lodgings
,
which
was
decorated
with
arras
,
costlycarpets
,
and
rich
stuffs
,
to
view
the
spectacle
.
<EOS>
Perfect
in
all
manly
accomplishments
,
Henry
splintered
several
lanceswith
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
who
formed
an
admirablematch
for
him
in
point
of
weight
and
strength
;
and
at
last
,
though
he
didnot
succeed
in
unhorsing
the
duke
,
he
struck
off
his
helmet
,
the
claspof
<EOS>
which
,
it
was
whispered
,
was
left
designedly
unfastened
;
and
beingthereupon
declared
the
victor
,
he
received
the
prize
--
a
scarfembroidered
by
her
own
hands
--
from
the
fair
Anne
herself
.
<EOS>
He
then
retired
from
the
lists
,
leaving
them
free
for
the
younger
knightsto
<EOS>
run
a
course
at
the
ring
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
to
enter
the
arena
was
Sir
ThomasWyat
;
and
as
he
was
known
to
be
a
skilful
jouster
,
it
was
expected
hewould
come
off
triumphantly
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
glance
from
the
royal
balconyrendered
his
arm
unsteady
,
and
he
missed
the
mark
.
<EOS>
Next
came
the
Duke
of
Richmond
,
superbly
accoutred
.
 
<EOS>
Laughing
atWyat
's
ill
success
,
he
bowed
to
the
Fair
Geraldine
,
and
taking
a
lancefrom
his
esquire
,
placed
it
in
the
rest
,
and
rode
gallantly
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Buthe
was
equally
unsuccessful
,
and
retired
,
looking
deeply
chagrined
.
<EOS>
The
third
knight
who
presented
himself
was
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
Mounted
on
hisfavourite
black
Arabian
--
a
steed
which
,
though
of
fiery
temper
,
obeyedhis
slightest
movement
--
his
light
symmetrical
figure
was
seen
to
thegreatest
advantage
in
his
close
-
fitting
habiliments
of
silk
and
velvet
.
<EOS>
Without
venturing
a
look
at
the
royal
balcony
,
the
earl
couched
hislance
,
and
bounding
forward
,
bore
away
the
ring
on
its
point
.
<EOS>
Amid
the
plaudits
of
the
spectators
,
he
then
careered
around
the
arena
,
and
approaching
the
royal
balcony
,
raised
his
lance
,
and
proffered
thering
to
the
Fair
Geraldine
,
who
blushingly
received
it
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
,
though
byno
means
pleased
with
Surrey
's
success
,
earned
as
it
was
at
theexpense
of
his
son
,
complimented
him
upon
his
skill
,
and
Anne
Boleynjoined
warmly
in
his
praises
.
<EOS>
The
lists
were
then
closed
,
and
the
royal
party
retired
to
partake
ofrefreshments
;
after
which
they
proceeded
to
the
butts
erected
in
thebroad
mead
at
the
north
of
the
castle
,
where
the
Duke
of
Shoreditchand
his
companions
shot
a
well
-
contested
match
with
the
long
-
bow
.
<EOS>
During
these
sports
,
Surrey
placed
himself
as
near
as
he
could
to
theFair
Geraldine
,
and
though
but
few
opportunities
occurred
ofexchanging
a
syllable
with
her
,
his
looks
spoke
a
sufficiently
intelligiblelanguage
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
just
as
they
were
about
to
return
to
the
palace
,
hebreathed
in
an
imploring
tone
in
her
ear--"You
will
attend
vespers
at
Saint
George
's
Chapel
this
evening
.
 
<EOS>
Returnthrough
the
cloisters
.
 
<EOS>
Grant
me
a
moment
's
interview
alone
there
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
promise
,
"
replied
the
Fair
Geraldine
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
followed
in
thetrain
of
the
Lady
Anne
.
<EOS>
The
earl
's
request
had
not
been
unheard
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
royal
train
proceededtowards
the
castle
,
Will
Sommers
contrived
to
approach
the
Duke
ofRichmond
,
and
said
to
him
,
in
a
jeering
tone
"
You

""Pest

cried

angrily
;

""If

pursued
Will
Sommers
;
"
but
you
lost
a
golden
opportunity
ofingratiating
yourself
with
your
lady
-
love

<EOS>
All
your

now
at

<EOS>
A
word
in
your
ear
--
the
Fair
Geraldine
will
meet
Surrey
alone
thisevening
.
<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
liest
,
knave
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
duke
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
grace
will
find
the
contrary
,
if
you
will
be
at
Wolsey
's
tomb

time

"
replied
the
jester
.
<EOS>
"I
will
be
there
,
"
replied
the
duke
;
"
but
if
I
am
brought
on
a
bootlesserrand
,
not
even
my
royal
father
shall
save
thee
from
chastisement

<EOS>
""I
will
bear
any
chastisement

may
choose
to
inflict
upon
me
,
if
I
prove
not
the
truth
of
my
assertion
,
"
replied
Sommers
.
 
<EOS>
And
hedropped
into
the
rear
of
the
train
.
<EOS>
The
two
friends
,
as
if
by
mutual
consent
,
avoided
each
other
during
therest
of
the
day
--
Surrey
feeling
he
could
not
unburden
his
heart
toRichmond
,
and
Richmond
brooding
jealously
over
the
intelligence
hehad
received
from
the
jester
.
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
hour
the
duke
proceeded
to
the
lower
ward
,
andstationed
himself
near
Wolsey
's
tomb
-
house
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
he
arrived
there
,
the
vesper
hymn
arose
from
the
adjoining
fane
,
and
its
solemn
strainssomewhat
soothed
his
troubled
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
died
away
;
and
as
thejester
came
not
,
Richmond
grew
impatient
,
and
began
to
fear
he
hadbeen
duped
by
his
informant
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
service
concluded
,
and
,
losing
all
patience
,
he
was
about
to
depart
,
when
the
jester
peeredround
the
lower
angle
of
the
tomb
-
house
,
and
beckoned
to
him
.
<EOS>
Obeying
the
summons
,
the
duke
followed
his
conductor
down
thearched
passage
leading
to
the
cloisters
.
<EOS>
"Tread
<EOS>
softly
,
gossip
,
or
you
will
alarm
them
,
"
said
Sommers
,
in
a
lowtone
.
<EOS>
They
turned
the
corner
of
the
cloisters
;
and
there
,
near
the
entrance
ofthe
chapel
,
stood
the
youthful
pair
--
<EOS>
the
Fair
Geraldine
half
recliningupon
the
earl
's
breast
,
while
his
arm
encircled
her
slender
waist
.
"There
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
the
jester
,
chuckling
maliciously
"
there
!
<EOS>
did
I
speakfalsely
--
eh
,
gossip?Richmond
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
.
<EOS>
"Hist
<EOS>
!
"
said
the
jester
;
"
hear
what
the
Fair
Geraldine
has
to
say
.
<EOS>
""We
must
meet
no
more
thus
<EOS>
,
Surrey
,
"
she
murmured:"I
feel
I
was
wrong
in
granting
the
interview
,

I
could
not
help
it

<EOS>
If

a

more
years

<EOS>
interrupted
Surrey

<EOS>
"
I
here
solemnly

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
return
the

replied
the
Fair
Geraldine
earnestly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
vow
tobe
yours
,
and
yours
only

<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
that
Richmond
could
hear
your
vow
!
<EOS>
"
said
Surrey
;
"
it
wouldextinguish
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
""He
has
heard
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
duke
,
advancing
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
his
hopes
are
not
yetextinguished
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Fair
Geraldine
uttered
a
slight
scream
,
and
disengaged
herself
fromthe
earl
.
<EOS>
"Richmond
,
you
have
acted
unworthily
in
thus
playing
the
spy
,
"
saidSurrey
angrily
.
<EOS>
"None
but
a
spy
can
surprise
interviews
like
these

"
rejoined
Richmondbitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Lady
Elizabeth
Fitzgerald
had
better
have
kept
herchamber
,
than
come
here
to
plight
her
troth
with
a
boy
,
who
will
changehis
mind
before
his

is
grown

<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
grace
shall
find
the
boy

enough
to
avenge
an
insult,"rejoined
Surrey
sternly
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
to

the

<EOS>

"Too
<EOS>
much
exasperated
to
hesitate
,
Surrey
followed
the
duke
down
thepassage
,
and
the
next
moment
the
clashing
of
swords
was
heard
.
 
<EOS>
TheFair
Geraldine
screamed
loudly
,
and
Will
Sommers
began
to
think
thejest
had
been
carried
too
far
.
<EOS>
"What
is
to
be
done
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
the
king
hears
of
this
quarrel

he
willassuredly
place
the

<EOS>
I
now
repent

the

<EOS>
"You
acted
most
maliciously

"
cried
the
Fair
Geraldine
;
"
but
fly
,
andprevent
further
mischief

<EOS>
"Thus
urged
,
the
jester
ran
towards
the
lower

of
the
guard
and
a
couple
of
halberdiers
near
the
entrance
of
St

<EOS>
George

told
them
what

theyimmediately
hastened
with

to
the
scene

conflict

<EOS>
"My

cried
the
officer
to
the
combatants

I
command

"But
<EOS>
finding
no

he
rushed
between

with
the
aid

forcibly
separated
them

"My

the

"On

rejoined
the

.
<EOS>
"You

the

""But

I
provoked
the

Richmond
:

.
 
<EOS>
Of
Tristram
Lyndwood
,
the
old
Forester
,
and
his
Grand
-
daughterMabel
--
Of
the
Peril
in
which
the
Lady
Anne
Boleyn
was
placed
duringthe
chase
--
<EOS>
And
by
whom
she
was
rescued
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
the
announcement
that
a
grand
hunting
party
wouldbe
held
in
the
forest
,
all
the
verderers
,
rangers
,
and
keepers
assembledat
an
early
hour
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
king
's
arrival
at
Windsor
inan
open
space
on
the
west
side
of
the
great
avenue
,
where
a
woodenstand
was
erected
,
canopied
over
with
green
boughs
and
festoonedwith
garlands
of
flowers
,
for
the
accommodation
of
the
Lady
AnneBoleyn
and
her
dames
,
who
,
it
was
understood
,
would
be
present
at
thechase
.
<EOS>
At
a
little
distance
from
the
stand
an
extensive
covert
was
fencedround
with
stout
poles
,
to
which
nets
were
attached
so
as
to
form
ahaye
or
preserve
,
where
the
game
intended
for
the
royal
sport
wasconfined
;
and
though
many
of
the
animals
thus
brought
together
wereof
hostile
natures
,
they
were
all
so
terrified
,
and
seemingly
soconscious
of
the
danger
impending
over
them
,
that
they
did
not
molesteach
other
.
 
<EOS>
The
foxes
and
martins
,
of
which
there
were
abundance
,
slunk
into
the
brushwood
with
the
hares
and
rabbits
,
but
left
their
preyuntouched
.
 
<EOS>
The
harts
made
violent
efforts
to
break
forth
,
and
,
entangling
their
horns
in
the
nets
,
were
with
difficulty
extricated
anddriven
back
;
while
the
timid
does
,
not
daring
to
follow
them
,
stoodwarily
watching
the
result
of
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
antlered
captives
was
a
fine
buck
,
which
,
having
beenonce
before
hunted
by
the
king
,
was
styled
a
"
hart
royal
,
"
and
thisnoble
animal
would
certainly
have
effected
his
escape
if
he
had
notbeen
attacked
and
driven
back
by
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
who
throughout
themorning
's
proceedings
displayed
great
energy
and
skill
.
 
<EOS>
Thecompliments
bestowed
on
Fenwolf
for
his
address
by
the
chief
verdererexcited
the
jealousy
of
some
of
his
comrades
,
and
more
than
oneasserted
that
he
had
been
assisted
in
his
task
by
some
evil
being
,
andthat
Bawsey
herself
was
no
better
than
a
familiar
spirit
in
the
form
of
ahound
.
<EOS>
Morgan
Fenwolf
scouted
these
remarks
;
and
he
was
supported
by
someothers
among
the
keepers
,
who
declared
that
it
required
nosupernatural
aid
to
accomplish
what
he
had
done
--
that
he
was
nothingmore
than
a
good
huntsman
,
who
could
ride
fast
and
boldly
--
that
hewas
skilled
in
all
the
exercises
of
the
chase
,
and
possessed
a
stanchand
well
-
trained
hound
.
<EOS>
The
party
then
sat
down
to
breakfast
beneath
the
trees
,
and
the
talkfell
upon
Herne
the
Hunter
,
and
his
frequent
appearance
of
late
in
theforest
(
for
most
of
the
keepers
had
heard
of
or
encountered
thespectral
huntsman
)
;
and
while
they
were
discussing
this
topic
,
and
aplentiful
allowance
of
cold
meat
,
bread
,
ale
,
and
mead
at
the
sametime
,
two
persons
were
seen
approaching
along
a
vista
on
the
right
,
who
specially
attracted
their
attention
and
caused
Morgan
Fenwolf
todrop
the
hunting
-
knife
with
which
he
was
carving
his
viands
,
and
startto
his
feet
.
<EOS>
The
new
-
comers
were
an
old
man
and
a
comely
young
damsel
.
 
<EOS>
Theformer
,
though
nearer
seventy
than
sixty
,
was
still
hale
and
athletic
,
with
fresh
complexion
,
somewhat
tanned
by
the
sun
,
and
a
keen
greyeye
,
which
had
lost
nothing
of
its
fire
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
habited
in
a
stoutleathern
doublet
,
hose
of
the
same
material
,
and
boots
rudely
fashionedout
of
untanned
ox
-
hide
,
and
drawn
above
the
knee
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
girdle
wasthrust
a
large
hunting
-
knife
;
a
horn
with
a
silver
mouthpiece
dependedfrom
his
shoulder
,
and
he
wore
a
long
bow
and
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
athis
back
.
 
<EOS>
A
flat
bonnet
,
made
of
fox
-
skin
and
ornamented
with
araven
's
wing
,
covered
his
hair
,
which
was
as
white
as
silver
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
upon
this
old
forester
,
for
such
his
attire
proclaimed
him
,
that
the
attention
of
the
beholders
,
and
of
Morgan
Fenwolf
in
especial
,
was
fixed
,
but
upon
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
Amongst
the
many
lovely
and
high

born
dames
who
had
so
recently
graced
the
procession
to
the
castlewere
few
,
if
any
,
comparable
to
this
lowly
damsel
.
 
<EOS>
Her
dress
--
probablyowing
to
the
pride
felt
in
her
by
her
old
relative
was
somewhat
superiorto
her
station

A

<EOS>
A
gown
of
orange

coloured
cloth
,
sufficiently
short
to
display
her
small
ankles
,
and
a
pair
of
greenbuskins
,
embroidered
with
silver
,
together
with
a
collar
of
the
whitestand
finest
linen
,
though
shamed
by
the
neck
it
concealed
,
and
fastenedby
a
small
clasp
,
completed
her
attire
.
 
<EOS>
Her
girdle
was
embroidered
withsilver
,
and
her
sleeves
were
fastened
by
aiglets
of
the
same
metal
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
proud
old
Tristram
Lyndwood
seems
of

<EOS>
one
of
the
keepers
.
"And
<EOS>

replied
another

"Ay

rejoined
the
first
speaker
;
"

,
to
my
thinking

<EOS>
she

fairer

sweeter
flower

<EOS>
""Have

"
observed
another
keeper
.
 
<EOS>
"
Recollect
thatMark
Fytton

the
butcher

was
hanged
for
speaking
slightingly
of

Anne

and
you
may
share
his
fate
if
you
disparage

<EOS>
""Na
<EOS>
I
meant
not
to
disparage

Gabriel

<EOS>
"
Hal

when

If

<EOS>
The
more
the
merrier

say
I.
 
<EOS>
But
if
he
sets
eyes
on
MabLyndwood
it
may
somewhat
unsettle
his
love
for
the
Lady
Anne
.
<EOS>
""Tush
,
Gabriel

<EOS>
"
said
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
darting
an
angry
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
"What
business
have
you
to
insinuate
that
the
king
would
heed
otherthan
the

with
a
malignantgrin

<EOS>
"

""And

that

another

laughed
in
chorus

<EOS>
"
Come

Morgan

<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
keeper
turned
moodily
away
,
and
hied
towards
TristramLyndwood
and
his
granddaughter
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
forester
shook
him
cordiallyby
the
hand
,
and
after
questioning
him
as
to
what
had
taken
place
,
andhearing
how
he
had
managed
to
drive
the
hart
royal
into

clapped
him
on

"To
<EOS>
this
speech
Mabel
not
only
paid
no
attention

looked
studiouslyanother
way

"I

"It

"Then
<EOS>
I
am
franker
than
some
of
my
sex
,
"
replied
Mabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
who
isthe
strange
man
looking
at
us
from
behind
that
tree
,
grandfather!"I
see
no
one
,
"
replied
the
old
forester
.
<EOS>
"Neither
<EOS>
do
I
,
"
added
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
with
a
shudder
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
wilfullyblind
,
"
rejoined
Mabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
see
,
the
person
I
mentioned
stalks
forth
.
<EOS>
Now
,
perhaps
,
he
is
visible
to
you
both
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
she
spoke
,
a
tall
wild
-
looking
figure
,
armed
with
a
hunting
-
spear
,
emerged
from
the
trees
and
advanced
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
garb
of
thenewcomer
somewhat
resembled
that
of
a
forester
;
but
his
arms
andlower
limbs
were
destitute
of
covering
,
and
appeared
singularlymuscular
,
while
his
skin
was
swarthy
as
that
of
a
gipsy
.
 
<EOS>
His
jet
-
blackhair
hung
in
elf
-
locks
over
his
savage
-
looking
features
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
he
was
beside
them
,
and
fixed
his
dark
piercingeyes
on
Mabel
in
such
a
manner
as
to
compel
her
to
avert
her
gaze
.
<EOS>
"What
brings
you
here
this
morning
,
Tristram
Lyndwood
?
"
<EOS>
hedemanded
,
in
a
hoarse
imperious
tone
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
same
motive
that
brought
you
,
Valentine
Hagthorne
,
replied
theold
forester--
"
to
see
the
royal
chase
.
<EOS>
""This
,
I
suppose
,
is
your
granddaughter
?
"
pursued
Hagthorne
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
replied
Tristram
bluntly
.
<EOS>
"Strange
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
seen
her
before
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sheis
very
fair
.
 
<EOS>
Be
ruled
by
me
,
friend
Tristram
--
take
her
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
If
shesees
the
king
,
ill
will
come
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
or
should
know
,
hischaracter
.
<EOS>
""Hagthorne
<EOS>
advises
<EOS>
well
,
"
interposed
Fenwolf
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mabel
will
be
better
athome
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
she
has
no
intention
of
returning
at
present
,
"
replied
Mabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Youbrought
me
here
for
pastime
,
dear
grandfather
,
and
will
not
take
meback
at
the
recommendation
of
this
strange
man?""Content
<EOS>
you
,
child
--
content
you
,
"
replied
Tristram
kindly
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
shallremain
where
you
are
.
<EOS>
""You
will
repent
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hagthorne
.
<EOS>
And
hastily
darting
among
the
trees
,
he
disappeared
from
view
.
<EOS>
Affecting
to
laugh
at
the
occurrence
,
though
evidently
annoyed
by
it
,
the
old
forester
led
his
granddaughter
towards
the
stand
,
where
he
wascordially
greeted
by
the
keepers
,
most
of
whom
,
while
expressing
theirpleasure
at
seeing
him
,
strove
to
render
themselves
agreeable
in
theeyes
of
Mabel
.
<EOS>
From
this
scene
Morgan
Fenwolf
kept
aloof
,
and
remained
leaningagainst
a
tree
,
with
his
eyes
riveted
upon
the
damsel
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
rousedfrom
his
reverie
by
a
slight
tap
upon
the
shoulder
;
and
turning
at
thetouch
,
beheld
Valentine
Hagthorne
.
 
<EOS>
Obedient
to
a
sign
from
the
latter
,
he
followed
him
amongst
the
trees
,
and
they
both
plunged
into
a
dell
.
<EOS>
An
hour
or
two
after
this
,
when
the
sun
was
higher
in
the
heavens
,
andthe
dew
dried
upon
the
greensward
,
the
king
and
a
large
company
oflords
and
ladies
rode
forth
from
the
upper
gate
of
the
castle
,
and
takingtheir
way
along
the
great
avenue
,
struck
off
on
the
right
when
abouthalf
-
way
up
it
,
and
shaped
their
course
towards
the
haye
.
<EOS>
A
goodly
sight
<EOS>
it
was
to
see
this
gallant
company
riding
beneath
thetrees
;
and
pleasant
was
it
,
also
,
to
listen
to
the
blithe
sound
of
theirvoices
,
amid
which
Anne
Boleyn
's
musical
laugh
could
be
plainlydistinguished
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
was
attended
by
his
customary
band
of
archersand
yeomen
of
the
guard
,
and
by
the
Duke
of
Shoreditch
and
hisfollowers
.
 
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
haye
,
the
king
dismounted
,
and
assistingthe
Lady
Anne
from
her
steed
,
ascended
the
stand
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
then
took
a
small
and
beautifully
fashioned
bow
from
an
attendant
,
and
stringing
it
,
presented
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
trust
<EOS>
this
will
not
prove
too
strong
for
your
fair
hands
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"I
will
make
shift
to
draw
it
,
"
replied
Anne
,
raising
the
bow
,
andgracefully
pulling
the
string
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
I
could
wound
your
majesty
assurely
as
I
shall
hit
the
first
roe
that
passes
.
<EOS>
""That
were
a
needless
labour
,
"
rejoined
Henry
,
"
seeing
that
you
havealready
stricken
me
to
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
You
should
cure
the
wound
you
havealready
made
,
sweetheart
-
<EOS>
not
inflict
a
new
one
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
juncture
<EOS>
the
chief
verderer
,
mounted
on
a
powerful
steed
,
andfollowed
by
two
keepers
,
each
holding
a
couple
of
stag
-
hounds
in
leash
,
rode
up
to
the
royal
stand
,
and
placing
his
horn
to
his
lips
,
blew
threelong
mootes
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
part
of
the
network
of
thehaye
was
lifted
up
,
and
a
roebuck
set
free
.
<EOS>
By
the
management
of
the
keepers
,
the
animal
was
driven
past
theroyal
stand
;
and
Anne
Boleyn
,
who
had
drawn
an
arrow
nearly
to
thehead
,
let
it
fly
with
such
good
aim
that
she
pierced
the
buck
to
theheart
.
 
<EOS>
A
loud
shout
from
the
spectators
rewarded
the
prowess
of
thefair
huntress
;
and
Henry
was
so
enchanted
,
that
he
bent
the
knee
toher
,
and
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
Satisfied
,
however
,
with
the'achievement
,
Anne
prudentlv
declined
another
shot
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
then
took
abow
from
one
of
the
archers
,
and
other
roes
being
turned
out
,
heapproved
upon
them
his
unerring
skill
as
a
marksman
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
hounds
,
being
held
in
leash
,
kept
up
a
loud
andincessant
baying
;
and
Henry
,
wearying
of
his
slaughterous
sport
,
turnedto
Anne
,
and
asked
her
whether
she
was
disposed
for
the
chase
.
 
<EOS>
Sheanswered
in
the
affirmative
,
and
the
king
motioned
his
henchmen
tobring
forward
the
steeds
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
he
caught
sight
of
Mabel
,
who
was
standing
with
hergrandsire
among
the
keepers
,
at
a
little
distance
from
the
stand
,
and
,
struck
with
her
extraordinary
beauty
,
he
regarded
her
for
a
momentintently
,
and
then
called
to
Gabriel
Lapp
,
who
chanced
to
be
near
him
,
and
demanded
her
name
.
<EOS>
"It
is
Mabel
Lyndwood
,
an't
please
your
majesty
,
"
replied
Gabriel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sheis
granddaughter
to
old
Tristram
Lyndwood
,
who
dwells
at
Black
Nest
,
near
the
lake
,
at
the
farther
extremity
of
Windsor
Forest
,
and
who
wasforester
to
your
royal
father
,
King
Henry
the
Seventh
,
of
blessedmemory
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
is
it
so
?
"
cried
Henry
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
prevented
from
further
remark
by
Anne
Boleyn
,
who
,
perceiving
how
his
attention
was
attracted
,
suddenly
interposed
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
majesty
spoke
of
the
chase
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
impatiently
.
 
<EOS>
But
perhapsyou
have
found
other
pastime
more
<EOS>
diverting?""Not
so
--
not
so
,
sweetheart
,
"
he
replied
hastily
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
a
hart
royal
in
the
haye
,
"
said
Gabriel
Lapp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
yourmajesty
's
pleasure
that
I
set
him
free?"It
is
,
good
fellow
--
<EOS>
it
is
,
"
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
And
as
Gabriel
hastened
to
the
netted
fencework
,
and
prepared
to
driveforth
the
hart
,
Henry
assisted
Anne
Boleyn
,
who
could
not
helpexhibiting
some
slight
jealous
pique
,
to
mount
her
steed
,
and
havingsprung
into
his
own
saddle
,
they
waited
the
liberation
of
the
buck
,
which
was
accomplished
in
a
somewhat
unexpected
manner
.
<EOS>
Separated
from
the
rest
of
the
herd
,
the
noble
animal
made
a
suddendart
towards
Gabriel
,
and
upsetting
him
in
his
wild
career
,
darted
pastthe
king
,
and
made
towards
the
upper
part
of
the
forest
.
 
<EOS>
In
anotherinstant
the
hounds
were
un
coupled
and
at
his
heels
,
while
Henry
andAnne
urged
their
steeds
after
him
,
the
king
shouting
at
the
top
of
hislusty
voice
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
royal
party
followed
as
they
might
,
and
thewoods
resounded
with
their
joyous
cries
.
<EOS>
The
hart
royal
proved
himself
worthy
of
his
designation
.
 
<EOS>
Dashingforward
with
extraordinary
swiftness
,
he
rapidly
gained
upon
hispursuers
--
for
though
Henry
,
by
putting
his
courser
to
his
utmost
speed
,
could
have
kept
near
him
,
he
did
not
choose
to
quit
his
fair
companion
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
scoured
the
forest
,
until
the
king
,
seeing
they
shouldbe
speedily
distanced
,
commanded
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
who
,
with
theDukes
of
Suffolk
and
Norfolk
,
was
riding
close
behind
him
,
to
cross
bythe
lower
ground
on
the
left
,
and
turn
the
stag
.
 
<EOS>
Wyat
instantly
obeyed
,
and
plunging
his
spurs
deeply
into
his
horse
's
sides
,
started
off
at
afurious
pace
,
and
was
soon
after
seen
shaping
his
rapid
course
througha
devious
glade
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Henry
and
his
fair
companion
rode
on
without
relaxing
theirpace
,
until
they
reached
the
summit
of
a
knoll
,
crowned
by
an
old
oakand
beech
-
tree
,
and
commanding
a
superb
view
of
the
castle
,
wherethey
drew
in
the
rein
.
<EOS>
From
this
eminence
they
could
witness
the
progress
of
the
chase
,
as
itcontinued
in
the
valley
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
An
ardent
lover
of
hunting
<EOS>
,
the
kingwatched
it
with
the
deepest
interest
,
rose
in
his
saddle
,
and
utteringvarious
exclamations
,
showed
,
from
his
impatience
,
that
he
was
onlyrestrained
by
the
stronger
passion
of
love
from
joining
it
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
stag
,
hounds
,
and
huntsmen
were
lost
amid
a
thicket
,
andnothing
could
be
distinguished
but
a
distant
baying
and
shouts
.
 
<EOS>
At
lasteven
these
sounds
died
away
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
who
had
ill
brooked
the
previous
restraint
,
now
grew
soimpatient
,
that
Anne
begged
him
to
set
off
after
them
,
when
suddenlythe
cry
of
hounds
burst
upon
their
ears
,
and
the
hart
was
seen
issuingfrom
the
dell
,
closely
followed
by
his
pursuers
.
<EOS>
The
affrighted
animal
,
to
the
king
's
great
satisfaction
,
made
his
waydirectly
towards
the
spot
where
he
was
stationed
;
but
on
reaching
theside
of
the
knoll
,
and
seeing
his
new
foes
,
he
darted
off
on
the
right
,
and
tried
to
regain
the
thicket
below
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
turned
by
anotherband
of
keepers
,
and
again
driven
towards
the
knoll
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
reined
in
his
steed
by
the
side
of
theking
,
than
the
hart
again
appeared
bounding
up
the
hill
.
 
<EOS>
Anne
Boleyn
,
who
had
turned
her
horse
's
head
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
the
hunt
,
alarmed
by
the
animal
's
menacing
appearance
,
tried
to
get
out
of
hisway
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
Hemmed
in
on
all
sides
,
and
driven
todesperation
by
the
cries
of
hounds
and
huntsmen
in
front
,
the
hartlowered
his
horns
,
and
made
a
furious
push
at
her
.
<EOS>
Dreadfully
alarmed
,
Anne
drew
in
the
rein
so
suddenly
and
sharply
,
thatshe
almost
pulled
her
steed
back
upon
his
haunches
;
and
in
trying
toavoid
the
stag
's
attack
,
caught
hold
of
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
who
was
closebeside
her
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
probability
she
would
have
received
some
seriousinjury
from
the
infuriated
animal
,
who
was
just
about
to
repeat
hisassault
and
more
successfully
,
when
a
bolt
from
a
cross
-
bow
,
discharged
by
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
who
suddenly
made
his
appearancefrom
behind
the
beech
-
tree
,
brought
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
But
Anne
Boleyn
escaped
one
danger
only
to
encounter
another
equallyserious
.
 
<EOS>
On
seeing
her
fling
herself
into
the
arms
of
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
Henry
regarded
her
in
stern
displeasure
for
a
moment
,
and
then
callingangrily
to
his
train
,
without
so
much
as
deigning
to
inquire
whether
shehad
sustained
any
damage
from
the
accident
,
or
making
the
slightestremark
upon
her
conduct
,
rode
sullenly
towards
the
castle
.

IX
.
 
<EOS>
By
what
means
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
obtained
an
Interview
with
AnneBoleyn
--
<EOS>
And
how
the
Earl
of
Surrey
saved
them
from
the
King
's
anger
.
<EOS>
The
incident
above
related
gave
new
life
to
the
adherents
of
Catherineof
Arragon
,
while
it
filled
those
devoted
to
Anne
Boleyn
with
alarm
.
<EOS>
Immediately
on
Anne
's
return
to
the
castle
Lord
Rochford
had
a
privateinterview
with
her
,
and
bitterly
reproached
her
for
endangering
hersplendid
prospects
.
 
<EOS>
Anne
treated
the
matter
very
lightly
--
said
it
wasonly
a
temporary
gust
of
jealousy
--
and
added
that
the
king
would
be
ather
feet
again
before
the
day
was
past
.
<EOS>
"You
are
over
-
confident
,
mistress
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rochford
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Henry
isnot
an
ordinary
gallant
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
you
who
are
mistaken
,
father
,
"
replied
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
king
differs
inno
respect
from
any
of
his
love
-
smitten
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
him
in
my
toils
,
and
will
not
let
him
escape
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
a
tiger
in
your
toils
,
daughter
,
and
take
heed
he
breaks
notforcibly
through
them
,
"
rejoined
Rochford
.
 
<EOS>
"
Henry
is
more
waywardthan
you
suppose
him
.
 
<EOS>
Once
let
him
take
up
a
notion
,
and
nothing
canshake
him
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
resolved
upon
the
divorce
as
much
from
self
<EOS>
-
will
as
from
any
other
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
regain
your
position
withhim
,
of
which
you
seem
so
confident
,
do
not
consider
yourself
secure
--
not
even
when
you
are
crowned
queen
--
but
be
warned
by
Catherine
ofArragon
.
<EOS>
""Catherine
<EOS>
has
not
the
art
to
retain
him
,
"
said
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Henry
will
neverdivorce
me
.
<EOS>
""Take
<EOS>
care
<EOS>
he
does
not
rid
himself
of
you
in
a
more
summary
manner
,
daughter
,
"
rejoined
Rochford
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
would

study
his

humour
him

yield
to

<EOS>
Above

,
you

<EOS>
""You
are
wrong
in
all

the
last
,
father
,
"
returned
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Henry
is
notto
be
pleased
by
such
nice
attention
to
his
humours
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
because
Ihave
shown
myself
careless
of
them
that
I
have
captivated
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
Iwill
take
care
not
to
exhibit
jealousy
,
and
,
sooth
to
say
,
I
do
not
think
Ishall
have
cause
.
<EOS>
""Be
<EOS>
not
too
sure
of
that
,
"
replied
Rochford
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
at
all
events
,
let
notthe
king
have
cause
to
be
jealous
of
you

<EOS>
I
trust
Wyat
will
be
banishedfrom
court
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
he
is
not
,
do
not
let
him
approach
you
more
.
<EOS>
""Poor
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
!
"
sighed
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
loved
me
very
dearly
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
what
is
his
love
compared
to
the
king
's
?
"
cried
Rochford
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
,
girl
!
<EOS>
think
no
more
of
him

<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
will
not
,
my
lord

"
she
rejoined
;
"
I
see
the
prudence
of
your
counsel
,
and
will
obey
it
.
 
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
I
pray
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
soon
win
back
theaffections

<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
sooner
had
Rochford
quitted
the
chamber
than
the
arras
at
thefarther
end
was
raised
,
and
Wyat
stepped
from
behind
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
firstproceeding
was
to
bar
the
door
.
<EOS>
"What
means
this
,
Sir
Thomas
?
"
cried
Anne
in
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
have
youobtained
admittance
here?""Through
the
secret
staircase
,
"
replied
Wyat
,
bending
the
knee
beforeher
.
<EOS>
"Rise
,
sir
!
"
cried
Anne
,
in
great
alarm

<EOS>
"
Return

I
beseech
you

<EOS>
You
have
greatly
endangered

<EOS>
If
you

it
will
be
in

Oh

Sir

<EOS>
you
can

""Not

<EOS>
he
repeated
bitterly
;
"
not

I
Words
cannotspeak
my

<EOS>
I
would
lay
down
my

But
for
my
love

I
would
throw
open
that
door

walk
forthso

so

experience
some

""But

you

AnneBoleyn

in

<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
no

Wyat

with
some
contempt

"
replied
Wyat
in
a
sombre
tone
,
"
the
thought
of
Henry'shappiness
drives
me
mad

I
feel
that

""Sir

she
exclaimed

in
mingled
fear

anger

flinging
himself
into

"This

cried
Wyat

springing
to
his

his
dark
eyes

blazing
with
jealous
fury

upon
her--
<EOS>
"
you

Better
had

better

""No

"Better

far
you

pursued
Wyat
fiercely

<EOS>
"
Think
not
Henry
will
respectyou
more

her

had
been
eight

twenty

<EOS>
No;when
he
is
tired
of

when
some

shall
enslave
his

he
will
cast
you
off

or
,
as
your
fathertruly
intimated
,
will
seek
a
readier
means
of
ridding
himself
of
you

<EOS>
Then
you
will
think
of
the
different
fate
that
might
have
been
yours

adhered

your

<EOS>
""Wyat

cried
Anne

<EOS>
"I
am
glad
to
see

Wyat

your

""Oh

I
forego

your

<EOS>
""You

she
rejoined

with

repressing

you

perish

""I

with
a
bitter

"Wyat

cried
Anne

throwing
herself
on

before
him

by

"But
<EOS>
Wyat
continued
inexorable

<EOS>
"0

exclaimed
Anne

wringing
her

<EOS>
A
terriblesilence
ensued

during

Anne
regarded
Wyat

she
coulddiscern
no
change

<EOS>
At
this
juncture
the
tapestry

again
raised

the
Earl

from

"You

the

I

Wyat

At

footsteps
were

approaching

the
stern
voice

heard
commanding

pressed

The

Henry
rushed
in

Norfolk

Suffolk

a

"Ah

broken

"Liberated

""Retire
,
my
lords
,
"
said
Henry
to
the
assemblage
;
"
we
owe
someapology
to
the
Lady
Anne
for
our
intrusion
,
and
desire
an
opportunity
tomake
it
.
<EOS>
"Upon
<EOS>
this
the
chamber
was
instantly
cleared
of
its
occupants
,
and
theEarl
of
Surrey
was
conducted
,
under
a
guard
,
to
the
Round
Tower
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
however
,
did
not
find
it
an
easy
matter
to
make
peace
with
theLady
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
Conscious
of
the
advantage
she
had
gained
,
shedetermined
not
to
relinquish
it
,
and
,
after
half
an
hour
's
vain
suing
,
herroyal
lover
proposed
a
turn
in
the
long
gallery
,
upon
which
herapartments
opened
.
 
<EOS>
Here
they
continued
conversing
--
<EOS>
Henry
pleading
inthe
most
passionate
manner
,
and
Anne
maintaining
a
show
of
offendedpride
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
exhibited
some
signs
of
relenting
,
and
Henry
led
her
into
arecess
in
the
gallery
,
lighted
by
a
window
filled
with
magnificentstained
glass
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
recess
was
a
seat
and
a
small
table
,
on
whichstood
a
vase
filled
with
flowers
,
arranged
by
Anne
's
own
hand
;
and
herethe
monarch
hoped
to
adjust
his
differences
with
her
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
word
having
reached
Wolsey
and
Campeggio
of
the
newcause
of
jealousy
which
the
king
had
received
,
it
was
instantly
resolvedthat
the
former
should
present
to
him
,
while
in
his
present
favourablemood
,
a
despatch
received
that
morning
from
Catherine
of
Arragon
.
<EOS>
Armed
with
the
letter
,
Wolsey
repaired
to
the
king
's
closet
.
 
<EOS>
Not
findinghim
there
,
and
being
given
to
understand
by
an
usher
that
he
was
in
thegreat
gallery
,
he
proceeded
thither
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
walked
softly
along
thepolished
oak
floor
,
he
heard
voices
in
one
of
the
recesses
,
and
distinguished
the
tones
of
Henry
and
Anne
Boleyn
.
<EOS>
Henry
was
clasping
the
snowy
fingers
of
his
favourite
,
and
gazingpassionately
at
her
,
as
the
cardinal
approached
.
<EOS>
"Your
majesty
shall
not
detain
my
hand
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
unless
you
swearto
me
,
by
your
crown
,
that
you
will
not
again
be
jealous
without
cause
.
<EOS>
""I
swear
it
,
"
replied
Henry
.
<EOS>
"Were
<EOS>
your
majesty
as
devoted
to
me
as
you
would
have
<EOS>
me
believe
,
you
would
soon
bring
this
matter
of
the
divorce
to
an
issue
,
"
said
Anne
.
<EOS>
"I
would
fain
do
so
,
sweetheart
,
"
rejoined
Henry
;
"
but
these
cardinalsperplex
me
sorely
.
<EOS>
""I
am
told
by
one
who
overheard
him
,
that
Wolsey
has
declared
thedivorce
shall
not
be
settled
these
two
years
,
"
said
Anne
;
"
in
which
caseit
had
better
not
be
settled
at
all
;
for
I
care
not
to
avow
<EOS>
I
can
not
brookso
much
delay
.
 
<EOS>
The
warmth
of
my
affection
will
grow
icy
cold
by
thattime
.
<EOS>
""It
were
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
the
most
forbearing
,
"
rejoined
theking
,
smiling--
"
but
it
shall
not
be
so--
by
this
lily
hand
it
shall
not
!
<EOS>
Andnow
,
sweetheart
,
are
we
entirely
reconciled?"Not
yet

"
replied
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
claim
a
boon
from
your
majesty
before
Iaccord
my
entire
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
""Name
it

,
"
said
the
king
,
still
clasping
her
hand
tenderly
,
andintoxicated
by
the
witchery
of
her
glance
.
<EOS>
"I
ask
an
important
favour
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
but
as
it
is
one
which
willbenefit
your
majesty
as
much
as
myself
,
I
have
the
less
scruple
inrequesting
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
ask
the
dismissal
of
one
who
has
abused
your
favour
,
who
,
by
his
extortion
and
rapacity
,
has
in
some
degree
alienated
theaffections
of
your
subjects
from
you
,
and
who
solely
opposes
yourdivorce
from
Catherine
of
Arragon
because
he
fears
my
influence
maybe
prejudicial
to
him
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
mean
Wolsey
?
"
said
Henry
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"Your
majesty
has
guessed
aright
,
"
replied
Anne
.
<EOS>
"Wolsey
<EOS>
has
incurred
my
displeasure
oft
of
late
,
"
said
Henry
;
"
and
yethis
fidelity--""Be
not
deceived

my
liege

said
Anne
;
<EOS>
"
he
is
faithful
to
you
only
so
faras
serves
his

<EOS>
He
thinks
he
rules
you
.
"Before
<EOS>
Henry
could
reply
,
the
cardinal
stepped
forward
.
<EOS>
"I
bring
your
majesty
a
despatch
,
just
received
from
the
queen
,
"
hesaid
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
have
been
listening
to
our
discourse
?
"
rejoined
Henry
sternly
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
overheard--""Enough
to
convince
me
,
if
I
had
previously
doubted
it
,
that
the
LadyAnne

my
mortal
foe

"
replied
Wolsey
.
<EOS>
"Foe
<EOS>
though
I
am

I
will
make
terms
with
your

said
Anne

"Expedite

do
so

replied
Wolsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
further
the
matter
,
ifpossible
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
rests
chiefly
in
the
hands
of
his
holiness
Pope
Clementthe

<EOS>
""If

Anne

<EOS>
"
Nay

frown
at

<EOS>
Such
,
I
repeat

If

""Do

said
Henry
,
smiling
approval
at
Anne
;
"
Ishall
uphold
her

<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
it
please
your

said
Wolsey
,
again
offering
Catherine

letter

<EOS>
"Take

replied
the

""Excellent

""Then

replied
Henry

<EOS>
"She

muttered
Wolsey
as

walked
away

was
told

"X.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
Mysterious
Disappearance
of
Herne
the
Hunter
in
the
Lake
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
procure
any
mitigation
of
Surrey
's
sentence
,
the
Duke
ofRichmond
proceeded
to
the
Round
Tower
,
where
he
found
his
friend
ina
small
chamber
,
endeavouring
to
beguile
his
captivity
by
study
.
<EOS>
Richmond
endeavoured
to
console
him
,
and
was
glad
to
find
him
inbetter
spirits
than
he
expected
.
 
<EOS>
Early
youth
is
seldom
long
dejected
,
and
misfortunes
,
at
that
buoyant
season
,
seem
lighter
than
they
appearlater
on
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
cause
for
which
he
suffered
,
moreover
,
sustainedSurrey
,
and
confident
of
the
Fair
Geraldine
's
attachment
<EOS>
,
he
cared
littlefor
the
restraint
imposed
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
point
he
expressed
someregret
--
namely
,
his
inability
to
prosecute
the
adventure
of
Herne
theHunter
with
the
duke
.
<EOS>
"I
grieve
that
I
can
not
accompany
you
,
Richmond
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
sincethat
is
impossible
,
let
me
recommend
you
to
take
the
stout
archer
whogoes
by
the
name
of
the
Duke
of
Shoreditch
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
veryman
you
require
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
some
consideration
the
duke
assented
,
and
,
promising
to
returnon
the
following
day
and
report
what
had
occurred
he
took
his
leave
,
and
went
in
search
of
the
archer
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
he
had
taken
uphis
quarters
at
the
Garter
,
he
sent
for
him
and
proposed
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Shoreditch
heard
the
duke
's
relation
with
astonishment
,
but
expressedthe
greatest
willingness
to
accompany
him
,
pledging
himself
,
asRichmond
demanded
,
to
profound
secrecy
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
hour
--
namely
,
midnight
--
the
duke
quitted
the
castle
,
and
found
Shoreditch
waiting
for
him
near
the
upper
gate
.
 
<EOS>
The
latterwas
armed
with
a
stout
staff
,
and
a
bow
and
arrows
.
<EOS>
"If
we
gain
sight
of
the
mysterious
horseman
to
-
night
,
"
he
said
,
"
a
cloth
-
yard
shaft
shall
try
whether
he
is
of
mortal
mould
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
be
not
ademon
,
I
will
warrant
he
rides
no
more
.
<EOS>
"Quitting
<EOS>
the
Home
Park
,
they
shaped
their
course
at
once
towards
theforest
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
stormy
night
,
and
the
moon
was
obscured
by
thickclouds
.
 
<EOS>
Before
they
reached
the
hill
,
at
the
end
of
the
long
avenue
,
aheavy
thunderstorm
came
on
,
and
the
lightning
,
playing
among
thetrees
,
seemed
to
reveal
a
thousand
fantastic
forms
to
their
half
-
blindedgaze
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
the
rain
began
to
descend
in
torrents
,
and
compelledthem
to
take
refuge
beneath
a
large
beech
-
tree
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
,
notwithstanding
his
boasting
,
that
the
courage
ofShoreditch
was
waning
fast
,
and
he
at
last
proposed
to
his
leader
thatthey
should
return
as
soon
as
the
rain
abated
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
duke
indignantlyrejected
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
sheltering
themselves
,
the
low
winding
of
a
hornwas
heard
.
 
<EOS>
The
sound
was
succeeded
by
the
trampling
of
horses'hoofs
,
and
the
next
moment
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
showed
a
hartdarting
past
,
followed
by
a
troop
of
some
twenty
ghostly
horsemen
,
headed
by
the
demon
hunter
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Richmond
bade
his
companion
send
a
shaft
after
them
;
butthe
latter
was
so
overcome
by
terror
that
he
could
scarcely
fix
an
arrowon
the
string
,
and
when
he
bent
the
bow
,
the
shaft
glanced
from
thebranches
of
an
adjoining
tree
.
<EOS>
The
storm
continued
with
unabated
fury
for
nearly
an
hour
,
at
theexpiration
of
which
time
it
partially
cleared
off
,
and
though
it
was
stillprofoundly
dark
,
the
duke
insisted
upon
going
on
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
pressedforward
beneath
the
dripping
trees
and
through
the
wet
grass
.
 
<EOS>
Everand
anon
the
moon
broke
through
the
rifted
clouds
,
and
shed
a
wildglimmer
upon
the
scene
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
tracking
a
glade
on
the
farther
side
of
the
hill
,
the
spectralhuntsmen
again
swept
past
them
,
and
so
closely
that
they
could
almosttouch
their
horses
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
duke
's
horror
,
he
perceived
among
them
thebody
of
the
butcher
,
Mark
Fytton
,
sitting
erect
upon
a
powerful
blacksteed
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Shoreditch
,
having
somewhat
regained
his
courage
,
discharged
another
shaft
at
the
troop
.
 
<EOS>
The
arrow
struck
the
body
ofthe
butcher
,
and
completely
transfixed
it
,
but
did
not
check
his
career;while
wild
and
derisive
laughter
broke
from
the
rest
of
the
cavalcade
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Richmond
hurried
after
the
band
,
trying
to
keep
them
insight
;
and
Shoreditch
,
flinging
down
his
bow
,
which
he
found
useless
,
and
grasping
his
staff
,
endeavoured
to
keep
up
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
thoughthey
ran
swiftly
down
the
glade
,
and
tried
to
peer
through
the
darkness
,
they
could
see
nothing
more
of
the
ghostly
company
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
they
arrived
at
a
hillside
,
at
the
foot
of
which
lay
the
lake
,
whose
darkling
waters
were
just
distinguishable
through
an
opening
inthe
trees
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
duke
was
debating
with
himself
whether
to
go
on
orretrace
his
course
,
the
trampling
of
a
horse
was
heard
behind
them
,
and
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
they
beheld
Herne
the
Hunter
,
mounted
on
his
swarthy
steed
and
accompanied
only
by
his
two
blackhounds
,
galloping
furiously
down
the
declivity
.
 
<EOS>
Before
him
flew
the
owl
,
whooping
as
it
sailed
along
the
air
.
<EOS>
The
demon
hunter
was
so
close
to
them
that
they
could
perfectlydiscern
his
horrible
lineaments
,
the
chain
depending
from
his
neck
,
andhis
antlered
helm
.
 
<EOS>
Richmond
shouted
to
him
,
but
the
rider
continuedhis
headlong
course
towards
the
lake
,
heedless
of
the
call
.
<EOS>
The
two
behoIders
rushed
forward
,
but
by
this
time
the
huntsman
hadgained
the
edge
of
the
lake
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
his
sable
hounds
plunged
into
it
,
and
the
owl
skimmed
over
its
surface
.
 
<EOS>
Even
in
the
hasty
view
<EOS>
whichthe
duke
caught
of
the
flying
figure
<EOS>
,
he
fancied
he
perceived
that
it
wasattended
by
a
fantastic
shadow
,
whether
cast
by
itself
or
arising
fromsome
supernatural
<EOS>
cause
he
could
not
determine
.
<EOS>
But
what
followed
was
equally
marvellous
and
incomprehensible
.
 
<EOS>
Asthe
wild
huntsman
reached
the
brink
of
the
lake
,
he
placed
a
horn
to
hismouth
,
and
blew
from
it
a
bright
blue
flame
,
which
illumined
his
owndusky
and
hideous
features
,
and
shed
a
wild
and
unearthly
glimmerover
the
surrounding
objects
.
<EOS>
While
enveloped
in
this
flame
,
the
demon
plunged
into
the
lake
,
andapparently
descended
to
its
abysses
,
for
as
soon
as
the
duke
couldmuster
courage
to
approach
its
brink
,
nothing
could
be
seen
of
him
,
hissteed
,
or
his
hounds

""The
<EOS>
king
's
pleasure
shall
be
obeyed
,
"
rejoined
Wyat
.
<EOS>
And
the
messenger
retired
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
Wyat
remained
for
some
time
in
profound
and
melancholythought
.
 
<EOS>
Heaving
a
deep
sigh
,
he
then
arose
,
and
paced
the
chamberwith
rapid
strides
.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
,
it
is
better
thus
,
"
he
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
remain
near
her
,
I
shall
dosome
desperate
deed
.
 
<EOS>
Better
--
far
better
--
I
should
go
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
to
leaveher
with
Henry
--
<EOS>
to
know
that
he
is
ever
near
her
--
that
he
drinks
in
themusic
of
her
voice
,
and
basks
in
the
sunshine
of
her
smile
--
while
I
amdriven
forth
to
darkness
and
despair
--
the
thought
is
madness
!
<EOS>
I
will
notobey
the
hateful
mandate
!
<EOS>
I
will
stay
and
defy
him!"As
<EOS>
he
uttered
aloud
this
wild
and
unguarded
speech
,
the
arrasscreening
the
door
was
drawn
aside
,
and
gave
admittance
to
Wolsey
.
<EOS>
Wyat
's
gaze
sunk
before
the
penetrating
glance
fixed
upon
him
by
theCardinal
.
<EOS>
"I
did
not
come
to
play
the
eavesdropper
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
said
Wolsey;"but
I
have
heard
enough
to
place
your
life
in
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
refuseto
obey
the
king
's
injunctions
.
 
<EOS>
You
refuse
to
proceed
to
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
Yourefuse
to
assist
in
bringing
about
the
divorce
,
and
prefer
remaining
hereto
brave
your
sovereign
,
and
avenge
yourself
upon
a
fickle
mistress
.
<EOS>
Ha?"Wyat
returned
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
such
be
your
purpose
,
"
pursued
Wolsey
,
after
a
pause
,
during
whichhe
intently
scrutinised
the
knight
's
countenance
,
"
I
will
assist
you
in
it
.
<EOS>
Be
ruled
by
me
,
and
you
shall
have
a
deep
and
full
revenge
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
on
,
"
rejoined
Wyat
,
his
eyes
blazing
with
infernal
fire
,
and
his
handinvoluntarily
clutching
the
handle
of
his
dagger
.
<EOS>
If
I
read
you
aright
,
"
continued
the
cardinal
,
"
you
are
arrived
at
thatpitch
of
desperation
when
life
itself
becomes
indifferent
,
and
when
butone
object
remains
to
be
gained--"And
that
is
vengeance
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Wyat
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Right
,
cardinal
--
<EOS>
right
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
have
vengeance
--
terrible
vengeance!""You
shall
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
deceive
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
purchase
what
you
seekat
the
price
of
your
own
head
.
<EOS>
""I
care
not
,
"
replied
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"
All
sentiments
of
love
and
loyalty
areswallowed
up
by
jealousy
and
burning
hate
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
but
blood
canallay
the
fever
that
consumes
me
.
 
<EOS>
Show
me
how
to
slay
him!""Him
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
the
cardinal
,
in
alarm
and
horror
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wretch
!
<EOS>
would
you
killyour
king
?
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
I
should
counsel
the
injury
of
a
hair
of
hishead
!
<EOS>
I
do
not
want
you
to
play
the
assassin
,
Wyat
,
"
he
added
morecalmly
,
"
but
the
just
avenger
.
 
<EOS>
Liberate
the
king
from
the
thraldom
ofthe
capricious
siren
who
enslaves
him
,
and
you
will
do
a
service
to
thewhole
country
.
 
<EOS>
A
word
from
you
--
a
letter
--
a
token
--
will
cast
her
from
theking
,
and
place
her
on
the
block
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
matter
?
<EOS>
The
gory
scaffoldwere
better
than
Henry
's
bed
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
harm
her
,
"
cried
Wyat
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
love
her
still
,
devotedlyas
ever
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
in
my
power
yesterday
,
and
without
your
aid
,
cardinal
,
I
could
have
wreaked
my
vengeance
upon
her
,
if
I
had
been
sominded
.
<EOS>
""You
were
then
in
her
chamber
,
as
the
king
suspected
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Wolsey
,
with
a
look
of
exultation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Trouble
yourself
no
more
,
Sir
Thomas
.
 
<EOS>
I
willtake
the
part
of
vengeance
off
your
hands
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
indiscretion
will
avail
you
little
,
cardinal
,
"
replied
Wyat
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
Ahasty
word
proves
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
perish
on
the
rack
sooner
thanaccuse
Anne
Boleyn
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
desperate
man
,
but
<EOS>
not
so
desperate
asyou
suppose
me
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
ago
I
might
have
been
led
on
,
by
themurderous
and
traitorous
impulse
that
prompted
me
,
to
lift
my
handagainst
the
king
,
but
I
never
could
have
injured
her
.
<EOS>
""You
are
a
madman
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wolsey
impatiently
,
"
and
it
is
a
waste
oftime
to
argue
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
speed
on
your
journey
.
 
<EOS>
On
yourreturn
you
will
find
Anne
Boleyn
Queen
of
England
.
<EOS>
""And
you
disgraced
,
"
rejoined
Wyat
,
as
,
with
a
malignant
and
vindictivelook
,
the
cardinal
quitted
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
Again
left
alone
,
Wyat
fell
into
another
fit
of
despondency
from
which
heroused
himself
with
difficulty
,
and
went
forth
to
visit
the
Earl
of
Surreyin
the
Round
Tower
.
<EOS>
Some
delay
occurred
before
he
could
obtain
access
to
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
Thehalberdier
stationed
at
the
entrance
to
the
keep
near
the
NormanTower
<EOS>
refused
to
admit
him
without
the
order
of
the
officer
in
commandof
the
tower
,
and
as
the
latter
was
not
in
the
way
at
the
moment
,
Wyathad
to
remain
without
till
he
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
While
thus
detained
,
he
beheld
Anne
Boleyn
and
her
royal
lover
mounttheir
steeds
in
the
upper
ward
,
and
ride
forth
,
with
their
attendants
,
ona
hawking
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
Anne
Boleyn
bore
a
beautiful
falcon
on
herwrist
--
Wyat
's
own
gift
to
her
in
happier
days
--
and
looked
full
of
coquetry
,
animation
,
and
delight
--
without
the
vestige
of
a
cloud
upon
her
brow
,
ora
care
on
her
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
With
increased
bitterness
of
heart
,
heturned
from
the
sight
,
and
shrouded
himself
beneath
the
gateway
of
theNorman
Tower
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
the
officer
appeared
,
and
at
once
according
Wyatpermission
to
see
the
earl
,
preceded
him
up
the
long
flight
of
stonesteps
communicating
with
the
upper
part
of
the
keep
,
and
screened
byan
embattled
and
turreted
structure
,
constituting
a
covered
way
to
theRound
Tower
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
landing
,
the
officer
unlocked
a
door
on
the
left
,
andushered
his
companion
into
the
prisoner
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
Influenced
by
the
circular
shape
of
the
structure
in
which
it
wassituated
,
and
of
which
it
formed
a
segment
,
the
farther
part
of
thischamber
was
almost
lost
to
view
,
and
a
number
of
cross
-
beams
andwooden
pillars
added
to
its
sombre
and
mysterious
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Thewalls
were
of
enormous
thickness
,
and
a
narrow
loophole
,
terminatinga
deep
embrasure
,
afforded
but
scanty
light
.
 
<EOS>
Opposite
the
embrasuresat
Surrey
,
at
a
small
table
covered
with
books
and
writing
materials
.
 
<EOS>
Alute
lay
beside
him
on
the
floor
,
and
there
were
several
astrological
andalchemical
implements
within
reach
.
<EOS>
So
immersed
was
the
youthful
prisoner
in
study
,
that
he
was
not
aware
,
until
a
slight
exclamation
was
uttered
by
Wyat
,
of
the
entrance
of
thelatter
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
arose
,
and
gave
him
welcome
.
<EOS>
Nothing
material
passed
between
them
as
long
as
the
officer
remainedin
the
chamber
,
but
on
his
departure
Surrey
observed
laughingly
to
hisfriend
,
"
And
how
doth
my
fair
cousin
,
the
Lady
Anne
Boleyn?""She
has
just
ridden
forth
with
the
king
,
to
hawk
in
the
park
,
"
repliedWyat
moodily
.
"
<EOS>
For
myself
,
l
am
ordered
on
a
mission
to
France
,
but
Icould
not
depart
without
entreating
your
forgiveness
for
the
jeopardy
inwhich
I
have
placed
you
.
 
<EOS>
Would
I
could
take
your
place
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
heed
me
,
"
replied
Surrey
;
"
I
am
well
content
with
what
hashappened
.
 
<EOS>
Virgil
and
Homer
,
Dante
and
Petrarch
,
are
the
companionsof
my
confinement
;
and
in
good
sooth
,
I
am
glad
to
be
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Amid
thedistractions
of
the
court
I
could
find
little
leisure
for
the
muse
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
situation
is
,
in
many
respects
,
enviable
,
Surrey
,
"
replied
Wyat
.
"Disturbed
<EOS>
by
no
jealous
doubts
and
fears
,
you
can
beguile
the
tedioushours
in
the
cultivation
of
your
poetical
tastes
,
or
in
study
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
I
mustneeds
reproach
myself
with
being
the
cause
of
your
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
""I
repeat
,
you
have
done
me
a
service
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"I
would
laydown
my
life
for
my
fair
cousin
,
Anne
Boleyn
,
and
I
am
glad
to
be
able
<EOS>
toprove
the
sincerity
of
my
regard
for
you
,
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
I
applaud
the
king'sjudgment
in
sending
you
to
France
,
and
if
you
will
be
counselled
by
me
,
you
will
stay
there
long
enough
to
forget
her
who
now
occasions
you
somuch
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
the
Fair
Geraldine
be
forgotten
when
the
term
of
yourimprisonment
shall
expire
,
my
lord
?
"
asked
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"Of
<EOS>
a
surety
not
,
"
replied
the
earl
.
"And
<EOS>
yet
,
in
less
than
two
months
I
shall
return
from
France
,
"
rejoinedWyat
.
<EOS>
"Our
<EOS>
cases
are
not
alike
,
"
said
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Lady
Elizabeth
Fitzgeraldhas
plighted
her
troth
to
me
.
<EOS>
""Anne
<EOS>
Boleyn
vowed
eternal
constancy
to
me
,
"
cried
Wyat
bitterly
;
<EOS>
"
andyou
see
how
she
kept
her
oath
.
 
<EOS>
The
absent
are
always
in
danger
;
andfew
women
are
proof
against
ambition
.
<EOS>
Vanity
--
vanity
is
the
rock
theysplit
upon
.
 
<EOS>
May
you
never
experience
from
Richmond
the
wrong
I
haveexperienced
from
his
father
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
fear
,
"
replied
Surrey
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
there
was
a
slight
noise
in
that
part
of
the
chamber
whichwas
buried
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
we
a
listener
here
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Wyat
,
grasping
his
sword
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
unless
it
be
a
four
-
legged
one
from
the
dungeons
beneath
,
"
repliedSurrey
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
were
speaking
of
Richmond
.
 
<EOS>
He
visited
me
thismorning
,
and
came
to
relate
the
particulars
of
a
mysterious
adventurethat
occurred
to
him
last
night
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
the
earl
proceeded
to
detail
what
had
befallen
the
duke
in
theforest
.
<EOS>
"A
marvellous
story
,
truly
!
"
said
Wyat
,
pondering
upon
the
relation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Iwill
seek
out
the
demon
huntsman
myself
.
"Again
<EOS>
a
noise
similar
to
<EOS>
that
heard
a
moment
before
resounded
from
thelower
part
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
Wyat
immediately
flew
thither
,
and
drawing
hissword
,
searched
about
with
its
point
,
but
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
"It
could
not
be
fancy
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
yet
nothing
is
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
like
jesting
about
Herne
the
Hunter
,
"
remarked
Surrey
,
"
afterwhat
I
myself
have
seen
.
 
<EOS>
In
your
present
frame
of
mind
<EOS>
I
advise
you
notto
hazard
an
interview
with
the
fiend
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
power
over
thedesperate
.
<EOS>
"Wyat
returned
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
lost
in
gloomy
thought
,
and
soonafterwards
took
his
leave
.
<EOS>
On
returning
to
his
lodgings
,
he
summoned
his
attendants
,
and
orderedthem
to
proceed
to
Kingston
,
adding
that
he
would
join
them
thereearly
the
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
an
old
serving
-
man
,
noticing
theexceeding
haggardness
of
his
looks
,
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
togo
with
them
;
but
Wyat
,
with
a
harshness
totally
unlike
his
customarymanner
,
which
was
gracious
and
kindly
in
the
extreme
,
peremptorilyrefused
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
look
very
ill
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
said
the
old
servant
;
"
worse
than
I
everremember
seeing
you
.
 
<EOS>
Listen
to
my
counsel
,
I
beseech
you
.
 
<EOS>
Plead
illhealth
with
the
king
in
excuse
of
your
mission
to
France
,
and
retire
forsome
months
to
recruit
your

at
Allington

<EOS>
""Tush
,
Adam
Twisden
!
<EOS>
I
am

"
exclaimed
Wyat
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"Go
and
prepare
my
mails
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
dear
,
dear
master

"
cried
old
Adam
,
bending
the
knee
before
him
,
and
pressing
his
hand
to
his
lips
;
"
something
tells
me
that
if
I
leave
younow
I
shall
never
see
you
again

<EOS>
There
is
a
paleness
in

anda
fire
in
your
eye

such
as
I
never
before
observed
in
you

or
in

<EOS>
I
tremble
to
say
it

but
you
look
like
one
possessed
by
the
fiend

Forgive
my
boldness

I
speak
from
affection

I

I
honour
you

<EOS>
I
have
heard
that
thereare
evil

nay

even
within

who
lure

""Make

replied
Wyat
;
"
no

<EOS>
""Swear
<EOS>
it

cried
the
old
man
eagerly--

""By

Wyat

<EOS>
As
the
words
were
uttered
,
the
door
behind
the
arras
was
suddenlyshut
with
violence

<EOS>
"Curses

cried
Wyat
fiercely

"Our

"
<EOS>
"
I
will
soon
see

"
cried
Adam
,
springing
to
his
feet
,
andrushing
towards
the
door
,
which
opened
upon
a
long
corridor
.
<EOS>
"Well
!
"
cried
Wyat
,
as
Adam
returned
the
next
moment
,
with
cheeksalmost

I

""It

<EOS>
replied
Wyat
,
affecting
an
incredulity
he
was
far
from
feeling
.
<EOS>
"Your

strangely

crossing

devoutly

added
,
giving
him
Henry

"

<EOS>
""I
hope
your

not
about

the
forest

hour?"said
Adam
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
told
by
the
stout
archer
,
whom
the
kingdubbed
Duke
of
Shoreditch
,
that
he
and
the
Duke
of

venturedthither
last

that
they
saw
a

mounted

amongst

Mark

the

a

Curfew
Tower
by

strangely
disappeared

<EOS>
Do
not

forest

dear
Sir
Thomas!""No

<EOS>
cried
Wyat
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
Do

I

you
,
and
if
I
join
younot
before

there

<EOS>
"I
never
expect
to
see
you
again
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
the
old
man
,
as
he
tookhis
leave
.
<EOS>
The
anxious
concern
evinced
in
his
behalf
by
his
old
and
trusty
servantwas
not
without
effect
on
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
and
made
him
hesitate
inhis
design
;
but
by
-
and
-
by
another
access
of
jealous
rage
came
on
,
andoverwhelmed
all
his
better
resolutions
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
within
hischamber
to
a
late
hour
,
and
then
issuing
forth
,
proceeded
to
the
terraceat
the
north
of
the
castle
,
where
he
was
challenged
by
a
sentinel
,
butwas
suffered
to
pass
on
,
on
giving
the
watch
-
word
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
profoundly
dark
,
and
the
whole
of
the
glorious
prospectcommanded
by
the
terrace
shrouded
from
view
.
 
<EOS>
But
Wyat
's
object
incoming
thither
was
to
gaze
,
for
the
last
time
,
at
that
part
of
the
castlewhich
enclosed
Anne
Boleyn
,
and
knowing
well
the
situation
of
herapartments
,
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
windows
;
but
althoughnumerous
lights
streamed
from
the
adjoining
corridor
,
all
here
wasburied
in
obscurity
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
however
,
the
chamber
was
illumined
,
and
he
beheld
Henryand
Anne
Boleyn
enter
it
,
preceded
by
a
band
of
attendants
bearingtapers
.
 
<EOS>
It
needed
not
Wyat
's
jealousy
-
sharpened
gaze
to
read
,
even
atthat
distance
,
the
king
's
enamoured
looks
,
or
Anne
Boleyn
's
responsiveglances
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
that
one
of
Henry
's
arms
encircled
her
waist
,
whilethe
other
caressed
her
yielding
hand
.
 
<EOS>
They
paused
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
bentforward
,
and
Anne
half
averted
her
head
,
but
not
so
much
so
as
toprevent
<EOS>
the
king
from
imprinting
a
long
and
fervid
kiss
upon
her
lips
.
<EOS>
Terrible
was
its
effect
upon
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
An
adder
's
bite
would
have
been
lesspainful
.
 
<EOS>
His
hands
convulsively
clutched
together
;
his
hair
stood
erectupon
his
head
;
a
shiver
ran
through
his
frame
;
and
he
tottered
backseveral
paces
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
recovered
,
Henry
had
bidden
good
-
night
to
theobject
of
his
love
,
and
,
having
nearly
gained
the
door
,
turned
and
waveda
tender
valediction
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
Anne
lookedround
with
a
smile
of
ineffable
pride
and
pleasure
at
her
attendants
,
buta
cloud
of
curtains
dropping
over
the
window
shrouded
her
from
thesight
of
her
wretched
lover
.
<EOS>
In
a
state
of
agitation
wholly
indescribable
,
Wyat
staggered
towardsthe
edge
of
the
terrace
--
it
might
be
with
the
design
of
flinging
himselffrom
it
--
but
when
within
a
few
yards
of
the
low
parapet
wall
defendingits
precipitous
side
,
he
perceived
a
tall
dark
figure
standing
directly
inhis
path
,
and
halted
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
object
he
beheld
was
human
or
nothe
could
not
determine
,
but
it
seemed
of
more
than
mortal
stature
.
 
<EOS>
Itwas
wrapped
in
a
long
black
cloak
,
and
wore
a
high
conical
cap
on
itshead
.
 
<EOS>
Before
Wyat
could
speak
the
figure
addressed
him
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
desire
to
see
Herne
the
Hunter
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
figure
,
in
a
deep
,
sepulchral
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ride
hence
to
the
haunted
beechtree
near
the
marsh
,
at
the
farther
side
of
the
forest
,
and
you
will
find
him
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
are
Herne
<EOS>
--
I
feel
it
,
"
cried
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
go
into
the
forest
?
<EOS>
Speaknow
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
stepped
forward
with
the
intention
of
grasping
the
figure
,
but
iteluded
him
,
and
,
with
a
mocking
laugh
,
melted
into
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
Wyat
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
terrace
and
looked
over
the
parapet
,
but
he
could
see
nothing
except
the
tops
of
the
tall
trees
springing
fromthe
side
of
the
moat
.
 
<EOS>
Flying
to
the
sentinel
,
he
inquired
whether
anyone
had
passed
him
,
but
the
man
returned
an
angry
denial
.
<EOS>
Awestricken
and
agitated
,
Wyat
quitted
the
terrace
,
and
,
seeking
hissteed
,
mounted
him
,
and
galloped
into
the
forest
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
he
I
have
seen
be
not
indeed
the
fiend
,
he
will
scarcely
outstrip
mein
the
race
,
"
he
cried
,
as
his
steed
bore
him
at
a
furious
pace
up
thelong
avenue
.
<EOS>
The
gloom
was
here
profound
,
being
increased
by
the
dense
masses
offoliage
beneath
which
he
was
riding
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
time
,
however
,
that
hereached
the
summit
of
Snow
Hill
the
moon
struggled
through
theclouds
,
and
threw
a
wan
glimmer
over
the
leafy
wilderness
around
.
 
<EOS>
Thedeep
slumber
of
the
woods
was
unbroken
by
any
sound
save
that
of
thefrenzied
rider
bursting
through
them
.
<EOS>
Well
acquainted
with
the
forest
,
Wyat
held
on
a
direct
course
.
 
<EOS>
His
brainwas
on
fire
,
and
the
fury
of
his
career
increased
his
fearful
excitement
.
<EOS>
Heedless
of
all
impediments
,
he
pressed
forward
--
now
dashing
beneathoverhanging
boughs
at
the
risk
of
his
neck
--
now
skirting
the
edge
of
aglen
where
a
false
step
might
have
proved
fatal
.
<EOS>
On
--
on
he
went
,
his
frenzy
increasing
each
moment
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
reached
the
woody
height
overlooking
the
marshy
tractthat
formed
the
limit
of
his
ride
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
the
moon
had
withdrawnher
lustre
,
and
a
huge
indistinct
black
mass
alone
pointed
out
theposition
of
the
haunted
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Around
it
wheeled
a
large
white
owl
,
distinguishable
by
its
ghostly
plumage
through
the
gloom
,
like
a
sea
-
bird
in
a
storm
,
and
hooting
bodingly
as
it
winged
its
mystic
flight
.
 
<EOS>
Noother
sound
was
heard
,
nor
living
object
seen
.
<EOS>
While
gazing
into
the
dreary
expanse
beneath
him
,
Wyat
for
the
firsttime
since
starting
experienced
a
sensation
of
doubt
and
dread
;
andthe
warning
of
his
old
and
faithful
attendant
rushed
upon
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Hetried
to
recite
a
prayer
,
but
the
words
died
away
on
his
lips
--
neitherwould
<EOS>
his
fingers
fashion
the
symbol
of
a
cross
.
<EOS>
But
even
these
admonitions
did
not
restrain
him
.
 
<EOS>
Springing
from
hisfoaming
and
panting
steed
,
and
taking
the
bridle
in
his
hand
,
hedescended
the
side
of
the
acclivity
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
and
anon
a
rustling
amongthe
grass
told
him
that
a
snake
,
with
which
description
of
reptile
thespot
abounded
,
was
gliding
away
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
horse
,
which
hadhitherto
been
all
fire
and
impetuosity
,
now
began
to
manifest
symptomsof
alarm
,
quivered
in
every
limb
,
snorted
,
and
required
to
be
draggedalong
forcibly
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
few
paces
of
the
tree
,
its
enormous
rifted
trunk
becamefully
revealed
to
him
;
but
no
one
was
beside
it
.
 
<EOS>
Wyat
then
stood
still
,
and
cried
in
a
loud
,
commanding
tone
,
<EOS>
"
Spirit
,
I
summon
thee!--appear!"At
<EOS>
these
words
a
sound
like
a
peal
of
thunder
rolled
over
head
,
accompanied
by
screeches
of
discordant
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
Other
strange
andunearthly
noises
were
heard
,
and
amidst
the
din
a
blue
phosphoric
lightissued
from
the
yawning
crevice
in
the
tree
,
while
a
tall
,
gaunt
figure
,
crested
with
an
antlered
helm
,
sprang
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
aswarm
of
horribly
grotesque
,
swart
objects
,
looking
like
imps
,
appearedamid
the
branches
of
the
tree
,
and
grinned
and
gesticulated
at
Wyat
,
whose
courage
remained
unshaken
during
the
fearful
ordeal
.
 
<EOS>
Not
sohis

.
 
<EOS>
After
rearing
and
plunging
violently
,
the
affrighted
animalbroke
its
hold
and
darted
off
into
the
swamp
,
where
it
floundered
andwas
lost
.
<EOS>
"You
have
called
me
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
"
said
the
demon
,
in
a
sepulchraltone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
you?""My
name
being
known
to
you
,
spirit
of
darkness
,
my
errand
should
bealso
,
"
replied
Wyat
boldly
.
<EOS>
"Your
errand
is
known
to
me
,
"
replied
the
demon
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
lost
amistress
,
and
would
regain
her?""I
would
give
my
soul
to
win
her
back
from
my
kingly
rival

"
cried
Wyat
.
<EOS>
I
accept
your

"
rejoined
the
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anne
Boleyn
shall
be
yours
.
<EOS>
Your
hand
upon
the
compact
.
<EOS>
"Wyat
stretched
forth
his
hand
,
and
grasped
that
of
the
demon
.
<EOS>
His
fingers
were
compressed
as
if
by
a
vice
,
and
he
felt
himself
draggedtowards
the
tree
,
while
a
stifling
and
sulphurous
vapour
rose
aroundhim
.
 
<EOS>
A
black
veil
fell
over
his
head
,
and
was
rapidly
twined
around
hisbrow
in
thick
folds
.
<EOS>
Amid
yells
of
fiendish
laughter
he
was
then
lifted
from
the
ground
,
thrust
into
the
hollow
of
the
tree
,
and
thence
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
conveyed
into
a
deep
subterranean
cave

In
what
manner
Wolsey
put
his
Scheme
into
Operation
.
<EOS>
Foiled
in
his
scheme
of
making
Wyat
the
instrument
of
Anne
Boleyn'soverthrow
,
Wolsey
determined
to
put
into
immediate
operation
the
planhe
had
conceived
of
bringing
forward
a
rival
to
her
with
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
If
achoice
had
been
allowed
him
,
he
would
have
selected
some
high
-
borndame
for
the
purpose
;
but
as
this
was
out
of
the
question
-
and
as
,
indeed
,
Henry
had
of
late
proved
insensible
to
the
attractions
of
all
thebeauties
that
crowded
his
court
except
Anne
Boleyn
-
he
trusted
to
theforester
's
fair
granddaughter
to
accomplish
his
object
.
 
<EOS>
The
sourcewhence
he
had
received
intelligence
of
the
king
's
admiration
of
MabelLyndwood
was
his
jester
,
Patch
-
a
shrewd
varlet
who
,
under
the
maskof
folly
,
picked
up
many
an
important
secret
for
his
master
,
and
wasproportionately
rewarded
.
<EOS>
Before
executing
the
scheme
,
it
was
necessary
to
ascertain
whetherthe
damsel
's
beauty
was
as
extraordinary
as
it
had
been
represented;and
<EOS>
with
this
view
,
Wolsey
mounted
his
mule
one
morning
,
and
,
accompanied
by
Patch
and
another
attendant
,
rode
towards
the
forest
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
bright
and
beautiful
morning
,
and
preoccupied
as
he
was
,
theplotting
cardinal
could
not
be
wholly
insensible
to
the
loveliness
of
thescene
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
Crossing
Spring
Hill
,
he
paused
at
the
head
of
a
longglade
,
skirted
on
the
right
by
noble
beech
-
trees
whose
silver
stemssparkled
in
the
sun
shine
,
and
extending
down
to
the
thicket
nowcalled
Cooke
's
Hill
Wood
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
point
,
as
from
every
othereminence
on
the
northern
side
of
the
forest
,
a
magnificent
view
of
thecastle
was
obtained
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
the
kingly
pile
,
towering
above
its
vassal
woods
,
kindledhigh
and
ambitious
thoughts
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
lord
of
that
proud
structure
has
been
for
years
swayed
by

,

hemused
,

and
shall
the

be

wrested

<EOS>
Not
if
I
can
hold
my
own
.
<EOS>
"Roused
<EOS>
by
the
reflection
,
he
quickened
his
pace
,
and
shaping
hiscourse
towards
Black
Nest
,
reached
in
a
short
time
the
borders
of
awide
swamp
lying
between
the
great
lake
and
another
pool
of
water
ofless
extent
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
.
 
<EOS>
This
wild
and
drearymarsh
,
the
haunt
of
the
bittern
and
the
plover
,
contrasted
forcibly
anddisagreeably
with
the
rich
sylvan
district
he
had
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
"I
should
not
like
to
cross
this
swamp
at

"
he
observed
to
Patch
,
who
rode
close
behind
him
.
<EOS>
"Nor

I

replied
the
buffoon

Iwas
crouching
among

to
get
a
shot
at
a
fat
buck

called
me
to

<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
St.

this

the

your

cried
Patch

<EOS>
"And

rejoined

<EOS>
"
Artsure

knave?""As
sure

your

replied
Patch

"
That

have
brought
you
a
rich
reward

either
from

"
remarked
Wolsey
to
the
keeper
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
has
brought
me
nothing
,
"
rejoined
Fenwolf
sullenly
.
"Hum
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
cardinal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
the
fellow
a
piece
of
gold
,
Patch
.
<EOS>
""Methinks
I
should
have
better
earned
your

's
bounty
<EOS>
if
I
had
letthe
hart

"
said
Fenwolf
,
reluctantly
receiving
the
coin
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
,
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
cardinal
,
knitting
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
I
mean
no
offence
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
;
"
but
the
rumour
goes
<EOS>
thatyour
grace
and
the
Lady
Anne
are
not
well
affected
towards
eachother
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
rumour
is
false
,
"
rejoined
the
cardinal
,
"
and
you
can
nowcontradict
it
on
your
own
experience
.
 
<EOS>
Harkee
,
sirrah
!
<EOS>
where
liesTristram
Lyndwood
's
hut?"Fenwolf
looked
somewhat
surprised
and
confused
by
the
question
.
<EOS>
"It
lies
on
the
other
side
of
yonder
rising
ground
,
about
half
a
milehence
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
your
grace
is
seeking
old
Tristram
,
you
will
notfind
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
parted
with
him
,
half
-
an
-
hour
ago
,
on
Hawk
's
Hill
,
and
he
wasthen
on
his
way
to
the
deer
-
pen
at
Bray
Wood
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
see
his
granddaughter
Mabel
,
it
will
suffice
,
"
rejoined
the
cardinal
.
<EOS>
"I
am
told
she
is
a
comely
damsel
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
so?""I
am
but
an
indifferent
judge
of
beauty
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
moodily
.
<EOS>
"Lead
<EOS>
my
mule
across
this
swamp
,
thou
senseless
loon
,
"
said
thecardinal
,
"
and
I
will
give
thee
my
blessing
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
a
very
ill
grace
Fenwolf
complied
,
and
conducted
Wolsey
to
thefarther
side
of
the
marsh
.
<EOS>
If
your
grace
pursues
the
path
over
the
hill
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
then
strikesinto
the
first
opening
on
the
right
,
it
will
bring
you
to
the
place
youseek
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
without
waiting
for
the
promised
blessing
,
he
disappearedamong
the
trees
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
top
of
the
hill
,
Wolsey
descried
the
hut
through
anopening
in
the
trees
at
a
few
hundred
yards
'
distance
.
 
<EOS>
It
waspleasantly
situated
on
the
brink
of
the
lake
,
at
the
point
where
its
widthwas
greatest
,
and
where
it
was
fed
by
a
brook
that
flowed
into
it
from
alarge
pool
of
water
near
Sunninghill
.
<EOS>
From
the
high
ground
where
Wolsey
now
stood
the
view
of
the
lake
wasbeautiful
.
 
<EOS>
For
nearly
a
mile
its
shining
expanse
was
seen
stretching
outbetween
banks
of
varied
form
,
sometimes
embayed
,
sometimes
runningout
into
little
headlands
,
but
everywhere
clothed
with
timber
<EOS>
almost
tothe
water
's
edge
.
 
<EOS>
Wild
fowl
skimmed
over
its
glassy
surface
,
or
dippedin
search
of
its
finny
prey
,
and
here
and
there
a
heron
might
bedetected
standing
in
some
shallow
nook
,
and
feasting
on
the
smallerfry
.
 
<EOS>
A
flight
of
cawing
rooks
were
settling
upon
the
tall
trees
on
theright
bank
,
and
the
voices
of
the
thrush
,
the
blackbird
,
and
otherfeathered
songsters
burst
in
redundant
melody
from
the
nearer
groves
.
<EOS>
A
verdant
path
,
partly
beneath
the
trees
,
and
partly
on
the
side
of
thelake
,
led
Wolsey
to
the
forester
's
hut
.
 
<EOS>
Constructed
of
wood
and
clay
,
with
a
thatched
roof
,
green
with
moss
,
and
half
overgrown
with
ivy
,
thelittle
building
was
in
admirable
keeping
with
the
surrounding
scenery
.
<EOS>
Opposite
the
door
,
and
opening
upon
the
lake
,
stood
a
little
boathouse
,
and
beside
it
a
few
wooden
steps
,
defended
by
a
handrail
,
ran
into
thewater
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
yards
beyond
the
boathouse
<EOS>
the
brook
before
mentionedemptied
its
waters
into
the
lake
.
<EOS>
Gazing
with
much
internal
satisfaction
at
the
hut
,
Wolsey
bade
Patchdismount
,
and
ascertain
whether
Mabel
was
within
.
 
<EOS>
The
buffoonobeyed
,
tried
the
door
,
and
finding
it
fastened
,
knocked
,
but
to
nopurpose
.
<EOS>
After
a
pause
of
a
few
minutes
,
the
cardinal
was
turning
away
inextreme
disappointment
,
when
a
small
skiff
,
rowed
by
a
female
hand
,
shot
round
an
angle
of
the
lake
and
swiftly
approached
them
.
 
<EOS>
A
glancefrom
Patch
would
have
told
Wolsey
,
had
he
required
any
suchinformation
,
that
this
was
the
forester
's
granddaughter
.
 
<EOS>
Her
beautyquite
ravished
him
,
and
drew
from
him
an
exclamation
of
wonder
anddelight
.
 
<EOS>
Features
regular
,
exquisitely
moulded
,
and
of
a
joyousexpression
,
a
skin
dyed
like
a
peach
by
the
sun
,
but
so
as
to
improverather
than
impair
its
hue
;
eyes
bright
,
laughing
,
and
blue
as
a
summersky
;
ripe
,
ruddy
lips
,
and
pearly
teeth
;
and
hair
of
a
light
and
glossybrown
,
constituted
the
sum
of
her
attractions
.
 
<EOS>
Her
sylph
-
like
figure
wascharmingly
displayed
by
the
graceful
exercise
on
which
she
wasengaged
,
and
her
small
hands
,
seemingly
scarcely
able
to
grasp
an
oar
,
impelled
the
skiff
forwards
with
marvellous
velocity
,
and
apparentlywithout
much
exertion
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
Unabashed
by
the
presence
of
the
strangers
,
though
Wolsey
's
attirecould
leave
her
in
no
doubt
as
to
his
high
ecclesiastical
dignity
,
shesprang
ashore
at
the
landing
-
place
,
and
fastened
her
bark
to
the
side
ofthe
boathouse
.
<EOS>
"You
are
Mabel
Lyndwood
,
I
presume
,
fair
maiden
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
thecardinal
,
in
his
blandest
tones
.
<EOS>
"Such
is
my
name
,
your
grace
,
"
she
replied
;
"
for
your
garb
tells
me
I
amaddressing
Cardinal
Wolsey
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
cardinal
graciously
inclined
his
head
.
<EOS>
"Chancing
<EOS>
to
ride
in
this
part
of
the
forest
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
having
heardof
your
beauty
,
I
came
to
see
whether
the
reality
equalled
thedescription
,
and
I
find
it
far
transcends
it
.
<EOS>
"Mabel
<EOS>
blushed
deeply
,
and
cast
down
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"Would
<EOS>
that
Henry
could
see
her
now
!
<EOS>
"
thought
the
cardinal
,
"
AnneBoleyn
's
reign
were
nigh
at
an
end.--How
long
<EOS>
have
you
dwelt
in
thiscottage
,
fair
maid
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
aloud
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
grandsire
,
Tristram
Lyndwood
,
has
lived
here
fifty
years
and
more,"replied
Mabel
,
"
but
I
have
only
been
its
inmate
within
these
few
weeks
.
<EOS>
Before
that
time
I
lived
at
Chertsey
,
under
the
care
of
one
of
the
laysisters
of
the
monastery
there
--
Sister
Anastasia
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
your
parents
--
where
are
they
?
"
asked
the
cardinal
curiously
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
your
grace
,
I
have
none
,
"
replied
Mabel
with
a
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
TristramLyndwood
is
my
only
living
relative
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
to
come
over
once
amonth
to
see
me
at
Chertsey
--
and
latterly
,
finding
his
dwelling
lonely
,
for
he
lost
the
old
dame
who
tended
it
for
him
<EOS>
,
he
brought
me
to
dwellwith
him
.
 
<EOS>
Sister
Anastasia
was
loth
to
part
with
me
--
and
I
was
grievedto
leave
her
--
but
I
could
not
refuse
my
grandsire
.
<EOS>
""Of
<EOS>
a
surety
not
,
"
replied
the
cardinal
musingly
,
and
gazing
hard
at
her
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
know
nothing
of
your
parents?""Little
beyond
this
,
"
replied
Mabel:-
<EOS>
"
My
father
was
a
keeper
of
theforest
,
and
being
unhappily
gored
by
a
stag
,
perished
of
the
wound
--
fora
hurt
from
a
hart
's
horn
,
as
your
grace
knows
,
is
certain
death
;
and
mymother
pined
after
him
and
speedily
followed
him
to
the
grave
.
 
<EOS>
I
wasthen
placed
by
my
grandsire
with
Sister
Anastasia
,
as
I
have
justrelated
--
and
this
is
all
my
history
.
<EOS>
""A
simple
yet
a
curious
one
,
"
said
Wolsey
,
still
musing
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
thefairest
maid
of
low
degree

<EOS>
You
saw

chasethe
other

Mabel?""Truly
,
did
I
,
your

she
replied
,
her
eyes
brightening

hercolour
rising
;
"
and
a
right
noble
king
he
is
.
""And
<EOS>
as
gentle
and
winning
as
he
is
goodly
to
look
upon

said
Wolsey
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"Report
<EOS>
says
otherwise
,
"
rejoined
Mabel
.
<EOS>
"Report
<EOS>
speaks
falsely
,
"
cried
Wolsey
;
"
I
know
him
well
,
and
he
is
what
Idescribe
him
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Mabel
;
"
and
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
formed
the
sameopinion
myself
--
for
the
smile
he
threw
upon
me
<EOS>
was
one
of
the
sweetestand
kindliest
I
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
""Since
you
confess
so
much
,
fair
maiden
,
"
rejoined
Wolsey
,
"
I
will
beequally
frank
,
and
tell
you
it
was
from
the
king

own
lips
I
heard
of
yourbeauty
.
<EOS>
""Your
grace
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well

"
said
Wolsey
,
smiling
,
"
if
the
king
is
bewitched
,
I
cannotmarvel
at
it

<EOS>
And
now
,
good
day
,
fair
maiden

you
will
hear
more
of
me
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
grace
will
not
refuse
me
your
blessing

"
said
Mabel
.
<EOS>
"Assuredly
<EOS>
not
,
my
child
,
"
replied
Wolsey
,
stretching
his
hands
over
her
.
"All
<EOS>
good
angels
and
saints
bless
you
,
and
hold
you
in
their
keeping

<EOS>
Mark
my
words
:
a
great
destiny
awaits
you
;
but
in
all
changes
,
restassured
you
will
find
a
friend
in
Cardinal
Wolsey
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
grace
overwhelms
me
with
kindness
,
"
cried
Mabel
;
nor
can
Iconceive
how
I
have
found
an
interest
in
your
eyes
--
unless
SisterAnastasia
or
Father
Anslem
,
of
Chertsey
Abbey
,
may
have
mentionedme
to
you
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
found
a
more
potent
advocate
with
me
than
either
SisterAnastasia
or
Father
Anselm
,
"
replied
Wolsey
;
"
and
now
,
farewell
.
"And
<EOS>
turning
the
head
of
his
mule
,
he
rode
slowly
away
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
day
there
was
a
great
banquet
in
the
castle
,
and
,
as
usual
,
Wolsey
took
his
station
on
the
right
of
the
sovereign
,
while
the
papallegate
occupied
a
place
on
the
left
.
 
<EOS>
Watching
a
favourable
opportunity
,
Wolsey
observed
to
Henry
that
he
had
been
riding
that
morning
in
theforest
,
and
had
seen
the
loveliest
damsel
that
eyes
ever
fell
upon
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
by
our
Lady
!
<EOS>
and
who
may
she
be
?
"
asked
the
king
curiously
.
<EOS>
"She
can
boast
little
in
regard
to
birth
,
being
grandchild
to
an
oldforester
,
"
replied
Wolsey
;
"
but
your
majesty
saw
her
at
the
huntingparty
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
""Ah
,
now
I
bethink
me
of
her
,
"
said
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
comely
damsel
,
in
goodsooth
.
<EOS>
""I
know
not
where
her
match
is
to
be
found
,
"
cried
the
cardinal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wouldyour
majesty
had
seen
her
skim
over
the
lake
in
a
fairy
boat
managedby
herself
,
as
I
beheld
her
this
morning
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
have
taken
her
for
awater
-
sprite
,
except
that
no
water
-
sprite
was
half
so
beautiful
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
speak
in
raptures
,
cardinal
,
"
cried
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
this
damselagain
.
 
<EOS>
Where
does
she
dwell
?
<EOS>
I
have
heard
,
but
it
has
slipped
mymemory
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
a
hut
near
the
great
lake
,
"
replied
Wolsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
mysteryattached
to
her
birth
,
which
I
have
not
yet
fathomed
.
<EOS>
""Leave
me
to
unriddle
it
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
king
laughingly
.
<EOS>
And
he
turned
to
talk
on
other
subjects
to
Campeggio
,
but
Wolsey
feltsatisfied
that
the
device
was
successful
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
mistaken
.
<EOS>
AsHenry
retired
from
the
banquet
,
he
motioned
the
Duke
of
Suffolktowards
him
,
and
said
,
in
an
undertone
-"I
shall
go
forth
at
dusk
to
-
morrow
even
in
disguise
,
and
shall
requireyour
attendance
.
<EOS>
""On
a
love
affair
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
duke
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
Perchance
,
"
replied
Henry
;
"
but
I
will
explain
myself
more
fully
anon
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
muttered
colloquy
was
overheard
by
Patch

faithfully
reportedby

he
shook
his
head
gravely

<EOS>
"I
am
sorry

went

he
observed
.
 
<EOS>
"
ValentineHagthorne
said
mischief
would
come
of

I

<EOS>
"I

Mabel

"
On

<EOS>
The
good

me
a

the

""Would

rejoined
Tristram

"But

you

""I

,
"
she
replied
;
"
nor
did
I
know
I
was
doing
any
harm
.
<EOS>
""Answer
<EOS>
no
such
inquiries
in
future
,
"
said
Tristram
angrily
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
,
grandfather
,
I
could
not
refuse
to
answer
the
cardinal
,
"
shereplied
,
in
a
deprecating
voice
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
more
excuses
,
but
attend
to
my
injunctions
,
"
said
Tristram
.
 
<EOS>
"
Haveyou
seen
Morgan
Fenwolf
to
-
day?""No
;
and
I
care
not
if
I
never
see
him
again
,
"
she
replied
pettishly
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
dislike
him
strangely
,
Mab
,
"
rejoined
her
grandfather
;
"
he
is
thebest
keeper
in
the
forest
,
and
makes
no
secret
of
his
love
for
you
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
very
reason
why
I
dislike
him
<EOS>
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
the
same
rule
,
if
what
the
cardinal
stated
be
true
--
though
,
trust
me
<EOS>
,
he
was
<EOS>
but
jesting
<EOS>
--
you
ought
to
dislike
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
But
get
my
supper
.
 
<EOS>
Ihave
need
of
it
,
for
I
have
fasted
long
.
<EOS>
"Mabel
<EOS>
hastened
to
obey
,
and
set
a
mess
of
hot
pottage
and
otherviands
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
Little
more
conversation
passed
between
them
,
forthe
old
man
was
weary
,
and
sought
his
couch
early
.
<EOS>
That
night
Mabel
did
nothing
but
dream
of
the
king
--
of
statelychambers
,
rich
apparel
,
and
countless
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
She
awoke
,
andfinding
herself
in
a
lowly
cottage
,
and
without
a
single
attendant
,
was
,
like
other
dreamers
of
imaginary
splendour
,
greatly
discontented
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
her
grandsire
went
again
to
Bray
Wood
,
and
she
wasleft
to
muse
upon
the
event
of
the
previous
day
.
 
<EOS>
While
busied
aboutsome
trifling
occupation
,
the
door
suddenly
opened
,
and
MorganFenwolf
entered
the
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
a
tall
man
,
with
acountenance
of
extreme
paleness
,
but
a
noble
and
commanding
figure
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
striking
in
the
appearance
of
the
latter
person
,
that
it
riveted
the
attention
of
Mabel
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
corresponding
effect
wasproduced
on
the
stranger
,
for
he
scarcely
bestowed
a
look
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Morgan
Fenwolf
hastily
asked
whether
her
grandsire
was
at
home
,
ornear
at
hand
,
and
being
answered
in
the
negative
,
appeared
muchdisappointed
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
said
that
he
must
borrow
the
skiff
for
a
shortwhile
,
as
he
wished
to
visit
some
nets
on
the
lake
.
 
<EOS>
Mabel
readilyassented
,
and
the
stranger
quitted
the
house
,
while
Fenwolf
lingered
tooffer
some
attention
to
Mabel
,
which
was
so
ill
received
that
he
wasfain
to
hurry
forth
to
the
boathouse
,
where
he
embarked
with
hiscompanion
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
plash
of
oars
announced
their
departure
,
Mabel
went
forth
to
watch
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
who
was
seated
in
thestern
of
the
boat
,
for
the
first
time
fixed
his
large
melancholy
eyes
fullupon
her
,
and
did
not
withdraw
his
gaze
till
an
angle
of
the
lake
hid
himfrom
view
.
<EOS>
Marvelling
who
he
could
be
,
and
reproaching
herself
for
not
questioningFenwolf
on
the
subject
,
Mabel
resolved
to
repair
the
error
when
theskiff
was
brought
back
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
opportunity
did
not
speedily
occur
.
<EOS>
Hours
flew
by
,
the
shades
of
evening
drew
on
,
but
neither
Fenwolf
northe
stranger
returned
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
dusk
her
grandfather
came
home
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
express
theleast
astonishment
at
Fenwolf
's
prolonged
absence
,
but
said
that
hewas
sure
to
be
back
in
the
course
of
the
evening
,
and
the
skiff
was
notwanted
.
<EOS>
"He
will
bring
us
a
fine
jack
or
a
carp
for
dinner
to
-
morrow
,
I
'll
warrantme
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
had
returned
in
time
we
might
have
had
fish
forsupper
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
make
shift
with
the
mutton
pie
and
a
rasherof
bacon
.
 
<EOS>
Morgan
did
not
mention
the
name
of
his
companion
<EOS>
,
yousay?""He
did
not
,
"
replied
Mabel
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
he
will
bring
him
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
isthe
goodliest
gentleman
I
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
a
goodlier
gentleman
than
the
king
!
"
cried
Tristram
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
they
should
not
be
compared
,
"
replied
Mabel
:
"
the
one
is
stoutand
burly
;
the
other
slight
,
long
-
visaged
,
and
pale
,
but
handsomewithal
--
very
handsome
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
daresay
I
shall
see
him
anon
,
"
said
Tristram
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
forsupper
,
for
I
am
as
sharp
-
set
as
a
wolf
;
and
so
is
old
Hubert
,
"
he
added
,
glancing
affectionately
at
the
hound
by
which
he
was
attended
.
<EOS>
Mabel
placed
the
better
part
of
a
huge
pie
before
him
,
which
the
oldforester
attacked
with
great
zeal
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
fell
to
work
upon
someslices
of
bacon
toasted
over
the
embers
by
his
granddaughter
,
andhaving
washed
them
down
with
a
jug
of
mead
,
declared
he
had
suppedfamously
.
 
<EOS>
While
taking
care
of
himself
,
he
did
not
forget
his
hound
.
<EOS>
From
time
to
time
he
threw
him
morsels
of
the
pie
,
and
when
he
haddone
he
gave
him
a
large
platterful
of
bones
.
<EOS>
"Old
<EOS>
Hubert
has
served
me
faithfully
nigh
twenty
years
,
"
he
said
,
pattingthe
hound
's
shaggy
neck
,
"
and
must
not
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
"Throwing
a
log
of
wood
on
the
fire
,
he
drew
his
chair
into
the
ingle
-
nook
,
and
disposed
himself
to
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mabel
busiedherself
about
her
household
concern
,
and
was
singing
a
lulling
melodyto
her
grandfather
,
in
a
voice
of
exquisite
sweetness
,
when
a
loud
tapwas
heard
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
Tristram
roused
himself
from
his
doze
,
and
oldHubert
growled
menacingly
.
<EOS>
"Quiet
<EOS>
,
Hubert
--
quiet
!
"
cried
Tristram
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be
Morgan
Fenwolf,"he
added
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
would
never
knock
thus
.
<EOS>
Come
in
,
friend
,
whoever
thouart
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
invitation
<EOS>
two
persons
darkened
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
The
foremostwas
a
man
of
bulky
frame
and
burly
demeanour
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
attired
in
abuff
jerkin
,
over
which
he
wore
a
loose
great
surcoat
;
had
a
flat
velvetcap
on
his
head
;
and
carried
a
stout
staff
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
His
face
wasbroad
and
handsome
,
though
his
features
could
scarcely
be
discernedin
the
doubtful
light
to
which
they
were
submitted
.
 
<EOS>
A
reddish
-
colouredbeard
clothed
his
chin
.
 
<EOS>
His
companion
,
who
appeared
a
trifle
the
tallerof
the
two
,
and
equally
robust
,
was
wrapped
in
a
cloak
of
dark
greencamlet
.
<EOS>
"Give
you
good
e'en
,
friend
,
"
said
the
foremost
stranger
to
the
forester
.
<EOS>
"We
are
belated
travellers
,
on
our
way
from
Guildford
to
Windsor
,
and
,
seeing
your
cottage
,
have
called
to
obtain
some
refreshment
before
wecross
the
great
park
.
 
<EOS>
We
do
not
ask
you
to
bestow
a
meal
upon
us
,
butwill
<EOS>
gladly
pay
for
the
best
your
larder
affords

<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
have
it
,
and
welcome
,
my
masters
<EOS>
,
"
replied
<EOS>
Tristram,"but
I
amafraid
my
humble
fare
will
scarcely
suit
you
.
<EOS>
""Fear
nothing
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
we
have
good
appetites

are
notover

<EOS>
Beshrew

""5he

"
replied
Tristram

<EOS>
"Well

said
the
other
;
"
by
the
mass

a

<EOS>
We
have
none
such

I
doubt

the

Windsor
Castle

<EOS>
What
say
you
,
Charles
Brandon?""It
were
treason
to
agree
with
you
,
Harry
La
Roy
,
"
replied
Brandon
,
laughing
,
"
for
they
say
the
king
visits
with
the
halter
<EOS>
all
those
whodisparage
the
charms
of
the
Lady
Anne

<EOS>
But

this

<EOS>
""You
will
discompose
her

my
masters

if
you
praise
her
thus

said
Tristram
somewhat
testily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Mab
,
bring
forth
all
myscanty
larder
affords

and
put
some
rashers
of
bacon
on
the
fire

<EOS>
""Cold
<EOS>
meat

bread
will
suffice
for
us

said
Harry
:
"
we
will
not
troublethe
damsel
to
play
the
cook
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
Mabel
,
who
appeared
a
good
deal
embarrassed
by
thepresence
of
the
strangers
,
spread
a
cloth
of
snow
-
white
linen
on
thelittle
table
,
and
placed
the
remains
of
the
pie
and
a
large
oven

them
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
-
comers
sate
down
,
and
ate
heartily
of
thehumble
viands

he
who
had
answered
to
the
name
of
Harry
frequentlystopping
in
the
course
of
his
repast
to
compliment
his
fair
attendant
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
our
Lady
,
I
have
never
been
so
waited
on

"
he
added
,
risingand
removing
his
stool
towards
the
fire
,
while
his
companion
took
up
aposition
,
with
his
back
against
the
wall
,
near
the
fireplace
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
my
pretty
Mabel
,
have
you
never
a
cup
of
ale
to
wash
down
the

can
offer
you
a
draught
of
right
good
mead

Tristram;"and
<EOS>
that

the
only
liquor

<EOS>
""Nothing

replied
Harry
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
mead
,
by
all
means,"While
Mabel
went
to
draw
the
liquor
,
Tristram
fixed
his
eyes
on
Harry
,
whose
features
were
now
fully
revealed
by
the
light
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
do
you
look
at
me
so
hard
,
friend
?
"
demanded
Harry
bluffly
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
seen
some
one
very
like
you

"
replied
Tristram
,
"
andone
whom
it
is
no
light
honour
to
resemble

<EOS>
""You
mean
the
king

returned
Harry
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
the

me

<EOS>
""You

replied
Tristram
,
joining
inthe
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
say
you
,
Mab
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
his
granddaughter
,
who
atthat
moment
returned
with
a
jug
and
a
couple
of
drinking
-
horns
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whomdoes
this
gentleman
resemble?""No

"
returned
Mabel
,
without
raising
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
one

"
echoed
Harry
,
chucking
her
under
the
chin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Look
me
full
inthe
face

you
will
find
out
your

Marry

<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
that
said
in
good
sooth

"
<EOS>
asked
Mabel
,
slightly
raising
her
eyes

and
instantly
dropping
them
before
the
ardent
gaze
of
the
self

<EOS>
"In

replied
Henry
,
rounding
his
arm

his
hand
on
his
lusty
thigh
in
true
royal
fashion
.
<EOS>
"Were
you
the
royal
Henry

I
should
not

saidMabel
more
confidently

<EOS>
"
My

says
the

""God

Harry

Andwherefore

said
Harry
,
checking
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
It

make

you

Brandon

<EOS>
"
He
is

he
added
,
aside

<EOS>
"You
hear
what
my
friend
says

"
observed
Harry
;
"
and
Iassure
you
<EOS>
he
has
the
best
opportunities

judging

But
I

""She

Tristram

<EOS>
"
But

out
the

"While
<EOS>
Mabel
,
in
compliance
with
her
grandsire
's
directions
,
filled
thehorn
,
the
door
of
the
cottage
was
noiselessly
opened
by
MorganFenwolf
,
who
stepped
in
,
followed
by
Bawsey
.
 
<EOS>
He
stared
inquisitively
atthe
strangers
,
but
both
were
so
much
occupied
by
the
damsel
that
heremained
unnoticed
.
 
<EOS>
A
sign
from
the
old
forester
told
him
he
had
betterretire
:
<EOS>
jealous
curiosity
,
however
,
detained
him
,
and
he
tarried
till
Harryhad
received
the
cup
from
Mabel
,
and
drained
it
to
her
health
.
 
<EOS>
He
thendrew
back
,
closed
the
door
softly
,
and
joined
a
dark
and
mysteriousfigure
,
with
hideous
lineaments
and
an
antlered
helm
upon
its
brows
,
lurking
outside
the
cottage

<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
a
cup
of
mead
having
been
offered
to
Brandon
,
he
observedto
his
companion
,
"
We

Nightis

""I

rejoined
Harry

make
a

<EOS>
How
Herne
the
Hunter
showed
the
Earl
of
Surrey
the
Fair
Geraldine
ina
Vision
.
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
after
Surrey
's
imprisonment
in
the
keep
,
he
wasremoved
to
the
Norman
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
The
chamber
allotted
him
was
square
,
tolerably
lofty
,
and
had
two
narrow
-
pointed
windows
on
either
side
,
looking
on
the
one
hand
into
the
upper
quadrangle
,
and
on
the
otherinto
the
middle
ward
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
permission
was
accorded
himto
take
exercise
on
the
battlements
of
the
Round
Tower
,
or
within
thedry
and
grassy
moat
at
its
foot
.
<EOS>
The
Fair
Geraldine
,
he
was
informed
,
had
been
sent
to
the
royal
palaceat
Greenwich
;
but
her
absence
occasioned
him
little
disquietude
,
because
he
knew
,
if
she
had
remained
at
Windsor
,
he
would
not
havebeen
allowed
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
day
that
Surrey
was
removed
to
the
Norman
Tower
,
theDuke
of
Richmond
quitted
the
castle
without
assigning
any
motive
forhis
departure
,
or
even
taking
leave
of
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
some
jealousmistrust
that
he
might
be
gone
to
renew
his
suit
to
the
Fair
Geraldinetroubled
the
earl
;
but
he
strongly
combated
the
feeling
,
as
calculated
,
ifindulged
,
to
destroy
his
tranquillity
;
and
by
fixing
his
thoughtssedulously
on
other
subjects
,
he
speedily
succeeded
in
overcoming
it
.
<EOS>
On
that
night
,
while
occupied
in
a
translation
of
the
Aeneid
which
hehad
commenced
,
he
remained
at
his
task
till
a
late
hour
.
 
<EOS>
The
midnightbell
had
tolled
,
when
,
looking
up
,
he
was
startled
by
perceiving
a
tallfigure
standing
silent
and
motionless
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Independently
of
the
difficulty
of
accounting
for
its
presence
,
theappearance
of
the
figure
was
in
itself
sufficiently
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
It
wasabove
the
ordinary
stature
,
and
was
enveloped
in
a
long
black
cloak
,
while
a
tall
,
conical
black
cap
,
which
added
to
its
height
,
and
increasedthe
hideousness
of
its
features
,
covered
its
head
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
Surrey
remained
gazing
at
the
figure
in
muteastonishment
,
during
which
it
maintained
the
same
motionless
posture
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
was
able
to
murmur
forth
the
interrogation
,
"
Who
artthou
?
"
<EOS>
"
A
friend
,
"
replied
the
figure
,
in
a
sepulchral
tone
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
a
man
or
spirit
?
"
demanded
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"It
matters
not
<EOS>
--
I
am
a
friend
,
"
rejoined
the
figure
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
what
errand
come
you
here
?
"
asked
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
serve
you
,
"
replied
the
figure
;
"
to
liberate
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
go
hencewith
me
,
if
you
choose
.
<EOS>
""On
<EOS>
what
condition
?
"
rejoined
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"We
will
speak
of
that
when
we
are
out
of
the
castle
,
and
on
the
greensod
of
the
forest
,
"
returned
the
figure
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
tempt
in
vain
,
"
cried
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
go
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
recognise
inyou
the
demon
hunter
Herne
.
<EOS>
"
The
figure
laughed
hollowly
--
so
hollowlythat
Surrey
's
flesh
crept
upon
his
bones
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
lord
of
Surrey
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
am
Herne
the
Hunter
.
 
<EOS>
Youmust
join
me
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
is
already
one
of
my
band
.
<EOS>
""You
lie
,
false
fiend
!
"
rejoined
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
is
in
France
.
<EOS>
"It
is
you
who
lie
,
lord
of
Surrey
,
"
replied
Herne
;
"
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
is
nowin
<EOS>
the
great
park
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
see
him
in
a
few
minutes
,
if
you
will
comewith
me
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
disbelieve
you
,
tempter
!
"
cried
Surrey
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
Wyat
is
too
good
aChristian
,
and
too
worthy
a
knight
,
to
league
with
a
demon
.
"Again
<EOS>
Herne
laughed
bitterly
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
told
you
he
would
seek
me
out
,
"
said
the
demon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hedid
so
,
and
gave
himself
to
me
for
Anne
Boleyn
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
have
no
power
over
her
,
demon
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Surrey
,
shuddering
.
<EOS>
"You
will
learn
whether
I
have
or
not
,
in
due
time
,
"
replied
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Doyou
refuse
to
go
with
me?"I
refuse
to
deliver
myself
to
perdition
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>
idle
fear
,
"
rejoined
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
for
your
soul
--
you
will
destroyit
without
my
aid
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
need
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
be
back
again
in
thischamber
before
the
officer
visits
it
in
the
morning
,
and
no
one
shall
beaware
of
your
absence
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
or
I
will
bear
you
hence
.
<EOS>
""You
dare
not
touch
me
,
"
replied
Surrey
,
placing
his
hand
upon
hisbreast
;
"
I
am
armed
with
a
holy
relic
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
know
it
,
"
said
Herne
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
feel
its
power
,
or
I
would
not
have
trifledwith
you
thus
long
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
can
not
shield
you
from
a
rival
.
 
<EOS>
You
believethe
Fair
Geraldine
constant
--
<EOS>
ha?""I
know
her
to
he
<EOS>
so
,
"
said
Surrey
.
<EOS>
A
derisive
laugh
broke
from
Herne
.
<EOS>
"Peace
,
mocking
fiend
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Surrey
furiously
.
<EOS>
I
laugh
to
think
how
you
are
deceived
,
"
said
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
you
beholdyour
mistress
<EOS>
now?--would
<EOS>
you
see
how
she
conducts
herself
duringyour
<EOS>
absence?""If
you
choose
to
try
me
,
I
will
not
oppose
the
attempt
,
"
replied
Surrey;"but
it
will
be
futile
.
<EOS>
""Remove
<EOS>
the
relic
from
your
person
,
"
rejoined
Herne
.
<EOS>
"
Place
it
upon
thetable
,
within
your
grasp
,
and
you
shall
see
her
.
<EOS>
"Surrey
<EOS>
hesitated
;
but
he
was
not
proof
against
the
low
mocking
laughof
the
demon
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
harm
can
result
from
it
,
"
he
cried
at
length
,
detaching
the
relic
fromhis
neck
,
and
laying
it
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"Extinguish
<EOS>
the
light
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Herne
,
in
a
commanding
voice
.
<EOS>
Surrey
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
dashed
the
lamp
off
the
table
.
"Behold
!
"
cried
the
demon
.
<EOS>
And
instantly
a
vision
,
representing
the
form
and
lineaments
of
the
FairGeraldine
to
the
life
,
shone
forth
against
the
opposite
wall
of
thechamber
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
feet
of
the
visionary
damsel
knelt
a
shape
resemblingthe
Duke
of
Richmond
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
pressing
the
hand
extended
to
him
bythe
Fair
Geraldine
to
his
lips
,
and
a
smile
of
triumph
irradiated
hisfeatures
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
is
man
's
friendship
--
such
woman
's
constancy
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Areyou
now
satisfied?""I
am
,
that
you
have
deceived
me
,
false
spirit
!
"
cried
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
wouldnot
believe
the
Fair
Geraldine
inconstant
,
though
all
hell
told
me
so
.
<EOS>
"A
terrible
laugh
broke
from
the
demon
,
and
the
vision
faded
away
.
<EOS>
Allbecame
perfect
darkness
,
and
for
a
few
moments
the
earl
remainedsilent
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
called
to
the
demon
,
but
receiving
no
answer
,
put
forthhis
hand
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
stood
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Confounded
,
Surrey
returned
to
the
table
,
and
searched
for
the
relic
,
but
,
with
a
feeling
of
indescribable
anguish
and
self
-
reproach
,
foundthat
it
had
likewise
disappeared

<EOS>
What
befell
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
in
the
Sandstone
Cave
--
<EOS>
And
how
hedrank
a
maddening
Potion
.
<EOS>
THE
cave
in
which
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
found
himself
,
on
the
removal
ofthe
bandage
from
his
eyes
,
was
apparently
--
<EOS>
for
it
was
only
lighted
by
asingle
torch
--
of
considerable
width
and
extent
,
and
hewn
out
of
a
bed
ofsoft
sandstone
.
 
<EOS>
The
roof
,
which
might
be
about
ten
feet
high
,
wassupported
by
the
trunks
of
three
large
trees
rudely
fashioned
intopillars
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
several
narrow
lateral
passages
within
it
,
apparently
communicating
with
other
caverns
;
and
at
the
farther
end
,
which
was
almost
buried
in
obscurity
,
there
was
a
gleam
seeminglyoccasioned
by
the
reflection
of
the
torchlight
upon
water
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
righthand
stood
a
pile
of
huge
stones
,
disposed
somewhat
in
the
form
of
aDruidical
altar
,
on
the
top
of
which
,
as
on
a
throne
,
sat
the
demonhunter
,
surrounded
by
his
satellites
--
one
of
whom
,
horned
and
beardedlike
a
satyr
,
<EOS>
had
clambered
the
roughened
sides
of
the
central
pillar
,
and
held
a
torch
over
the
captive
's
head
.
<EOS>
Half
-
stifled
by
the
noxious
vapour
he
had
inhaled
,
and
blinded
by
thetightness
of
the
bandage
,
it
was
some
time
before
Wyat
fully
recoveredhis
powers
of
sight
and
utterance
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
am
<EOS>
I
brought
hither
,
false
fiend
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
at
length
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
join
my
band
,
"
replied
the
demon
harshly
and
imperiously
.
"Never
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
nought
to
do
with
you
,
except
asregards
our
compact
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
I
require
from
you
is
part
of
our
compact
,
"
rejoined
the
demon
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
who
has
once
closed
hands
with
Herne
the
Hunter
can
not
retreat
.
<EOS>
But
I
mean
you
fairly
,
and
will
not
delude
you
with
false
expectation
.
<EOS>
What
you
seek
can
not
he
accomplished
on
the
instant
.
 
<EOS>
Ere
three
<EOS>
daysAnne
Boleyn
shall
be
yours
.
<EOS>
""Give
me
<EOS>
some
proof
that
you
are
not
deceiving
me
,
spirit
,
"
said
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
then
!
"
replied
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
sprang
from
the
stone
,
and
,
taking
Wyat
's
hand
,
led
him
towards
the
lower
end
of
the
cave
,
whichgradually
declined
till
it
reached
the
edge
of
a
small
but
apparentlydeep
pool
of
water
,
the
level
of
which
rose
above
the
rock
that
formedits
boundary
.
"Remove
<EOS>
the
torch
!
"
thundered
the
demon
to
those
behind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nowsummon
your
false
love
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
"
he
added
,
as
his
orderswere
obeyed
,
and
the
light
was
taken
into
one
of
the
side
passages
,
sothat
its
gleam
no
longer
fell
upon
the
water
.
<EOS>
"Appear
,
Anne
Boleyn
!
"
cried
Wyat
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
a
shadowy
resemblance
of
her
he
had
invoked
flitted
over
thesurface
of
the
water
,
with
hands
outstretched
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
movedwas
Wyat
by
the
vision
,
that
he
would
have
flung
himself
into
the
poolto
grasp
it
if
he
had
not
been
forcibly
detained
by
the
demon
.
 
<EOS>
Duringthe
struggle
the
figure
vanished
,
and
all
was
buried
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
"I
have
said
she
shall
be
yours
,
"
cried
Herne
;
"
but
time
is
required
forthe
accomplishment
of
my
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
only
power
over
her
whenevil
is
predominant
in
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
But
such
moments
are
notunfrequent
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
to
the
chase
.
 
<EOS>
Ipromise
you
<EOS>
it
will
be
a
wilder
and
more
exciting
ride
than
you
everenjoyed
in
the
king
's
company
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
chase!--to
<EOS>
the
chase
,
I
say!"Sounding
a
call
upon
his
horn
,
the
light
instantly
reappeared
.
 
<EOS>
All
wasstir
and
confusion
amid
the
impish
troop
--
<EOS>
and
presently
afterwards
anumber
of
coal
-
black
horses
,
and
hounds
of
the
same
hue
,
leashed
incouples
,
were
brought
out
of
one
of
the
side

Among
thelatter
were
two
large
sable
hounds
of
Saint
Hubert
's
breed
,
whomHerne
summoned
to
his
side
by
the
names
of
Saturn
and
Dragon
.
<EOS>
A
slight
noise
,
as
of
a
blow
dealt
against
a
tree
,
was
now
heardoverhead
,
and
Herne
,
imposing
silence
on
the
group
by
a
hasty
gesture
,
assumed
an
attitude
of
fixed
attention
.
 
<EOS>
The
stroke
was
repeated
asecond
time
.
<EOS>
"It
is
our
brother
,
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
"
cried
the
demon
.
<EOS>
Catching
hold
of
a
chain
hanging
from
the
roof
,
which
Wyat
had
nothitherto
noticed
,
he
swung
himself
into
a
crevice
above
,
anddisappeared
from
view
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
absence
of
their
leader
the
troopremained
motionless
and
silent
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
afterwards
Herne
reappeared
at
the
upper
end
of
thecave
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
Fenwolf
,
between
whom
and
Wyat
aslight
glance
of
recognition
passed
.
<EOS>
The
order
being
given
by
the
demon
to
mount
,
Wyat
,
after
an
instant'shesitation
,
seized
the
flowing
mane
of
the
horse
nearest
him
--
for
it
wasfurnished
neither
with
saddle
nor
bridle
-
and
vaulted
upon
its
back
.
 
<EOS>
Atthe
same
moment
Herne
uttered
a
wild
cry
,
and
plunging
into
the
pool
,
sunk
within
.
 
<EOS>
it
.
 
<EOS>
Wyat
's
steed
followed
,
and
swam
swiftly
forwardbeneath
the
water
.
<EOS>
When
Wyat
rose
to
the
surface
,
he
found
himself
in
the
open
lake
,
which
was
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
Before
him
he
beheld
Herneclambering
the
bank
,
accompanied
by
his
two
favourite
hounds
,
while
alarge
white
owl
wheeled
round
his
head
,
hooting
loudly
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
camethe
grisly
cavalcade
,
with
their
hounds
,
swimming
from
beneath
a
bankcovered
by
thick
overhanging
trees
,
which
completely
screened
thesecret
entrance
to
the
cave
.
 
<EOS>
Having
no
control
over
his
steed
,
Wyatwas
obliged
to
surrender
himself
to
its
guidance
,
and
was
soon
placedby
the
side
of
the
demon
hunter
.
<EOS>
"Pledge
<EOS>
me
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
"
said
Herne
,
unslinging
a
gourd
-
shapedflask
from
his
girdle
,
and
offering
it
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
a
rare
wine
,
and
willprevent
you
from
suffering
from
your
bath
,
as
well
as
give
you
spirits
forthe
chase
.
<EOS>
"Chilled
<EOS>
to
the
bone
by
the
immersion
he
had
undergone
,
Wyat
did
notrefuse
the
offer
,
but
placing
the
flask
to
his
lips
took
a
deep
draughtfrom
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
demon
uttered
a
low
bitter
laugh
as
he
received
back
theflask
,
and
he
slung
it
to
his
girdle
without
tasting
it
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
the
potion
upon
Wyat
was
extraordinary
.
 
<EOS>
The
wholescene
seemed
to
dance
around
him;-the
impish
figures
in
the
lake
,
orupon
its
bank
,
assumed
forms
yet
more
fantastic
;
the
horses
lookedlike
monsters
of
the
deep
;
the
hounds
like
wolves
and
ferocious
beasts;the
branches
of
the
trees
writhed
and
shot
forward
like
hissingserpents;--and
though
this
effect
speedily
passed
off
,
it
left
behind
it
awild
and
maddening
feeling
of
excitement
.
<EOS>
"A
noble
hart
is
lying
in
yon
glen
,
"
said
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
advancingtowards
his
leader
;
"
I
tracked
his
slot
thither
this
evening
.
<EOS>
""Haste
,
and
unharbour
him
,
"
replied
Herne
,
"
and
as
soon
as
you
rousehim
,
give
the
halloa
.
"
<EOS>
Fenwolf
obeyed
;
and
shortly
afterwards
a
cry
washeard
from
the
glen
.
<EOS>
"List
halloa

<EOS>
cried
Herne

How
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
hunted
with
Herne
.
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
Wyat
,
and
followed
by
the
whole
cavalcade
,
Hernedashed
into
the
glen
,
where
Fenwolf
awaited
him
.
 
<EOS>
Threading
thehollow
,
the
troop
descried
the
hart
flying
swiftly
along
a
sweeping
gladeat
some
two
hundred
yards
distance
.
 
<EOS>
The
glade
was
passed
--
a
woodyknoll
skirted
--
a
valley
traversed
--
and
the
hart
plunged
into
a
thick
groveclothing
the
side
of
Hawk
's
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
offered
him
no
secure
retreat
.
<EOS>
Dragon
and
Saturn
were
close
upon
him
,
and
behind
them
came
Herne
,
crashing
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
,
and
heedless
of
allimpediments
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
the
thicket
became
more
open
,
and
theyentered
Cranbourne
Chase
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
hart
soon
quitted
it
to
return
to
thegreat
park
,
and
darted
down
a
declivity
skirted
by
a
line
of
noble
oaks
.
<EOS>
Here
he
was
so
hotly
pressed
by
his
fierce
opponents
,
whose
fangs
hecould
almost
feel
within
his
haunches
,
that
he
suddenly
stopped
andstood
at
bay
,
receiving
the
foremost
of
his
assailants
,
Saturn
,
on
thepoints
of
his
horns
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
defence
,
though
gallant
,
was
unavailing
.
 
<EOS>
Inanother
instant
Herne
came
up
,
and
,
dismounting
,
called
off
Dragon
,
who
was
about
to
take
the
place
of
his
wounded
companion
.
 
<EOS>
Drawing
aknife
from
his
girdle
,
the
hunter
threw
himself
on
the
ground
,
and
,
advancing
on
all
fours
towards
the
hart
,
could
scarcely
bedistinguished
himself
from
some
denizen
of
the
forest
.
 
<EOS>
As
heapproached
the
hart
snorted
and
bellowed
fiercely
,
and
dashed
itshorns
against
him
;
but
the
blow
was
received
by
the
hunter
upon
hisown
antlered
helm
,
and
at
the
same
moment
his
knife
was
thrust
to
thehilt
into
the
stag
's
throat
,
and
it
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Springing
to
his
feet
,
Herne
whooped
joyfully
,
placed
his
bugle
to
hislips
,
and
blew
the
dead
mot
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
shouted
to
Fenwolf
to
call
awayand
couple
the
hounds
,
and
,
striking
off
the
deer
's
right
forefoot
withhis
knife
,
presented
it
to
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
Several
large
leafy
branches
beinggathered
and
laid
upon
the
ground
,
the
hart
was
placed
upon
them
,
<EOS>
andHerne
commenced
breaking
him
up
,
as
the
process
of
dismemberingthe
deer
is
termed
in
the
language
of
woodcraft
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
step
was
tocut
off
the
animal
's
head
,
which
he
performed
by
a
single
blow
with
hisheavy
trenchant
knife
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
the
hounds
the
flesh
,
"
he
said
,
delivering
the
trophy
to
Fenwolf
;
"
<EOS>
but
keep
the
antlers
,
for
it
is
a
great
deer
of
head
.
<EOS>
"Placing
<EOS>
the
head
on
a
hunting
-
pole
<EOS>
,
Fenwolf
withdrew
to
an
open
spaceamong
the
trees
,
and
,
halloing
to
the
others
,
they
immediately
cast
offthe
hounds
,
who
rushed
towards
him
,
leaping
and
baying
at
the
stag'shead
,
which
he
alternately
raised
and
lowered
until
they
weresufficiently
excited
,
when
he
threw
it
on
the
ground
before
them
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
going
forward
the
rest
of
the
band
were
occupied
invarious
ways
--
some
striking
a
light
with
flint
and
steel
--
<EOS>
some
gatheringtogether
sticks
and
dried
leaves
to
form
a
fire
--
others
producing
variousstrange
-
shaped
cooking
utensils
--
while
others
were
assisting
theirleader
in
his
butcherly
task
,
which
he
executed
with
infinite
skill
andexpedition
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
fire
was
kindled
,
Herne
distributed
certain
portions
ofthe
venison
among
his
followers
,
which
were
instantly
thrown
upon
theembers
to
broil
;
while
a
few
choice
morsels
were
stewed
in
a
pan
withwine
,
and
subsequently
offered
to
the
leader
and
Wyat
.
<EOS>
This
hasty
repast
concluded
,
the
demon
ordered
the
fire
to
beextinguished
,
and
the
quarters
of
the
deer
to
be
carried
to
the
cave
.
<EOS>
Hethen
mounted
his
steed
,
and
,
attended
by
Wyat
and
the
rest
of
histroop
,
except
those
engaged
in
executing
his
orders
,
galloped
towardsSnow
Hill
,
where
he
speedily
succeeded
in
unharbouring
another
noblehart
.
<EOS>
Away
then
went
the
whole
party
--
stag
,
hounds
,
huntsmen
,
sweepinglike
a
dark
cloud
down
the
hill
,
and
crossing
the
wide
moonlit
glade
,
studded
with
noble
trees
,
on
the
west
of
the
great
avenue
.
<EOS>
For
a
while
the
hart
held
a
course
parallel
with
the
avenue
;
he
thendashed
across
it
,
threaded
the
intricate
woods
on
the
opposite
side
,
tracked
a
long
glen
,
and
leaping
the
pales
,
entered
the
home
park
.
 
<EOS>
Italmost
seemed
as
if
he
designed
to
seek
shelter
within
the
castle
,
forhe
made
straight
towards
it
,
and
was
only
diverted
by
Herne
himself
,
who
,
shooting
past
him
with
incredible
swiftness
,
turned
him
towardsthe
lower
part
of
the
park
.
<EOS>
Here
the
chase
continued
with
unabated
ardour
,
until
,
reaching
thebanks
of
the
Thames
,
the
hart
plunged
into
it
,
and
suffered
himself
tobe
carried
noiselessly
down
the
current
.
 
<EOS>
But
Herne
followed
him
alongthe
banks
,
and
when
sufficiently
near
,
dashed
into
the
stream
,
anddrove
him
again
ashore
.
<EOS>
Once
more
they
flew
across
the
home
park
--
<EOS>
once
more
they
leaped
itspales
--
once
more
they
entered
the
great
park
--
but
<EOS>
this
time
the
stagtook
the
direction
of
Englefield
Green
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
,
however
,
allowed
tobreak
forth
into
the
open
country
;
but
,
driven
again
into
the
thickwoods
,
he
held
on
with
wondrous
speed
till
the
lake
appeared
in
view
.
<EOS>
In
another
instant
he
was
swimming
across
it
.
<EOS>
Before
the
eddies
occasioned
by
the
affrighted
animal
's
plunge
haddescribed
a
wide
ring
<EOS>
,
Herne
had
quitted
his
steed
,
and
was
cleavingwith
rapid
strokes
the
waters
of
the
lake
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
escape
impossible
,
the
hart
turned
to
meet
him
,
and
sought
to
strike
him
with
his
horns
,
butas
in
the
case
of
his
ill
-
fated
brother
of
the
wood
,
the
blow
was
<EOS>
wardedby
the
antlered
helm
of
the
swimmer
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
moment
the
clear
waterwas
dyed
with
blood
,
and
Herne
,
catching
the
gasping
animal
by
thehead
,
guided
his
body
to
shore
.
<EOS>
Again
the
process
of
breaking
up
the
stag
was
gone
through
;
and
whenHerne
had
concluded
his
task
,
he
once
more
offered
his
gourd
to
SirThomas
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
Reckless
of
the
consequences
,
the
knight
placed
theflask
to
his
lips
,
and
draining
it
to
the
last
drop
,
fell
from
his
horseinsensible
.
<EOS>
VII
.
<EOS>
How
Wyat
beheld
Mabel
Lyndwood
--
<EOS>
And
how
he
was
rowed
by
Morgan
Fenwolf
upon
the
Lake
.
<EOS>
When
perfect
consciousness
returned
to
him
,
Wyat
found
himself
lyingupon
a
pallet
in
what
he
first
took
to
be
the
cell
of
an
anchorite
;
but
asthe
recollection
of
recent
events
arose
more
distinctly
before
him
,
heguessed
it
to
be
a
chamber
connected
with
the
sandstone
cave
.
 
<EOS>
Asmall
lamp
,
placed
in
a
recess
,
lighted
the
cell
;
and
upon
a
footstool
byhis
bed
stood
a
jug
of
water
,
and
a
cup
containing
some
drink
in
whichherbs
had
evidently
been
infused
.
<EOS>
Well
-
nigh
emptying
the
jug
,
for
he
feltparched
with
thirst
,
Wyat
attired
himself
,
took
up
the
lamp
,
and
walkedinto
the
main
cavern
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
there
,
nor
could
he
obtain
any
answerto
his
calls
.
<EOS>
Evidences
,
however
,
were
not
wanting
to
prove
that
a
feasthad
recently
been
held
there
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
side
were
the
scarcelyextinguished
embers
of
a
large
wood
fire
;
and
in
the
midst
of
thechamber
was
a
rude
table
,
covered
with
drinking
-
horns
and
woodenplatters
,
as
well
as
with
the
remains
of
three
or
four
haunches
ofvenison
.
 
<EOS>
While
contemplating
this
scene
Wyat
heard
footsteps
in
oneof
the
lateral
passages
,
and
presently
afterwards
Morgan
Fenwolf
madehis
appearance
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
you
are
come
round
at
last
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
observed
the
keeper
,
in
aslightly
sarcastic
tone
.
<EOS>
"What
has
ailed
me
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Wyat
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"You
have
had
a
fever
for
three
days
,
"
returned
Fenwolf
,
"
and
havebeen
raving
like
a
madman
.
<EOS>
""Three
days
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
false
juggling
fiend
promised
her
tome
on
the
third
day
.
<EOS>
""Fear
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
;
Herne
will
be
as
good
as
his
word
,
"
said
Fenwolf
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
willyou
go
forth
with
me
?
<EOS>
I
am
about
to
visit
my
nets
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
fine
day
,
and
arow
on
the
lake
will
do
you
good
.
<EOS>
"Wyat
acquiesced
,
and
followed
Fenwolf
,
who
returned
along
thepassage
.
 
<EOS>
It
grew
narrower
at
the
sides
and
lower
in
the
roof
as
theyadvanced
,
until
at
last
they
were
compelled
to
move
forward
on
theirhands
and
knees
.
 
<EOS>
For
some
space
the
passage
,
or
rather
hole
(
for
<EOS>
itwas
nothing
more
)
ran
on
a
level
.
 
<EOS>
A
steep
and
tortuous
ascent
thencommenced
,
which
brought
them
to
an
outlet
concealed
by
a
largestone
.
<EOS>
Pushing
it
aside
,
Fenwolf
crept
forth
,
and
immediately
afterwards
Wyatemerged
into
a
grove
,
through
which
,
on
one
side
,
the
gleaming
watersof
the
lake
were
discernible
.
 
<EOS>
The
keeper
's
first
business
was
to
replacethe
stone
,
which
was
so
screened
by
brambles
and
bushes
that
it
couldnot
,
unless
careful
search
were
made
,
be
detected
.
<EOS>
Making
his
way
through
the
trees
to
the
side
of
the
lake
,
Fenwolfmarched
along
the
greensward
in
the
direction
of
Tristram
Lyndwood'scottage
.
 
<EOS>
Wyat
mechanically
followed
him
;
but
he
was
so
pre
-
occupiedthat
he
scarcely
heeded
the
fair
Mabel
,
nor
was
it
till
after
hisembarkation
in
the
skiff
with
the
keeper
,
when
she
came
forth
to
lookat
them
,
that
he
was
at
all
struck
with
her
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
inquired
hername
from
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"She
is
called
Mabel
Lyndwood
,
and
is
an
old
forester
's
granddaughter,"replied
<EOS>
the
other
somewhat
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
do
you
seek
her
love
?
,
"
asked
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
and
wherefore
not
?
"
asked
Fenwolf
,
with
a
look
of
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
I
know
not
,
friend
,
"
rejoined
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
comely
damsel
.
<EOS>
""What!-
comelier
than
the
Lady
Anne
?
"
demanded
Fenwolf
spitefully
.
<EOS>
"I
said
not
so
,
"
replied
Wyat
;
"
but
she
is
very
fair
,
and
looks
true
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
"Fenwolf
<EOS>
glanced
at
him
from
under
his
brows
;
and
plunging
his
oars
intothe
water
,
soon
carried
him
out
of
sight
of
the
maiden
.
<EOS>
It
was
high
noon
,
and
the
day
was
one
of
resplendent
loveliness
.
<EOS>
Thelake
sparkled
in
the
sunshine
,
and
as
they
shot
past
its
tiny
bays
andwoody
headlands
,
new
beauties
were
every
moment
revealed
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
while
the
scene
softened
Wyat
's
feelings
,
it
filled
him
withintolerable
remorse
,
and
so
poignant
did
his
emotions
become
,
that
hepressed
his
hands
upon
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
lovely
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
Whenhe
looked
up
again
the
scene
was
changed
.
 
<EOS>
The
skiff
had
entered
anarrow
creek
,
arched
over
by
huge
trees
,
and
looking
as
dark
andgloomy
as
the
rest
of
the
lake
was
fair
and
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
closed
in
bya
high
overhanging
bank
,
crested
by
two
tall
trees
,
whose
tangled
rootsprotruded
through
it
like
monstrous
reptiles
,
while
their
branches
casta
heavy
shade
over
the
deep
,
sluggish
water
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
have
you
come
here
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Wyat
,
looking
uneasily
roundthe
forbidding
spot
.
<EOS>
"You
will
discover
anon
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
moodily
.
<EOS>
"Go
<EOS>
back
into
the
sunshine
,
and
take
me
to
some
pleasant
bank
--
<EOS>
I
willnot
land
here
,
"
said
Wyat
sternly
.
<EOS>
"Needs
<EOS>
must
when
--
I
need
not
remind
you
of
the
proverb
,
"
rejoinedFenwolf
,
with
a
sneer
.
<EOS>
"Give
me
<EOS>
the
oars
,
thou
malapert
knave
!
"
cried
Wyat
fiercely
,
"
and
I
willput
myself
ashore
.
<EOS>
""Keep
<EOS>
quiet
,
"
said
Fenwolf
;
"
you
must
perforce
abide
our
master'scoming
.
<EOS>
"Wyat
gazed
at
the
keeper
for
a
moment
,
as
if
with
the
intention
ofthrowing
him
overboard
;
but
abandoning
the
idea
,
he
rose
up
in
theboat
,
and
caught
at
what
he
took
to
be
a
root
of
the
tree
above
.
 
<EOS>
To
hissurprise
and
alarm
,
it
closed
upon
him
with
an
iron
grasp
,
and
he
felthimself
dragged
upwards
,
while
the
skiff
,
impelled
by
a
sudden
strokefrom
Morgan
Fenwolf
,
shot
from
beneath
him
.
 
<EOS>
All
Wyat
's
efforts
todisengage
himself
were
vain
,
and
a
wild
,
demoniacal
laugh
,
echoed
bya
chorus
of
voices
,
proclaimed
him
in
the
power
of
Herne
the
Hunter
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
he
was
set
on
the
top
of
the
bank
,
while
the
demongreeted
him
with
a
mocking
laugh
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
you
thought
to
escape
me
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyatt
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
in
ataunting
tone
;
"
but
any
such
attempt
will
prove
fruitless
.
 
<EOS>
The
murderermay
repent
the
blow
when
dealt
;
the
thief
may
desire
to
restore
thegold
he
has
purloined
;
the
barterer
of
his
soul
may
rue
his
bargain
;
butthey
are
Satan
's
,
nevertheless
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
mine
,
and
nothing
can
redeemyou!""Woe
<EOS>
is
me
that
it
should
be
so
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"Lamentation
<EOS>
is
useless
and
unworthy
of
you
,
"
rejoined
Hernescornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
wish
will
be
speedily
accomplished
.
 
<EOS>
This
very
nightyour
kingly
rival
shall
be
placed
in

<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Wyat
,
the
flame
of
jealousy
again
rising
within
hisbreast
.
<EOS>
"You
can
make
your
own
terms
with
him
for
the
Lady
Anne

pursuedHerne
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
life
will
be
at
your

<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
promise
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
replied
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Put
yourself
under
the
conduct
of
Fenwolf
,
and
allshall
happen
as
you
desire

<EOS>
We

"
he
added
to
one
of
his
attendants
,
"
go
with
Sir
Thomas
to
the
skiff
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
personage
who
received
the
command
,
and
who
was
wildly
andfantastically
habited
,
beckoned
Wyat
to
follow
him
,
and
after
manytwistings
and
turnings
brought
them
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
,
where
theskiff
was
lying
,
with
Fenwolf
reclining
at
full
length
upon
its
benches
.
<EOS>
He
arose
,
however
,
quickly
at
the
appearance
of
Meschines
,
and
askedhim
for
some
provisions
,
which
the
latter
promised
to
bring
,
and
whileWyat
got
into
the
skiff
he
disappeared
,
but
returned
a
few
minutesafterwards
with
a
basket
,
which
he
gave
to
the
keeper
.
<EOS>
Crossing
the
lake
,
Fenwolf
then
shaped
his
course
towards
a
verdantbank
enamelled
with
wild
flowers
,
where
he
landed
.
 
<EOS>
The
basket
beingopened
,
was
found
to
contain
a
flask
of
wine
and
the
better
part
of
avenison
pasty
,
of
which
Wyat
,
whose
appetite
was
keen
enough
afterhis
long
fasting
,
ate
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
stretched
himself
on
the
velvetsod
,
and
dropped
into
a
tranquil
slumber
which
lasted
to
a
late
hour
inthe
evening
.
<EOS>
He
was
roused
from
it
by
a
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
,
while
a
deep
voicethundered
in
his
ear--
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Up
,
up
,
Sir
Thomas
,
and
follow
me
,
and

<EOS>
How
the
King
and
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
were
assailed
by
Herne'sBand
--
And
what
followed
the
Attack
.
<EOS>
Henry
and
Suffolk
,
on
leaving
the
forester
's
hut
,
took
their
way
for
asort
space
along
the
side
of
the
lake
,
and
then
turned
into
a
pathleading
through
the
trees
up
the
eminence
on
the
left
.
 
<EOS>
The
king
was
ina
joyous
mood
,
and
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
passion
with
whichthe
fair
damsel
had
inspired
him
.
<EOS>
"I
'
faith
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
the
cardinal
has
a
quick
eye
for
a
pretty
wench
.
 
<EOS>
Ihave
heard
that
he
loves
one
in
secret
,
and
I
am
therefore
the
morebeholden
to
him
for
discovering
Mabel
to
me
.
<EOS>
""You
forget
,
my
liege
,
that
it
is
his
object
to
withdraw
your
regards
fromthe
Lady
Anne
Boleyn
,
"
remarked
Suffolk
.
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
what
his
motive
may
be
,
as
long
as
the
result
is
sosatisfactory
,
"
returned
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Confess
now
,
Suffolk
,
you
never
behelda
figure
<EOS>
so
perfect
,
a
complexion
so
blooming
,
or
eyes
<EOS>
so
bright
.
 
<EOS>
As
toher
lips
,
by
my
soul
,
I
never
tasted
such
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
your
majesty
is
not
inexperienced
in
such
matters
,
"
laughedSuffolk
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
my
own
part
,
I
was
as
much
struck
by
her
grace
as
by
herbeauty
,
and
can
scarcely
persuade
myself
she
can
be
nothing
morethan
a
mere
forester
's
grand
-
daughter
.
<EOS>
""Wolsey
told
me
there
was
a
mystery
about
her
birth
,
"
rejoined
Henry;"but
,
pest
on
it
;
her
beauty
drove
all
recollection
of
the
matter
out
of
myhead
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
back
,
and
question
her
now
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
majesty
forgets
that
your
absence
from
the
castle
will
occasionsurprise
,
if
not
alarm
,
"
said
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
mystery
will
keep
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""Tut
,
tut!--I
will
return
,
"
said
the
king
perversely
.
 
<EOS>
And
Suffolk
,
knowinghis
wilfulness
,
and
that
all
remonstrance
would
prove
fruitless
,
retracedhis
steps
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
not
proceeded
far
when
they
perceived
afemale
figure
at
the
bottom
of
the
ascent
,
<EOS>
just
where
the
path
turned
offon
the
margin
of
the
lake
.
<EOS>
"As
I
live
,
there
she
is
!
"
exclaimed
the
king
joyfully
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
divined
mywishes
,
and
is
come
herself
to
tell
me
her
history
.
"And
<EOS>
he
sprang
forward
,
while
Mabel
advanced
rapidly
towards
him
.
<EOS>
They
met
half
-
way
,
and
Henry
would
have
caught
her
in
his
arms
<EOS>
,
butshe
avoided
him
,
exclaiming
,
in
a
tone
of
confusion
and
alarm
,
"
ThankHeaven
,
I
have
found
you
,
sire!""Thank
Heaven
,
too
,
sweetheart

"
rejoined
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
hidewhen
you
are
the
seeker
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
know
me
--
ha?"I
knew
you
at
first
,
"
replied
Mabel
confusedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
you
at
the
greathunting
party
;
and
,
once

,
your

<EOS>
""Ha

a
compliment
as
soothly
as
the

cried
Henry
,
catching
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"Beseech
<EOS>
your

,
release
me
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Mabel
,
struggling
to
getfree
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
follow
you
on
the
light
errand
you
suppose
,
but
to
warnyou
of
danger
.
 
<EOS>
Before
you
quitted
my
grandsire
's
cottage
I
told
you
thispart
of
the
forest
was
haunted
by
plunderers
and
evil
beings
,
andapprehensive
lest
some
mischance
might
befall
you
,
I
opened
thewindow
softly
to
look
after
you
-""And
<EOS>

"
<EOS>
interrupted
the
king
,
squeezing
her
hand
-
<EOS>
"
andhow
resolved
I
was
to
make
you
mine
--

<EOS>

<EOS>
words
I
heard
were
of
very
different
import

rejoinedMabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
menaced
by
miscreants
,
who
purposed
to
waylayyou
before
you
could
reach
your
steed

<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
them
come
,
"
replied
Henry
carelessly
;
"
they
shall
pay
for
theirvillainy
.
 
<EOS>
How
many
were
there?""Two

answered
Mabel
;
"
but
one
of
them
was
Herne
,
the

of

<EOS>
He
said
he
would
summon
his

<EOS>
What
can
your
strong

,
even
aided

avail

exclaimed
the

<EOS>
"
Said
the
knave
<EOS>
so?He
did

"
replied
Mabel
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
knew
it
was
Herne
by
his
antleredhelm
.
<EOS>
""There
is
reason
in
what
the
damsel
says
,
my

"
interposed
Suffolk
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
possible
,
you
had
better
avoid
an
encounter
with

villains

<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
hands
itch
to

Henry

<EOS>
"
But
I

<EOS>
""Where

<EOS>
"
asked
Mabel
.
<EOS>
"Tied
to
a
tree
at
the
foot
of
the

"
replied
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
haveattendants
midway
between
this
spot
and
Snow
Hill

<EOS>
""This
way

then

"
said
Mabel
,
breaking
from
him
,
and
darting
into
anarrow
path
among
the
trees
.
<EOS>
Henry
ran
after
her
,
but
was
not
agile
enough
to
overtake
her
.
 
<EOS>
At
lengthshe
stopped
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
your
majesty
will
pursue
this
path
<EOS>
,
"
she
cried
,
"
you
will
come

when

if
you
will
direct
your
course
towardsa

tree
on
the

you
will
find

<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
can
not
go
alone

"
cried
Henry
.
<EOS>
Mabel
,
however
,
slipped
past
him
,
and
was
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Henry
looked
as
if
he
meant
to
follow
her
,
but
Suffolk
ventured
to
arresthim
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
tarry
here

said
the

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Return
with

if
you
please
,
but
do
not

<EOS>
"Henry
yielded
,
though
reluctantly
,
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Erelong
they
arrived
at
the
open
space
described
by
Mabel
,
andimmediately
perceived
the
large
beech
-
tree
,
behind
which
they
foundthe
path
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
moon
had
arisen
,
and
as
they
emerged
uponthe
marsh
they
easily
discovered
a
track
,
though
not
broader
than
asheep
-
walk
,
leading
along
its
edge
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
hurried
across
it
,
Suffolkoccasionally
cast
a
furtive
glance
over
his
shoulder
,
but
he
saw
nothingto
alarm
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
tract
of
marshy
land
on
the
left
was
hiddenfrom
view
by
a
silvery
mist
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
king
and
his
companion
gained
firmer
ground
,
andascending
the
gentle
elevation
on
the
other
side
of
the
marsh
,
madetheir
way
to
a
little
knoll
crowned
by
a
huge
oak
,
which
commanded
afine
view
of
the
lake
winding
through
the
valley
beyond
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
whowas
a
few
yards
in
advance
of
his
companion
,
paused
at
a
shortdistance
from
the
free
,
and
being
somewhat
over
-
heated
,
took
off
hiscap
to
wipe
his
brow
,
laughingly
observing
-"In
good
truth
,
Suffolk
,
we
must
henceforth
be
rated
as
miserablefaineants
,
to
be
scared
from
our
path
by
a
silly
wench
's
tale
ofdeerstealers
and
wild
huntsmen
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
yielded
to
her
entreaties
.
<EOS>
If
Herne
be
still
extant
,
he
must
be
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
old
,
for
unless
the
legend
is
false
,
he
flourished
in
the
time
of
mypredecessor
,
Richard
the
Second
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
I
could
see
him!""Behold
him
,
then
!
<EOS>
"
cried
a
harsh
voice
from
behind
.
<EOS>
Turning
at
the
sound
,
Henry
perceived
a
tall
dark
figure
of
hideousphysiognomy
and
strange
attire
,
helmed
with
a
huge
pair
of
antlers
,
standing
between
him
and
the
oak
-
tree
.
 
<EOS>
So
sudden
was
theappearance
of
the
figure

"

What

"
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
I
have
said
,
"
replied
the
demon
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
Herne
the
Hunter

<EOS>
Welcome
to
my
domain
,
Harry
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
lord
of

I

<EOS>
Ha

ha!""I

of

false

"
<EOS>
cried
the
king
,
"
and
none
shall
dispute
it
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
In
thename
of
the
most
holy
faith
,
of
which
I
am
the
defender
,
I
commandthee
to
avoid
my

<EOS>
Get
thee
backwards
,
Satan!"The
demon
laughed
derisively
.
<EOS>
"Harry
of
England
<EOS>
,
advance
towards
me
,
and
you
advance
upon
yourperil

"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Avaunt
,
I
say
!
"
cried
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
the
blessed
Trinity
,
andof
all
holy
angels
and

,
<EOS>
I
strike!And
<EOS>
he
whirled
the
staff
round
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
But
ere
the
weapon
coulddescend
,
a
flash
of
dazzling
fire
<EOS>
encircled
the
demon
,
amidst
which
hevanished
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
<EOS>
protect
us
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Henry
,
appalled
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
the
sound
of
a
horn
was
heard
,
and
a
number
of
wildfigures
in
fantastic
garbs
--
some
mounted
on
swarthy
steeds
,
andaccompanied
by
hounds
,
others
on
foot
-
issued
from
the
adjoiningcovert
,
and
hurried
towards
the
spot
occupied
by
the
king
.
"Aha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Henry-
"
more
of
the
same
sort
.
<EOS>
Hell
,
it
would
seem
,
has
let
loose
her
hosts
;
but
I
have
no
fear
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
Stand
by
me
,
Suffolk
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
the
death
,
sire
,
"
<EOS>
replied
the
duke
,
drawing
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
timeone
of
the
foremost
of
the
impish
crew
had
reached
the
king
,
andcommanded
him
to
yield
himself
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"Dost
know
whom
thou
askest
to
yield
,
dog
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Henry
furiously
.
<EOS>
"Yea
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
thou
art
the
king!""Then
down
on
thy
knees
,
traitor
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Henry
;
"
down
all

ye

andsue
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
mercy
--
<EOS>
ha
!
ha
!
"
rejoined
the
other
;
"
it
is
thy
turn
to
sue
for
mercy
,
tyrant
!
<EOS>
We
acknowledge
no
other
ruler
than
Herne
the
Hunter
.
<EOS>
""Then
seek
him
in
hell
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
,
dealing
the
speaker
a
tremendousblow
on
the
head
with
his
staff
,
which
brought
him
senseless
to
theground
.
<EOS>
The
others
immediately
closed
round
him
,
and
endeavoured
to
seizethe
king
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
dogs
-ha
!
<EOS>
traitors
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Henry
,
plying
his
staff
with
greatactivity
,
and
bringing
down
an
assailant
at
each
stroke
;
"
do
you
dare
tolay
hands
upon
our
sacred
person
?
<EOS>
Back
!
<EOS>
back!"The
<EOS>
determined
resistance
offered
by
the
king
,
supported
as
he
was
bySuffolk
,
paralysed
his
assailants
,
who
seemed
more
bent
upon
securinghis
person
than
doing
him
injury
.
 
<EOS>
But
Suffolk
's
attention
was
presentlydiverted
by
the
attack
of
a
fierce
black
hound
,
set
upon
him
by
a
stoutfellow
in
a
bearded
mask
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
hard
struggle
,
and
not
before
he
hadbeen
severely
bitten
in
the
arm
,
the
duke
contrived
to
despatch
hisassailant
.
<EOS>
"This
to
avenge
poor
Bawsey
!
"
cried
the
man
who
had
set
on
thehound
,
stabbing
at
Suffolk
with
his
knife
.
<EOS>
But
the
duke
parried
the
blow
,
and
,
disarming
his
antagonist
,
forcedhim
to
the
ground
,
and
tearing
off
his
mask
,
disclosed
the
features
ofMorgan
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Henry
had
been
placed
in
considerable
jeopardy
.
 
<EOS>
LikeSuffolk
,
he
had
slaughtered
a
hound
,
and
,
in
aiming
a
blow
at
the
villainwho
set
it
on
,
his
foot
slipped
,
and
he
lay
at
his
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
The
wretchraised
his
knife
,
and
was
in
the
act
of
striking
when
a
sword
waspassed
through
his
body
.
 
<EOS>
The
blow
was
decisive
;
the
king
instantlyarose
,
and
the
rest
of
his
assailants
-
horse
as
well
as
foot
--
<EOS>
disheartenedby
what
had
occurred
,
beat
a
hasty
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
turned
to
look
for
hisdeliverer
,
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
anger
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
God
's
death
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
can
I
believe
my
eyes
?
<EOS>
Is
it
you
,
<EOS>
SirThomas
Wyat?""Ay
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
do
you
here
?
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
demanded
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
be
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
""I
have
tarried
for
revenge
,
"
replied
Wyat
.
"Revenge!--ha
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
whom?""On
you
,
"
replied
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
vociferated
Henry
,
foaming
with
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
you
,
traitor
,
<EOS>
whohave
devised
this
damnable
<EOS>
plot?--is
<EOS>
it
you
who
would
make
your
king
acaptive?--you
who
slay
him
?
<EOS>
Have
you
leagued
yourself
with
fiends?"But
<EOS>
Wyat
made
no
answer
;
and
though
he
lowered
the
point
of
hissword
,
he
regarded
the
king
sternly
.
<EOS>
A
female
figure
now
rushed
forward
,
and
bending
before
the
king
,
criedin
an
imploring
voice--"Spare
him
,
sire
--
spare
him
!
<EOS>
He
is
no
party
to
theattack
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
near
him
in
yon
wood
,
and
he
stirred
not
forth
till
he
sawyour
life
in
danger
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
delivered
you
from
the
assassin
.
<EOS>
""I
did
so
because
I
reserved
him
for
my
own
hand
,
"
said
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
hear
him
confess
his
treason
,
"
cried
Henry
;
"
down
on
your
knees
,
villain
,
or
I
will
strike
you
to
my
feet

<EOS>
""He
has
just
saved
your

cried
the
supplicant
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh

sparehim!""What
make
you
here
,
Mabel
?
"
cried
Henry
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
followed
yourmajesty

"
she
replied
,
in
some
confusion
,
"
and
reached
yonwood
just
as
the
attack
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
dare
to
advancefarther
.
<EOS>
""You
should
have
gone
home
--
gone
home
,
"
rejoined
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
Wyat,"he
continued
,
in
a
tone
of
stern
reproach
,
"
you
were
once
a
loyalsubject
.
 
<EOS>
What
means
this
change?""It
means
that
you
have
robbed
me
of
a
mistress
,
"
replied
Wyat
;
"
andfor
this
cause
I
have
damned
myself
.
<EOS>
""Pardon
<EOS>
him!-oh
,
pardon
him

"
cried
Mabel
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
understand
you
,
Wyat
,
"
said
Henry
,
after
a
pause
;
"
but
I
havemyself
suffered
from
the
pangs
of
jealousy

<EOS>
You
have
saved
my
life

andI
will
spare
yours
.
<EOS>
""Sire
!
"
cried
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"Suffolk

"
exclaimed
Henry
,
looking
towards
the
duke
,
who
was
holdingFenwolf
by
the
throat
,
"
shall
I
be
justified
in
letting
him
go
free?"Strike!-
strike
!
"
<EOS>
cried
a
deep
voice
in
Wyat
's
ear
;
"
your
rival
is
now
inyour
power

""Far
<EOS>
be
it
from
me
to
thwart
your

<EOS>
generous
<EOS>
impulses,"rejoined
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
that
Wyat
has
saved
your

and
if
he
hadbeen
disposed
to
take
it
<EOS>
,
you
have
this
moment
exposed
yourself
tohim

<EOS>
""Sir

said
the
king
,
turning
to
him
,
"
you
have
my
full

<EOS>
Quit
this
forest
instantly
,
and
make
your

<EOS>
Ifyou

you

be
lodged

<EOS>
"Wyat
knelt
down
,
and
would
have
pressed
Henry
's
hand
to
his
lips
,
butthe
latter
pushed
him
aside
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
--
<EOS>
no

<EOS>
Not
now
--
on
your
return

<EOS>
"Thus
rebuffed
,
Wyat
strode
away
,
and
as
he
passed
the
tree
he
heard
avoice
exclaim
,
"
You
have
escaped
him
,
but
think
not
to
escape
me!""And
now
,
sweetheart
,
"
said
Henry
,
turning
to
Mabel
,
"
since
you
are
sofar
on
the
way

you
shall
go
with
me
to
the
castle
.
<EOS>
""On
no
account
,
my
liege
<EOS>
,
"
she
returned
;
"
my
grandsire
will
wonderwhat
has
become
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
already
be
in
great
alarm
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
will
send
an
attendant
to
quiet
his
fears
,
"
urged
Henry
.
<EOS>
"That
would
only
serve
to
increase
them
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
mustgo
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
breaking
from
him
,
she
darted
swiftly
down
the
hill
,
and
glancedacross
the
marsh
like
a
moonbeam
.
"Plague
<EOS>
on
it
!
"
cried
Henry
,
"
I
have
again
forgotten
to
question
herabout
her
birth
.
<EOS>
""Shall
<EOS>
I
despatch
this
knave
,
my
liege

"
<EOS>
cried
Suffolk
,
pointing
with
hissword
to
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
no
means
,
"
said
the
king
;
"
something
may
be
learnt
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
Harkthee
,
thou
felon
hound
;
<EOS>
if
thou
indeed
servest
the
fiend
,
thou
seest
hedeserts
thee
,
as
he
does
all
who
put
faith
in
him
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
see
it
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
,
who
,
finding
resistance
vain
,
had
folded
hishands
doggedly
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"Then
confess
thy
evil
practices
,
"
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
me
my
life
,
and
<EOS>
I
will
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
he
uttered
thewords
,
he
caught
sight
of
the
dark
figure
of
Herne
,
stationed
at
the
sideof
the
oak
,
with
its
right
arm
raised
menacingly
.
<EOS>
"What
seest
thou
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Henry
,
remarking
his
fixed
gaze
towards
thetree
,
and
glancing
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Fenwolf
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
Henry
went
up
to
the
tree
,
and
walked
round
it
,
but
he
could
seenothing
.
<EOS>
"I
will
scour
the
forest
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
muttered
,
"
and
hang
every
knaveI
find
within
it
who
can
not
give
a
good
account
of
himself
.
<EOS>
""Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
ho

<EOS>
"
laughed
a
voice
,
which
seemed
to
proceed
from
thebranches
of
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
looked
up
,
but
no
one
was
visible
.
<EOS>
"God
's
death
--
derided
!
"
<EOS>
he
roared
.
 
<EOS>
"
Man

,
thou
shalt
feel

<EOS>
""Ho

<EOS>
ho

"
<EOS>
again
laughed
the
voice
.
<EOS>
Stamping
with
rage
,
Henry
swore
a
great
oath
,
and
smote
the
trunk
ofthe
tree
with
his
sword
.
<EOS>
"Your
majesty
will
search
in
vain
,
"
said
Suffolk
;
"
it
is
clearly
the
fiendwith
whom
you
have
to
deal
,
and
<EOS>
the
aid
of
holy
priests
must
beobtained
to
drive
him
from
the
forest
.
<EOS>
""Ho
!
<EOS>
ho

<EOS>
ho

"
<EOS>
again
laughed
the
voice
.
<EOS>
A
party
of
horsemen
now
appeared
in
view
.
 
<EOS>
They
proved
to
be
the
royalattendants
,
who
had
ridden
forward
in
search
of
the
king
,
and
wereinstantly
hailed
by
Henry
and
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
headed
by
CaptainBouchier
,
who
at
a
sign
from
the
king
instantly
dismounted
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
me
your
horse
,
Bouchier
<EOS>
,
"
said
Henry
,
"
and
do
you
and
half

a

dozen

remain

a

When
they
arrive

station
them
near

remain
here

I
return
in

If
any

appears
,
make
him
a
prisoner

<EOS>
""Your

replied
Bouchier
.
<EOS>
Bound

and

,
Fenwolf
was
thrown
upon
the
back
of
a
horse
,
and
guarded
by
two
halberdiers
,
who
were
prepared
to
strike
him
deadon
the
slightest
movement

<EOS>
In
this
way
he
was
conveyed

Half

Duke

being
cleared

the

"I

said
Suffolk

The

determined

of

all

but
he
does

therefore
sent
this

withthe
desire

""Confession

I

""You

replied
Fenwolf"Ay

"
replied
the
canon
;
"
but
even
that
fiery
trial
will
fail
to
purge
outyour
offences
without
penitence
.
 
<EOS>
My
lord
of
Suffolk
,
this
wretchedman
's
condition
demands
special
attention
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
profit
the
Churchmuch
to
win
his
soul
from
the
fiend
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
,
I
pray
you
,
be
removed
tothe
dungeon
beneath
the
Garter
Tower
,
where
a
priest
shall
visit
him
,
and
pray
by
his
side
till
daybreak
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
useless
,
father
,
"
said
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
despair
,
my
son
,
"
replied
the
canon
;
"
and
when
I
see
you
againin
the
morning
I
trust
to
find
you
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
duke
then
gave
directions
to
the
guard
to
remove
the
prisoner
,
andafter
some
further
conference
with
the
canon
,
returned
to
the
royalapartments
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
canon
shaped
his
course
towards
the
HorseshoeCloisters
,
a
range
of
buildings
so
designated
from
their
form
,
andsituated
at
the
west
end
of
St.
 
George
's
Chapel
,
and
he
had
scarcelyentered
them
when
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
,
and
turning
at
thesound
,
beheld
a
Franciscan
friar
,
for
so
his
habit
of
the
coarsest
greycloth
,
tied
with
a
cord
round
the
waist
,
proclaimed
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
friar
<EOS>
wasvery
tall
and
gaunt
,
and
his
cowl
was
drawn
over
his
face
so
as
toconceal
his
features
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
would
you
,
brother
?
"
inquired
the
canon
,
halting
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
arequest
to
make
of
you
,
reverend
sir
,
"
replied
the
friar
,
with
a
lowlyinclination
of
the
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
arrived
from
Chertsey
Abbey
,
<EOS>
whither
I
have
been
tarrying
for
the
last
three
days
,
and
whileconversing
with
the
guard
at
the
gate
<EOS>
,
I
saw
a
prisoner
brought
into
thecastle
charged
with
heinous
offences
,
and
amongst
others
,
withdealings
with
the
fiend
.
<EOS>
""You
have
been
rightly
informed
,
brother
,
"
rejoined
the
canon
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
have
I
also
been
rightly
informed
that
you
desire
a
priest
to
passthe
night
with
him
,
reverend
sir
?
"
<EOS>
returned
the
friar
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
I
wouldcrave
permission
to
undertake
the
office
.
 
<EOS>
Two
souls
,
as
deeply
ladenas
that
of
this
poor
wretch
,
have
been
snatched
from
the
jaws
of
Satanby
my
efforts
,
and
I
do
not
despair
of
success
now
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
you
are
so
confident
,
brother
,
"
said
the
canon
,
"
I
commit
himreadily
to
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
seek
other
aid
,
but
your
offercomes
opportunely
.
 
<EOS>
With
Heaven
's
help
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
you
will
achieve
avictory
over
the
evil
one
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
the
latter
words
were
uttered
a
sudden
pain
seemed
to
seize
thefriar
.
 
<EOS>
Staggering
<EOS>
slightly
,
he
caught
at
the
railing
of
the
cloisters
forsupport
,
but
he
instantly
recovered
himself
.
<EOS>
"It
is
nothing
,
reverend
sir
,
"
he
said
,
seeing
that
the
good
canonregarded
him
anxiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
Long
vigils
and
fasting
have
made
me
liableto
frequent
attacks
of
giddiness
,
but
they
pass
as
quickly
as
theycome
.
 
<EOS>
Will
it
please
you
to
go
with
me
,
and
direct
the
guard
to
admitme
to
the
prisoner?"The
canon
assented
;
and
crossing
the
quadrangle
,
they
returned
to
thegateway
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
prisoner
had
been
removed
to
the
lower
chamber
of
theGarter
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
This
fortification
,
one
of
the
oldest
in
the
castle
,
beingcoeval
with
the
Curfew
Tower
,
is
now
in
a
state
of
grievous
neglect
andruin
.
 
<EOS>
Unroofed
,
unfloored
,
filled
with
rubbish
,
masked
by
the
yard
wallsof
the
adjoining
habitations
,
with
one
side
entirely
pulled
down
,
and
agreat
breach
in
front
,
it
is
solely
owing
to
the
solid
and
rock
-
likeconstruction
of
its
masonry
that
it
is
indebted
for
partial
preservation
.
<EOS>
Still
,
notwithstanding
its
dilapidated
condition
,
and
that
it
is
the
mereshell
of
its
former
self
,
its
appearance
is
highly
picturesque
.
 
<EOS>
The
wallsare
of
prodigious
thickness
,
and
the
deep
embrasures
within
them
arealmost
perfect
;
while
a
secret
staircase
may
still
be
tracked
partlyround
the
building
.
 
<EOS>
Amid
the
rubbish
choking
up
its
lower
chambergrows
a
young
tree
,
green
and
flourishing
-
a
type
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
,
ofthe
restoration
of
the
structure
.
<EOS>
Conducted
to
a
low
vaulted
chamber
in
this
tower
,
the
prisoner
wascast
upon
its
floor
-
<EOS>
for
he
was
still
hound
hand
and
foot
-
and
left
aloneand
in
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
destined
to
continue
in
this
state
long
.
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
dungeon
opened
,
and
the
guard
ushered
in
the
tallFranciscan
friar
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
dog
of
a
prisoner
,
"
he
cried
,
"
here
is
a
holy
man
come
to
passthe
night
with
you
in
prayer
.
<EOS>
""He
may
take
his
Ave
Maries
and
Paternosters
elsewhere
-
<EOS>
I
want
themnot
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
moodily
.
<EOS>
"You
would
prefer
my
bringing
Herne
the
Hunter
,
no
doubt
,
"
rejoined
theguard
,
laughing
at
his
own
jest
;
"
but
this
is
a
physician
for
your
soul
.
<EOS>
The
saints
help
you
in
your
good
work
,
father
;
you
will
have
no
easytask
.
<EOS>
""Set
<EOS>
down
the
light
,
my
son
,
"
cried
the
friar
harshly
,
"
and
leave
us
;
mytask
will
be
easily
accomplished
.
<EOS>
"Placing
<EOS>
the
lamp
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
dungeon
,
the
guard
withdrew
,
and
locked
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
repent
,
my
son
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
friar
,
as
soon
as
they
werealone
.
<EOS>
"Certes
<EOS>
,
I
repent
having
put
faith
in
a
treacherous
fiend
,
who
hasdeserted
me
-
<EOS>
but
that
is
all
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
,
with
his
face
turned
to
theground
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
put
faith
in
me
,
if
I
promise
you
deliverance
?
"
demanded
thefriar
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
promise
more
than
you
can
perform
,
as
most
of
your
brethren
do,"rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
say
so
if
you
look
up
,
"
said
the
friar
.
<EOS>
Fenwolf
started
at
the
words
,
which
were
pronounced
in
a
differenttone
from
that
previously
adopted
by
the
speaker
,
and
raised
himself
asfar
as
his
bonds
would
permit
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
friar
had
thrown
hack
his
cowl
,
and
disclosed
features
of
appalling
hideousness
,
lighted
up
by
adiabolical
grin
.
<EOS>
"You
here
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"You
doubted
me
,
"
rejoined
Herne
,
"
but
I
never
desert
a
follower
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
wish
to
show
the
royal
Harry
that
my
power
is
equal
to
hisown
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
how
are
we
to
get
out
of
this
dungeon
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Fenwolf
,
gazinground
apprehensively
.
<EOS>
My
way
out
will
he
easy
enough
,
"
replied
Herne
;
"
but
your
escape
isattended
with
more
difficulty
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
how
we
went
to
thevaulted
chamber
in
the
Curfew
Tower
on
the
night
when
Mark
Fytton
,
the
butcher
,
was
confined
within
it?"I
do
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
;
"
but
I
can
think
of
nothing
while
I
am
tied
thus
.
<EOS>
"Heme
instantly
drew
forth
a
hunting
-
knife
,
and
cutting
Fenwolf
's
bondsasunder
,
the
latter
started
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
that
bull
-
headed
butcher
would
have
joined
me
,
I
would
haveliberated
him
as
I
am
about
to
liberate
you
,
"
pursued
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
toreturn
to
the
matter
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
You
recollect
the
secret
passage
we
thentracked
?
<EOS>
There
is
just
such
another
staircase
in
this
tower
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
stepping
to
the
farther
side
of
the
chamber
,
he
touched
a
smallknob
in
the
wall
,
and
a
stone
flew
hack
,
disclosing
an
aperture
justlarge
enough
to
allow
a
man
to
pass
through
it
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
your
road
to
freedom
,
"
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
hole
.
 
<EOS>
"
Creepalong
that
narrow
passage
,
and
it
will
bring
you
to
a
small
loophole
inthe
wall
,
not
many
feet
from
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
loophole
is
guarded
by
abar
of
iron
,
but
it
is
moved
by
a
spring
in
the
upper
part
of
the
stone
inwhich
<EOS>
it
appears
to
be
mortised
.
<EOS>
This
impediment
removed
,
you
willeasily
force
your
way
through
the
loophole
.
 
<EOS>
Drop
cautiously
,
for
fear
ofthe
sentinels
on
the
walls
;
then
make
your
way
to
the
forest
,
and
if
you'scape
the
arquebusiers
who
are
scouring
it
,
conceal
yourself
in
thesandstone
cave
below
the
beech
-
tree
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
of
you
?
"
asked
Fenwoif
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
more
to
do
here
,
"
replied
Herne
<EOS>
impatiently-"away!"Thus
dismissed
,
Fenwolf
entered
the
aperture
,
which
was
instantlyclosed
after
him
by
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
Carefully
following
the
instructions
of
hisleader
,
the
keeper
passed
through
the
loophole
,
let
himself
drop
softlydown
,
and
keeping
close
to
the
walls
of
the
tower
till
he
heard
thesentinels
move
off
,
darted
swiftly
across
the
street
and
made
good
hisescape
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Herne
drew
the
cowl
over
his
head
,
and
stepping
to
thedoor
,
knocked
loudly
against
it
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
would
you
,
father
?
"
cried
the
guard
from
without
.
<EOS>
"Enter
,
my
son
,
and
you
shall
know
,
"
replied
Herne
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
the
door
was
unlocked
,
and
the
guard
advanced
intothe
dungeon
.
"Ha
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
snatching
up
the
lamp
and
looking
around
,
"
whereis
the
prisoner?""Gone
,
"
replied
Herne
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
has
the
fiend
flown
away
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
man
,
in
mixedastonishment
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
has
been
set
free
by
Herne
the
Hunter
!
"
cried
the
demon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
allwho
question
thee
so
,
and
relate
what
thou
now
seest
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
the
words
a
bright
blue
flame
illumined
the
chamber
,
in
the
midst
ofwhich
was
seen
the
tall
dark
figure
of
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
His
Franciscan
's
gownhad
dropped
to
his
feet
,
and
he
appeared
habited
in
his
wild
deer
-
skingarb
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
loud
cry
,
the
guard
fell
senseless
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
after
this
,
as
was
subsequently
ascertained
,
a
tallFranciscan
friar
threaded
the
cloisters
behind
Saint
George
's
Chapel
,
and
giving
the
word
to
the
sentinels
,
passed
through
the
outer
doorcommunicating
with
the
steep
descent
leading
to
the
town
.
<EOS>
X.
 
<EOS>
How
Herne
the
Hunter
was
himself
hunted
.
<EOS>
On
the
guard
's
recovery
,
information
of
what
had
occurred
wasimmediately
conveyed
to
the
king
,
who
had
not
yet
retired
to
rest
,
butwas
sitting
in
his
private
chamber
with
the
Dukes
of
Suffolk
andNorfolk
.
 
<EOS>
The
intelligence
threw
him
into
a
great
fury
:
he
buffeted
theguard
,
and
ordered
him
to
be
locked
up
in
the
dungeon
whence
theprisoner
had
escaped
;
reprimanded
the
canon
;
directed
the
Duke
ofSuffolk
,
with
a
patrol
,
to
make
search
in
the
neighbourhood
of
thecastle
for
the
fugitive
and
the
friar
;
and
bade
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
gettogether
a
band
of
arquebusiers
;
and
as
soon
as
the
latter
wereassembled
,
he
put
himself
at
their
head
and
again
rode
into
the
forest
.
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
had
proceeded
about
a
mile
along
the
great
avenue
,
when
one
of
the
arquebusiers
rode
up
and
said
that
he
heard
somedistant
sounds
on
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
Commanding
a
halt
,
Henry
listened
for
amoment
,
and
,
satisfied
that
the
man
was
right
,
quitted
the
course
hewas
pursuing
,
and
dashed
across
the
broad
glade
now
traversed
by
theavenue
called
Queen
Anne
's
Ride
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
advanced
the
rapid
tramplingof
horses
was
heard
,
accompanied
by
shouts
,
and
presently
afterwardsa
troop
of
wild
-
looking
horsemen
in
fantastic
garbs
was
seen
gallopingdown
the
hill
,
pursued
by
Bouchier
and
his
followers
.
 
<EOS>
The
kingimmediately
shaped
his
course
so
as
to
intercept
the
flying
party
,
and
,
being
in
some
measure
screened
by
the
trees
,
he
burst
unexpectedlyupon
them
at
a
turn
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
Henry
called
to
the
fugitives
to
surrender
,
but
they
refused
,
and
,
brandishing
their
long
knives
and
spears
,
made
a
desperate
resistance
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
speedily
surrounded
and
overpowered
.
<EOS>
Bouchier
inquiredfrom
the
king
<EOS>
what
should
be
done
with
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
"Hang
them
all
upon
yon
trees
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
,
pointing
to
two
sisteroaks
which
stood
near
the
scene
of
strife
.
<EOS>
The
terrible
sentence
was
immediately
carried
into
execution
.
<EOS>
Cordswere
produced
,
and
in
less
than
half
-
an
-
hour
twenty
breathless
bodieswere
swinging
from
the
branches
of
the
two
trees
indicated
by
the
king
.
<EOS>
"This
will
serve
to
deter
others
from
like
offences
,
"
observed
Henry
,
who
had
watched
the
whole
proceedings
with
savage
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
Bouchier
,
how
came
you
to
let
the
leader
of
these
villainsescape?""I
did
not
know
he
had
escaped
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Bouchier
,
inastonishment
.
<EOS>
"Yea
<EOS>
,
marry
,
but
he
has
escaped
,
"
rejoined
Henry
;
"
and
he
has
had
theaudacity
to
show
himself
in
the
castle
within
this
hour
,
and
the
cunning
,
moreover
,
to
set
the
prisoner
free
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
proceeded
to
relate
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
"This
is
strange
indeed
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Bouchier
,
at
the
close
of
theking
's
recital
,
"
and
to
my
thinking
,
is
proof
convincing
that
we
have
todo
with
a
supernatural
being
.
<EOS>
""Supernatura!--pshaw!-
banish
the
idle
notion
,
"
rejoined
Henry
sternly
.
<EOS>
"We
are
all
the
dupes
of
some
jugglery
.
 
<EOS>
The
caitiff
will
doubtless
returnto
the
forest
.
 
<EOS>
Continue
your
search
,
therefore
,
for
him
throughout
thenight
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
catch
him
,
I
promise
you
a
royal
reward
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
rode
back
to
the
castle
,
somewhat
appeased
by
thewholesale
vengeance
he
had
taken
upon
the
offenders
.
<EOS>
In
obedience
to
the
orders
he
had
received
,
Bouchier
,
with
hisfollowers
,
continued
riding
about
the
forest
during
the
whole
night
,
butwithout
finding
anything
to
reward
his
search
,
until
about
dawn
itoccurred
to
him
to
return
to
the
trees
on
which
the
bodies
weresuspended
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
approached
them
he
fancied
he
beheld
a
horsestanding
beneath
the
nearest
tree
,
and
immediately
ordered
hisfollowers
to
proceed
as
noiselessly
as
possible
,
and
to
keep
under
thecover
of
the
wood
.
 
<EOS>
A
nearer
advance
convinced
him
that
his
eyes
hadnot
deceived
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
swart
,
wild
-
looking
horse
that
he
beheld
,
with
eyes
that
flamed
like
carbuncles
,
while
a
couple
of
bodies
,
evidently
snatched
from
the
branches
,
were
laid
across
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
Aglance
at
the
trees
,
too
,
showed
Bouchier
that
they
had
beenconsiderably
lightened
of
their
hideous
spoil
.
<EOS>
Seeing
this
,
Bouchier
dashed
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
noise
,
the
wildhorse
neighed
loudly
,
and
a
dark
figure
instantly
dropped
from
the
treeupon
its
back
,
and
proceeded
to
disencumber
it
of
its
load
.
<EOS>
But
beforethis
could
be
accomplished
,
a
bolt
from
a
cross
-
bow
,
shot
by
one
ofBouchier
's
followers
,
pierced
the
animal
's
brain
.
 
<EOS>
Rearing
aloft
,
it
fellbackwards
in
such
manner
as
would
have
crushed
an
ordinary
rider
,
but
Herne
slipped
off
uninjured
,
and
with
incredible
swiftness
dartedamong
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
The
others
started
in
pursuit
,
and
a
chasecommenced
in
which
the
demon
huntsman
had
to
sustain
the
part
ofthe
deer
--
nor
could
any
deer
have
afforded
better
sport
.
<EOS>
Away
flew
the
pursued
and
pursuers
over
broad
glade
and
throughtangled
glen
,
the
woods
resounding
with
their
cries
.
 
<EOS>
Bouchier
did
notlose
sight
of
the
fugitive
for
a
moment
,
and
urged
his
men
to
push
on;but
,
despite
his
alternate
proffers
and
menaces
,
they
gained
but
littleon
Herne
,
who
,
speeding
towards
the
home
park
,
cleared
its
highpalings
with
a
single
bound
.
<EOS>
Over
went
Bouchier
and
his
followers
,
and
they
then
descried
himmaking
his
way
to
a
large
oak
standing
almost
alone
in
the
centre
of
awide
glade
.
 
<EOS>
An
instant
<EOS>
afterwards
he
reached
the
tree
,
shook
his
armmenacingly
at
his
pursuers
,
and
vanished
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
Bouchier
came
up
,
flung
himself
from
his
pantingsteed
,
and
,
with
his
drawn
sword
in
hand
,
forced
himself
through
a
riftin
its
side
into
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
hollow
within
it
<EOS>
large
enough
toallow
a
man
to
stand
upright
,
and
two
funnel
-
like
holes
ran
upwardsinto
the
branches
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
nothing
,
Bouchier
called
for
a
hunting
-
spear
,
and
thrust
it
as
far
as
he
could
into
the
holes
above
.
<EOS>
The
pointencountered
no
obstruction
except
such
as
was
offered
by
the
wooditself
.
 
<EOS>
He
stamped
upon
the
ground
,
and
sounded
it
on
all
sides
withthe
spear
,
but
with
no
better
success
.
<EOS>
Issuing
forth
he
next
directed
his
attention
to
the
upper
part
of
the
tree
,
which
,
while
he
was
occupied
inside
,
had
been
very
carefully
watchedby
his
followers
,
and
not
content
with
viewing
it
from
below
,
heclambered
into
the
branches
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
had
nothing
to
show
excepttheir
own
leafy
covering
.
<EOS>
The
careful
examination
of
the
ground
about
the
tree
at
length
led
tothe
discovery
of
a
small
hole
among
its
roots
,
about
half
a
dozen
yardsfrom
the
trunk
,
and
though
this
hole
seemed
scarcely
large
enough
toserve
for
an
entrance
to
the
burrow
of
a
fox
,
Bouchier
deemed
itexpedient
to
keep
a
careful
watch
over
it
.
<EOS>
His
investigation
completed
,
he
dispatched
a
sergeant
of
the
guard
tothe
castle
to
acquaint
the
king
with
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Disturbed
by
the
events
of
the
night
,
Henry
obtained
little
sleep
,
and
atan
early
hour
summoned
an
attendant
,
and
demanded
whether
therewere
any
tidings
from
the
forest
<EOS>
The
attendant
replied
that
a
sergeantof
the
guard
was
without
,
sent
by
Captain
Bouchier
with
a
message
forhis
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
The
sergeant
was
immediately
admitted
to
the
royalpresence
,
and
on
the
close
of
his
marvellous
story
the
king
,
who
hadworked
himself
into
a
tremendous
fury
during
its
relation
,
roared
out,"What
!
<EOS>
foiled
again
?
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
But
he
shall
not
escape
,
if
I
have
to
root
up
halfthe
trees
in
the
forest
.
 
<EOS>
Bouchier
and
his
fellows
must
be
bewitched
.
<EOS>
Harkye
,
knaves
:
get
together
a
dozen
of
the
best
woodmen
and
yeomenin
the
castle
--
instantly
,
as

<EOS>
D'ye

<EOS>
Stay

<EOS>
I

and

<EOS>
Summon

quickly

and
bid
a
band
of
the
yeomenof
the
guard
get
ready
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
sprang
from
his
couch
.
<EOS>
The
king
's
commands
were
executed
with
such
alacrity
,
that
by
thetime
he
was
fully
attired
the
whole
of
the
persons
he
had
ordered
to
hesummoned
were
assembled
.
 
<EOS>
Putting
himself
at
their
head
,
he
rodeforth
to
the
home
park
,
and
found
Bouchier
and
his
followers
groupedaround
the
tree
.
<EOS>
"We
are
still
at
fault
,
my
liege
,
"
said
Bouchier
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
see
,
Sir
,
"
replied
the
king
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hew
down
the
tree
instantly
,
knaves
,
"
he
added
to
the
woodmen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fall

--
fall
to
.
<EOS>
"Ropes
were
then
fastened
to
the
head
of
the
tree
,
and
the
welkinresounded
with
the
rapid
strokes
of
the
hatchets
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
task
ofsome
difficulty
,
but
such
zeal
and
energy
were
displayed
by
thewoodmen
that
ere
long
the
giant
trunk
lay
prostrate
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Itshollows
were
now
fully
exposed
to
view
,
but
they
were
empty
.
<EOS>
"Set
<EOS>
fire
to
the
accursed
piece
of
timber
!
<EOS>
"
roared
the
king
,
"
and
burn
itto
dust
,
and
scatter
it
to
the
wind!"At
these
orders
two
yeomen
of
the
guard
advanced
,
and
throwing
downa
heap
of
fagots
,
straw
,
and
other
combustibles
on
the
roots
of
the
tree
,
soon
kindled
a
fierce
fire
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
a
couple
of
woodmen
,
stripped
of
their
jerkins
,
and
withtheir
brawny
arms
bared
to
the
shoulder
,
mounted
on
the
trunk
,
andstrove
to
split
it
asunder
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
keepers
likewise
got
into
thebranches
,
and
peered
into
every
crack
and
crevice
,
in
the
hope
ofmaking
some
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
Amongst
the
latter
was
Will
Sommers
,
whohad
posted
himself
near
a
great
arm
of
the
tree
,
which
he
maintainedwhen
lopped
off
would
be
found
to
contain
the
demon
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
other
expedients
neglected
.
 
<EOS>
A
fierce
hound
had
been
sentinto
the
hole
near
the
roots
of
the
tree
by
Gabriel
Lapp
,
but
after
a
shortabsence
he
returned
howling
and
terrified
,
nor
could
all
the
efforts
ofGabriel
,
seconded
by
a
severe
scourging
with
his
heavy
dog
-
whip
,
induce
him
to
enter
it
again
.
<EOS>
When
the
hound
had
come
forth
,
a
couple
of
yeomen
advanced
toenlarge
the
opening
,
while
a
third
with
a
pick
endeavoured
to
removethe
root
,
which
formed
an
impediment
to
their
efforts
.
<EOS>
"They
may
dig
,
but
they
'll
never
catch
him
,
"
observed
Shoreditch
,
whostood
by
,
to
his
companions
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hunting
a
spirit
is
not
the
same
thing
astraining
and
raising
a
wolf
,
or
earthing
and
digging
out
a
badger
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
loud

"
said
Islington
;
"

think

<EOS>
""I
have
an
arrow
blessed
by
a
priest

"
said
Paddington
,
"
which
I
shall
letfly
at

appears

<EOS>
""Here
<EOS>
he
is
--

"
<EOS>
cried
Will
Sommers
,
as
a
great
white
hornedowl
,
which
had
been
concealed
in
some
part
of
the
tree
,
flew
forth
.
<EOS>
"It
may
be
the
demon
in
that
form

shoot

<EOS>
shoot

"
<EOS>
cried
Shoreditch
.
<EOS>
Paddington
bent
his
bow
.
 
<EOS>
The
arrow
whistled
through
the
air
,
and
inanother
moment
the
owl
fell
fluttering
to
the
ground
completelytransfixed
;
but
it
underwent
no
change
,
as
was
expected
by
thecredulous
archer
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
fire
,
being
kept
constantly
supplied
with
fresh
fagots
,
and
stirred
by
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
,
burnt
bravely
.
 
<EOS>
The
lower
part
ofthe
tree
was
already
consumed
,
and
the
flames
,
roaring
through
thehollow
within
with
a
sound
like
that
of
a
furnace
,
promised
soon
toreduce
it
to
charcoal
.
<EOS>
The
mouth
of
the
hole
having
now
been
widened
,
another
keeper
,
whohad
brought
forward
a
couple
of
lurchers
,
sent
them
into
it
;
but
in
a
fewmoments
they
returned
,
as
the
hound
had
done
,
howling
and
withscared
looks
.
 
<EOS>
Without
heeding
their
enraged
master
,
they
ran
off
,
withtheir
tails
between
their
legs
,
towards
the
castle
.
<EOS>
"I
see
how
it
is

said
Gabriel
,
patting
his
hound
,
who
lookedwistfully
and
half
-
reproachfully
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou

The

"Though
<EOS>
long
ere
this
<EOS>
it
had
become
the
general
opinion
that
it
wasuseless
to
persevere
further
in
the
search
,
the
king
,
with
hischaracteristic
obstinacy
,
would
not
give
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
In
due
time
the
whole
ofthe
trunk
of
the
enormous
tree
was
consumed
,
and
its
branches
castinto
the
fire

<EOS>
The
roots
were
rent
from
the
ground
,
and
a
wide

deeptrench
digged
around

<EOS>
The

traced
forsome

it
was
never

At

The

Comprising

Two
Epochs

the
History

Castle

<EOS>
Amid
the
gloom
hovering
over
the
early
history
of
Windsor
Castleappear
the
mighty
phantoms
of
the
renowned
King
Arthur
and
hisknights
,
for
whom
it
is
said
Merlin
reared
a
magic
fortress
upon
itsheights
,
in
a
great
hall
whereof
,
decorated
with
trophies
of
war
and
ofthe
chase
,
was
placed
the
famous
Round
Table
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
the
antique
taleis
now
worn
out
,
and
no
longer
part
of
our
faith
,
it
is
pleasant
at

torecord
it
,
and
surrendering
ourselves
for
a
while
to
the
sway
of
fancy
,
toconjure
up
the
old
enchanted
castle
on

courtswith
warlike

Windsor

Wyndleshore

so
called
from
the
winding
banks
of
the
riverflowing
past
it
,
was
the
abode
of
the
ancient
Saxon
monarchs
;
and
alegend
is
related
by
William
of
Malmesbury
of
a
woodman
namedWulwin
,
who
being
stricken
with
blindness
,
and
having
visited
eighty
-
seven
churches
and
vainly
implored
their
tutelary
saints
for
relief
,
wasat

restored
to
sight
by
the
touch
of
Edward
the
Confessor
,
whofurther
enhanced
the
boon
by
making
him
keeper
of
his
palace
atWindsor
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
this
story
may
be
doubted
,
it
is
certain
that
thepious
king
above
mentioned
granted
Windsor
to
the
abbot
and
monks
ofSaint
Peter
at
Westminster
,
"
for
the
hope
of
eternal
reward
,
theremission
of
his
sins
,
the
sins
of
his
father
,
mother
,
and
all
hisancestors

to
the
praise
of
Almighty
God

perpetualendowment

William
the
Conqueror
prevailed
upon
Abbot
Edwin
toaccept
in
exchange
for
it
Wakendune
and
Feringes
,
in
Essex
,
togetherwith
three
other
tenements
in
Colchester
;
and
having
obtainedpossession
of
the
coveted
hill
,
he
forthwith
began
to
erect
a
castleupon
it
--
occupying
a
space
of
about
half
a
hide
of
land
.
 
<EOS>
Around
it
heformed
large
parks
,
to
enable
him
to
pursue
his
favourite
pastime
ofhunting
;

he
enacted
and
enforced
severe
laws
for
the
preservationof

game

As
devoted

the
chase

frequently
huntedin
the
forests

Windsor
,

solemnised
some
of

festivals

castle

In
the
succeeding
reign
--

,
that
of
Henry
the
First

the
castle
wasentirely
rebuilt

greatly
enlarged

assuming
somewhat
of
thecharacter
of
a
palatial
residence

before
been
little
more
than
astrong
hunting

seat

The
structure
then
erected
in
all
probabilityoccupied
the

nothing
remains

In

Henry
celebrated
the

magnificence
within

In

<EOS>
Proof
that
Windsor
Castle
was
regarded
as
the
second
fortress
in
therealm
is
afforded
by
the
treaty
of
peace
between
the
usurper
<EOS>
Stephenand
<EOS>
the
Empress
Maud
,
in
which
it
is
coupled
with
the
Tower
of
Londonunder
the
designation
of
Mota

Windsor
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
signing
of
the
treaty
itwas
committed
to
the
custody
of
Richard
de
Lucy
,
who
was
continuedin
<EOS>
the
office
of
keeper
by
Henry
the
Second

<EOS>
In
the
reign
of
this
monarch
many
repairs
were
made
in
the
castle
,
towhich
a
vineyard
was
attached
--
the
cultivation
of
the

being
atthis

extensively
practised
throughout

Strange
as
thecircumstance
may
now
appear
<EOS>

Stow
mentions
that
vines
grew
inabundance
in
the

park
in

reign

<EOS>
of
Richard

<EOS>
,
thewine

consumed
at

<EOS>
It
is
related
by
Fabian
that
Henry
,
stung
by
the
disobedience
andingratitude
of
his
sons
,
caused
an
allegorical
picture
to
be
painted
,
representing
an
old
eagle
assailed
by
four
young
ones
,
which
he
placedin
one
of
the
chambers
of
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
When
asked
the
meaning
of
thedevice

be
replied
,
"
I
am
the
old
eagle
,
and
the
four
eaglets
are
mysons
,
<EOS>
Who
cease
not

pursue
my

The

my

my

best

loved
son

and
who
yet
is
the
most
eager
for
my
destruction

<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
his
departure
for
the
holy
wars
Richard
Coeur
de
Lion
entrusted
thegovernment
of
the
castle
to
Hugh
de
Pudsey
,
Bishop
of
Durham
and
Earlof
Northumberland
;
but
a
fierce
dispute
arising
between
the
warrior
-
prelate
and
his
ambitious
colleague
,
William
Longchamp
,
Bishop
of
Ely
,
he
was
seized
and
imprisoned
by
the
latter
,
and
compelled
to
surrenderthe
castle

<EOS>
After
an
extraordinary
display
of
ostentation

Longchampwas
ousted
in
his
turn

<EOS>
On
the
arrival
of
the
news
of
Richard

the

In
John

reign
the
castle
became
the
scene
of
a
foul
and
terrible
eventWilliam
de
Braose
,
a
powerful
baron
,
having
offended
the
king
,
his
wifeMaud
was
ordered
to
deliver
up
her

for

Butinstead
of
complying
with
the
injunction

rashly
returned

Upon

enclosing
them
in
a
recess
in

of
the

<EOS>
Sorely
pressed
by
the
barons
in
1215
,
John
sought
refuge
within
thecastle

in

signed
the

A
curious
account
of
his
frantic
demeanour
,
after
divestinghimself
of
so
much
power
and
extending
so
greatly
the
liberties
of
thesubject
,
is
given
by
Holinshed:--"Having
acted
so
far
contrary
to

the

was
right
sorrowful
in

,
cursed
his

the
hour
in
which

wishing

did
bite
now
on

,
now
on
another
,
as
hewalked
,
and
oft
brake
the
same
in
pieces
when
he
had
done
,
and
withsuch
disordered
behaviour
and
furious
gestures
<EOS>
he
uttered
his
grief
,
that
the
noblemen
very
well
perceived
the
inclination
of
his
inwardaffection
concerning
these
things
before
the
breaking
-
up
of
the
council
,
and
therefore
sore
lamented
the
state
of
the
realm
,
guessing
whatwould
follow
of
his
impatience
,
and
displeasant
taking
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
faithless
king
made
an
attempt
to
regain
his
lost
power

warbreaking
out
afresh
in
the
following
year

a
numerous
army
,
under

besieged
the

wasstoutly
defended
by
Inglehard

The
barons
,
however
,
learning
that
John
was
marching
through
Norfolk

Suffolk
,
and
ravaging
the
country
,
hastily
raised
the
siege

advanced
tomeet
him

But
he
avoided

<EOS>
thelatter

it
is
conjectured

referring
to
the
erection
of
a
new
great
hallwithin
the

,
there
being
already
a
hall
of
small

<EOS>
inthe

,
an

During
the
greater

proceeded
with
unabated
activity

Carpenters
weremaintained

In

building
an
apartment
for

sixty

along

with

<EOS>
The
chapel
,
as
appears
from
an
order
toWalter

,
Archbishop
of

,
had
a
Galilee

a
cloister

a

covered

a
stone
turret
in

holding

Withinside
it

made
to
appear
like
stone

work
withgood
ceiling
and

and
it
contained
four
gilded
images
.
<EOS>
This
structure
is
supposed
to
have
been
in
existence
,
under
thedesignation
of
the
Old
College
Church
,
in

,
by

it

<EOS>
Traces
of
its
architecture
have
been
discovered
bydiligent
antiquarian
research
in
the
south
ambulatory
of
the
Dean'sCloister
,
and
in
the
door
behind
the
altar
in
St.
 
George
's
Chapel
,
thelatter
of
which
is
conceived
to
have
formed
the
principal
entrance
tothe
older
structure

and
has
been
described
as
exhibiting
"
one
of
themost
beautiful
specimens
which
time
and
innovation
have
respected
ofthe
elaborate
ornamental
work
of

.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
1241
Henry
commenced
operations
upon
the
outworks
of
the
castle
,
and
the
three
towers
on
the
western
side
of
the
lower
ward
--
<EOS>
now
knownas
the
Curfew
,
the
Garter
,

Towers
--
were
erected
byhim

<EOS>
He
also
continued
the

discoverable
in

walls
of
the
houses
of
the
alms
-
knights
as
far
as
the
tower
nowbearing
his

.
 
<EOS>
From
thence
it
is
concluded
that
the
ramparts
ranalong
the
east
side
of
the
upper
ward
to
a
tower
occupying
the
site
ofthe
Wykeham
or
Winchester
Tower

The
three
towers
at

the
architecture
of
thethirteenth

.
 
<EOS>
The
lower
storey
of
the
Curfew
Tower
,
which

The

TheGarter
Tower

The

<EOS>
On

24th

issued
a

enjoining

"The

they
wereafterwards
resumed

Comprising
the
Third
Great
Epoch
in
the
History
of
theCastle
--
And
showing
how
the
Most
Noble
Order
of
the
Garter
wasinstituted
.
<EOS>
Strongly
attached
to
the
place
of
his
birth
,
Edward
the
Third
,
by
hisletters
patent
dated
from
Westminster
,
in
the
twenty
-
second
year
of
hisreign
,
now
founded
the
ancient
chapel
established
by
Henry
the
First
,
and
dedicated
it
to
the
Virgin
,
Saint
George
of
Cappadocia
,
and
SaintEdward
the
Confessor
;
ordaining
that
to
the
eight
canons
appointed
byhis
predecessor
there
should
be
added
one
custos
,
fifteen
morecanons
,
and
twenty
-
four
alms
-
knights
;
the
whole
to
be
maintained
outof
the
revenues
with
which
the
chapel
was
to
be
endowed
.
 
<EOS>
Theinstitution
was
confirmed
by
Pope
Clement
the
Sixth
,
by
a
bull
issued
atAvignon
the
13th
of
November
1351.In
1349
,
before
the
foundation
of
the
college
had
been
confirmed
,
asabove
related
,
Edward
instituted
the
Order
of
the
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
The
origin
ofthis
illustrious
Order
has
been
much
disputed
.
 
<EOS>
By
some
writers
it
hasbeen
ascribed
to
Richard
Coeur
de
Lion
,
who
is
said
to
have
girded
aleathern
band
round
the
legs
of
his
bravest
knights
in
.
<EOS>
Palestine
.
 
<EOS>
Byothers
it
has
been
asserted
that
it
arose
from
the
word
"
garter
"
havingbeen
used
as
a
watchword
by
Edward
at
the
battle
of
Cressy
.
 
<EOS>
Othersagain
have
stoutly
maintained
that
its
ringlike
form
bore
mysteriousreference
to
the
Round
Table
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
popular
legend
,
to
which
,
despite
the
doubts
thrown
upon
it
,
credence
still
attaches
,
declares
itsorigin
to
be
as
follows
:
Joan
,
Countess
of
Salisbury
,
a
beautiful
dame
,
ofwhom
Edward
was
enamoured
,
while
dancing
at
a
high
festivalaccidentally
slipped
her
garter
,
of
blue
embroidered
velvet
.
 
<EOS>
It
waspicked
up
by
her
royal
partner
,
who
,
noticing
the
significant
looks
of
hiscourtiers
on
the
occasion
,
used
the
words
to
them
which
afterwards.became
the
motto
of
the
Order--
<EOS>
"
Honi
soit
qui
mal
y
pense
;
"
adding
that"in
a
short
time
they
should
see
that
garter
advanced
to
so
high
honourand
estimation
as
to
account
themselves
happy
to
wear
it
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
whatever
may
have
originated
the
Order
,
it
unquestionably
owes
itsestablishment
to
motives
of
policy
.
 
<EOS>
Wise
as
valiant
,
and
bent
uponprosecuting
his
claim
to
the
crown
of
France
,
Edward
,
as
a
means
ofaccomplishing
his
object
,
resolved
to
collect
beneath
his
standard
thebest
knights
in
Europe
,
and
to
lend
a
colour
to
the
design
,
he
gave
forththat
he
intended
a
restoration
of
King
Arthur
's
Round
Table
,
andaccordingly
commenced
constructing
within
the
castle
a
large
circularbuilding
of
two
hundred
feet
in
diameter
,
in
which
he
placed
a
roundtable
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
completion
of
the
work
,
he
issued
proclamationsthroughout
England
,
Scotland
,
France
,
Burgundy
,
Flanders
,
Brabant
,
and
the
Empire
,
inviting
all
knights
desirous
of
approving
their
valour
toa
solemn
feast
and
jousts
to
be
holden
within
the
castle
of
Windsor
onSaint
George
's
Day
,
1345
.
 
<EOS>
The
scheme
was
completely
successful
.
<EOS>
The
flower
of
the
chivalry
of
Europe
--
excepting
that
of
Philip
the
Sixthof
France
,
who
,
seeing
through
the
design
,
interdicted
the
attendanceof
his
knights
-
were
present
at
the
tournament
,
which
was
graced
byEdward
and
his
chief
nobles
,
together
with
his
queen
and
threehundred
of
her
fairest
dames
,
"
adorned
with
all
imaginable
gallantry
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
chivalrous
convocation
<EOS>
the
institution
of
the
Order
of
the
Garterwas
arranged
;
but
before
its
final
establishment
Edward
assembled
hisprincipal
barons
and
knights
,
to
determine
upon
the
regulations
<EOS>
,
whenit
was
decided
that
the
number
should
be
limited
to
twenty
-
six
.
<EOS>
The
first
installation
took
place
on
the
anniversary
of
Saint

,
thepatron
of
the
Order
,
1349
,
when

and
hearing

marched
bareheaded
in
solemn
procession
to
thechapel
of
Saint

,
then
recently
rebuilt
,
where
mass
wasperformed
by
William
Edington
,
Bishop

after
which
theypartook
of
a

The
insignia
of
the

were

,
the

added
by
Henrythe

<EOS>
The
mantle
,
as

substituted
by
Henrythe
Sixth
,
the

being
adorned
with
the
arms
of
SaintGeorge
,
embroidered
within
a
garter
.
 
<EOS>
Little
is
known
of
the
materials
ofwhich
the
early
garter
was
composed
;
but
it
is
supposed
to
have
beenadorned
with
gold
,
and
fastened
with
a
buckle
of
the
same
metal
.
 
<EOS>
Themodern
garter
is
of

It
is
worn
onthe

<EOS>
The
most
magnificent
garter
thatever
graced
a
sovereign
was
that
presented
to
Charles
the
First
byGustavus
Adolphus
,
King
of
Sweden
,
each

Well

the

flocked

TheQueen

Edward

was
present
at
the
jousts

it

that
John

commenting
upon
the

shrewdly
observed
"
that
he
never
saw
or
knew
such
royal
shows
andfeastings
without
some
after

reckoning
.
<EOS>
"
The
same
monarch
replied
tohis
kingly
captor
,
who
sought
to
rouse
him
from
dejection
,
on
anotheroccasion--
"
Quomodo
cantabimus
canticum
in
terra
aliena!"That
<EOS>
his
works
might
not
be
retarded
for
want
of
hands
,
<EOS>
Edward
in
thetwenty
-
fourth
year
of
his
reign
appointed
John

master

with
a
power

command
to

,
to
assist
him

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
powers
were
fully
actedupon
at
a
later
period
,
when
some
of
the
workmen
,
having
left

were
thrown
into
Newgate

<EOS>
In
1356
WILLIAM
OF
WYKEHAM
was
constituted
superintendent
of
theworks
,
with
the
same
powers
as
John
de
Sponlee
,
and
his
appointmentmarks
an
important
era
in
the
annals
of
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
Originally
secretaryto
Edward
the
Third
,
this
remarkable
man
became
Bishop
of
Winchesterand
prelate
of
the
Garter
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
solicited
the
bishopric
,
it
is
said
thatEdward
told
him
he
was
neither
a
priest
nor
a
scholar
;
to
which
hereplied
that
he
would
soon
be
the
one
,
and
in
regard
to
the
other
,
hewould
make
more
scholars
than
all
the
bishops
of
England
ever
did
.
<EOS>
Hemade
good
his
word
by
founding
the
collegiate
school
at
Winchester
,
and
erecting
New
College
at
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Winchester
Tower
wasfinished
,
he
caused
the
words
,
HOC
FECIT
WYKEHAM
,
to
be
carvedupon
it
;
and
the
king
,
offended
at
his
presumption
,
<EOS>
Wykeham
turnedaway
his
displeasure
by
declaring
that
the
inscription
meant
that
thecastle
had
made
him
,
and
not
that
he
had
made
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
acurious
coincidence
that
this
tower
,
after
a
lapse
of
four
centuries
anda
half
,
should
become
the
residence
of
an
architect
possessing
thegenius
of
Wykeham
,
and
who
,
like
him
,
had
rebuilt
the
kingly
edifice
--
SIR
JEFFRY
WYATVILLE.William
of
Wykeham
retired
from
office
,
loaded
with
honours
,
in
1362,and
was
succeeded
by
William

Mulso

<EOS>
He
was
interred
in

"In

Holinshed
relates

old

caused
diversother
fine

sumptuous
works
to
be
set
up

so
that
almost
all
the

that

were
sent
for
and
employed
about

The
old

were
probably
the
remains

As
the
original
chapel
dedicated

Saint
George
was
demolished
byEdward

Fourth

its
position

form
can
not
be
clearly
determined

But
a
conjecture
has
been
hazarded
that
it
occupied

extended
farther

Edward

<EOS>
Finding
the
foundation
and
walls
of
Saint

's
Chapel
muchdilapidated
and
decayed
,
Edward
the

resolved
to
pull
down
thepile
,
and
build
a
larger
and
statelier
structure
in
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
With
thisview
,
he
constituted
Richard
Beauchamp
,
Bishop
of
Salisbury
,
surveyorof
the
works
,
from
whose
designs
arose
the
present
beautiful
edifice
.
<EOS>
To
enable
the
bishop
to
accomplish
the
work
,
power
was
given
him
toremove
all
obstructions
,
and
to
enlarge
the
space
by
the
demolition
ofthe
three
buildings
then
commonly
called
Clure
's
Tower
,
Berner'sTower
,
and
the
Almoner
's
Tower
.
<EOS>
The
zeal
and
assiduity
with
which
Beauchamp
prosecuted
his
task
isadverted
to
in
the
patent
of
his
appointment
to
the
office
of
chancellorof
<EOS>

Garter
,
the
preamble
whereof
recites

"
that
out

Sir
Reginald
Bray
,
prime
minister
of
Henry
the
Seventh
,
succeeded
Bishop
Beauchamp
as
surveyor
of

works
,
and
it
was
byhim
that
the
matchless
roof
of
the
choir
and
other
parts
of
the
fabricwere
built
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
frequent

Bray
's

,
sometimessingle
,
sometimes
impaling
his

,
in
many
parts

has
led
to
the
supposition
that
he
himself
contributedlargely
to
the
expense
of

<EOS>
The
groined
ceiling
of
the

not
commenced
till
the
twenty

seventh
year
of
the

were
decorated
withvanes

supported
by
gilt
figures
of
lions
,
antelopes

greyhounds

,
the
want
of
which
is
still
a
detriment
to
the
external
beauty
ofthe

St.
 
George
's
Chapel

"
says
Mr.
 
Poynter

"
isperhaps
,
without
exception
,
the
most
beautiful
specimen
of

it

very
improperly

The

the

in

It
is
,
in

a
waggon

broken

that

to
say
,
groins

It
is
not

it
is
unique
in
its
proportions
,
in
which
the
exact
meanseems
to
be
attained
between
the
poverty
and
monotony
of
a
waggon
-
headed
ceiling
and
the
ungraceful
effect
of
a
mere
groined
roof
with
adepressed
roof
or
large
span
--
to
which
may
be
added
,
that
with
arichness
of
effect
scarcely
,
if
at
all
,
inferior
to
fan
tracery
,
it
is
free
fromthose
abrupt

other

when
the

Commenced
by
Henry
the
Seventh
as
a
mausoleum
,
but
abandoned
forthe
chapel
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
this
structure
was
granted
by
Henrythe
Eighth
to
Wolsey
,
who
,
intending
it
as
a
place
of
burial
for
himself
,
erected
within
it
a
sumptuous
monument
of
black
and
white
marble
,
with
eight
large
brazen
columns
placed
around
it
,
and
four
others
in

At
the
time
of
the
cardinal

disgrace
,
when
the
building
reverted
to

,
the
monument
was
far
advanced
towards
completion
--
the

of
4280
ducats
having
been
paid
to
Benedetto

a
Florentinesculptor

This
tomb
was
stripped

Fullinstructions

Thepavement

On

<EOS>
so
runs
the

"
On
the

Between

surmounted
by
a

Over
this

.
 
<EOS>
It
would
be
matter
of
infinite
regret
that
this
greatdesign
was
never
executed
,
if
its
destruction
by
the
Parliamentaryplunderers
would
not
in
that
case
have
been
also
matter
of
certainty
.
<EOS>
Charles
the
First
intended
to
fit
up
this
structure
as
a
royal
mausoleum
,
but
was
diverted
from
the
plan
by
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
.
 
<EOS>
It
wasafterwards
used
as
a
chapel
by
James
the
Second
,
and
mass
waspublicly
performed
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
ceiling
was
painted
by
Verrio
,
and
thewalls
highly
ornamented
;
but
the
decorations
were
greatly
injured
bythe
fury
of
an
anti

Catholic
mob
,
who
assailed
the
building
,
anddestroyed
its
windows
,
on
the
occasion
of
a
banquet
given
to
thePope
's
nuncio
by
the

<EOS>
In
this
state
it
continued
till
the

the
desire

the
history
of

hasled
to
the

digression
.
 
<EOS>
About
the

time
that
the
chapelwas
built
,
habitations
for
the
dean
and
canons
were
erected
on
thenorth

east
of

while
another

The

In

was
accomplished

when
a

there
the
water
plenteously
did
rise
thirteen
feet
high
.
<EOS>
"
In
themiddle
of
the

was
erected
a
magnificent
fountain
,
consisting

About
this

Fewer
additions
were
made
to
Windsor
Castle
by

than
mighthave
been
expected
from
her
predilection
for
it
as
a
place
of
residence

She
extended

the

Elizabeth
often
hunted

which
was
by
no

Her
fondness

<EOS>
ON
the
Restoration
the
castle
resumed
its
splendour
,
and
presented
astriking
contrast
to
the
previous
gloomy
period
.
 
<EOS>
The
terrace
,
with
itsfestive
groups
,
resembled
a
picture
by
Watteau
,
the
courts
resoundedwith
laughter
,
and
the
velvet
sod
of
the
home
park
was
as
oftenpressed
by
the
foot
of
frolic
beauty
as
by
that
of
the
tripping
deer
.
<EOS>
Seventeen
state
apartments
were
erected
by
Sir
Christopher
Wren
,
under
the
direction
of
Sir
John
Denham
.
 
<EOS>
The
ceilings
were
painted
byVerrio
,
and
the
walls
decorated
with
exquisite
carvings
by
GrinlingGibbons
.
 
<EOS>
A
grand
staircase
was
added
at
the
same
time
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
thechambers
were
hung
with
tapestry
,
and
all
adorned
with
pictures
andcostly
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
The
addition
made
to
the
castle
by
Charles
was
thepart
of
the
north
front
,
then
called
the
"
Star
Building
,
"
from
the
star
ofthe
Order
of
the
Garter
worked
in
colours
in
the
front
of
it
,
but
nowdenominated
the
"
Stuart
Building
,
"
extending
eastward
along
theterrace
from
<EOS>
Henry
the
Seventh
's
building
one
hundred
and
seventyfeet
.
 
<EOS>
In
1676
the
ditch
was
filled
up
,
and
the
terrace
carried
along
thesouth
and
east
fronts
of
the
castle
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
original
character
of
the
castle
was
completelydestroyed
and
Italianised
.
 
<EOS>
The
beautiful
and
picturesque
irregularitiesof
the
walls
were
removed
,
the
towers
shaved
off
,
the
windowstransformed
into
commonplace
circular
-
headed
apertures
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
thecastle
remained
for
more
than
a
century
.
<EOS>
Edward
the
Third
's
Tower
,
indifferently
called
the
Earl
Marshal
's
Towerand
the
Devil
Tower
,
and
used
as
a
place
of
confinement
for
stateprisoners
,
was
now
allotted
to
the
maids
of
honour
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
intended
byCharles
to
erect
a
monument
in
honour
of
his
martyred
father
on
thesite
of
the
tomb
-
house
,
which
he
proposed
to
remove
,
and70,000
pounds
were
voted
by
Parliament
for
this
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
The
design
,
however
,
was
abandoned
under
the
plea
that
the
body
could
not
befound
,
though
it
was
perfectly
well
known
where
it
lay
.
 
<EOS>
The
real
motive
,
probably
,
was
that
Charles
had
already
spent
the
money
.
<EOS>
In
1680
an
equestrian
statue
of
Charles
the
Second
,
executed
byStrada
,
at
the
expense
of
Tobias
Rustat
,
formerly
housekeeper

<EOS>
It
nowstands
at
the
lower

of
the

.
 
<EOS>
The
sculptures
on
thepedestal
were
designed
by
Grinling
Gibbons
;
and
Horace
Walpolepleasantly
declared
that
the
statue
had
no
other
merit
than
to
attractattention
to
them
.
<EOS>
In
old
times
a
road
,
forming
a
narrow
irregular
avenue
,
ran
through
thewoods
from
the
foot
of
the
castle
to
Snow
Hill
but
this
road
having
beenneglected
during
a
long
series
of
years
,
the
branches
of
the
trees
andunderwood
had
so
much
encroached
upon
it
as
to
render
it
whollyimpassable

<EOS>
A
grand
avenue
,
two
hundred
and
forty
feet
wide
,
wasplanned
by
Charles
in
its
place
,
and
the
magnificent

by

Queen

inimproving
which
nearly
40,000
pounds
were
expended

In
1707
theextensive
avenue
running
almost
parallel
with
the
Long
Walk
,
andcalled
the
"
Queen

was
planted
by

three

a

road
was
formed
through

also
planned
on

The

rarely
used
Windsor
asa
residence

preferring
Hampton

did
not
actually
live
in

in
the
Queen'sLodge
--
a
large
detached

with
no
pretension
to

,
which
he
himself
erected
opposite

,
at
a
costof
nearly
44,000

<EOS>
With
most
praiseworthy
zeal
,
and
almostentirely
at
his
own
expense
,
this
monarch
undertook
the
restoration
ofSaint
George
's
Chapel
.
 
<EOS>
The
work
was
commenced
in

,
occupiedthree
years
,
and
was
executed
by
Mr.

,
isabout
four

<EOS>
On
the

,
and
nearly
on
the

,
a

to
Norden

this
park
contained
3050
acres;but
when
surveyed
by
George
the

it
was
found
to
consist
of
3800acres
,
of
which
200
were
covered
with
water

At
that
time
the
parkwas
over
grown
with
fern
and
rushes
,
and
abounded
in
bogs

which
in
many

were
dangerous

the

Some

his

that

no

<EOS>
IT
was
now
the
joyous
month
of
June
;
and
where
is
June
so
joyous
as
within
the
courts
and
halls
of
peerless
Windsor
?
<EOS>
Where
does
the

shine
so
brightly
as
upon
its
stately
gardens
and
broad
terraces
,
itsmatchless
parks
,
its
silver
belting
river
and
its
circumference
of
proud
andregal
towers
?
<EOS>
Nowhere
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
seasons
Windsor
is
magnificent
:
whether
,
in
winter
,
she
looks
upon
her
garnitures
of
woods
stripped
oftheir
foliage
--
her
river
covered
with
ice
--
or
the
wide
expanse
of
countryaround
her
sheeted
with
snow
--
or
,
in
autumn
,
gazes
on
the
samescene
--
a
world
of
golden
-
tinted
leaves
,
brown
meadows
,
or
glowingcornfields
.
 
<EOS>
But
summer
is
her
season
of
beauty
<EOS>
--
June
is
the
monthwhen
her
woods
are
fullest
and
greenest
;
when
her
groves
areshadiest
;
her
avenues
most
delicious
;
when
her
river
sparkles
like
adiamond

;
when
town
and

,
mansion

andtower
,
hill
and
vale
,
the
distant
capital
itself
--
all
within

--
are
seen
tothe
highest
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
At
such
a
season
it
is
impossible
to
behold
fromafar
the
heights
of
Windsor
,
crowned
,
like
the
Phrygian
goddess
,
by
acastled
diadem
,
and
backed
by
lordly
woods
,
and
withhold
a
burst
ofenthusiasm
and
delight
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
equally
impossible
,
at
such
a
season
,
to
stand
on
the
grand
northern
terrace
,
and
gaze
first
at
the
proud
pileenshrining
the
sovereign
mistress
of

,
and
then
gaze
on
theunequalled
prospect
spread
out
before

,
embracing
in
its

kind
of
beauty
that
the
country
can
boast
,
and
not
be
struck
withthe
thought
that

with
the
wide

smiling
,
and
populous
district
around
it
<EOS>
,
form
an
apt
representation
of
the
British
sovereign
and
her
dominions
.
 
<EOS>
There
stands
the
castle
,
dating
back
as
far
as
the
Conquest
,
and
boasting
since
its
foundation
a
succession
of
royal
inmates
,
while
at
its
foot
lies
a
region
of
unequalled
fertility
and
beauty
-
full
of
happy
homes
,
and
loving
,
loyal
hearts
--
a
miniature
of
the
old
country
and
its
inhabitants
.
 
<EOS>
What
though
the
smiling
landscape
may
he
darkened
by
a
passing
cloud!--what
though
a
momentary
gloom
may
gather
round
the
august
brow
of
the
proud
pile
!
-
<EOS>
the
cloud
will
speedily
vanish
,
the
gloom
disperse
,
and
the
bright
and
sunny
scene
look
yet
brighter
and
sunnier
from
the
contrast
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
chance
of
the
writer
of
these
lines
upon
one
occasion
tobehold
his
sovereign
under
circumstances
which
he
esteems
singularlyfortunate
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
taking
rapid
exercise
with
the
prince
upon
thesouth
side
of
the
garden
-
terrace
.
 
<EOS>
All
at
once
the
royal
pair
paused
atthe
summit
of
the
ascent
leading
from
George
the
Fourth
's
gateway
.
<EOS>
The
prince
disappeared
along
the
eastern
terrace
,
leaving
the
queenalone
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
she
stood
,
her
slight
,
faultless
figure
sharply
definedagainst
the
clear
sky
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
was
wanting
to
complete
the
picture
:
the
great
bay
-
windows
of
the
Victoria
Tower
on
the
one
hand
--
thebalustrade
of
the
terrace
on
the
other
--
the
home
park
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
It
wasthrilling
to
feel
that
that
small
,
solitary
figure
comprehended
all
themight
and
majesty
of
England
--
and
a
thousand
kindling
aspirationswere
awakened
by
the
thought
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
,
as
has
been
said
,
the
merry
month
of
June
,
and
WindsorCastle
looked
down
in
all
its
magnificence
upon
the
pomp
of
woods
,
and
upon
the
twelve
fair
and
smiling
counties
lying
within
its
ken
.
 
<EOS>
Ajoyous
stir
was
within
its
courts
--
the
gleam
of
arms
and
<EOS>
the
fluttering
ofbanners
was
seen
upon
its
battlements
and
towers
,
and
the
ringing
ofbells
,
the
beating
of
drums
,
and
the
fanfares
of
trumpets
,
mingled
withthe
shouting
of
crowds
and
the
discharge
of
ordnance
.
<EOS>
Amidst
this
tumult
a
grave
procession
issued
from
the
deanery
,
andtook
its
way
across
the
lower
quadrangle
,
which
was
thronged
withofficers
and
men
-
at
-
arms
,
in
the
direction
of
the
lower
gate
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
itarrived
there
a
distant
gun
was
heard
,
and
an
answering
peal
wasinstantly
fired
from
the
culverins
of
the
Curfew
Tower
,
while
a
broadstandard
,
emblazoned
with
the
arms
of
France
and
England
within
thegarter
,
and
having
for
supporters
the
English
lion
crowned
and
the
reddragon
sinister
,
was
reared
upon
the
keep
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
preparationsbetokened
the
approach
of
the
king
,
who
was
returning
to
the
castleafter
six
weeks
'
absence
.
<EOS>
Though
information
of
the
king
's
visit
to
the
castle
had
only
precededhim
by
a
few
hours
,
everything
was
ready
for
his
reception
,
and
thegreatest
exertions
were
used
to
give
splendour
to
it
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
stubborn
and
tyrannical
nature
,
Henry
was
a
popularmonarch
,
and
never
showed
himself
before
his
subjects
but
he
gainedtheir
applauses
;
his
love
of
pomp
,
his
handsome
person
,
and
manlydeportment
,
always
winning
him
homage
from
the
multitude
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
noperiod
was
he
in
a
more
critical
position
than
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
Themeditated
divorce
from
Catherine
of
Arragon
was
a
step
which
found
nosympathy
from
the
better
portion
of
his
subjects
,
while
the
ill
-
assortedunion
of
Anne
Boleyn
,
an
avowed
Lutheran
,
which
it
was
known
wouldfollow
it
,
was
equally
objectionable
.
 
<EOS>
The
seeds
of
discontent
had
beenwidely
sown
in
the
capital
;
and
tumults
had
occurred
which
,
thoughpromptly
checked
,
had
nevertheless
alarmed
the
king
,
coupled
as
theywere
with
the
disapprobation
of
his
ministers
,
the
sneeringremonstrances
of
France
,
the
menaces
of
the
Papal
See
,
and
the
openhostilities
of
Spain
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
characteristic
obstinacy
of
his
nature
kepthim
firm
to
his
point
,
and
he
resolved
to
carry
it
,
be
the
consequenceswhat
they
might
.
<EOS>
All
his
efforts
to
win
over
Campeggio
proved
fruitless
.
 
<EOS>
The
legate
wasdeaf
to
his
menaces
or
promises
,
<EOS>
well
knowing
that
to
aid
Anne
Boleynwould
be
to
seriously
affect
the
interests
of
the
Church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
The
affair
,
however
,
so
long
and
so
artfully
delayed
,
was
now
drawingto
a
close
.
 
<EOS>
A
court
was
appointed
by
the
legates
to
be
holden
on
the18th
of
June
,
at
Blackfriars
,
to
try
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
Gardiner
had
beenrecalled
from
Rome
to
act
as
counsel
for
Henry
;
and
the
monarch
,
determining
to
appear
by
proxy
at
the
trial
,
left
his
palace
at
Bridewellthe
day
before
it
was
to
come
on
,
and
set
out
with
Anne
Boleyn
and
hischief
attendants
for
Windsor
Castle
.
<EOS>
Whatever
secret
feelings
might
be
entertained
against
him
,
Henry
wasreceived
by
the
inhabitants
of
Windsor
with
every
demonstration
ofloyalty
and
affection
.
 
<EOS>
Deafening
shouts
rent
the
air
as
he
approached;blessings
and
good
wishes
were
showered
upon
him
;
and
hundreds
ofcaps
were
flung
into
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
But
noticing
that
Anne
Boleyn
wasreceived
with
evil
looks
and
in
stern
silence
,
and
construing
this
into
anaffront
to
himself
,
Henry
not
only
made
slight
and
haughtyacknowledgment
of
the
welcome
<EOS>
given
him
,
but
looked
out
for
somepretext
to
manifest
his
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
Luckily
none
was
afforded
him
,
and
he
entered
the
castle
in
a
sullen
mood
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
spent
in
gentle
exercise
within
the
home
park
and
on
theterrace
,
and
the
king
affected
the
utmost
gaiety
and
indifference
;
butthose
acquainted
with
him
could
readily
perceive
he
was
ill
at
ease
.
 
<EOS>
Inthe
evening
he
remained
for
some
time
alone
in
his
closet
penningdespatches
,
and
then
summoning
an
attendant
,
ordered
him
to
bringCaptain
Bouchier
into
his
presence
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
,
Bouchier
,
"
he
said
,
as
the
officer
made
his
appearance
,
"
haveyou
obeyed
my
instructions
in
regard
to
Mabel
Lyndwood?""I
<EOS>
have
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Bouchier
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
obedience
to
your
majesty'scommands
,
immediately
after
your
arrival
at
the
castle
I
rode
to
theforester
's
hut
,
and
ascertained
that
the
damsel
was
still
there
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
looking
as
beautiful
as
ever
,
I
'll
be
sworn
!
"
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
I
had
seen
her
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Bouchier
;
"
but
I
donot
think
she
could
have
ever
looked
more
beautiful
.
<EOS>
""I
am
well
assured
of
it
,
"
replied
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
pressure
of
affairs
duringmy
absence
from
the
castle
had
banished
her
image
from
my
mind
;
butnow
it
returns
as
forcibly
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
have
so
arranged
it
<EOS>
thatshe
will
be
brought
hither
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
night?"Bouchier
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"It
is
well
,
"
pursued
Henry
;
"
but
what
more?--for
you
look
as
if
you
hadsomething
further
to
declare
.
<EOS>
""Your
majesty
will
not
have
forgotten
how
you
exterminated
the
band
ofHerne
the
Hunter
?
"
said
Bouchier
.
<EOS>
"Mother
<EOS>
of
Heaven
,
no
!
"
cried
the
king
,
starting
up;"I
have
not
forgottenit
.
 
<EOS>
What
of
them
?
<EOS>
--Ha
!
<EOS>
have
they
come
to
life
<EOS>
again?--do
<EOS>
they
scour
theparks
once
more
?
<EOS>
That
were
indeed
a
marvel!""What
<EOS>
I
have
to
relate
<EOS>
is
almost
as
great
a
marvel
,
"
returned
Bouchier
.
<EOS>
"I
have
not
heard
of
the
resurrection
of
the
band
though
for
aught
<EOS>
Iknow
it
may
have
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
But
Herne
has
been
seen
again
in
theforest
.
 
<EOS>
Several
of
the
keepers
have
been
scared
by
him
--
travellers
havebeen
affrighted
and
plundered
--
and
no
one
will
now
cross
the
greatpark
after
nightfall
.
""Amazement
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
,
again
seating
himself
;
once
let
the
divorcebe
settled
,
and
I
will
effectually
check
the
career
of
this
lawless
andmysterious
being
.
<EOS>
""Pray
<EOS>
heaven
<EOS>
your
majesty
may
be
able
to
do
so
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Bouchier

<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
have
always
been
of
opinion
that
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
thedemon
would
be
by
the
aid
of
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
unassailable
by
mortalweapons
.
<EOS>
""It
would
almost
seem
so
,
"
said
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
I
do
not
like
to
yieldto
the
notion
.
<EOS>
""I
shrewdly
suspect
that
old
Tristram
Lyndwood
,
the
grandsire
of
thedamsel
upon
whom
your
majesty
has
deigned
to
cast
your
regards
,
is
insome
way

other
leagued

"
said
Bouchier
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
Isaw
him
with
a
tall
hideous
-
looking
personage
,
whose
name
Iunderstand
to
be
Valentine
Hagthorne
,
and
who
,
I
feel
persuaded
,
mustbe
one
of
the
remnants
of
the
demon
hunter
's
band
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
did
you
not
arrest
him
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Henry
.
<EOS>
"I
did
not
like
to
do
so
without
your
majesty
's
authority
,
"
repliedBouchier
.
 
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
I
could
scarcely
arrest
Hagthorne
without
at
thesame
time
securing
the
old
forester
,
which
might
have
alarmed
thedamsel
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
ready
to
execute
your
injunctions
now
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
a
party
of
men
go
in
search
of
Hagthorne
to
-
night
"
replied
Henry;"and
<EOS>
while
Mabel
is
brought
to
the
castle
to
-
morrow
,
do
you
arrest
oldTristram
,
and
keep
him
in
custody
till
I
have
leisure
to
examine
him
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
done
as
you
desire
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Bouchier
,
bowing
anddeparting
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
Henry
,
accompanied
by
Anne
Boleyn
,
proceeded
withhis
attendants
to
Saint
George
's
Chapel
,
and
heard
vespers
performed
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
was
about
to
return
,
an
usher
advanced
towards
him
,
andmaking
a
profound
reverence
,
said
that
a
masked
dame
,
whosehabiliments
proclaimed
her
of
the
highest
rank
,
craved
a
moment'saudience
of
him
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
she
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Henry
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
the
north
aisle
,
an't
please
your
majesty
,
"
replied
the
usher
,
"
nearthe
Urswick
Chapel
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
that
this
was
not
the
place
for
anaudience
of
your
majesty
,
nor
the
time
;
but
she
would
not
be
said
nay
,
and
therefore
,
at
the
risk
of
incurring
your
sovereign
displeasure
,
I
haveventured
to
proffer
her
request
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
usher
omitted
to
state
that
his
chief
inducement
to
incur
the
riskwas
a
valuable
ring
,
given
him
by
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
will
go
to
her
,
"
said
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
pray
you
,
excuse
me
for
a
shortspace
,
fair
mistress
,
"
he
added
to
Anne
Boleyn
.
<EOS>
And
quitting
the
choir
,
he
entered
the
northern
aisle
,
and
casting
hiseyes
down
the
line
of
noble
columns
by
which
it
is
flanked
,
and
seeingno
one
,
he
concluded
that
the
lady
must
have
retired
into
the
UrswickChapel
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
proved
;
for
on
reaching
this
exquisite
little
shrine
heperceived
a
tall
masked
dame
within
it
,
clad
in
robes
of
the
richestblack
velvet
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
entered
the
chapel
,
the
lady
advanced
towardshim
,
and
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
,
removed
her
mask
--
disclosingfeatures
stamped
with
sorrow
and
suffering
,
but
still
retaining
anexpression
of
the
greatest
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
those
of
Catherine
ofArragon
.
<EOS>
Uttering
an
angry
exclamation
,
Henry
turned
on
his
heel
and
wouldhave
left
her
,
but
she
clung
to
the
skirts
of
his
robe
.
<EOS>
"Hear
me
<EOS>
a
moment
,
Henry
--
my
king
--
my
husband
--
one
single
moment
--
hear
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catherine
,
in
tones
of
such
passionate
anguish
that
hecould
not
resist
the
appeal
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
brief
,
then
,
Kate
,
"
he
rejoined
,
taking
her
hand
to
raise
her
.
"Blessings
<EOS>
on
you
for
the
word
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
queen
,
covering
his
hand
withkisses
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
indeed
your
own
true
Kate
-
your
faithful
,
loving
,
lawfulwife!"Rise
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
coldly
;
"
this
posture
beseems
not
Catherineof
Arragon
.
<EOS>
""I
obey
you
now
as
I
have
ever
done
,
"
she
replied
,
rising
;
"
though
if
Ifollowed
the
prompting
of
my
heart
,
I
should
not
quit
my
knees
till
I
hadgained
my
suit
.
<EOS>
""You
have
,
done
wrong
in
coming
here
,
Catherine
,
at
this
juncture
,
"
saidHenry
,
"
and
may
compel
me
to
some
harsh
measure
which
I
wouldwillingly
have
avoided
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
one
knows
I
am
here

"
replied
the
queen
,
"
except
two
faithfulattendants
,
who
are
vowed
to
secrecy

and
I
shall
depart
as
I
came

<EOS>
""I
am
glad

have
taken
these
precautions
,
"
replied
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nowspeak
freely
,
but
again
I
must
bid
you
be
brief

<EOS>
""I
will
be
as
brief
as
I
can
,
"
replied
the
queen
;
"
but
I
pray
you
bear
withme

Henry

I
unhappily
weary
you

<EOS>
I

But

said
Henry
,
frowning
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
reproach
you

Henry

replied
Catherine
meekly
,
"
<EOS>
I
only

<EOS>
I
only

not

<EOS>
"
I
lament
your

my

are
fully
opened
to
the
sinful
state
in

I

and
I
am
resolved
to
abandon
it

<EOS>
""An
unworthy
prevarication

"
replied
Catherine
,
"
by
which
you
seek
towork
my
ruin
,
and
accomplish
your
union

<EOS>
And
youwill
no

for

I

<EOS>
You

I

you

<EOS>
But
mark
my

Henry

"The

smiled
bitterly"She

Catherine

"
<EOS>
The

""No

""This

Question
your
sister
Mary
,
somewhile
consort
to
Louis
the
Twelfth
and
now
Duchess
of
Suffolk
--
question
her
as
to
the
character
and
conduct
of
Anne
Boleyn
when
shewas
her
attendant
at
the
court
of
France
--
ask
whether
she
had
never
toreprove
her
for
levity
--
question
the
Lord
Percy
as
to
her
love
for
him
--
question
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
and
a
host
of
others
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
these
charges
are
false
and
calumnious
!
"
cried
Anne
Boleyn
.
<EOS>
Let
the
king
inquire
and
judge
for
himself
,
"
rejoined
Catherine
;
"
and
ifhe
weds
you
,
let
him
look
well
to
you
,
or
you
will
make
him
a
scoff
to
allhonourable
men
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
you
have
come
between
him
and
me
--
asyou
have
divided
husband
and
wife
--
for
the
intent
,
<EOS>
whether
successfulor
not
,
I
denounce
you
before
Heaven
,
and
invoke
its
wrath
upon
yourhead
.
 
<EOS>
Night
and
day
I
will
pray
that
you
may
be
brought
to
shame
;
andwhen
I
shall
be
called
hence
,
as
I
maybe
soon
,
I
will
appear
before
thethrone
of
the
Most
High
,
and
summon
you
to
judgment
.
<EOS>
""Take
me
from
her
,
Henry
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Anne
faintly
;
"
her
violence
affrightsme
.
<EOS>
""No
,
you
shall
stay
,
"
said
Catherine
,
grasping
her
arm
and
detaining
her;"you
shall
hear
your
doom
.
 
<EOS>
You
imagine
your
career
will
be
a
brilliantone
,
and
that
you
will
be
able
to
wield
the
sceptre
you
wrongfully
wrestfrom
me
;
but
it
will
moulder
into
dust
in
your
hand
--
<EOS>
the
crown
unjustlyplaced
upon
your
brow
will
fall
to
the
ground
,
and
it
will
bring
the
headwith
it
.
<EOS>
""Take
me
away
<EOS>
,
Henry
,
I
implore
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Anne
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
hear
me
out
,
"
pursued
Catherine
,
exerting
all
her
strength
,
and
maintaining
her
grasp
,
"
or
I
will
follow
you
down
yon
aisles
,
andpour
forth
my
malediction
against
you
in
the
hearing
of
all
yourattendants
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
braved
me
,
and
shall
feel
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
Look
at
her
,
Henry
--
see
how
she
shrinks
before
the
gaze
of
an
injured
woman
.
 
<EOS>
Lookme
in
the
face
,
minion
<EOS>
--
you
cannot!--you
dare
not!""Oh
,
Henry
!
"
<EOS>
sobbed
Anne
.
<EOS>
"You
have
brought
it
upon
yourself
,
"
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
has
,
"
replied
Catherine
;
"
and
,
unless
she
pauses
and
repents
,
shewill
bring
yet
more
upon
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
You
suffer
now
,
minion
,
but
<EOS>
how
willyou
feel
when
,
in
your
turn
,
you
are
despised
,
neglected
,
andsupplanted
by
a
rival
--
when
the
false
glitter
of
your
charms
havingpassed
away
,
Henry
will
see
only
your
faults
,
and
will
open
his
eyes
toall
<EOS>
I
now
tell
him?"A
sob
was
all
the
answer
Anne
could
return
.
<EOS>
"You
will
feel
as
I
feel
towards
you
,
"
pursued
the
queen--"hatredtowards
her
;
but
you
will
not
have
the
consolations
I
enjoy
.
 
<EOS>
You
willhave
merited
your
fate
,
and
you
will
then
think
upon
me
and
my
woes
,
and
will
bitterly
,
but
unavailingly
,
repent
your
conduct
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
Henry
,
"
she
exclaimed
,
turning
solemnly
to
him
,
"
you
have
pledged
yourroyal
word
to
me
,
and
given
me
your
hand
upon
it
,
that
if
you
find
thiswoman
false
to
you
she
shall
expiate
her
offence
on
the
block
.
 
<EOS>
I
callupon
you
to
ratify
the
pledge
in
her
presence
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
so
,
Catherine
,
"
replied
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
mere
suspicion
of
her
guiltshall
be
enough
.
<EOS>
""Henry
!
"
exclaimed
Anne
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
said
it
,
"
replied
the
king
.
<EOS>
"Tremble
,
then
,
Anne
Boleyn
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catherine
,
"
tremble
!
<EOS>
and
when
youare
adjudged
to
die
the
death
of
an
adulteress
,
bethink
you
of
theprediction
of
the
queen
you
have
injured
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
not
live
to
witness
yourfate
,
but
we
shall
meet
before
the
throne
of
an
eternal
Judge
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
Henry
,
this
is
too
much
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
Anne
,
and
<EOS>
she
sank
fainting
intohis
arms
.
"Begone
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
king
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
killed
her!""It
were
well
for
us
both
if
I
had
done
so
,
"
replied
Catherine
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
shewill
recover
to
work
my
misery
and
her
own
.
<EOS>
To
your
hands
I
commit
herpunishment
.
 
<EOS>
May
God
bless
you
,
<EOS>
Henry!"With
this
<EOS>
she
replaced
her
mask
,
and
quitted
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
meanwhile
,
anxious
to
avoid
the
comments
of
his
attendants
,
exerted
himself
to
restore
Anne
Boleyn
to
sensibility
,
and
his
effortswere
speedily
successful
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
then
reality
?
"
<EOS>
gasped
Anne
,
as
she
gazed
around
.
<EOS>
"
I
hoped
it
was
ahideous
dream
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Henry
,
this
has
been
frightful
!
<EOS>
But
you
will
not
killme
,
as
she
predicted
?
<EOS>
Swear
to
me
you
will
not!""Why
<EOS>
should
you
be
alarmed
?
"
rejoined
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
are
faithful
,
you
have
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
said
suspicion
,
Henry
<EOS>
--
you
said
suspicion
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Anne
.
<EOS>
"You
must
put
the
greater
guard
upon
your
conduct
,
"
rejoined
the
kingmoodily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
there
is
some
truth
in
Catherine'sinsinuations
.
<EOS>
""Oh
<EOS>
no
,
I
swear
to
you
there
is
not
,
"
said
Anne--"I
have
trifled
with
thegallants
of
Francis
's
court
,
and
have
listened
,
perhaps
toocomplacently
,
to
the
love
-
vows
of
Percy
and
Wyat
,
but
when
yourmajesty
deigned
to
cast
eyes
upon
me
,
all
others
vanished
as
the
starsof
night
before
the
rising
of
the
god
of
day
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
,
I
love
you
deeply
,
devotedly
--
but
Catherine
's
terrible
imprecations
make
me
feel
morekeenly
than
I
have
ever
done
before
the
extent
of
the
wrong
I
am
aboutto
inflict
upon
her
--
and
I
fear
that
retributive
punishment
will
follow
it
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
will
do
her
no
wrong
,
"
replied
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
satisfied
of
the
justiceof
the
divorce
,
and
of
its
necessity
;
and
if
my
purposed
union
with
youwere
out
of
the
question
,
I
should
demand
it
.
 
<EOS>
Be
the
fault
on
my
head
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
words
restore
me
in
some
measure
,
my
liege
,
"
said
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
loveyou
too
well
not
to
risk
body
and
soul
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
yours
for
ever
--
<EOS>
ah!"she
exclaimed
,
with
a
fearful
look
.
<EOS>
"What
ails
you
,
sweetheart
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
king
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
thought
I
saw
a
face
at
the
window
,
<EOS>
"
she
replied--"a
black
andhideous
face
like
that
of
a
fiend
.
<EOS>
""It
was
mere
fancy
,
"
replied
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
mind
is
disturbed
by
whathas
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
join
your
attendants
,
and
retire
to
yourown
apartments
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
Henry
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Anne--
<EOS>
"
do
not
judge
me
unheard
-
do
not
believewhat
any
false
tongue
may
utter
against
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
love
only
you
and
canlove
only
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
not
wrong
you
,
even
in
thought
,
for
worlds
.
<EOS>
""I
believe
you
,
sweetheart
,
"
replied
the
king
tenderly
.
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
led
her
down
the
aisle
to
her
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
They
thenproceeded
together
to
the
royal
lodgings
,
where
Anne
retired
to
herown
apartments
,
and
Henry
withdrew
to
his
private
chamber
.
<EOS>
II
.
 
<EOS>
How
Herne
the
Hunter
appeared
to
Henry
on
the
Terrace
.
<EOS>
Henry
again
sat
down
to
his
despatches
,
and
employed
himself
uponthem
to
a
late
hour
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
feeling
heated
and
oppressed
,
he
arose
,
and
opened
a
window
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
,
he
was
almost
blinded
by
a
vividflash
of
forked
lightning
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
ready
to
court
danger
,
and
convinced
,
from
the
intense
gloom
without
,
that
a
fearful
storm
was
coming
on
,
Henry
resolved
to
go
forth
to
witness
it
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
quitted
thecloset
,
and
passed
through
a
small
door
opening
on
the
northernterrace
.
 
<EOS>
The
castle
clock
tolled
the
hour
of
midnight
as
he
issued
forth
,
and
the
darkness
was
so
profound
that
he
could
scarcely
see
a
footbefore
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
went
on
.
<EOS>
"Who
goes
there
?
"
<EOS>
cried
a
voice
,
as
he
advanced
,
and
a
partisan
wasplaced
at
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"The
king
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Henry
,
in
tones
that
would
have
left
no
doubt
of
thetruth
of
the
assertion
,
even
if
a
gleam
of
lightning
had
not
at
themoment
revealed
his
figure
and
countenance
to
the
sentinel
.
<EOS>
"I
did
not
look
for
your
majesty
at
such
a
time
,
"
replied
the
man
,
lowering
his
pike
.
 
<EOS>
"
Has
your
majesty
no
apprehension
of
the
storm
?
<EOS>
Ihave
watched
it
gathering
in
the
valley
,
and
it
will
be
a
dreadful
one
.
 
<EOS>
If
Imight
make
bold
to
counsel
you
,
I
would
advise
you
to
seek
instantshelter
in
the
castle
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
fear
,
good
fellow
,
"
laughed
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
thee
in
yon
porch
,
and
leave
the
terrace
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
warn
thee
when
I
leave
it
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
a
tremendous
peal
of
thunder
broke
overhead
,
and
seemedto
shake
the
strong
pile
to
its
foundations
.
 
<EOS>
Again
the
lightning
rent
theblack
canopy
of
heaven
in
various
places
,
and
shot
down
in
forkedflashes
of
the
most
dazzling
brightness
.
 
<EOS>
A
rack
of
clouds
,
heavilycharged
with
electric
fluid
,
hung
right
over
the
castle
,
and
poured
downall
their
fires
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Henry
paced
slowly
to
and
fro
,
utterly
indifferent
to
the
peril
he
ran
--
nowwatching
the
lightning
as
it
shivered
some
oak
in
the
home
park
,
orlighted
up
the
wide
expanse
of
country
around
him
--
now
listening
to
theroar
of
heaven
's
artillery
;
and
he
had
just
quitted
the
western
extremityof
the
terrace
,
when
the
most
terrific
crash
he
had
yet
heard
burst
overhim
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
instant
a
dozen
forked
flashes
shot
from
the
sky
,
whilefiery
coruscations
blazed
athwart
it
;
and
at
the
same
moment
a
boltstruck
the
Wykeham
Tower
,
beside
which
he
had
been
recentlystanding
.
 
<EOS>
Startled
by
the
appalling
sound
,
he
turned
and
beheld
uponthe
battlemented
parapet
on
his
left
a
tall
ghostly
figure
,
whoseantlered
helm
told
him
it
was
Herne
the
Hunter
.
 
<EOS>
Dilated
against
theflaming
sky
,
the
proportions
of
the
demon
seemed
gigantic
.
 
<EOS>
His
righthand
was
stretched
forth
towards
the
king
,
and
in
his
left
he
held
arusty
chain
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
grasped
the
handle
of
his
sword
,
and
partly
drew
it
,
keeping
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
figure
.
<EOS>
"You
thought
you
had
got
rid
of
me
,
Harry
of
England
,
"
cried
Herne
,
"
<EOS>
butwere
you
to
lay
the
weight
of
this
vast
fabric
upon
me
,
I
would
breakfrom
under
it
--
ho
!
<EOS>
ho!""What
wouldst
thou
,
infernal
spirit
?
"
cried
Henry
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
come
to
keep
company
with
you
,
Harry
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
demon
;
"
thisis
a
night
when
only
you
and
I
should
be
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
how
to
enjoyit
.
 
<EOS>
We
like
the
music
of
the
loud
thunder
,
and
the
dance
of
the
blithelightning
.
<EOS>
""Avaunt
,
fiend
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
hold
no
converse
with
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Back
tothy
native
hell!""You
have
no
power
over
me
,
Harry
,
"
rejoined
the
demon
,
his
wordsmingling
with
the
rolling
of
the
thunder
,
"
for
your
thoughts
are
evil
<EOS>
,
andyou
are
about
to
do
an
accursed
deed
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
dismiss
me
.
 
<EOS>
Beforethe
commission
of
every
great
crime
--
and
many
great
crimes
you
willcommit
--
<EOS>
I
will
always
appear
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
my
last
appearance
shall
hethree
days
before
your
end
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!""Darest
thou
say
this
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
furiously
.
<EOS>
"I
laugh
at
thy
menaces
,
"
rejoined
Herne
,
amid
another
peal
ofthunder--
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
not
yet
done
.
 
<EOS>
Harry
of
England
!
<EOS>
your
career
shallbe
stained
in
blood
.
 
<EOS>
Your
wrath
shall
descend
upon
the
heads
of
thosewho
love
you
,
and
your
love
shall
be
fatal
.
 
<EOS>
Better
Anne
Boleyn
fled
thiscastle
,
and
sought
shelter
in
the
lowliest
hovel
in
the
land
,
thanbecome
your
spouse
.
 
<EOS>
For
you
will
slay
her
--
and
not
her
alone
.
 
<EOS>
Anothershall
fall
by
your
hand
;
and
so
,
if
you
had
your
own
will
,
would
all!""What
meanest
thou
by
all
?
"
demanded
the
king
.
<EOS>
"You
will
learn
in
due
season
,
"
laughed
the
fiend
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
now
mark
me
,
<EOS>
Harry
of
England
,
thou
fierce
and
bloody
kin
--
thou
shalt
be
drunken
withthe
blood
of
thy
wives
;
and
thy
end
shall
be
a
fearful
one
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
shaltlinger
out
a
living
death
--
a
mass
of
breathing
corruption
shalt
thoubecome
--
and
when
dead
the
very
hounds
with
which
thou
huntedst
meshall
lick
thy
blood!"These
awful
words
,
involving
a
fearful
prophecy
,
which
was
afterwards
,
as
will
be
shown
,
strangely
fulfilled
,
were
so
mixed
up
with
the
rolling
ofthe
thunder
that
Henry
could
scarcely
distinguish
one
sound
from
theother
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
the
latter
speech
a
flash
of
lightning
of
suchdazzling
brilliancy
shot
down
past
him
,
that
he
remained
for
somemoments
almost
blinded
;
and
when
he
recovered

How
Mabel
Lyndwood
was
taken
to
the
Castle
by
Nicholas
Clamp
--
<EOS>
And
how
they
encountered
Morgan
Fenwolf
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
THE
storm
which
had
fallen
so
heavily
on
the
castle
had
likewise
visitedthe
lake
,
and
alarmed
the
inmates
of
the
little
dwelling
on
its
banks
.
 
<EOS>
Both
the
forester
and
his
grand
-
daughter
were
roused
from
their
beds
,
and
theysat
together
in
the
chief
apartment
of
the
cottage
,
listening
to
the
awfulrolling
of
the
thunder
,
and
watching
the
blue
flashing
of
the
lightning
.
<EOS>
The
storm
was
of
unusually
long
duration
,
and
continued
for
more
thanan
hour
with
unintermitted
violence
.
 
<EOS>
It
then
paused
;
the
thunder
rolledoff
,
and
the
flashes
of
lightning
grew
fainter
and
less
frequent
.
 
<EOS>
Duringthe
storm
Mabel
continued
on
her
knees
,
addressing
the
most
earnestprayers
to
the
Virgin
for
her
preservation
and
that
of
her
grandfather;but
<EOS>
the
old
forester
,
though
evidently
much
alarmed
,
uttered
not
asingle
supplication
,
but
remained
sitting
in
his
chair
with
a
sullen
,
scared
look
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
thunder
died
away
,
he
recovered
his
composure
,
and
addressed
himself
to
soothe
the
fears
of
his
granddaughter
.
 
<EOS>
In
thishe
had
partially
succeeded
,
and
was
urging
her
again
to
seek
hercouch
,
when
the
storm
recommenced
with
fresh
fury
.
 
<EOS>
Mabel
once
morefell
on
her
knees
,
and
the
old
man
resumed
his
sullen
posture
.
<EOS>
Anotherdreadful
half
-
hour
,
marked
by
a
succession
of
terrible
peals
and
vividflashes
,
succeeded
,
when
,
amidst
an
awful
pause
,
Mabel
ventured
toaddress
her
old
relative
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
do
you
not
pray
,
grandfather
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
regarding
him
uneasily
.
"Sister
<EOS>
Anastasia
and
good
Father
Anselm
always
taught
me
to
utter
anAve
and
cross
myself
during
a
thunderstorm
.
 
<EOS>
Why
do
you
not
pray
,
grandfather?""Do
not
trouble
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
your
cheeks
and
lips
are
blanched
,
"
rejoined
Mabel
;
"
and
Iobserved
you
shudder
during
that
last
awful
crash
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
grandfather
,
pray!""Peace
,
wench
,
and
mind
your
own
business
!
"
returned
the
old
manangrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
storm
will
soon
be
over
--
it
can
not
last
long
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
""The
saints
preserve
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mabel
,
as
a
tremendous
concussionwas
heard
overhead
,
followed
by
a
strong
sulphureous
smell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thecottage
is
struck!""It
is
--
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tristram
,
springing
to
his
feet
and
rushing
forth
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
Mabel
continued
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
.
 
<EOS>
She
thenstaggered
to
the
door
,
and
beheld
her
grandfather
occupied
with
twodark
figures
,
whom
she
recognised
as
Valentine
Hagthorne
and
MorganFenwolf
,
in
extinguishing
the
flames
,
which
were
bursting
from
thethatched
roof
of
the
hut
.
 
<EOS>
Surprise
and
terror
held
her
silent
,
and
theothers
were
so
busily
engaged
that
they
did
not
notice
her
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
by
their
united
efforts
,
the
fire
was
got
under
without
materialdamage
to
the
little
building
,
and
Mabel
retired
,
expecting
her
grandsireto
return
;
but
as
he
did
not
do
so
,
and
as
almost
instantly
afterwardsthe
plash
of
oars
was
heard
en
the
lake
,
she
flew
to
the
window
,
andbeheld
him
,
by
the
gleam
of
the
lightning
,
seated
in
the
skiff
withMorgan
Fenwolf
,
while
Valentine
Hagthorne
had
mounted
a
black
horse
,
and
was
galloping
swiftly
away
.
 
<EOS>
Mabel
saw
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Overcome
byfright
,
she
sank
on
the
ground
insensible
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
recovered
thestorm
had
entirely
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
A
heavy
shower
had
fallen
,
but
the
sky
wasnow
perfectly
clear
,
and
day
had
begun
to
dawn
.
 
<EOS>
Mabel
went
to
thedoor
of
the
hut
,
and
looked
forth
for
her
grandfather
,
but
he
wasnowhere
to
be
seen
.
 
<EOS>
She
remained
gazing
at
the
now
peaceful
lake
tillthe
sun
had
fairly
risen
,
when
,
feeling
more
composed
,
she
retired
torest
,
and
sleep
,
which
had
been
banished
from
them
during
the
greaterpart
of
the
night
,
now
fell
upon
her
lovely
eyelids
.
<EOS>
When
she
awoke
,
the
day
was
far
advanced
,
but
still
old
Tristram
hadnot
returned
;
and
with
a
heavy
heart
she
set
about
her
householdconcerns
.
 
<EOS>
The
thought
,
however
,
of
her
anticipated
visit
to
the
castlespeedily
dispelled
her
anxiety
,
and
she
began
to
make
preparations
forsetting
out
,
attiring
herself
with
unusual
care
.
<EOS>
Bouchier
had
notexperienced
much
difficulty
in
persuading
her
to
obey
the
king'sbehest
,
and
by
his
artful
representations
he
had
likewise
induced
hergrandfather
to
give
his
consent
to
the
visit
--
the
old
forester
onlystipulating
that
she
should
be
escorted
there
and
back
by
a
falconer
,
named
Nicholas
Clamp
,
in
whom
he
could
put
trust
;
to
whichproposition
Bouchier
readily
assented
.
<EOS>
At
length
five
o'clock
,
the
appointed
hour
,
arrived
,
and
with
it
cameNicholas
Clamp
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
middle
-
aged
man
,
with
yellow
hair
,
clipped
closely
over
his
brows
,
and
a
beard
and
moustaches
to
match
.
<EOS>
His
attire
resembled
that
of
a
keeper
of
the
forest
,
and
consisted
of
adoublet
and
hose
of
green
cloth
;
but
he
did
not
carry
a
bugle
or
hunting
-
knife
.
 
<EOS>
His
sole
weapon
was
a
stout
quarter
-
staff
.
<EOS>
After
some
littlehesitation
Mabel
consented
to
accompany
the
falconer
,
and
they
setforth
together
.
<EOS>
The
evening
was
delightful
,
and
their
way
through
the
woods
wasmarked
by
numberless
points
of
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Mabel
said
little
,
for
herthoughts
were
running
upon
her
grandfather
,
and
upon
his
prolongedand
mysterious
absence
;
but
the
falconer
talked
of
the
damage
done
bythe
thunderstorm
,
which
he
declared
was
the
most
awful
he
had
everwitnessed
;
and
he
pointed
out
to
her
several
trees
struck
by
thelightning
.
 
<EOS>
Proceeding
in
this
way
,
they
gained
a
road
leading
fromBlacknest
,
when
,
from
behind
a
large
oak
,
the
trunk
of
which
hadconcealed
him
from
view
,
Morgan
Fenwolf
started
forth
,
and
plantedhimself
in
their
path
.
 
<EOS>
The
gear
of
the
proscribed
keeper
was
wild
andragged
,
his
locks
matted
and
disordered
,
his
demeanour
savage
,
andhis
whole
appearance
forbidding
and
alarming
.
<EOS>
"I
have
been
waiting
for
you
for
some
time
,
Mabel
Lyndwood
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"You
must
go
with
me
to
your
grandfather
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
grandfather
would
never
send
you
for
me
,
"
replied
Mabel
;
"
but
if
hedid
,
I
will
not
trust
myself
with
you
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
saints
preserve
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Nicholas
Clamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
I
believe
myeyes!--do
<EOS>
I
behold
Morgan
Fenwolf!""Come
with
me
,
Mabel
,
"
cried
Fenwolf
,
disregarding
him
.
<EOS>
But
she
returned
a
peremptory
refusal
.
"She
<EOS>
shall
not
stir
an
inch
!
"
cried
the
falconer
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
thou
,
MorganFenwolf
,
who
must
go
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
art
a
proscribed
felon
,
and
thy
lifeis
forfeit
to
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
Yield
thee
,
dog
,
as
my
prisoner!""Thy
prisoner
!
"
echoed
Fenwolf
scornfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
take
three
such
asthou
art
to
make
me
captive
!
<EOS>
Mabel
Lyndwood
,
in
your
grandfather'sname
,
I
command
you
to
come
with
me
,
and
let
Nick
Clamp
look
tohimself
if
he
dares
to
hinder
you
.
<EOS>
""Nick
will
do
something
more
than
hinder
her
,
"
rejoined
the
falconer
,
brandishing
his
staff
,
and
rushing
upon
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Felon
hound
!
<EOS>
Icommand
thee
to
yield!"Before
<EOS>
the
falconer
could
reach
him
,
Morgan
Fenwolf
plucked
a
longhunting
-
knife
from
his
girdle
,
and
made
a
desperate
stab
at
hisassailant
.
 
<EOS>
But
Clamp
avoided
the
blow
,
and
striking
Fenwolf
on
theshins
,
immediately
afterwards
closed
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
result
was
still
doubtful
,
when
the
struggle
was
suddenlyinterrupted
by
the
trampling
of
horse
approaching
from
the
side
ofWindsor
;
and
at
the
sound
Morgan
Fenwolf
disengaged
himself
from
hisantagonist
and
plunged
into
the
adjoining
wood
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
momentCaptain
Bouchier
rode
up
,
followed
by
a
small
band
of
halberdiers
,
andreceiving
information
from
the
falconer
of
what
had
occurred
,
dartedwith
his
men
into
the
wood
in
search
of
the
fugitive
.
 
<EOS>
Nicholas
Clampand
his
companion
did
not
await
the
issue
of
the
search
,
but
proceededon
their
way
.
<EOS>
As
they
walked
at
a
brisk
pace
,
they
reached
the
long
avenue
in
abouthalf
-
an
-
hour
,
and
took
their
way
down
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
within
a
mile
of
thecastle
they
were
overtaken
by
Bouchier
and
his
followers
,
and
thefalconer
was
much
disappointed
to
learn
that
they
had
failed
intracking
Morgan
Fenwolf
to
his
lair
.
 
<EOS>
After
addressing
a
fewcomplimentary
words
to
the
maiden
,
Bouchier
rode
on
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
the
pair
quitted
the
great
park
,
and
passing
through
arow
of
straggling
houses
,
divided
by
gardens
and
closes
,
which
skirtedthe
foot
of
Castle
Hill
,
presently
reached
the
lower
gate
.
 
<EOS>
They
wereadmitted
without
difficulty
;
but
just
as
they
entered
<EOS>
the
lower
ward
thefalconer
was
hailed
by
Shoreditch
and
Paddington
,
who
at
the
momentissued
from
the
doorway
of
the
guard
-
room
.
<EOS>
Clamp
obeyed
the
call
and
went
towards
them
,
and
it
was
evident
,
fromthe
gestures
of
the
archers
,
that
they
were
making
inquiries
aboutMabel
,
whose
appearance
seemed
to
interest
them
greatly
.
 
<EOS>
After
abrief
conversation
with
the
falconer
they
approached
her
,
and
,
respectfully
addressing
her
,
begged
leave
to
attend
her
to
the
royallodgings
,
whither
they
understood
she
was
going
.
 
<EOS>
No
objection
beingmade
to
the
proposal
by
Mabel
,
the
party
directed
their
course
towardsthe
middle
ward
.
<EOS>
Passing
through
the
gateway
of
the
Norman
Tower
,
they
stoppedbefore
a
low
portal
in
a
picturesque
Gothic
wing
of
the
castle
,
withprojecting
walls
and
bay
-
windows
,
which
had
been
erected
in
thepreceding
reign
of
Henry
the
Seventh
,
and
was
consequently
still
in
allits
freshness
and
beauty

How
Mabel
was
received
by
the
Party
in
the
Kitchen
--
And
of
theQuarrel
between
the
two
Jesters
.
<EOS>
Addressing
himself
to
a
stout
-
built
yeoman
of
the
guard
,
who
was
standingwithin
the
doorway
,
Nicholas
Clamp
demanded
admittance
to
the
kitchen
,
and
the
man
having
detained
them
for
a
few
moments
,
during
which
heregarded
Mabel
with
a
very
offensive
stare
,
ushered
them
into
a
small
hall
,
and
from
thence
into
a
narrow
passage
connected
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Lighted
by
narrowloopholes
pierced
through
the
walls
,
which
were
of
immense
thickness
,
thispassage
described
the
outer
side
of
the
whole
upper
quadrangle
,
andcommunicated
with
many
other
lateral
passages
and
winding
stairsleading
to
the
chambers
allotted
to
the
household
or
to
the
stateapartments
.
 
<EOS>
Tracking
it
for
some
time
,
Nicholas
Clamp
at
length
turnedoff
on
the
right
,
and
,
crossing
a
sort
of
ante
-
room
,
led
the
way
into
alarge
chamber
with
stone
walls
and
a
coved
and
groined
roof
,
lightedby
a
great
window
at
the
lower
end
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
royal
kitchen
,
and
init
yawned
no
fewer
than
seven
huge
arched
fireplaces
,
in
which
fireswere
burning
,
and
before
which
various
goodly
joints
were
beingroasted
,
while
a
number
of
cooks
and
scullions
were
congregatedround
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
a
large
table
in
the
centre
of
the
kitchen
were
seatedsome
half
-
dozen
yeomen
of
the
guard
,
together
with
the
clerk
of
thekitchen
,
the
chief
bargeman
,
and
the
royal
cutler
,
or
bladesmith
,
as
hewas
termed
.
<EOS>
These
worthies
were
doing
ample
justice
to
a
chine
of
beef
,
a
wild
-
boarpie
,
a
couple
of
fat
capons
,
a
peacock
pasty
,
a
mess
of
pickledlobsters
,
and
other
excellent
and
inviting
dishes
with
which
the
boardwas
loaded
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
did
they
neglect
to
wash
down
the
viands
withcopious
draughts
of
ale
and
mead
from
great
pots
and
flagons
placedbeside
them
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
this
party
stood
Giovanni
Joungevello
,
an
Italianminstrel
,
much
in
favour
with
Anne
Boleyn
,
and
Domingo
Lamellino
,
orLamelyn
--
as
he
was
familiarly
termed
--
a
Lombard
,
who
pretended
tosome
knowledge
of
chirurgery
,
astrology
,
and
alchemy
,
and
who
was
aconstant
attendant
on
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
the
bench
,
on
the
right
ofthe
table
,
sat
Will
Sommers
.
 
<EOS>
The
jester
was
not
partaking
of
the
repast
,
but
was
chatting
with
Simon
Quanden
,
the
chief
cook
,
a
good
-
humoured
personage
,
round
-
bellied
as
a

and
blessed

<EOS>
Deborah
,
as
fond
of
good
cheer
,
as
fat
,
and
as
good

humoured
as
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
the
cook
stood
the
cellarman
,
known
bythe
appellation
of
Jack
of
the
Bottles
,
and
at
his
feet
were
two
playfullittle
turnspits
,
with
long
backs
,
and
short
forelegs
,
as
crooked
almostas
sickles
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Mabel
,
Will
Sommers
immediately
arose
,
and
advancingtowards
her
with
a
mincing
step
,
bowed
with
an
air
of
mockceremony
,
and
said
in
an
affected
tone
,
"
Welcome
,
fair
mistress
,
to
theking
's
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
all
right
glad
to
see
you
;
are

not

"
replied
a
chorus
of
voices
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
my
troth
,
the

is
wondrously
beautiful

"
said
Kit
Coo
,
one
ofthe
yeomen
of
the
guard
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
wonder
the
king
is
smitten
with
her
,
"
said
Launcelot
Rutter
,
thebladesmith
;
"
her
eyes
shine
like
a
dagger
's
point
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
she
carries
herself
like
a
wafter
on
the
river
,
"
said
the
bargeman
.
<EOS>
"Her
<EOS>
complexion
is
as
good
as
if
I
had
given
her
some
of
my

"
said
Domingo
Lamelyn
.
<EOS>
"Much
<EOS>
better
,
"
observed
Joungevello
,
the
minstrel
;
"
I
shall
write
acanzonet
in
her
praise
,
and
sing
it
before
the
king

<EOS>
""And

"Nay

""I

Mabel

<EOS>
smiling;"for

<EOS>
""Well

well

I
will
not
force
you

replied
the

But
a

do

""I

"Let

me
pray
you
to
cast
your

Will

pointing
to
the
two
turn

spits

<EOS>
They
are
much
attached

their
chief
love
is
towards

nothing

Simon

<EOS>
Hob

When

Nob
will
watch
beside
it

his

tired

he
will
take

<EOS>
They
always
eat
out
of
the

platter
,
and
drink
out
of
the
same
cup

<EOS>
I
once
separated
them
for
a
few
hoursto
see
what
would
happen
,
but
they
howled
so
piteously
,
that
I
wasforced
to
bring
them
together
again

<EOS>
It
would
have
done
your

to

they
leaped

rolledwith
delight

"Placing
<EOS>
his

the

took

proceeding
towards

broke
it
into

pushed
the

<EOS>
While
Mabel
was
admiring
this
display
of
sagacity
and
affection
abustling
step
was
heard
behind
her
,

turning
,
she
beheld
a

immediately
recognised

The

recognised
her
too

stared
in
astonishment

a
leering
look
at

""Ay

<EOS>
resounded
on

<EOS>
Stimulated
by
curiosity
,
the
whole
of
the
party
rose
from
the
table;Simon
Quanden
got
out
of
his
chair
;
the
other
cooks
left
their
joints
toscorch
at
the
fire

the

suspended
their

Hob

"I

marching

fillinghimself
a
flagon
of
mead

<EOS>
"
Here

to

he
added

kissing
the

swallowing
its
contents
at

draught

"And

<EOS>
The
court
is
adjourned
for
three
days
,
Queen
Catherine
having
demanded
that
time
to
prepare
her
allegations

the
delay
has
been
granted
her

<EOS>
""Pest

cried
Will

<EOS>
"
Were
I

<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
wouldst
thou
do
,
thou
scurril
knave

"
<EOS>
cried
Patch
angrily
.
<EOS>
"I
would
strip
him
of

Patch

amid
the
laughter

company--
"
and
see
whether
your
back
does
not
smart
for
it
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
him
not
,
"
replied
Will
Sommers
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
yet
told
the
king

of
the
rare
wine
we
found
in
his
cellar

<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
wine
was
that

Will

<EOS>
"
cried
Jack
of
the
Bottles
.
<EOS>
"You
shall
hear
,
"
replied
Will
Sommers
,
enjoying
the
disconcerted
lookof
the
other
jester
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
at
the
palace
at
Hampton
,
when
this
scant
-
witted
knave
invited
me
to
taste
some
of
his
master
's
wine
,
andaccordingly
to
the
cellar
we
went
.
 
<EOS>
'
This
wine
will
surprise
you

quothhe
,
as
we
broached
the
first
hogshead
.
 
<EOS>
And
truly
it
did
surprise
me
,
forno
wine
followed
the
gimlet
.
 
<EOS>
So
we
went
on
to
another
,
and
another
,
and
another
,
till
we
tried
half
a
score
of
them
,
and
all
with
the
sameresult
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
I
seized
a
hammer
which
was
lying
by
and
soundedthe
casks
,
but
none
of
them
seeming
empty
<EOS>
,
I
at
last
broke
the
lid
ofone
--
and
what
do
you
think
it
<EOS>
contained?"A
variety
of
responses
were
returned
by
the
laughing
assemblage
,
during
which
Patch
sought
to
impose
silence
upon
his
opponent
.
 
<EOS>
ButWill
Sommers
was
not
to
be
checked
.
<EOS>
"It
contained
neither
vinegar
,
nor
oil
,
nor
lead

"
he
said
,
"
but
gold
;
ay
,
solid
bars
of
gold

ingots

<EOS>
Every
hogshead
was
worth
ten
thousandpounds
,
and
more
.
<EOS>
""Credit
<EOS>
him
not

my

"
cried
Patch
,
amid
the
roars

;
"
the
whole
is
a
mere
fable

an
invention

<EOS>
His

nosuch
treasure

<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
Will
Sommers
got
drunk
upon
some
choiceMalmsey
,
and
then
dreamed
he
had
been
broaching
casks
of
gold
.
<EOS>
""It
is
no
fable
,
as
you
and
your
master
will
find
when
the
king
comes
tosift
the
matter

"
replied
Will
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
will
be
a

result

ever
produced

<EOS>
""It
is
<EOS>
false!--I

false

<EOS>
screamed
Patch

<EOS>
"
let
the
cellars
be
searched
,
and
I
will
stake
my
head
nothing

<EOS>
""Stake
<EOS>
thy
cap
,
and
there
may
be
some
meaning
in
it
,
"
said
Will
,
plucking
Patch
's
cap
from
his
head
and
elevating
it
on
his
truncheon
.
<EOS>
"Here
is
an
emblem
of
the
Cardinal
of
York
,
"
he
cried
,
pointing
to
it
.
<EOS>
A
roar
of
laughter
from
the
company
followed
this
sally
,
and
Hob
andNob
looked
up
in
placid
wonderment
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
die
with
laughing
,
"
cried
Simon
Quanden
,
holding
his
fat
sides
,
and
addressing
his
spouse
,
who
was
leaning
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Patch
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
,
gesticulating
with
rageand
fury
,
cried
,
"
Thou
hast
done
well
to
steal
my
cap
and
bells
,
for
theybelong
of
right
to
thee

<EOS>
Add
my
folly
to
thy

and
thou
wilt

be
afitting
servant

or
e'en
give
him
the

then
therewill

<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
is
the
fool
now
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
"
rejoined
Will
Sommersgravely
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
call
you
all
to
witness
that
he
has
spoken
treason

"While
<EOS>
this
was
passing
Shoreditch
had
advanced
with
a
flagon
ofMalmsey
to
Mabel
,
but
she
was
so
interested
in
the
quarrel
betweenthe
two
jesters
that
she
heeded
him
not
;
neither
did
she
attend
toNicholas
Clamp
,
who
was
trying
to
explain
to
her
what
was
goingforward
.
 
<EOS>
But
just
as
Patch
's
indiscreet
speech
was
uttered
an
usherentered
the
kitchen
and
announced
the
approach
of
the
king

<EOS>
V.
 
Of
the
Combat

And
how

<EOS>
Mabel
's
heart
fluttered
violently
at
the
usher
's
announcement
,
and
for
amoment
the
colour
deserted
her
cheek
,
while
the
next
instant
she
wascovered
with
blushes
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
poor
Patch
,
feeling
that
his
indiscretionmight
place
him
in
great
jeopardy
and
seriously
affect
his
master
,
towhom
<EOS>
he
was
devotedly
attached
,
he
cast
a
piteous
and
imploring
lookat
his
antagonist
,
but
was
answered
only
by
a
derisive
laugh
,
coupledwith
an
expressive
gesture
to
intimate
that
a
halter
would
be
his
fate
.
<EOS>
Fearful
that
mischief
might
ensue
,
the
good
-
natured
Simon
Quandengot
out
of
his
chair
and
earnestly
besought
<EOS>
Will
not
to
carry
matters
toofar
;
but
the
jester
remained
implacable
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
unusual
with
Henry
to
visit
the
different
offices
of
the
castleand
converse
freely
and
familiarly
with
the
members
of
his
household
,
but
it
was
by
no
means
safe
to
trust
to
the
continuance
of
his
goodhumour
,
or
in
the
slightest
degree
to
presume
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
<EOS>
well
knownthat
<EOS>
his
taste
for
variety
of
character
often
led
him
,
like
the
renownedCaliph
Haroun
Al
Raschid
,
to
mix
with
the
lower
classes
of
his
subjectsin
disguise
,
at
which
times
many
extraordinary
adventures
are
said
tohave
befallen
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
present
visit
to
the
kitchen
,
therefore
,
wouldhave
occasioned
no
surprise
to
its
occupants
if
it
had
not
occurred
sosoon
after
the
cardinal
's
arrival
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
this
circumstance
,
in
fact
,
that
sent
him
thither
.
 
<EOS>
The
intelligence
brought
by
Wolsey
of
theadjournment
of
the
court
for
three
days
,
under
the
plea
of
giving
thequeen
time
for
her
allegations
,
was
so
unlooked
for
by
Henry
that
hequitted
the
cardinal
in
high
displeasure
,
and
was
about
to
repair
toAnne
Boleyn
,
when
he
encountered
Bouchier
,
who
told
him
that
MabelLyndwood
had
been
brought
to
the
castle
,
and
her
grandsire
arrested
.
<EOS>
The
information
changed
Henry
's
intentions
at
once
,
and
he
proceededwith
Bouchier
and
some
other
attendants
to
the
kitchen
,
where
he
wasgiven
to
understand
he
should
find
the
damsel
.
<EOS>
Many
a
furtive
glance
was
thrown
at
the
king
,
for
no
one
dared
openlyto
regard
him
as
he
approached
the
forester
's
fair
granddaughter
.
 
<EOS>
Buthe
tarried
only
a
moment
beside
her
,
chucked
her
under
the
chin
,
and
,
whispering
a
word
or
two
in
her
ear
<EOS>
that
heightened
her
blushes
,
passed
on
to
the
spot
where
the
two
jesters
were
standing
.
<EOS>
"What
dost
thou
here
,
knave
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
to
Will
Sommers
.
<EOS>
"I
might
rather
ask
that
question
of
your
majesty
,
"
replied
Will
;
"
and
Iwould
do
so
but
that
I
require
not
to
be
told""I
have
come
to
see
what
passeth
in
my

"
replied
the
king
,
throwing
himself
into
the
chair
lately
occupied
by
the
chief
cook
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Hob
and
Nob
,

merry
rascals

he
cried
,
patting
the
turnspits
,
whoran
towards
him
and
thrust
their
noses
against
his
hand
,
"
ye

<EOS>

I

And
now

replied
Will

,
pointing
to
Patch

<EOS>
"What

<EOS>
hath
he
retorted
upon
thee
too
sharply
?
"
<EOS>
replied
the
king
,
laughing

<EOS>
"
If

challenge

""Your

<EOS>
"
This

added
aloud

<EOS>
And
I
also
charge
his
master
the
cardinal
with
having
secretedin
his
cellars
at
Hampton
a
vast
amount
of
treasure
,
obtained
byextortion
,
privy
dealings
with
foreign
powers
,
and
other
iniquitouspractices
,
and
which
ought
of
right
to
find
its
way
to
your
royalexchequer
.
<EOS>
""'And
<EOS>
which
shall
find
its
way
thither
,
if
thou
dost
not
avouch
a
<EOS>
fable,"replied
<EOS>
the
king
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
majesty
shall
judge
,
"
rejoined
Will
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
repeated
the
storywhich
he
had
just
before
related
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
this
be
true
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Henry
at
its
close
.
<EOS>
"It
is
false
,
your
highness
,
every
word
of
it
,
"
cried
Patch
,
throwinghimself
at
the
king
's
feet
,
"
except
so
far
as
relates
to
our
visits
to
thecellar
,
where
,
I
shame
to
speak
it
,
we
drank
so
much
that
our
sensesclean
forsook
us
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
my
indiscreet
speech
touching
your
majesty
,
neither
disrespect
nor
disloyalty
were
intended
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
goaded
tothe
rejoinder
by
the
sharp
sting
of
this
hornet
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
matter
of
the
treasure
shall
be
inquired
into
without
delay
,
"
saidHenry
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
to
the
quarrel
,
it
shall
be
settled
thus
.
 
<EOS>
Get
both
of
you
<EOS>
uponthat
table
.
 
<EOS>
A
flour
-
bag
shall
be
given
to
each
;
and
he
who
is
firstknocked
off
shall
be
held
vanquished
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
king
's
judgment
was
received
with
as
much
applause
as
dared
beexhibited
by
the
hearers
;
and
in
an
instant
the
board
was
cleared
,
and
acouple
of
flour
-
bags
partly
filled
delivered
to
the
combatants
by
SimonQuanden
,
who
bestirred
himself
with
unwonted
activity
on
theoccasion
.
<EOS>
Leaping
upon
the
table
,
amid
the
smothered
mirth
of
the
assemblage
,
the
two
jesters
placed
themselves
opposite
each
other
,
and
grinnedsuch
comical
defiance
that
the
king
roared
with
laughter
.
<EOS>
After
avariety
of
odd
movements
and
feints
on
either
side
,
Patch
tried
to
bringdown
his
adversary
by
a
tremendous
two
-
handed
blow
;
but
in
dealing
it
,
the
weight
of
the
hag
dragged
him
forward
,
and
well
-
nigh
pitched
himhead
foremost
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
fell
on
his
face
upon
thetable
,
and
in
this
position
received
several
heavy
blows
upon
theprominent
part
of
his
back
from
Will
Sommers
.
 
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
however
,
hemanaged
to
regain
his
legs
,
and
,
smarting
with
pain
,
attacked
hisopponent
furiously
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
short
space
fortune
seemed
tofavour
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
bag
had
slightly
burst
,
and
the
flour
,
showering
from
itwith
every
blow
,
well
-
nigh
blinded
his
adversary
,
whom
he
drove
to
thevery
edge
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
At
this
critical
juncture
Will
managed
to
bringdown
his
bag
full
upon
his
opponent
's
sconce
,
and
the
force
of
the
blowbursting
it
,
Patch
was
covered
from
crown
to
foot
with
flour
,
andblinded
in
his
turn
.
 
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
combatants
was
now
soexquisitely
ridiculous
,
that
the
king
leaned
back
in
his
chair
to
indulgehis
laughter
,
and
the
mirth
of
the
spectators
could
no
longer
be
keptwithin
decorous
limits
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
turnspits
barked
in
laughing
concert
.
<EOS>
"Well
fought
on
both
sides
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
;
"
it
were
hard
to
say
which
willprove
the
victor
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
knaves
,
to
it
again
-
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!--to
it
<EOS>
again!"Once
more
the
bags
were
wielded
,
descended
,
and
the
blows
were
sowell
directed
on
either
side
,
that
both
combatants
fell
backwards
.
<EOS>
Again
the
king
's
laughter
rose
loud
and
long
.
 
<EOS>
Again
the
merriment
ofthe
other
beholders
was
redoubled
.
 
<EOS>
Again
Hob
and
Nob
barkedjoyously
,
and
tried
to
spring
on
to
the
table
to
take
part
in
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
Amid
the
general
glee
,
the
combatants
rose
and
renewed
the
fight
,
dealing
blows
thick
and
fast
--
for
the
bags
were
now
considerablylightened
of
their
contents
--
until
they
were
completely
hidden
from
viewby
a
cloud
of
white
dust
.
<EOS>
"We
can
not
see
the
fray
,
"
remarked
Henry
;
"
but
we
can
hear
the
din
ofbattle
.
 
<EOS>
Which
will
prove
the
victor
,
I
marvel?""I
am
for
Will
Sommers
,
"
cried
Bouchier
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
for
Patch
,
"
said
Simon
Quanden
.
 
<EOS>
"
Latterly
he
hath
seemed
to
meto
have
the
advantage
.
<EOS>
""It
is
decided
!
"
cried
the
king
,
rising
,
as
one
of
the
combatants
wasknocked
off
the
table
,
and
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
great
noise
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
isit?""Patch
,
"
replied
a
faint
voice
.
 
<EOS>
And
through
the
cloud
of
dust
struggledforth
the
forlorn
figure
of
the
cardinal
's
jester
,
while
Will
Sommersleaped
triumphantly
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"Get
<EOS>
thee
to
a
wash
-
tub
,
knave
,
and
cleanse
thyself
,
"
said
Henry
,
laughing
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
consideration
of
the
punishment
thou
hast
undergone
,
Ipardon
thee
thy
treasonable
speech
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
rose
,
and
walked
towards
Mabel
,
who
had
been
quite
asmuch
alarmed
as
amused
by
the
scene
which
had
just
taken
place
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
you
have
been
as
well
cared
for
,
damsel
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
"
since
yourarrival
at
the
castle
,
as
you
cared
for
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
and
myselfwhen
we
visited
your
cottage?"I
have
had
everything
I
require
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Mabel
timidly
.
<EOS>
"Dame
<EOS>
Quanden
will
take
charge
of
you
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
rejoined
theking
,
"
when
you
will
enter
upon
the
service
of
one
of
our
dames
.
<EOS>
""Your
majesty
is
very
considerate
,
"
said
Mabel
,
"
but
I
would
rather
goback
at
early
dawn
to
my
grandsire
.
<EOS>
""That
is
needless
,
"
rejoined
the
king
sternly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
grandsire
is
in
thecastle
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it
!
"
exclaimed
Mabel
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
altering
her
tone
,
forshe
did
not
like
the
expression
of
the
king
's
countenance
,
she
added
,
"
Ihope
he
has
not
incurred
your
majesty
's
displeasure
.
<EOS>
""I
trust
he
will
be
able
to
clear
himself
,
Mabel
,
"
said
Henry
,
"
but
helabours
under
the
grave
suspicion
of
leaguing
with
lawless
men
.
<EOS>
"Mabel
<EOS>
shuddered
,
for
the
thought
of
what
she
had
witnessed
on
theprevious
night
during
the
storm
rushed
forcibly
to
her
recollection
.
<EOS>
Theking
noticed
her
uneasiness
,
and
added
,
in
a
gentler
tone
,
"
If
he
makessuch
confession
as
will
bring
the
others
to
justice
,
he
has
nothing
tofear
.
 
<EOS>
Dame
Quanden
,
I
commit
this
maiden
to
your
charge
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrowshe
will
take
her
place
as
attendant
to
the
Lady
Elizabeth
Fitzgerald
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
moved
off
with
Bouchier
and
the
rest
of
his
attendants
,
leaving
Mabel
to
the
care
of
the
cook
's
good
humoured
spouse
,
whoseeing
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
,
strove
to
cheer
her
,
and
led
hertowards
a
small
side
-
table
,
where
she
pressed
wine
and
cates
uponher
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
of
good
cheer
,
sweetheart
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
soothing
tone
;
"
no
harmwill
befall
your
grandfather
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
much
too
high
in
favour
with
theking
for
that
.
<EOS>
""I
liked
the
king
much
better
as
I
saw
him
at
our
cottage
,
good
dame,"replied
<EOS>
Mabel
,
smiling
through
her
tears
,
"
in
the
guise
of
a
Guildfordmerchant
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
scarcely
to
notice
me
just
now
.
<EOS>
""That
was
because
so
many
eyes
were
upon
you
,
sweet
-
heart
,
"
repliedDeborah
;
"
but
<EOS>
sooth
to
say
<EOS>
,
I
should
be
better
pleased
<EOS>
if
he
did
notnotice
you
at
all
.
<EOS>
"Mabel
<EOS>
blushed
,
and
hung
her
head
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
you
are
to
be
an
attendant
on
the
Lady
Fitzgerald
,
"
pursuedDeborah
,
"
for
she
is
the
fairest
young
lady
at
court
,
and
as
good
andgentle
as
she
is
fair
,
and
I
am
sure
you
will
find
her
a
kind
mistress
.
 
<EOS>
Iwill
tell
you
something
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
beloved
by
the
king
's
son
,
theDuke
of
Richmond
,
but
she
requites
not
his
passion
,
for
her
heart
isfixed
on
the
youthful
Earl
of
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
Alack
-
a
-
day
!
<EOS>
the
noble
rivalsquarrelled
and
crossed
swords
about
her
;
but
as
luck
would
have
it
,
they
were
separated
before
any
mischief
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
The
king
was
verywroth
with
Lord
Surrey
,
and
ordered
him
to
be
imprisoned
for
twomonths
in
the
Round
Tower
,
in
this
castle
,
where
he
is
now
,
though
histerm
has
very
nearly
expired
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
I
pity
him
,
to
be
thus
harshly
treated
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
Mabel
,
her
eyesswimming
with
tears
,
"
and
the
Lady
Elizabeth
too
!
<EOS>
I
shall
delight
toserve
her
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
am
told
the
earl
passes
the
whole
of
his
time
in
poring
over
booksand
writing
love
-
verses
and
sonnets
,
"
said
Deborah
.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
strangethat
one
so
young
should
be
a
poet
;
but
I
suppose
he
caught
the
artfrom
his
friend
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
he
a
friend
of
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
?
"
asked
Mabel
quickly
.
<EOS>
His
close
friend
,
"
replied
Deborah
;
"
except
the
Duke
of
Richmond
,
nowhis
rival
,
he
had
none
closer
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
seen
Sir
Thomas
,
sweetheart?""Yes
,
for
a
few
moments
,
"
replied
Mabel
confusedly
.
<EOS>
"I
heard
that
he
lingered
for
a
short
time
in
the
forest
before
hisdeparture
for
Paris
,
"
said
Dame
Quanden
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
strange
rumourthat
he
had
joined
the
band
of
Herne
the
Hunter
.
<EOS>
But
that
must
havebeen
untrue
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
he
returned
from
France
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mabel
,
without
heeding
theremark
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
not
,
"
replied
the
good
dame
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
he
is
not
come
tothe
castle
.
 
<EOS>
Know
you
not
,
"
she
added
,
in
a
low
confidential
tone
,
"
<EOS>
thatthe
king
is
jealous
of
him
?
<EOS>
He
was
a
former
suitor
to
the
Lady
AnneBoleyn
,
and
desperately
in
love
with
her
;
and
it
is
supposed
that
hismission
to
France
was
only
a
pretext
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
""I
suspected
as
much
,
"
replied
Mabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
for
Sir
Thomas
;
and
alas!for
the
Earl
of
Surrey
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
for
Mabel
Lyndwood
,
if
she
allows
her
heart
to
be
fixed
uponthe
king

"
said
Deborah
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
the
business
of
the
kitchen
,
which
had
beeninterrupted
by
the
various
incidents
above
related
,
and
especially
bythe
conflict
between
the
two
jesters
,
was
hurried
forward
,
and
for
sometime
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
the
supper
was
served
,
and
all
his
duties
were
fullydischarged
,
Simon
Quanden
,
who
had
been
bustling
about
,
sat
down
inhis
easy
-
chair
,
and
recruited
himself
with
a
toast
and
a
sack
posset
.
<EOS>
Hob
and
Nob
had
their
supper
at
the
same
time
,
and
the
party
at
thetable
,
which
had
been
increased
by
the
two
archers
and
NicholasClamp
,
attacked
with
renewed
vigour
a
fresh
supply
of
mead
and
ale
,
which
had
been
provided
for
them
by
Jack
of
the
Bottles
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
then
turned
upon
Herne
the
Hunter
;
and
as
all
hadheard
more
or
less
about
him
,
and
some
had
seen
him
,
while
few
knewthe
legend
connected
with
him
,
Hector
Cutbeard
volunteered
to
relateit
;
upon
which
all
the
party
gathered
closer
together
,
and
Mabel

left
off
talking
,
and
drew
near

<EOS>
VI
.
 
<EOS>
The
Legend
of
Herne
the
Hunter
.
<EOS>
"Nearly
<EOS>
a
century
and
a
half
ago
,
"
commenced
Cutbeard
,
about
themiddle
of
the
reign
of
Richard
the
Second
,
there
was
among
thekeepers
of
the
forest
a
young
man
named
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
expertbeyond
his
fellows
in
all
matters
of
woodcraft
,
and
consequently
ingreat
favour
with
the
king
,
who
was
himself
devoted
to
the
chase
.
<EOS>
Whenever
he
stayed
at
the
castle
,
King
Richard
,
like
our
own
royalHarry
,
would
pass
his
time
in
hunting
,
hawking
,
or
shooting
with
thelong
-
bow
;
and
on
all
these
occasions
the
young
keeper
was
hisconstant
attendant
.
 
<EOS>
If
a
hart
was
to
be
chased
,
Herne
and
his
twoblack
hounds
of
Saint
Hubert
's
breed
would
hunt
him
down
withmarvellous
speed
;
if
a
wild
boar
was
to
be
reared
,
a
badger
digged
out
,
a
fox
unkennelled
,
a
marten
bayed
,
or
an
otter
vented
,
Herne
waschosen
for
the
task
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
could
fly
a
falcon
so
well
as
Herne
--
no
onecould
break
up
a
deer
so
quickly
or
so
skilfully
as
him
.
<EOS>
But
in
proportionas
he
grew
in
favour
with
the
king
,
the
young
keeper
was
hated
by
hiscomrades
,
and
they
concerted
together
how
to
ruin
him
.
 
<EOS>
All
theirefforts
,
however
,
were
ineffectual
,
and
rather
tended
to
his
advantagethan
injury
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
day
it
chanced
that
the
king
hunted
in
the
forest
with
hisfavourite
,
the
Earl
of
Oxford
,
when
a
great
deer
of
head
wasunharboured
,
and
a
tremendous
chase
ensued
,
the
hart
leading
hispursuers
within
a
few
miles
of
Hungerford
,
<EOS>
whither
the
borders
of
theforest
then
extended
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
followers
of
the
king
,
even
the
Earl
ofOxford
,
had
by
this
time
dropped
off
,
and
the
royal
huntsman
was
onlyattended
by
Herne
,
who
kept
close
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
the
hart
,
drivento
desperation
,
stood
at
bay
,
and
gored
the
king
's
horse
as
he
came
upin
such
a
manner
that
it
reared
and
threw
its
rider
.

received
the
stroke
intended
for
him

<EOS>
Though
desperately
wounded

the

contrived
slightly
toraise
himself

plunged
his

into

with

Herne

with
a

a

'"'Not

the

'"'I

hope

'"'I

he
put

Much
moved

the

rode
off
for
succour

a

call
on

was
presently
joined

Thelatter
were
secretly
rejoiced

hearing
what
had
befallen
Herne

feigned
the

hastened
with
the

thespot

Urswick

taking

he
cut
off

joins

"At
<EOS>
the
precise
time

Herne
,
attended
by
Urswick
,
presentedhimself
to
the
king

<EOS>
He
looked
thin
and
pale
,
but
all
danger
was
past
.
<EOS>
King
Richard
gave
the
forester
a
purse
full
of
nobles
,
and
added
a
silverbugle
to
the
gift
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
appointed
Herne
his
chief
keeper
,
hung
achain
of
gold
round
his
neck
,
and
ordered
him
to
be
lodged
in
thecastle
.
<EOS>
"About
<EOS>
a
week
after
this
,
Herne
,
having
entirely
regained
his
strength
,
accompanied
the
king
on
a
hunting
expedition
to
the
forest
,
and
theyhad
scarcely
entered
it
when
his
horse
started
and
threw
him
.
 
<EOS>
Up
tothat
moment
<EOS>
such
an
accident
had
never
happened
to
him
,
for
he
<EOS>
wasan
excellent
horseman
,
and
<EOS>
he
arose
greatly
discomfited
,
while
thekeepers
eyed
each
other
askance
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
a
buck
was
started
,
and
though
Herne
was
bravely
mounted
on
a
black
steed
bestowed
onhim
on
account
of
its
swiftness
by
the
king
,
he
was
the
last
in
thechase

<EOS>
"'Thou
art
out

laughing

as
he
came
up

<EOS>
"'I
<EOS>
know
not
what
ails

Herne
gloomily
.
<EOS>
"'It
can
not
be
thy
steed
's
fault

said
the
king

he
is
usually
as

I

I

'"Herne
raised
his
crossbow
,
and
let
fly
the
bolt
;
but
it
missed
its
mark
,
and
the
buck
,
startled
by
the
noise
,
dashed
down
the
brake
whollyuninjured
.
<EOS>
"King
<EOS>
Richard
's
brow
grew
dark
,
and
Herne
uttered
an
exclamation
ofrage
and
despair
.
<EOS>
"'Thou
shalt
have
a
third
and
yet
easier
trial

said
the
king

<EOS>
Old
OsmondCrooke
shall
lend
thee
his
bow

thy
quarry
shall
be

magot

pie

'"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
the
arrow
sped
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
quivered
in
the
trunk
of
the
tree
,
some
yards
from
the
bird
.
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
shooter
looked
distracted;but
<EOS>
King
Richard
made
no
remark
,
until
,
towards
the
close
of
the
day
,
he
said
to
him
,
'
Thou

regain
thy

<EOS>
I
cannotcontinue
thee

'"The
keepers
congratulated
each
other
in
secret

they
felt
that
theirmalice
was
about
to
be
gratified

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
next
day
Herne
went
forth
,
as
he
thought
,
alone
,
but
he
waswatched
by
his
enemies

<EOS>
Not
a
shaft
would
go
true

he
found
thathe
had
completely
lost

<EOS>
The
dayafter
that
he
again
rode
forth
to
hunt
with
the

and
his
failuresmade
him
<EOS>
the
laughing

stock
of
the
party

<EOS>
Richard
at
length
dismissedhim
with
these
words
<EOS>
,
'
Take
repose
for
a
week

'"Instead
of
returning
to
the
castle
,
Herne
rode
off
wildly
into
the
forest
,
where
he
remained
till
eventide
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
returned
with
ghastly
looksand
a
strange
appearance
,
having
the
links
of
a
rusty
chain
which
hehad
plucked
from
a
gibbet
hanging
from
his
left
arm
,
and
the
hart'santlered
skull
,
which
he
had
procured
from
Urswick
,
fixed
like
a
helmupon
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
His
whole
demeanour
showed
that
he
was
crazed
;
andhis
condition
,
which
might
have
moved
the
compassion
of
his
foes
,
onlyprovoked
their
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
After
committing
the
wildest
extravagances
,
he
burst
from
all
restraint
,
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
of
thehome
park
.
<EOS>
"An
hour
after
this
a
pedlar
,
who
was
crossing
the
park
from
Datchet
,
found
him
suspended
by
a
rope
from
a
branch
of
the
oak
-
tree
which
youhave
all
seen
,
and
which
bears
his
name

<EOS>
Despair
had
driven
him
to
thedreadful
deed
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
cutting
him
down
,
the
pedlar
ran
to
the
castleto
relate
what
he
had
witnessed
;
and
the
keepers
,
satisfied
that
theirrevenge
was
now
fully
accomplished
,
hastened
with
him
to
the
tree

But
the
body
was
gone

all
that
proclaimed
it
had
been
there

wasthe
rope
hanging
from
the
branch
.
 
<EOS>
Search
was
everywhere
made
forthe
missing
body
,
but
without
effect
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
matter
was
related
tothe
king
<EOS>
he
was
much
troubled
,
and
would
fain
have
had
masses
saidfor
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
the
unfortunate
keeper
,
but
the
priestsrefused
to
perform
them
,
alleging
that
he
had
'
committed
self

destruction
,
and
was
therefore
out
of
the
pale
of
the
Church
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
that
night
,
a
terrible
thunderstorm
occurred
--
as
terrible
,
it
may
be
,
as
that
of
last
night

and
during
its
continuance
,
the
oak
on

had
hanged
himself
was
blasted
by
the
lightning

"Old
<EOS>
Osmond
was
immediately
reinstated
in
his
post
of

<EOS>
he
had
little
time
for
rejoicing

for
he
found
that
the

spell
thathad
bound
Herne
had
fallen
upon
him

His
bolts

arrows
went
wideof

Half
frantic
,

afraid
of

he
feigned
illness

left

"Luckily
<EOS>
,
the
king
had
quitted
the
castle
,

they
felt
certain

be
dismissed
on
his
return

if
not
more
severely
punished

<EOS>
Atlast
,
after
taking
counsel
together
,
they
resolved
to
consult
Urswick
,
who
they
doubted
not
could
remove
the
spell
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
went
toBagshot
Heath
,

related
their
story
to
him

<EOS>
When
they
had
done
,
hesaid
,
'
The
curse
of
Herne

is
upon
you

you
may
learn
how
to
act

<EOS>
'"The
keepers
would
have
questioned
him
further
,

he
refused
toanswer
,
and
dismissed
them
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
shades
of
evening
had
fallen
as
they
quitted
Bagshot
;
and
it
wasmidnight
as
they
entered
the
home
park
,
and
proceeded
towards
thefatal
oak
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
pitchy
dark
,
and
they
could
only
distinguish
the
treeby
its
white

scathed
trunk

<EOS>
All
at
once
,
a
blue
flame
,
like
a
will
-
o'-the

wisp
,
appeared
,
flitted
thrice
round
the
tree

then
remainedstationary

its
light
falling
upon
a
figure
in
a
wild
garb
,
with
a
rustychain
hanging
from
its
left
arm
,
and
an
antlered
helm
upon
its
head

<EOS>
They
knew
it
to
be
Herne
,

instantly
fell
down
before
him
,
while
aburst
of
terrible
laughter
sounded
in
their
ears

<EOS>
"Without
<EOS>
heeding
them
further
,
the
spirit
darted
round
the
tree

rattlingits
chain
,

uttering
appalling
imprecations

<EOS>
It
then
stopped
,
andturning
to
the
terrified
beholders

bade
them
,
in
a
hollow

bringhounds

horses

following
night

"Filled
<EOS>
with
dread
,
the
keepers
returned
home
,
and
the
next
day
OldOsmond
again
sought
the
forester
,

told
him
what
had
occurred

<EOS>
"'You

And
without

he
dismissed

"Osmond
told
his
comrades
what
the
forester
had
said
,
and
though
theywere
filled
with
alarm
,
they
resolved
upon
compliance
.
 
<EOS>
At
midnight
,
therefore
,
they
rode
towards
the
tree
with
the
black
hounds
in
leash
,
and
leading
Herne
's
favourite
horse
,
saddled
and
bridled
.
<EOS>
As
they
drewnear
,
they
again
saw
the
terrible
shape
stalking
round

the
fearful
imprecations

<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
spells
ended
,
Herne
called
to
Osmond
to
bring
him
his
steed

old
man
tremblingly
obeyed
.

In
an
instant
the
mysterious
beingvaulted
on
its
back
,

in
a
voice
of
resistless
authority
cried
,
'
To

<EOS>
With
this
,
he
dashed
forward
,
and
the
whole
party
,
hounds

men
,
hurried
after
him

They
rode
at
a
furious
pace
for
five
or
six
miles
over
the
great
park
,
thekeepers
wondering
where
their
unearthly
leader
was
taking
them
,
andalmost
fancying
they
were
hurrying
to
perdition
,
when
they
descendeda
hillside
leading
to
the
marsh
,
and
halted
before
a
huge
beech
-
tree
,
where
Herne
dismounted
and
pronounced
certain
mystic
words
,
accompanying
them
with
strange
gestures
.
<EOS>
"Presently
,
he
became
silent
and
motionless

<EOS>
A
flash
of
fire
then
burstfrom
the
roots
of
the
tree
,
and
the
forester
Urswick
stood
before
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
aspect
was
more
terrible
and
commanding
than
it
had
seemedheretofore
to
the
keepers

<EOS>
'Welcome

Herne

he
cried
;

'"Not
daring

took
the

it
was

As

Herne

then
commanded

"They
came

"At

the

returned
to

Osmond

todissuade

all
remained
obdurate

Roger

,
falling
on

confessed

accused

kept
his

It

On

having
been
informed
by

thatTristram

was
lodged
in

prison

chamber
in

proceeded
thither
to
question
him

He
found
the
old
manseated
on
a
bench
,
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
;
but
though
evidentlymuch
alarmed
at
his
situation
,
he
could
not
be
brought
either
by
threatsor
proffers
to
make
any
confession
.
<EOS>
Out
of
patience
,
at
length
,
the
king
ordered
him
to
be
conveyed
to
thedungeon
beneath
the
Curfew
Tower
,
and
personally
superintended
hisremoval

<EOS>
"I
will
find

said
Henry

as
he
quittedthe

<EOS>
"
If

you

or
to

Keep

<EOS>
""I
will
do
my
best
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Bouchier
;
"
and
were
it
with
a
mortalfoe
I
had
to
contend
,
I
should
have
no
fear
.
<EOS>
But
what
vigilance
can
availagainst
a
fiend?""You
have
heard
my
injunctions
,
and
will
attend
to
them
,
"
rejoined
theking
harshly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
return
anon
to
the
examination
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
departed
.
<EOS>
Brave
as
a
lion
on
ordinary
occasions
,
Bouchier
entered
upon
hispresent
duty
with
reluctance
and
misgiving
;
and
he
found
thearquebusiers
by
whom
he
was
attended
,
albeit
stout
soldiers
,
equallyuneasy
.
 
<EOS>
Herne
had
now
become
an
object
of
general
dread
throughoutthe
castle
;
and
the
possibility
of
an
encounter
with
him
was
enough
todaunt
the
boldest
breast
.
 
<EOS>
Disguising
his
alarm
,
Bouchier
issued
hisdirections
in
an
authoritative
tone
,
and
then
mounted
with
threearquebusiers
to
the
summit
of
the
tower
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
dark
,
but
themoon
soon
arose
,
and
her
beams
rendered
every
object
asdistinguishable
as
daylight
would
have
done
,
so
that
watch
was
easilykept
.
 
<EOS>
But
nothing
occurred
to
occasion
alarm
,
until
all
at
once
,
a
noiselike
that
of
a
hammer
stricken
against
a
board
,
was
heard
in
thechamber
below
.
<EOS>
Drawing
his
sword
,
Bouchier
hurried
down
the
steps
leading
into
thischamber
,
which
was
buried
in
darkness
,
and
advanced
so
precipitatelyand
incautiously
into
the
gloom
,
that
he
struck
his
head
against
acrossbeam
.
 
<EOS>
The
violence
of
the
blow
stunned
him
for
a
moment
,
but
assoon
as
he
recovered
,
he
called
to
the
guard
in
the
lower
chamber
tobring
up
a
torch
.
 
<EOS>
The
order
was
promptly
obeyed
;
but
,
meanwhile
,
thesound
had
ceased
,
and
,
though
they
searched
about
,
they
could
notdiscover
the
occasion
of
it
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
not
so
wonderful
for
the
singular
construction
of
thechamber
,
with
its
numerous
crossbeams
,
its
deep
embrasures
andrecesses
,
its
insecure
and
uneven
floor
,
its
steep
ladder
-
like
staircases
,
was
highly
favourable
to
concealment
,
it
being
utterly
impossible
,
owing
to
the
intersections
of
the
beams
,
for
the
searchers
to
see
farbefore
them
,
or
to
move
about
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
chamber
wasa
large
wooden
compartment
enclosing
the
cumbrous
and
uncouthmachinery
of
the
castle
clock
,
and
through
the
box
ran
the
cordcommunicating
with
the
belfry
above
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
time
,
pieces
of
ordnancewere
mounted
in
all
the
embrasures
,
but
there
is
now
only
one
gun
,
placed
in
a
porthole
commanding
Thames
Street
,
and
the
longthoroughfare
leading
to
Eton
.
 
<EOS>
The
view
from
this
porthole
of
the
grovesof
Eton
,
and
of
the
lovely
plains
on
the
north
-
west
,
watered
by
the
river
,
is
enchanting
beyond
description
.
<EOS>
Viewed
from
a
recess
which
has
been
partly
closed
,
the
appearance
ofthis
chamber
is
equally
picturesque
and
singular
;
and
it
is
scarcelypossible
to
pass
beneath
its
huge
beams
or
to
gaze
at
the
fantastic
yetstriking
combinations
they
form
in
connection
with
the
deepembrasures
,
the
steep
staircases
and
trap
-
doors
,
and
not
feel
that
thewhole
place
belongs
to
romance
,
and
that
a
multitude
of
strange
andstartling
stories
must
be
connected
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
architects
wereindeed
great
romancers
,
and
built
for
the
painter
and
the
poet
.
<EOS>
Bouchier
and
his
companion
crept
about
under
the
great
meshwork
ofbeams
-
peered
into
all
the
embrasures
,
and
beneath
the
carriages
of
theculverins
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
heap
of
planks
and
beams
lying
on
the
floorbetween
the
two
staircases
,
but
no
one
was
near
it
.
<EOS>
The
result
of
their
investigations
did
not
tend
to
decrease
their
alarm
.
<EOS>
Bouchier
would
fain
have
had
the
man
keep
watch
in
the
chamber
,
butneither
threats
nor
entreaties
could
induce
him
to
remain
there
.
 
<EOS>
Hewas
therefore
sent
below
,
and
the
captain
returned
to
the
roof
.
 
<EOS>
He
hadscarcely
emerged
upon
the
leads
when
the
hammering
recommencedmore
violently
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
In
vain
Bouchier
ordered
his
men
to
godown
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
would
stir
;
and
superstitious
fear
had
by
this
timeobtained
such
mastery
over
the
captain
,
that
he
hesitated
to
descendalone
.
 
<EOS>
To
add
to
his
vexation
,
the
arquebusier
had
taken
the
torch
withhim
,
so
that
he
should
have
to
proceed
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
mustered
up
courage
to
make
the
attempt
;
but
he
pausedbetween
each
step
,
peering
through
the
gloom
,
and
half
fancying
hecould
discern
the
figure
of
Herne
near
the
spot
where
the
pile
of
woodlay
.
 
<EOS>
Certain
<EOS>
it
was
that
the
sound
of
diabolical
laughter
,
mingled
withthe
rattling
of
the
chain
and
the
sharp
blows
of
the
hammer
,
smote
hisears
.
 
<EOS>
The
laughter
became
yet
louder
as
Bouchier
advanced
,
thehammering
ceased
,
and
the
clanking
of
the
chain
showed
that
itsmysterious
wearer
was
approaching
the
foot
of
the
steps
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
captain
had
not
nerve
enough
for
the
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
Invoking
theprotection
of
the
saints
,
he
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
,
and
closed
thelittle
door
at
the
head
of
the
steps
after
him
.
<EOS>
The
demon
was
apparently
satisfied
with
the
alarm
he
had
occasioned
,
for
the
hammering
was
not
renewed
at
that
time
.

<EOS>
Showing
the
Vacillations
of
the
King
between
Wolsey
and
AnneBoleyn
.
<EOS>
Before
returning
to
the
state
apartments
,
Henry
took
a
turn
on
theramparts
on
the
north
side
of
the
castle
,
between
the
Curfew
Towerand
the
Winchester
Tower
,
and
lingered
for
a
short
time
on
the
bastioncommanding
that
part
of
the
acclivity
where
the
approach
,
called
theHundred
Steps
,
is
now
contrived
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
cautioned
the
sentinels
to
bedoubly
vigilant
throughout
the
night
,
and
having
gazed
for
a
moment
atthe
placid
stream
flowing
at
the
foot
of
the
castle
,
and
tinged
with
thelast
rays
of
the
setting
sun
,
he
proceeded
to
the
royal
lodgings
,
andentered
the
banquet
chamber
,
where
supper
was
already
served
.
<EOS>
Wolsey
sat
on
his
right
hand
,
but
he
did
not
vouchsafe
him
a
single
word
,
addressing
the
whole
of
his
discourse
to
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
who
was
placed
on
his
left
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
repast
was
over
,
he
retired
to
his
closet
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
cardinal
would
not
be
so
repulsed
,
and
sent
one
of
his
gentlemen
to
crave
a
moment
's
audience
of
the
king
,
which
with
some
reluctance
was
accorded
.
<EOS>
"
Well
,
cardinal
,
"
cried
Henry
,
as
Wolsey
presented
himself
,
and
the
usher
withdrew
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
playing
a
deep
game
with
me
,
as
you
think
;
but
take
heed
,
for
I
see
through
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
pray
you
dismiss
these
suspicions
from
your
mind
,
my
liege
,
"
said
Wolsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
servant
was
ever
more
faithful
to
his
master
than
I
have
been
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
servant
ever
took
better
care
of
himself
,
"
cried
the
king
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
alone
have
you
wronged
me
to
enrich
yourself
,
but
you
are
ever
intriguing
with
my
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
nourished
in
my
breast
a
viper
;
but
I
will
cast
you
off
--
will
crush
you
as
I
would
the
noxious
reptile
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
stamped
upon
the
floor
,
as
if
he
could
have
trampled
the
cardinal
beneath
his
foot
.
<EOS>
"
Beseech
you
calm
yourself
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Wolsey
,
in
the
soft
and
deprecatory
tone
which
he
had
seldom
known
to
fail
with
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
thought
of
my
own
aggrandisement
,
but
as
it
was
likely
to
advance
your
power
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
countless
benefits
I
have
received
at
your
hands
,
my
soul
overflows
with
gratitude
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
raised
me
from
the
meanest
condition
to
the
highest
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
made
me
your
confidant
,
your
adviser
,
your
treasurer
,
and
with
no
improper
boldness
<EOS>
I
say
it
,
your
friend
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
defy
the
enemies
who
have
poisoned
your
ears
against
me
,
to
prove
that
I
have
ever
abused
the
trust
placed
in
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
sole
fault
that
can
be
imputed
to
me
is
,
that
I
have
meddled
more
with
temporal
matters
than
with
spiritual
,
and
it
is
a
crime
for
which
I
must
answer
before
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
so
acted
because
I
felt
that
I
might
thereby
best
serve
your
highness
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
have
aspired
to
the
papal
throne
--
which
you
well
know
I
have
--
it
has
been
that
I
might
be
yet
a
more
powerful
friend
to
your
majesty
,
and
render
you
what
you
are
entitled
to
be
,
the
first
prince
in
Christendom
.
"
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
!
"
exclaimed
the
king
,
who
was
,
nevertheless
,
moved
by
the
artful
appeal
.
<EOS>
"
The
gifts
I
have
received
from
foreign
princes
,
"
pursued
Wolsey
,
seeing
the
effect
he
had
produced
,
"
the
wealth
I
have
amassed
,
have
all
been
with
a
view
of
benefiting
your
majesty
.
"
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
exclaimed
the
king
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
prove
that
I
speak
the
truth
,
sire
<EOS>
,
"
continued
the
wily
cardinal
,
"
thepalace
at
Hampton
Court
,
which
I
have
just
completed--
"
<EOS>
"
And
at
a
cost
more
lavish
than
I
myself
should
have
expended
on
it
,
"
interrupted
the
king
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
destined
it
for
myself
,
I
should
not
have
spent
a
tithe
of
what
I
have
done
,
"
rejoined
Wolsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
highness
's
unjust
accusations
force
me
to
declare
my
intentions
somewhat
prematurely
.
 
<EOS>
Deign
,
"
he
cried
,
throwing
at
the
king
's
feet
,
"
deign
to
accept
that
palace
and
all
within
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
pleased
,
during
your
late
residence
there
,
to
express
your
approval
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
trust
it
will
find
equal
favour
in
your
eyes
,
now
that
it
is
your
own
.
"
<EOS>
"
By
holy
Mary
,
a
royal
gift

"
cried
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rise
,
You
are
not
the
grasping
,
selfish
person
you
have
been
represented
.
"
<EOS>
"
Declare
as
much
to
my
enemies
,
sire
,
and
I
shall
be
more
content
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
the
palace
better
worth
acceptance
than
at
first
sight
might
appear
.
"
<EOS>
"
How
so
?
"
cried
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
Your
highness
will
be
pleased
to
take
this
key
,
"
said
the
cardinal
;
"
it
is
the
key
of
the
cellar
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
have
some
choice
wine
there
,
"
cried
Henry
significantly
;
"
given
you
by
some
religious
house
,
or
sent
you
by
some
foreign
potentate
,
ha
!
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
wine
that
a
king
might
prize
,
"
replied
the
cardinal
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
majesty
will
find
a
hundred
hogsheads
in
that
cellar
,
and
each
hogshead
filled
with
gold
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
amaze
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
king
,
feigning
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
all
this
you
freely
give
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
Freely
and
fully
,
sire
,
"
replied
Wolsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
have
saved
it
for
you
.
<EOS>
Men
think
I
have
cared
for
myself
,
whereas
I
have
cared
only
for
your
majesty
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
liege
,
by
the
devotion
I
have
just
approved
to
you
,
and
which
I
would
also
approve
,
if
needful
,
with
my
life
,
I
beseech
you
to
consider
well
before
you
raise
Anne
Boleyn
to
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
In
giving
you
this
counsel
,
I
know
I
hazard
the
favour
I
have
just
regained
.
<EOS>
But
even
at
that
hazard
,
I
must
offer
it
.
 
<EOS>
Your
infatuation
blinds
you
to
the
terrible
consequences
of
the
step
.
 
<EOS>
The
union
is
odious
to
all
your
subjects
,
but
most
of
all
to
those
not
tainted
with
the
new
heresies
and
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
never
be
forgiven
by
the
Emperor
Charles
the
Fifth
,
who
will
seek
to
avenge
the
indignity
offered
to
his
illustrious
relative
;
while
Francis
will
gladly
make
it
a
pretext
for
breaking
his
truce
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Add
to
this
the
displeasure
of
the
Apostolic
See
,
and
it
must
be
apparent
that
,
powerful
as
you
are
,
your
position
will
be
one
of
infinite
peril
.
"
<EOS>
"
Thus
far
advanced
,
I
can
not
honourably
abandon
the
divorce
,
"
said
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
advise
its
abandonment
,
sire
,
"
replied
Wolsey
;
"
but
do
not
let
it
be
a
means
of
injuring
you
with
all
men
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
let
a
mal
-
alliance
place
your
very
throne
in
jeopardy
;
as
,
with
your
own
subjects
and
all
foreign
powers
against
you
,
must
necessarily
be
the
case
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
speak
warmly
,
cardinal
,
"
said
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
My
zeal
prompts
me
to
do
so
,
"
replied
Wolsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
Anne
Boleyn
is
in
no
respect
worthy
of
the
honour
you
propose
her
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
whom
do
you
think
more
worthy
?
"
demanded
Henry
.
<EOS>
"
Those
whom
I
have
already
recommended
to
your
majesty
,
the
Duchess
d'Alencon
,
or
the
Princess
Renee
,
"
replied
Wolsey
;
"
by
a
union
with
either
of
whom
you
would
secure
the
cordial
co
-
operation
of
Francis
,
and
the
interests
of
the
see
of
Rome
,
which
,
in
the
event
of
a
war
with
Spain
,
you
may
need
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
Wolsey
,
"
replied
Henry
,
taking
a
hasty
turn
across
the
chamber
;
"
no
considerations
of
interests
or
security
shall
induce
me
to
give
up
Anne

<EOS>
I
love
her
too
well
for
that

<EOS>
Let
the

will
remain
firm
to
my
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
play
the
hypocrite
with
you
,
whatever
I
may
do
with
others
.
 
<EOS>
I
cast
off
Catherine
<EOS>
that
I
may
we
d
Anne
,
because
I
can
not
otherwise
obtain
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
shall
I
now
,
when
I
have
dared
so
much
,
and
when
the
prize
is
within
my
grasp
,
abandon
it?--Never
!
<EOS>
Threats
,
expostulations
,
entreaties
are
alike
unavailing
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
grieve
to
hear
it
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Wolsey
,
heaving
a
deep
sigh
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
ill
-
omened
union
,
and
will
bring
woe
to
you
,
woe
to
your
realm
,
and
woe
to
the
Catholic
Church
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
woe
to
you
also
,
false
cardinal
,
"
cried
Anne
Boleyn
,
throwing
aside
the
arras
,
and
stepping
forward
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
overheard
what
has
passed
;
and
from
my
heart
of
hearts
I
thank
you
,
Henry
,
for
the
love
you
have
displayed
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
here
solemnly
vow
never
to
give
my
hand
to
you
till
Wolsey
is
dismissed
from
your
counsels
.
"
<EOS>
"
Anne
!
"
exclaimed
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
My
own
enmity
I
could
forego
,
"
pursued
Anne
<EOS>
vehemently,"but
I
can
not
forgive
him
his
duplicity
and
perfidy
towards
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
just
proffered
you
his
splendid
palace
of
Hampton
,
and
his
treasures
;
and
wherefore?--I
will
tell
you
:
because
he
feared
they
would
be
wrested
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
jester
had
acquainted
him
with
the
discovery
just
made
of
the
secret
hoard
,
and
he
was
therefore
compelled
to
have
recourse
to
this
desperate
move
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
was
apprized
of
his
intentions
by
Will
Sommers
,
and
have
come
in
time
to
foil
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
By
my
faith
,
I
believe
you
are
right
,
sweetheart
,
"
said
the
king
.
<EOS>
"
Go
,
tell
your
allies
,
Francis
and
Clement
,
that
the
king
's
love
for
me
outweighs
his
fear
of
them
,
"
cried
Anne
,
laughing
spitefully
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
for
you
,
I
regard
you
as
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
"
Vain
woman
,
your
pride
will
be
abased
,
"
rejoined
Wolsey
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Vain
man
,
you
are
already
abased
,
"
replied
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
few
weeks
ago
I
would
have
made
terms
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
am
your
mortal
enemy
,
and
will
never
rest
till
I
have
procured
your
downfall
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
king
will
have
an
amiable
consort
,
truly
,
"
sneered
Wolsey
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
have
one
who
can
love
him
and
hate
his
foes
,
"
replied
Anne
;
"
and
not
one
who
would
side
with
them
and
thee
,
as
would
be
the
case
with
the
Duchess
d'Alencon
or
the
Princess
Renee
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
you
know
the
sole
terms
on
which
you
can
procure
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
The
king
nodded
a
playful
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"
Then
dismiss
him
at
once
,
disgrace
him
,
"
said
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
nay
,
"
replied
Henry
,
"
the
divorce
is
not
yet
passed
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
angered
now
,
and
will
view
matters
more
coolly
to
-
morrow
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
change
my
resolution
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
If
my
dismissal
and
disgrace
can
save
my
sovereign
,
I
pray
him
to
sacrifice
me
without
hesitation
,
"
said
Wolsey
;
"
but
while
I
have
liberty
of
speech
with
him
,
and
aught
of
power
remaining
,
I
will
use
it
to
his
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
I
pray
your
majesty
suffer
me
to
retire
.
"
<EOS>
And
receiving
a
sign
of
acquiescence
from
the
king
,
he
withdrew

amid
the
triumphant
laughter
of
Anne

How
Tristram
Lyndwood
was
interrogated
by
the
King
.
<EOS>
Anne
Boleyn
remained
with
her
royal
lover
for
a
few
minutes
to
pourforth
her
gratitude
for
the
attachment
he
had
displayed
to
her
,
and
toconfirm
the
advantage
she
had
gained
over
Wolsey
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
shewas
gone
,
Henry
summoned
an
usher
,
and
giving
him
some
instructionsrespecting
Mabel
Lyndwood
,
proceeded
to
the
Curfew
Tower
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
said
to
him
of
the
strange
noise
that
had
been
heard
in
theupper
chamber
,
for
the
arquebusiers
were
fearful
of
exciting
hisdispleasure
by
a
confession
of
their
alarm
,
and
he
descended
at
onceto
the
dungeon
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
fellow
<EOS>
,
"
he
cried
,
sternly
regarding
the
captive
,
who
arose
at
hisentrance
,
"
you
have
now
had
ample
time
for
reflection
,
and
I
trust
are
ina
better
frame
of
mind
than
when
I
last
spoke
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
command
<EOS>
youto
declare
all
you
know
<EOS>
concerning
Herne
the
Hunter

to
give
mesuch
information

enable

<EOS>
""I
have
already
told
your
highness
that
my
mouth
is
sealed
by
an
oathof
secrecy

replied
Tristram
,
humbly
,
but
firmly
.
<EOS>
"Obstinate
dog
!
<EOS>
thou
shalt
either
speak
,
or
I
will
hang
thee
from
the
topof
this
tower

as
I
hanged
Mark
Fytton
the
butcher

<EOS>
roared
Henry
.
<EOS>
"You
will
execute
your

the

""If

"The
<EOS>
old
man
started
at
the
command

and
trembled
violently
.
 
<EOS>
The
nextmoment
,
Mabel
was
led
into
the
dungeon
by
Shoreditch
andPaddington
.
<EOS>
Behind
her
came
Nicholas
Clamp
.
 
<EOS>
On
seeing
her
grandsire
,
she
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
would
have
rushed
towards
him

she
washeld
back
by
her
companions

<EOS>
"Oh

<EOS>
she
cried

done?-why

Tristram
groaned
,
and
averted
his
head
.
<EOS>
"He
is
charged
with
felony

sorcery

said
the
king
sternly

you

come
under
the

suspicion

""Believe

himself
at

Whatever

She

brought
up

devoutly

she

""Yet

"Not

Tristram

demanded

<EOS>
"I

Nicholas

stepping
forward

He

""Ha

Clamp

Mabel
disbelieved

I

sobbed
audibly

sternly

If

he
will

<EOS>
""Oh

Mabel

What
matters
the
violationof

And
withoutbestowing
a
look
at
Mabel

feared

he
quitted

"I

Of
the
Brief
Advantage
gained
by
the
Queen

the
Cardinal
.
<EOS>
As
the
king
,
wholly
unattended
--
for
he
had
left
the
archers
at
theCurfew
Tower

was
passing
at
the
back
of
Saint
George
's
Chapel
,
nearthe
north
transept
,
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
embattledentrance
to
the
New
Commons
--
a
structure
erected
in
the
eleventh
yearof
his
own
reign
by
James
Denton
,
a
canon
,
and
afterwards
Dean
ofLichfield
,
for
the
accommodation
of
such
chantry
priests
and
choristersas
<EOS>
had
no
place
in
the
college

<EOS>
Over
the
doorway
,
surmounted
by
aniche
,
ran
(
and
still
runs
)
<EOS>
the
inscription--"AEDES

<EOS>
A.D.1519."The
building
has
since
been
converted
into
one
of
the

'
houses

<EOS>
While
he
was
contemplating
this
beautiful
gateway
,
which
wasglimmering
in
the
bright
moonlight
,
a
tall
figure
suddenly
darted
frombehind
one
of
the
buttresses
of
the
chapel
,
and
seized
his
left
arm
withan
iron
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
The
suddenness
of
the
attack
took
him
by
surprise
;
buthe
instantly
recovered
himself
,
plucked
away
his
arm
,
and
,
drawing
hissword
,
made
a
pass
at
his
assailant
,
who
,
however
,
avoided
the
thrust
,
and
darted
with
inconceivable
swiftness
through
the
archway
leadingto
the
cloisters
.
 
<EOS>
Though
Henry
followed
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
he
lostsight
of
the
fugitive
,
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
enter
the
passagerunning
between
the
tomb
-
house
and
the
chapel
,
he
perceived
a
personin
the
south
ambulatory
evidently
anxious
to
conceal
himself
,
and
,
rushing
up
to
him
and
dragging
him
to
the
light
he
found
it
was
no
otherthan
the
cardinal
's
jester
,
Patch

<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
does
thou
here
,
knave
?
"
cried
Henry
angrily
.
<EOS>
"I
am
waiting
for
my
master

the
cardinal

replied
the
jester
,
terrifiedout
of
his
wits

<EOS>
"Waiting
<EOS>

him
here

cried
the
king

<EOS>
"
Where
is
he?""In

house

Patch

pointing
to
a
beautiful
bay

window
,
full
ofstained
glass
,
overhanging
the
exquisite
arches
of
the
northambulatory

<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
that
is
Doctor
Sampson

dwelling

"
cried
Henry
;
"
he
who
waschaplain
to
the
queen

and
is
a
strong
opponent

<EOS>
Whatdoth
<EOS>
he
there?""I
am
sure
I
know

replied
Patch

whose
terror
increased
eachmoment

<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
have
mistaken
the
house

<EOS>
Indeed

the
next
door

<EOS>
""Thou
<EOS>
liest

knave

cried
Henry
fiercely
;
"
thy
manner
convinces
methere
is
some
treasonable
practice
going
forward

<EOS>
But
I
will
soon
find
itout

<EOS>
Attempt
to
give
the
alarm

I
will
cut
thy
throat

"With
<EOS>
this
he
proceeded
to
the
back
of
the
north
ambulatory
,
and
findingthe
door
he
sought
unfastened
,
raised
the
latch
and
walked
softly
in
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
got
half
-
way
down
the
passage
,
Doctor
Sampson
himselfissued
from
an
inner
room
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
He
started
onseeing
the
king
,
and
exhibited
great
alarm
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Cardinal
of
York
is
here
--
<EOS>
I
know
it
,

said
Henry
in
a
deep
whisper
.
<EOS>
"Lead
me
to
him

<EOS>
""Oh
,
go
not
forward
,
my
gracious
liege

<EOS>
cried
Sampson
,
placing
himselfin
his
path
.
"Wherefore
<EOS>
not
?
"
rejoined
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
what
voice
is
that
I
heard
inthe
upper
chamber
?
<EOS>
Is
she
here

and
with
Wolsey

<EOS>
Out
of
my
way

man,"he
added
,
pushing
the
canon
aside
,
and
rushing
up
the
short
woodenstaircase
.
<EOS>
When
Wolsey
returned
from
his
interview
with
the
king
,
which
had
beenso
unluckily
interrupted
by
Anne
Boleyn
,
he
found
his
ante
-
chamberbeset
with
a
crowd
of
suitors
to
whose
solicitations
<EOS>
he
was
compelledto
listen
,
and
having
been
detained
in
this
manner
for
nearly
half
anhour
<EOS>
,
he
at
length
retired
into
an
inner
room
.
<EOS>
"Vile
sycophants
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
,
"
they
bow
the
knee
before
me

payme
greater
homage

desert

Not

wouldlend
a
helping
hand
to
crush
me
.
 
<EOS>
Not
one
but
would
rejoice
in
mydownfall
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
have
not
deceived
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
them
from
the
first
--
saw
through
their
hollowness
and
despised
them
.
 
<EOS>
While
power
lasts
tome

I
will
punish
some
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
While
power
lasts
!
"
he
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
HaveI
any
power
remaining
?
<EOS>
I
have
already
given
up
Hampton
and
mytreasures
to
the
king
;
and
the
work
of
spoliation
once
commenced
,
theroyal
plunderer
will
not
be
content
till
he
has
robbed
me
of
all
;
while
hisminion
,
Anne
Boleyn
,
has
vowed
my
destruction
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
not
yieldtamely
,
nor
fall
unavenged

<EOS>
"As
these
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
,
Patch
,
who
had
waited
fora
favourable
moment
to
approach
him
,
delivered
him
a
small
billetcarefully
sealed
,
and
fastened
with
a
silken
thread
.
 
<EOS>
Wolsey
took
it
,
andbroke
it
open
;
and
as
his
eye
eagerly
scanned
its
contents
,
theexpression
of
his
countenance
totally
changed
.
 
<EOS>
A
flash
of
joy
andtriumph
irradiated
his
fallen
features
;
and
thrusting
the
note
into
thefolds
of
his
robe
,
he
inquired
of
the
jester
by
whom
it
had
been
brought
,
and
how
long
.
<EOS>
"It
was
brought
by
a
messenger
from
Doctor
Sampson
,
"
replied
Patch,"and
was
committed
to
me
with
special
injunctions
to
deliver
it
to
yourgrace
immediately
on
your
return
,
and
secretly
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
cardinal
sat
down
,
and
for
a
few
moments
appeared
lost
in
deepreflection
;
he
then
arose
,
and
telling
Patch
he
should
return
presently
,
quitted
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
jester
,
who
was
of
an
inquisitive
turn
,
anddid
not
like
to
be
confined
to
half
a
secret
<EOS>
,
determined
to
follow
him
,
and
accordingly
tracked
him
along
the
great
corridor
,
down
a
windingstaircase
,
through
a
private
door
near
the
Norman
Gateway
,
across
themiddle
ward
,
and
finally
saw
him
enter
Doctor
Sampson
's
dwelling
,
atthe
back
of
the
north
ambulatory
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
reconnoitring
the
windows
ofthe
house
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
cloisters
in
the
hope
ofdiscovering
something
,
when
he
was
caught
,
as
before
mentioned
,
bythe
king
.
<EOS>
Wolsey
,
meanwhile
,
was
received
by
Doctor
Sampson
at
the
doorway
ofhis
dwelling
,
and
ushered
by
him
into
a
chamber
on
the
upper
floor
,
wainscoted
with
curiously
carved
and
lustrously
black
oak
.
 
<EOS>
A
silverlamp
was
burning
the
on
the
table
,
and
in
the
recess
of
the
window
,
which
was
screened
by
thick
curtains
,
sat
a
majestic
lady
,
who
rose
onthe
cardinal
's
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Catherine
of
Arragon
.
<EOS>
"I
attend
your
pleasure
,
madam
,
"
said
Wolsey
,
with
a
profoundinclination
.
<EOS>
"You
have
been
long
in
answering
my
summons
,
"
said
the
queen
;
"
but
Icould
not
expect
greater
promptitude
.
 
<EOS>
Time
was
when
a
summonsfrom
Catherine
of
Arragon
would
have
been
quickly
and
cheerfullyattended
to
;
when
the
proudest
noble
in
the
land
would
have
borne
hermessage
to
you
,
and
when
you
would
have
passed
through
crowds
toher
audience
-
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
Now
another
holds
her
place
,
and
she
isobliged
secretly
to
enter
the
castle
where
she
once
ruled
,
to
despatcha
valet
to
her
enemy
,
to
attend
his
pleasure
,
and
to
receive
him
in
thedwelling
of
an
humble
canon
.
 
<EOS>
Times
are
changed
with
me
,
Wolsey
--
sadly
changed
.
<EOS>
""I
have
been
in
attendance
on
the
king
,
madam
,
or
<EOS>
I
should
have
beenwith
you
sooner
,
"
replied
Wolsey
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
grieves
me
sorely
to
see
youhere
.
<EOS>
""I
want
not
your
pity
,
"
replied
the
queen
proudly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
send
for
youto
gratify
your
malice
by
exposing
my
abject
state
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
send
foryou
to
insult
me
by
false
sympathy
;
but
in
the
hope
that
your
owninterest
would
induce
you
to
redress
the
wrongs
you
have
done
me
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
madam
,
I
fear
it
is
now
too
late
to
repair
the
error
I
havecommitted
,
"
said
Wolsey
,
in
a
tone
of
affected
penitence
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
admit
,
then
,
that
it
was
an
error
,
"
cried
Catherine
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
that
issomething
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
you
had
paused
before
you
began
this
evil
work

before
you
had
raised
a
storm

will
destroy
me

<EOS>
Yourquarrel

<EOS>
""I

all
your
reproaches
,
madam

"
said
Wolsey
,
with
feignedmeekness
;
"
and
I
will
bear
them
without
a
murmur
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
sentfor
me
for
some
specific
object
<EOS>
,
I

<EOS>
the

,
"

""I

not

the

displeasure

Wolsey
.
"Dissembler

exclaimed
Catherine

I
now
perceive
the
insincerity
ofyour

And
now
to

""Ha

the
cardinal
joyfully
;

all
the

be

Let
me
see
the

I
pray
you

<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
Catherine
could
reply
,
the
door
was
thrown
violently
open
,
andthe
king
stood
before
them
.
"Soh

<EOS>
roared
Henry
,
casting
a
terrible
look

"
I

he
added

turning

meekly

steadily

returned
his
gaze

whatbrings
you

<EOS>
Because
I

""I

replied
Wolsey
,
recoveringhimself
,
"
I
leave
it
to
the
queen

explain
why
I
came
hither

<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
explanation
shall
be
given
at

"
said
Catherine
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
sent
for
thecardinal
to
request
him
to
lay
before
your

these
two
lettersfrom
Anne

to
Sir
Thomas
Wyat

you
might
judge

"Henry
glanced
at
the
letters

his
brow
grew
dark

<EOS>
"What
say
you
to

my
liege

<EOS>
cried
Catherine

with

In
the
one
she
vows
eternal
constancy

in
the
other
--
written
after

engagement

""Ten
thousand

cried
the
king

<EOS>
"
Where
got
you
these
letters

madam?""They
were
given
to
me
by
a
tall
dark
man
,
as
I
quitted
the
castle
lastnight

said
the
queen

<EOS>
"
He
said
they
were
taken
from

he
lay
concealed
in

cave
of
Hernethe

""If

Catherine

I

satisfied

""I
am
well
assured
that

when

for

said
Wolsey

<EOS>
"Perdition

exclaimed
the
king
,
striking
his
brow
with
his
clenchedhand
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh

<EOS>
he
continued
,
after
a
pause

during

watched

it

""I

No

""Make

""Right

replied
Wolsey

<EOS>
"
If
this
mood
will
only
endure,"he
muttered
,
"
all
will
go
well

<EOS>
But
his
jealousy
must
not
be
allowed
tocool

<EOS>
Would
that
Wyat
were

Sampson
could
scarcely
credit
his
senses
as
he
beheld
theaugust
pair
come
forth
together
,
and
a
word
from
Wolsey
explainingwhat
had
occurred
,
threw
him
into
transports
of
delight

<EOS>
But
thesurprise
of
the
good
canon
was
nothing
to
that
exhibited
as
Henry

entered
the
royal
lodgings

the

ordered

<EOS>

Mabel
were
liberated

<EOS>
Intelligence
of
the
queen
's
return
was
instantly
conveyed
to
AnneBoleyn

and
filled
her
with
indescribable
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
All
her
visions
of
powerand
splendour
seemed
to
melt
away
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
She
sent
for
her
father
,
Lord
Rochford
,
who
hurried
to
her
in
a
state
of
the
utmost
anxiety
,
andclosely
questioned
her
whether
the
extraordinary
change
had
not
beenoccasioned
by
some
imprudence
of
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
positively
deniedthe
charge
,
alleging
that
she
had
parted
with
the
king
scarcely
an
hourbefore
on
terms
of
the
most
perfect
amity
,
and
with
the
full
convictionthat
she
had
accomplished
the
cardinal
's
ruin
.
<EOS>
"You
should
not
have
put
forth
your
hand
against
him
till
you
were
sureof
striking
the
blow
,

said
Rochford
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
telling
what
secretinfluence
he
has
over
the
king
;
and
there
may
yet
be
a
hard
battle
tofight
.
 
<EOS>
But
not
a
moment
must
be
lost
in
counteracting
his
operations
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
Suffolk
is
here
,
and
his
enmity
to
the
cardinal
will
make
him
asure
friend

Pray
Heaven
<EOS>
you
have
not
given

freshoccasion

<EOS>
That
is
all
I
fear

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
quitting
his
daughter

he
sought
out
Suffolk
,
who
,
alarmed
at
whatappeared
like
a
restoration
of
Wolsey
to

promised
heartily
to
co

operate
with
him
in
the
struggle
;
and
that
no
time
might
be
lost
,
theduke
proceeded
at
once
to
the
royal
closet
,
where
he
found
the
kingpacing
moodily
to

<EOS>
"Your

disturbed

said
the
duke

<EOS>
"Disturbed!--ay

exclaimed
the
king

<EOS>
"
I
have
enough
to
disturb

"
Impossible

my

exclaimed
Suffolk
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
so
I
thought
,
"
cried
Henry
,
"
and
I
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
allinsinuations
thrown
out
against
her
,
till
proof
was
afforded
which
Icould
no
longer
doubt

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
was
the

asked
Suffolk

said
Henry

them
to
him

on

""But
<EOS>
these
only
prove

my

the
existence

a
former

nothing
more

remarked
Suffolk
,
after
he
had
scanned
them

<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
she
vows
eternal
constancy

"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
;
"

so

can

her

?
<EOS>
Suffolk
,
I
feel
she
does
not
love

my
passion
is
so
deep

devouring

Ihave
only
won
her
in
my
quality
of
king
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
am
persuaded
your
majesty
is
mistaken
,
"
said
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
Icould
think
so
!
"
<EOS>
sighed
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
no
--
<EOS>
no
,
I
can
not
be
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
I
willconquer
this
fatal
passion
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
,
Suffolk
!
<EOS>
it
is
frightful
to
be
thebondslave
of
a
woman
--
a
fickle
,
inconstant
woman
.
<EOS>
But
between
thedepths
of
love
and
hate
is
but
a
step
;
and
I
can
pass
from
one
to
theother
.
<EOS>
""Do
nothing
rashly
,
my
dear
liege
,
"
said
Suffolk
;
"
nothing
that
may
bringwith
it
after
-
repentance
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
be
swayed
by
those
who
have
inflamedyour
jealousy
,
and
who
could
practise
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
Think
the
matter
calmlyover
,
and
then
act
.
 
<EOS>
And
till
you
have
decided
,
see
neither
Catherine
norAnne
;
and
,
above
all
,
do
not
admit
Wolsey
to
your
secret
counsels
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
are
his
enemy
,
Suffolk
,
"
said
the
king
sternly
.
<EOS>
"I
am
your
majesty
's
friend
,
"
replied
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beseech
you
,
yield
tome
on
this
occasion
,
and
I
am
sure
of
your
thanks
hereafter
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
believe
you
are
right
,
my
good
friend
and
brother
,
"
said
Henry,"and
I
will
curb
my
impulses
of
rage
and
jealousy
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
before
Isee
either
the
queen
or
Anne
,
we
will
ride
forth
into
the
forest
,
and
talkthe
matter
further
over
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
highness
has
come
to
a
wise
determination
,
"
said
the
duke
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
Suffolk
!
"
<EOS>
sighed
Henry
,
"
would
I
had
never
seen
this
siren
!
<EOS>
Sheexercises
a
fearful
control
over
me
,
and
enslaves
my
very
soul
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
say
whether
it
is
for
good
or
ill
that
you
have
met
,
my
dearliege
,
"
replied
Suffolk
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
fancy
I
can
discern
the
way
in
which
yourultimate
decision
will
be
taken
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
now
near
midnight
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
yourmajesty
sound
and
untroubled
repose
.
<EOS>
""Stay
!
"
cried
Henry
,
"
I
am
about
to
visit
the
Curfew
Tower
,
and
musttake
you
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
explain
my
errand
as
we
go
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
somethought
of
sending
you
there
in
my
stead
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
glancingat
his
finger
,
"
By
Saint
Paul
,
it
is
gone!""What
is
gone
,
my
liege
?
"
asked
Suffolk
.
<EOS>
My
signet
,
"
replied
Henry
,
"
I
missed
it
not
till
now
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
wrestedfrom
me
by
the
fiend
,
during
my
walk
from
the
Curfew
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
notlose
a
moment
,
or
the
prisoners
will
be
set
free
by
him,--if
they
have
notbeen
liberated
already
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
took
a
couple
of
dags
--
a
species
of
short
gun--
from
a
reston
the
wall
,
and
giving
one
to
Suffolk
,
thrust
the
other
into
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
Thus
armed
,
they
quitted
the
royal
lodgings
,
and
hurried
in
the
directionof
the
Curfew
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
they
reached
the
Horseshoe
Cloisters
,
the
alarm
-
bell
began
to
ring
.
<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
I
not
tell
you
so
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
furiously
;
"
they
have
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
itceases!--what
has
happened?"About
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
the
king
had
quitted
the
Curfew
Tower
,
a
tall
man
,
enveloped
in
a
cloak
,
and
wearing
a
high
conical
cap
,
presented
himself
to
the
arquebusier
stationed
at
the
entrance
to
thedungeon
,
and
desired
to
be
admitted
to
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
"I
have
the
king
's
signet
,
"
he
said
,
holding
forth
the
ring
.
 
<EOS>
On
seeing
this
,
the
arquebusier
,
who
recognised
the
ring
,
unlocked
the
door
,
andadmitted
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mabel
was
kneeling
on
the
ground
beside
her
grandsire
,
with
her
hands
raised
as
in
prayer
,
but
as
the
tall
man
entered
thevault
,
she
started
to
her
feet
,
and
uttered
a
slight
scream
.
<EOS>
"What
is
the
matter
,
child
?
"
cried
Tristram
..
"He
<EOS>
is
here!--he
is
come
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mabel
,
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
terror
.
"Who
--
the
king
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Tristram
,
looking
up
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
!
<EOS>
Herne
is
cometo
deliver
me
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
go
with
him
,
grandsire
,
"
cried
Mabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
all
thesaints
,
I
implore
you
,
do
not
.
<EOS>
""Silence
her
!
"
said
Herne
in
a
harsh
,
imperious
voice
,
"
or
I
leave
you
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
old
man
looked
imploringly
at
his
granddaughter
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
know
the
conditions
of
your
liberation
?
"
said
Herne
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
--
<EOS>
I
do
,
"
replied
Tristram
hastily
,
and
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
grandfather
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mabel
,
falling
at
his
feet
,
"
do
not
<EOS>
,
I
conjure
you
,
make
any
conditions
with
this
dreaded
being
,
or
it
will
be
at
theexpense
of
your
salvation
.
 
<EOS>
Better
I
should
perish
at
the
stake
--
betteryou
should
suffer
the
most
ignominious
death
,
than
this
should
be
.
<EOS>
""Do
you
accept
them
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Herne
,
disregarding
her
supplications
.
<EOS>
Tristram
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Recall
<EOS>
your
words
,
grandfather
--
recall
your
words
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mabel
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
willimplore
pardon
for
you
on
my
knees
from
the
king
,
and
he
will
notrefuse
me
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
pledge
can
not
be
recalled
,
damsel
,
"
said
Herne
;
"
and
it
is
to
saveyou
from
the
king
,
as
much
as
to
accomplish
his
own
preservation
,
thatyour
grandsire
consents
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
not
have
you
a
victim
to
Henry'slust
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
he
divided
the
forester
's
bonds
with
his
knife
.
<EOS>
"You
must
go
with
him
,
Mabel
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
Something
warns
me
that
a
great
danger
awaitsme
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
must
go
,
girl
,
"
cried
Tristram
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
leave
you
to
Henry
's
lawless
passion
.
<EOS>
"Meanwhile
<EOS>
,
Herne
had
passed
into
one
of
the
large
embrasures
,
andopened
,
by
means
of
a
spring
,
an
entrance
to
a
secret
staircase
in
thewall
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
beckoned
Tristram
towards
him
,
and
whispered
someinstructions
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"I
understand
,
"
replied
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Proceed
to
the
cave
,
"
cried
Herne
,
"
and
remain
there
till
I
join
you
.
<EOS>
"Tristram
nodded
assent
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
Mabel
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
advancing
towards
her
,
and
seizing
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"Away!"cried
<EOS>
Herne
in
a
menacing
tone
.
<EOS>
Terrified
by
the
formidable
looks
and
gestures
of
the
demon
,
the
poorgirl
offered
no
resistance
,
and
her
grandfather
drew
her
into
theopening
,
which
was
immediately
closed
after
her
.
<EOS>
About
an
hour
after
this
,
and
when
it
was
near
upon
the
stroke
<EOS>
ofmidnight
,
the
arquebusier
who
had
admitted
the
tall
stranger
to
thedungeon
,
and
who
had
momentarily
expected
his
coming
forth
,
<EOS>
openedthe
door
to
see
what
was
going
forward
.
 
<EOS>
Great
was
his
astonishment
tofind
the
cell
empty
!
<EOS>
After
looking
around
in
bewilderment
,
he
rushed
tothe
chamber
above
,
to
tell
his
comrades
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
"This
is
clearly
the
work
of
the
fiend
,
"
said
Shoreditch
;
"
it
is
useless
tostrive
against
him
.
<EOS>
""That
tall
black
man
was
doubtless
Herne
himself
.
"
said
Paddington
.
 
<EOS>
"
Iam
glad
he
did
us
no
injury
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
king
will
not
provoke
his
malicefurther
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
we
must
inform
Captain
Bouchier
of
the
mischance
,
"
saidShoreditch
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
be
in
thy
skin
,
Mat
Bee
,
for
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
The
kingwill
be
here
presently
,
and
then--""It
is
impossible
to
penetrate
through
the
devices
of
the
evil
one,"interrupted
Mat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
sworn
it
was
the
royal
signet
,
for
I
saw
iton
the
king
's
finger
as
he
delivered
the
order
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
such
anotherchance
of
capturing
the
fiend
would
occur
to
me
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
the
words
were
uttered
,
the
door
of
a
recess
was
thrown
suddenlyopen
,
and
Herne
,
in
his
wild
garb
,
with
his
antlered
helm
upon
his
brow
,
and
the
rusty
chain
depending
from
his
left
arm
,
stood
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
Hisappearance
was
so
terrific
and
unearthly
that
they
all
shrank
aghast
,
and
Mat
Bee
fell
with
his
face
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"I
am
here
!
"
cried
the
demon
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
braggart
,
wilt
dare
to
seize
me?"But
not
a
hand
was
moved
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
party
seemedtransfixed
with
terror
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
dare
not
brave
my
power
,
and
you
are
right
,
"
cried
Herne--
"
a
waveof
my
hand
would
bring
this
old
tower
about
your
ears
--
a
word
wouldsummon
a
legion
of
fiends
to
torment
you
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
do
not
utter
it
,
I
pray
you
,
good
Herne
--
excellent
Herne
,
"
cried
MatBee
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
above
all
things
,
do
not
wave
your
hand
,
for
we
have
nodesire
to
be
buried
<EOS>
alive,--
<EOS>
have
we
,
comrades
?
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
saidwhat
<EOS>
I
did
if
I
had
thought
your
fiendship
within
hearing
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
royal
master
will
as
vainly
seek
to
contend
with
me
as
he
did
tobury
me
beneath
the
oak
-
tree
,
"
cried
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
want
me
further
,
seek
me
in
the
upper
chamber
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
these
words
he
darted
up
the
ladder
-
like
flight
of
steps
anddisappeared
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
recovered
from
the
fright
that
had
enchained
them
,
Shoreditch
and
Paddington
rushed
forth
into
the
area
in
front
of
theturret
,
and
shouting
to
those
on
the
roof
told
them
that
Herne
was
inthe
upper
room
--
a
piece
of
information
which
was
altogethersuperfluous
,
as
the
hammering
had
recommenced
,
and
continued
tillthe
clock
struck
twelve
,
when
it
stopped
.
 
<EOS>
Just
then
,
it
occurred
to
MatBee
to
ring
the
alarm
-
bell
,
and
he
seized
the
rope
,
and
began
to
pull
it;but
<EOS>
the
bell
had
scarcely
sounded
,
when
the
cord
,
severed
from
above
,
fell
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
king
and
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
When
toldwhat
had
happened
,
though
prepared
for
it
,
Henry
burst
into
a
terriblepassion
,
and
bestowed
a
buffet
on
Mat
Bee
,
that
well
nigh
broke
hisjaw
,
and
sent
him
reeling
to
the
farther
side
of
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
notat
first
understood
that
Herne
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
upper
room;but
as
soon
as
he
was
made
aware
of
the
circumstance
,
he
criedout--"Ah
,
dastards
!
<EOS>
have
you
let
him
brave
you
thus
?
<EOS>
But
I
am
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
His
capture
is
reserved
for
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
expose
yourself
to
this
risk
,
my
gracious
liege
,
"
said
Suffolk
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
are
you
too
a
sharer
in
their
womanish
fears
,
Suffolk
?
"
criedHenry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
had
been
made
of
stouter
stuff
.
 
<EOS>
If
there
isdanger
,
I
shall
be
the
first
to
encounter
it
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
"
he
added
,
snatchinga
torch
from
an
arquebusier
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
drawing
his
dag
,
he
hurried
up
thesteep
steps
,
while
Suffolk
followed
his
example
,
and
three
or
fourarquebusiers
ventured
after
them
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Shoreditch
and
Paddington
ran
out
,
and
informed
Bouchierthat
the
king
had
arrived
,
and
was
mounting
in
search
of
Herne
,
uponwhich
the
captain
,
shaking
off
his
fears
,
ordered
his
men
to
follow
him
,
and
opening
the
little
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
began
cautiously
todescend
,
feeling
his
way
with
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
got
about
half
-
waydown
,
when
Henry
sprang
upon
the
platform
.
 
<EOS>
The
light
of
the
torch
fellupon
the
ghostly
figure
of
Herne
,
with
his
arms
folded
upon
his
breast
,
standing
near
the
pile
of
wood
,
lying
between
the
two
staircases
.
 
<EOS>
Soappalling
was
the
appearance
of
the
demon
,
that
Henry
stood
still
togaze
at
him
,
while
Bouchier
and
his
men
remained
irresolute
on
thestairs
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
had
gained
the
platform
,
and
the
arquebusiers
were
seen
near
the
head
of
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
last
,
thou
art
in
my
power
,
accursed
being
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thou
arthemmed
in
on
all
sides
,
and
canst
not
escape!""Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
"
<EOS>
laughed
Herne
.
<EOS>
This
shall
prove
whether
thou
art
human
or
not
,
"
cried
Henry
,
takingdeliberate
aim
at
him
with
the
dag
.
<EOS>
"Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
"
<EOS>
laughed
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
the
report
rang
through
the
room
,
he
sank
through
the
floor
,
and
disappeared
from
view
.
<EOS>
"Gone
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Henry
,
as
the
smoke
cleared
off
;
"
gone
!
<EOS>
Holy
Mary!then
it
must
indeed
be
the
fiend
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
the
middle
of
his
skull
my
aim
,
and
if
he
had
not
been
invulnerable
,
the
bullet
must
have
pierced
hisbrain
.
<EOS>
"I
heard
it
rebound
from
his
horned
helmet
,
and
drop
to
the
floor

"What
is
that
chest
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
,
pointing
to
a
strange
coffin
-
shapedbox
,
lying
,
as
it
seemed
,
on
the
exact
spot
where
the
demon
haddisappeared
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
seen
it
before
,
though
all
called
to
mind
the
mysterioushammering
;
and
they
had
no
doubt
that
the
coffin
was
the
work
of
thedemon
.
<EOS>
"Break
<EOS>
it
open
,
"
cried
Henry
;
"
for
aught
we
know
,
Herne
may
beconcealed
within
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
order
was
reluctantly
obeyed
by
the
arquebusiers
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
forcewas
required
,
for
the
lid
was
not
nailed
down
;
and
when
it
wasremoved
,
a
human
body
in
the
last
stage
of
decay
was
discovered
.
<EOS>
"Pah
!
<EOS>
close
it
up
,
"
cried
Henry
,
turning
away
in
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
came
itthere?""It
must
have
been
brought
by
the
powers
of
darkness
,
"
said
Bouchier;"no
such
coffin
was
here
when
I
searched
the
chamber
two
hours
ago
.
<EOS>
But
see
,
"
he
suddenly
added
,
stooping
down
,
and
picking
up
a
piece
ofpaper
which
had
fallen
from
the
coffin
,
"
here
is
a
scroll
.
<EOS>
""Give
it
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Henry
;
and
holding
it
to
the
light
,
he
read
the
words,"The
body
of
Mark
Fytton
,
the
butcher
,
the
victim
of
a
tyrant
's
cruelty
.
<EOS>
"Uttering
<EOS>
a
terrible
imprecation
<EOS>
,
Henry
flung
the
paper
from
him
;
andbidding
the
arquebusiers
burn
the
body
at
the
foot

he
quitted
the

<EOS>
How
Wolsey
was
disgraced
by
the
King
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
,
a
reconciliation
took
place
between
the
king
andAnne
Boleyn
.
 
<EOS>
During
a
ride
in
the
great
park
with
his
royal
brother
,
Suffolk
not
only
convinced
him
of
the
groundlessness
of
his
jealousy
,
but
contrived
to
incense
him
strongly
against
Wolsey
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
queenand
the
cardinal
lost
the
momentary
advantage
they
had
gained
<EOS>
,
whileAnne
's
power
was
raised
yet
higher
.
 
<EOS>
Yielding
to
her
entreaties
not
tosee
Catherine
again
,
nor
to
hold
further
conference
with
Wolsey
untilthe
sentence
of
the
court
should
be
pronounced
,
Henry
left
the
castlethat
very
day
,
and
proceeded
to
his
palace
of
Bridewell
.
 
<EOS>
The
distress
ofthe
unhappy
queen
at
this
sudden
revolution
of
affairs
may
beconceived
.
 
<EOS>
Distrusting
Wolsey
,
and
putting
her
sole
reliance
on
Heavenand
the
goodness
of
her
cause
<EOS>
,
she
withdrew
to
Blackfriars
,
where
sheremained
till
the
court
met
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
cardinal
himself
,
driven
desperateby
his
situation
,
and
exasperated
by
the
treatment
he
had
experienced
,
he
resolved
,
at
whatever
risk
,
to
thwart
Henry
's
schemes
,
and
revengehimself
upon
Anne
Boleyn
.
<EOS>
Thus
matters
continued
till
the
court
met
as
before
in
the
Parliament
-
chamber
,
at
Blackfriars
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
Henry
was
present
,
and
tookhis
place
under
a
cloth
of
estate,--the
queen
sitting
at
some
distancebelow
him
.
 
<EOS>
Opposite
them
were
the
legates
,
with
the
Archbishop
ofCanterbury
,
and
the
whole
of
the
bishops
.
 
<EOS>
The
aspect
of
theassemblage
was
grave
and
anxious
.
 
<EOS>
Many
eyes
were
turned
on
Henry
,
who
looked
gloomy
and
menacing
,
but
the
chief
object
of
interest
wasthe
queen
,
who
,
though
pale
as
death
,
had
never
in
her
highest
days
ofpower
worn
a
more
majestic
and
dignified
air
than
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
proceedings
of
the
court
then
commenced
,
and
the
king
beingcalled
by
the
crier
,
he
immediately
answered
to
the
summons
.
<EOS>
Catherine
was
next
called
,
and
instead
of
replying
,
she
marchedtowards
the
canopy
beneath
which
the
king
was
seated
,
prostratedherself
,
and
poured
forth
a
most
pathetic
and
eloquent
appeal
to
him
,
atthe
close
of
which
she
arose
,
and
making
a
profound
reverence
,
walkedout
of
the
court
,
leaning
upon
the
arm
of
her
general
receiver
,
Griffith
.
<EOS>
Henry
desired
the
crier
to
call
her
back
,
but
she
would
not
return
;
andseeing
the
effect
produced
by
her
address
upon
the
auditory
,
heendeavoured
to
efface
it
by
an
eulogium
on
her
character
and
virtues
,
accompanied
by
an
expression
of
deep
regret
at
the
step
he
wascompelled
to
take
in
separating
himself
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
hypocrisyavailed
him
little
,
and
his
speech
was
received
with
looks
of
ill
-
disguised
incredulity
.
 
<EOS>
Some
further
discourse
then
took
place
betweenthe
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
and
the
Bishop
of
Rochester
;
but
as
thequeen
had
absented
herself
,
the
court
was
adjourned
to
the
next
day
,
when
it
again
met
,
and
as
she
did
not
then
appear
,
though
summoned
,
she
was
pronounced
contumacious
.
 
<EOS>
After
repeated
adjournments
,
thelast
session
was
held
,
and
judgment
demanded
on
the
part
of
the
king
,
when
Campeggio
,
as
had
been
arranged
between
him
and
Wolsey
,
declined
to
pronounce
it
until
he
had
referred
the
matter
to
the
Pope
,
and
the
court
was
dissolved
.
<EOS>
About
two
months
after
this
event
,
during
which
time
the
legate'scommission
had
been
revoked
,
while
Henry
was
revolving
theexpediency
of
accomplishing
the
divorce
through
the
medium
of
hisown
ecclesiastical
courts
,
and
without
reference
to
that
of
Rome
,
adespatch
was
received
from
the
Pope
by
the
two
cardinals
,
requiringthem
to
cite
the
king
to
appear
before
him
by
attorney
on
a
certain
day
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
this
instrument
,
Campeggio
chanced
to
bestaying
with
Wolsey
at
his
palace
at
Esher
,
and
as
the
king
was
thenholding
his
court
at
Windsor
,
they
both
set
out
for
the
castle
on
thefollowing
day
,
attended
by
a
retinue
of
nearly
a
hundred
horsemen
,
splendidly
equipped
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
middle
of
September
,
and
the
woods
,
instead
ofpresenting
one
uniform
mass
of
green
,
glowed
with
an
infinite
variety
oflovely
tints
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
despite
the
beauty
of
the
scene
,
there
wassomething
melancholy
in
witnessing
the
decline
of
the
year
,
as
markedby
those
old
woods
,
and
by
the
paths
that
led
through
them
,
so
thicklystrewn
with
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
Wolsey
was
greatly
affected
.
 
<EOS>
"
These
noble
treeswill
ere
long
bereft
of
all
their
glories
,
"
he
thought
,
"
and
so
,
most
likely
,
will
it
be
with
me
,
and
perhaps
my
winter
may
come
sooner
thantheirs
!
"
<EOS>
The
cardinal
and
his
train
had
crossed
Staines
Bridge
,
and
passing
through
Egham
,
had
entered
the
great
park
near
Englefield
Green
.
<EOS>
They
were
proceeding
along
the
high
ridge
overlooking
the
woody
region
between
it
and
the
castle
,
<EOS>
when
a
joyous
shout
in
the
glades
beneath
reached
them
,
and
looking
down
,
they
saw
the
king
accompanied
by
Anne
Boleyn
,
and
attended
by
his
falconers
and
a
large
company
of
horsemen
,
pursuing
the
sport
of
hawking
.
 
<EOS>
The
royal
party
appeared
so
much
interested
in
their
sport
that
they
did
not
notice
the
cardinal
and
his
train
,
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
Wolsey
descended
Snow
Hill
,
and
entered
the
long
avenue
,
he
heard
the
trampling
of
horses
at
a
little
distance
,
and
shortly
afterwards
,
Henry
and
Anne
issued
from
out
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
somewhat
more
than
a
bow
-
shot
in
advance
of
the
cardinal
;
but
instead
of
halting
till
he
came
up
,
the
king
had
no
sooner
ascertained
who
it
was
,
than
,
despatching
a
messenger
to
the
castle
,
who
was
seen
galloping
swiftly
down
the
avenue
,
he
rode
off
with
Anne
Boleyn
towards
the
opposite
side
of
the
park
.
 
<EOS>
Though
deeply
mortified
by
the
slight
,
Wolsey
concealed
his
vexation
from
his
brother
cardinal
,
and
pursued
his
way
to
the
castle
,
before
which
he
presently
arrived
.
 
<EOS>
The
gate
was
thrown
open
at
his
approach
,
but
he
had
scarcely
entered
the
lower
ward
when
Sir
Henry
Norris
,
the
king
's
groom
of
the
stole
,
advanced
to
meet
him
,
and
,
with
a
sorrowful
expression
of
countenance
,
said
that
his
royal
master
had
so
many
guests
at
the
castle
,
that
he
could
not
accommodate
him
and
his
train
.
<EOS>
"I
understand
your
drift
,
sir
,
"
replied
Wolsey
;
"
you
would
tell
me
I
am
notwelcome
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
his
eminence
Cardinal
Campeggio
and
myselfmust
take
up
our
lodging
at
some
hostel
in
the
town
,
for
it
is
necessarywe
should
see
the
king
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
your
grace
is
content
to
dismiss
your
attendants
,
"
said
Norris
in
alow
tone
,
"
you
and
Cardinal
Campeggio
can
be
lodged
in
Henry
theThird
's
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
much
I
will
take
upon
me
;
but
I
dare
not
admit
youto
the
royal
lodgings
.
<EOS>
"Wolsey
tried
to
look
unconcerned
,
and
calling
to
his
gentleman
usher
,
George
Cavendish
,
gave
him
some
instructions
in
a
low
voice
,
uponwhich
the
other
immediately
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
retinue
,
and
ordered
them
to
quit
the
castle
with
him
,
leaving
only
the
jester
,
Patch
,
to
attend
upon
his
master
.
 
<EOS>
Campeggio
's
attendants
beingcomparatively
speaking
,
few
in
number
,
were
allowed
to
remain
,
andhis
litter
was
conveyed
to
Henry
the
Third
's
Tower
--
a
fortificationstanding
,
as
already
stated
,
in
the
south
side
of
the
lower
ward
,
nearthe
edge
of
the
dry
moat
surrounding
the
Round
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
steps
ofthis
tower
Wolsey
dismounted
,
and
was
about
to
follow
Campeggio
intothe
doorway
,
when
Will
Sommers
,
who
had
heard
of
his
arrival
,
steppedforward
,
and
with
a
salutation
of
mock
formality
,
said
,
"
I
am
sure
it
willgrieve
the
king
,
my
master
,
not
to
be
able
to
accommodate
your
grace'strain
;
but
since
it
is
larger
than
his
own
,
you
will
scarce
blame
his
wantof
hospitality
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
the
courtesy
of
his
attendants
,
"
rejoined
Wolsey
sharply
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
inno
mood
for
thy
jesting
now
.
 
<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
sirrah
,
or
<EOS>
I
will
have
the
rodapplied
to
thy

<EOS>
care
the
king
does
not
apply
the
rod
to
your
own
,
lord
cardinal,"retorted
<EOS>
Will
Sommers
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
he
scourges
you
according
to
your
deserts
,
your
skin
will
be
redder
than
your
robe
.
"
<EOS>
And
his
mocking
laugh
pursuedWolsey
like
the
hiss
of
a
snake
into
the
tower
.
<EOS>
Some
two
hours
after
this
,
Henry
and
his
attendants
returned
from
thechase
.
 
<EOS>
The
king
seemed
in
a
blithe
humour
,
and
Wolsey
saw
him
laughheartily
as
Will
Sommers
pointed
with
his
bauble
towards
Henry
theThird
's
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
The
cardinal
received
no
invitation
to
the
royal
banquet;and
<EOS>
the
answer
to
his
solicitation
for
an
interview
was
,
that
he
andCampeggio
would
be
received
in
the
presence
-
chamber
on
thefollowing
morning
,
but
not
before
.
<EOS>
That
night
a
great
revel
was
held
in
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
Masquing
,
dancing
,
<EOS>
andfeasting
filled
up
the
evening
,
and
the
joyous
sounds
and
strainsreached
Wolsey
in
his
seclusion
,
and
forced
him
to
contrast
it
with
hisrecent
position
,
when
he
would
have
been
second
only
to
the
king
inthe
entertainment
.
 
<EOS>
He
laid
his
head
upon
his
pillow
,
but
not
to
rest
,
<EOS>
andwhile
tossing
feverishly
about
his
couch
,
he
saw
the
arras
with
whichthe
walls
were
covered
,
move
,
and
a
tall
,
dark
figure
step
from
behindit
.
 
<EOS>
The
cardinal
would
have
awakened
his
jester
,
who
slept
in
a
smalltruckle
-
bed
at
his
feet
,
but
the
strange
visitor
motioned
him
to
be
still
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
may
conjecture
who
I
am
,
cardinal
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
in
case
youshould
doubt
,
I
will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
Herne
the
Hunter

<EOS>
And
now
to
myerrand

<EOS>
There
is
a
damsel
,
whom
you
once
saw
in
the
forest
near
thegreat
lake
,
and
whom
you
promised
to
befriend

<EOS>
You
can
assist
hernow
--
to

it
may

<EOS>
""I
have
enough
to
do
to
aid
myself
,
without
meddling
with
whatconcerns
me

"
said
Wolsey
.
<EOS>
"This
damsel
does
concern
you
,
"
cried
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Read
this
,
and
you
willsee
in
what
way
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
tossed
a
letter
to
Wolsey
,
who
glanced
at
it
by
the
light
of
thelamp
.
<EOS>
"Ha!is
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
he
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
she--
"
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Herne
,
"
or
you
will
wake
this
sleeper
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
as
you
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
not
aid
her
now
?
<EOS>
Will
you
not
bestow
some
of
your
treasure
upon
her
before
it
is
wholly
wrested
from
you
by
the
king

<EOS>
I
will
do
aught
you
wish
,
secretly
and
swiftly
.
<EOS>
""Go
,
then
,
to
my
palace
at
Esher
,
"
cried
the
cardinal
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
this
key
tomy
treasurer
--
it
is
the
key
of
my
coffers

<EOS>
Bid
him
deliver

gilt
chamber

<EOS>
Here
is
a
token
by

hewill
know
that
you
came
from

he
added
,
delivering
him
a
smallchain
of
gold
,
"
for
it
has
been
so
agreed
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
will
besure
to
give
the
treasure
to
Mabel
.
<EOS>
""Fear
nothing
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
And
stretching
forth
his
hand
to
receivethe
key
and
the
chain
,
he
glided
behind
the
tapestry
,
and
disappearedThis
strange
incident
gave
some
diversion
to
Wolsey
's
thought
;
but
erelong
they
returned
to
their
former
channel
.
 
<EOS>
Sleep
would
not
besummoned
,
and
as
soon
as
the
first
glimpse
of
day
appeared
,
he
arose
,
and
wrapping
his
robe
around
him
,
left
his
room
and
ascended
awinding
staircase
leading
to
the
roof
of
the
tower
.
<EOS>
The
morning
promised
to
be
fine
,
but
it
was
then
hazy
,
and
the
greaterpart
of
the
forest
was
wrapped
in
mist
.
 
<EOS>
The
castle
,
however
,
was
seento
great
advantage
.
 
<EOS>
Above
Wolsey
rose
the
vast
fabric
of
the
RoundTower
,
on
the
summit
of
which
the
broad
standard
was
at
that
momentbeing
unfurled
;
while
the
different
battlements
and
towers
arosemajestically
around
.
 
<EOS>
But
Wolsey
's
gaze
rested
chiefly
upon
theexquisite
mausoleum
lying
immediately
beneath
him
;
in
which
he
hadpartly
prepared
for
himself
a
magnificent
monument
.
 
<EOS>
A
sharp
pangshook
him
as
he
contemplated
it
,
and
he
cried
aloud
,
"
My
very
tomb
willbe
wrested
from
me
by
this
rapacious
monarch
;
and
after
all
my
careand
all
my
cost
<EOS>
,
I
know
not
where
I
shall
rest
my
bones!"Saddened
by
the
reflection
,
he
descended
to
his
chamber
,
and
againthrew
himself
on
the
couch
.
<EOS>
But
Wolsey
was
not
the
only
person
in
the
castle
who
had
passed
asleepless
night
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
host
of
his
enemies
many
had
been
kept
awakeby
the
anticipation
of
his
downfall
on
the
morrow
;
and
among
these
wasAnne
Boleyn
,
who
had
received
an
assurance
from
the
king
that
herenmity
should
at
length
be
fully
gratified
.
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
hour
,
the
two
cardinals
,
proceeded
to
the
royallodgings
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
detained
for
some
time
in
the
ante
-
chamber
,
where
Wolsey
was
exposed
to
the
taunts
and
sneers
of
the
courtiers
,
who
had
lately
so
servilely
fawned
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
they
wereushered
into
the
presence
chamber
,
at
the
upper
end
of
which
beneatha
canopy
emblazoned
with
the
royal
arms
woven
in
gold
,
sat
Henry
,
with
Anne
Boleyn
on
his
right
hand
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
the
throne
stood
WillSommers
,
and
near
him
the
Dukes
of
Richmond
and
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
Norfolk
,
Rochford
,
and
a
number
of
other
nobles
,
all
open
enemies
of
Wolsey
,
were
also
present
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
watched
the
advance
of
the
cardinals
with
astern
look
,
and
after
they
had
made
an
obeisance
to
him
,
he
motionedthem
to
rise
.
<EOS>
"You
have
sought
an
interview
with
me
,
my
lords
,
"
he
said
,
withsuppressed
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
would
you?""We
have
brought
an
instrument
to
you
,
my
liege
,
"
said
Wolsey
,
"
whichhas
just
been
received
from
his
holiness
the
Pope
.
<EOS>
""Declare
its
nature
,
"
said
Henry
.
<EOS>
"It
is
a
citation
,
"
replied
Wolsey
,
"
enjoining
your
high
ness
to
appear
byattorney
in
the
papal
court
,
under
a
penalty
of
ten
thousand
ducats
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
presented
a
parchment
,
stamped
with
the
great
seal
of
Rome
,
tothe
king
,
who
glanced
his
eye
fiercely
over
it
,
and
then
dashed
it
to
theground
,
with
an
explosion
of
fury
terrible
to
hear
and
to
witness
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
by
Saint
George
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
;
"
am
I
as
nothing
,
that
the
Pope
dares
toinsult
me
thus?""It
is
a
mere
judicial
form
your
majesty

"
interposed
Campeggio
,
"
and
ischiefly
sent
by
his
holiness
to
let
you
know
we
have
no

<EOS>
""I
will
take
care
you
have
not

nor
his

either

"
roared
the
king
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
my

he
shall
find
I
will
be
no

""But

cried
Campeggio

<EOS>
"Peace

cried
the
king

<EOS>
"
I
will
hear
no
apologies
nor

<EOS>
Theinsult
has
been
offered
,
and
can
not

effaced
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
you
,
Wolsey--""Sire
!
"
exclaimed
the
cardinal
,
shrinking
before
the
whirlwind
ofpassion
,
which
seemed
to
menace
his
utter
extermination
.
<EOS>
"As
for
you
,
I
say
,
"
pursued
Henry
,
extending
his
hand
towards
him
,
while
his
eyes
flashed
fire
,
"
who
by
your
outrageous
pride

so
longovershadowed
our

oppressed

by

<EOS>
""You

Wolsey
abjectly

<EOS>
"

""I

<EOS>
Anne

"
for
it
is
keen
enough

I
can
not

you
to
saythat
these

merely
hostile

<EOS>
Those
who
would

""I

<EOS>
Firstly
,
contrary
to
ourprerogative
,
and
for
your
own
advancement
and
profit
,
you
haveobtained
authority
legatine
from
the
Pope
;
by
which
authority
you
havenot
only
spoiled
and
taken
away
their
substance
from
many
religioushouses
,
but
have
usurped
much
of
our
own
jurisdiction
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
alsomade
a
treaty
with
the
King
of
France
for
the
Pope
without
our
consent
,
and
concluded
another
friendly
treaty
with
the
Duke
of
Ferrara
,
underour
great
seal
,
and
in
our
name
,
without
our
warrant
.
<EOS>
And
furthermoreyou
have
presumed
to
couple
yourself
with

royal
self

Will

<EOS>
"You

<EOS>
""In

exercise

Will
Sommers

<EOS>
"
A

<EOS>
ha!""Then
it
has
been
your
practice
to
receive

first
at

continued
Henry
,
"
to
hear
their
chargesand
intentions
,
and
to
instruct
them
as
you
might
see
fit
.
<EOS>
You
have
alsoso
practised
that
all
our
letters
sent
from
beyond
sea
have
first
come
toyour
own
hands
,
by
which
you
have
acquainted
yourself
with

compelled
us

our
council
to
follow
your
devices

<EOS>
Youhave
also
written
to
all
our
ambassadors
abroad
in
your
own
nameconcerning
our
affairs
,
without

authority

and
received
letters
inreturn
from
them
by
which
you
have
sought
to
compass
your

<EOS>
By
your
ambition
and
pride
you
have
undone
many
of

subjects
;
have
suppressed
religious
houses
,

received
theirpossessions

have
seized
upon
the
goods
of

constrained
all
ordinaries
yearly
to
compound
with
you

havegotten
riches
for
yourself
and
servants
by
subversion
of
the
laws
,
andby
abuse
of
your
authority
in
causing
divers
pardons
of

to
besuspended
until
you
,
by
promise
of
a
yearly
pension
,
chose
to
revivethem
;

also
by
crafty
and
untrue
tales
have
sought
to
createdissention
among
our
nobles
.
<EOS>
""That

"
cried
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
never

<EOS>
""Of
all
men
in
England
<EOS>
your
grace
should
be
the
last
to
say
so

"
rejoinedWolsey
;
"
for
if
I
had
not

you
would
not
have
had
a

""No

misdemeaned
yourself

<EOS>
And
lastly
,
whenever
in

Parliament
allusion
hathbeen
made
to
heresies
and
erroneous
sects
,
you
have
failed
to
correctand
notice
them

to
the
danger

whole
body

Christianpeople
of
this
our
realm

""This
last
charge
ought
to
win
me
favour
in
the
eyes
of
one
whoprofesses
the
Opinions
of
Luther

said
Wolsey
to
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
deny
it
,
as
I
do
all
the
rest

<EOS>
""I

listen

""Do
not

prostrating
himself
.
<EOS>
"I
have
heard

And
,
seatinghimself

he
turned

V

LYNDWOODI
<EOS>
How
the
Earl
of
Surrey
and
the
Fair
Geraldine
met
in
King
James'sBower
in
the
Moat
--
<EOS>
And
how
they
were
surprised
by
the
Duke
ofRichmond
.
<EOS>
IN
order
to
preserve
unbroken
the
chain
of
events
with
which
the
lastbook
of
this
chronicle
concluded
,
it
was
deemed
expedient
to
disturbthe
unity
of
time
,
so
far
as
it
related
to
some
of
the
less
importantcharacters
;
and
it
will
now
he
necessary
,
therefore
,
to
return
to
themiddle
of
June
,
when
the
Earl
of
Surrey
's
term
of
captivitywas
drawingto
a
close
.
<EOS>
As
the
best
means
of
conquering
the
anxiety
produced
by
the
visionexhibited
to
him
by
Herne
,
increased
as
it
was
by
the
loss
of
the
reliche
had
sustained
at
the
same
time
,
the
earl
had
devoted
himself
toincessant
study
,
and
for
a
whole
month
he
remained
within
hischamber
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
of
his
unremitting
application
was
that
,
though
he
succeeded
in
his
design
and
completely
regained
histranquillity
,
his
strength
gave
way
under
the
effort
,
and
he
was
confinedfor
some
days
to
his
couch
by
a
low
fever
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
venture
forth
,
he
mountedto
the
summit
of
the
Round
Tower
,
in
the
hope
that
a
walk
round
itsbreezy
battlements
might
conduce
to
his
restoration
to
health
.
 
<EOS>
The
daywas
bright
and
beautiful
,
and
a
gentle
wind
was
stirring
;
and
as
Surreyfelt
the
breath
.
 
<EOS>
of
heaven
upon
his
cheek
,
and
gazed
upon
the
glorious.prospect
before
him
<EOS>
,
he
wondered
that
his
imprisonment
had
not
drivenhim
mad
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
around
him
,
indeed
,
.
 
<EOS>
was
calculated
to
make
thesense
of
captivity
painful
.
 
<EOS>
The
broad
and
beautiful
meads
,
stretchingout
beneath
him
,
seemed
to
invite
a
ramble
over
them
;
the
silver
rivercourted
a
plunge
into
its
waves
,
the
woods
an
hour
's
retirement
intotheir
<EOS>
shady
recesses
,
The
bells
of
Eton
College
rang
out
merrily
,
buttheir
sound
saddened
rather
than
elated
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
road
between
Etonand
Windsor
,
then
marked
by
straggling
cottages
with
gardensbetween
them
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
dwelling
of
a
better
kind
,
wasthronged
with
herds
of
cattle
and
their
drivers
,
for
a
fair
was
held
thatday
in
the
town
of
Windsor
,
to
which
they
were
hastening
.
 
<EOS>
Then
therewere
country
maidens
and
youthful
hinds
in
their
holiday
apparel
,
trooping
towards
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
Booths
were
erected
,
near
which
,
in
theBrocas
meads
,
the
rustic
sports
of
wrestling
,
running
,
and
casting
thebar
were
going
forward
,
while
numbers
of
boats
shot
to
and
fro
uponthe
river
,
and
strains
of
music
proceeded
from
a
large
gilt
barge
mooredto
its
banks
.
 
<EOS>
Nearer
,
and
in
the
broad
green
plain
lying
beneath
thenorth
terrace
,
were
a
company
of
archers
shooting
at
the
butts
.
 
<EOS>
Butthese
sights
,
instead
of
affording
pleasure
to
Surrey
,
only
sharpenedthe
anguish
of
his
feelings
by
the
contrast
they
offered
to
his
presentposition
.
<EOS>
To
distract
his
thoughts
,
he
quitted
the
near
view
,
and
let
his
eye
runalong
the
edge
of
the
horizon
,
until
it
rested
upon
a
small
speck
,
whichhe
knew
to
be
the
lofty
spire
of
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
as
hesupposed
,
the
Fair
Geraldine
was
in
attendance
upon
Anne
Boleyn
,
atthe
palace
at
Bridewell
,
she
must
be
under
the
shadow
of
this
veryspire
;
and
the
supposition
,
whether
correct
or
not
,
produced
such
quickand
stifling
emotions
,
that
the
tears
rushed
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Ashamed
of
his
weakness
,
he
turned
to
the
other
side
of
the
tower
,
andbent
his
gaze
upon
the
woody
heights
of
the
great
park
.
 
<EOS>
These
recalledHerne
the
Hunter
;
and
burning
with
resentment
at
the
tricks
practisedupon
him
by
the
demon
,
he
determined
that
the
first
use
he
would
makeof
his
liberty
should
be
to
seek
out
,
and
,
if
possible
,
<EOS>
effect
the
captureof
this
mysterious
being
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
strange
encounters
betweenHerne
and
the
king
had
been
related
to
him
by
the
officer
on
guard
atthe
Norman
Tower
but
these
only
served
as
stimulants
to
theadventure
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
couple
of
hours
thus
passed
on
the
keep
,
hedescended
refreshed
and
invigorated
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
day
he
was
thereagain
,
and
the
day
after
that
;
when
,
feeling
that
his
restoration
was
wellnigh
complete
,
he
requested
permission
to
pass
the
following
eveningin
the
dry
moat
of
the
donjon
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
readily
accorded
him
.
<EOS>
Covered
with
green
sod
,
and
shaded
by
many
tall
trees
growing
out
ofthe
side
of
the
artificial
mound
on
which
the
keep
was
built
,
the
fosseoffered
all
the
advantages
of
a
garden
to
the
prisoners
who
wereallowed
to
take
exercise
within
it
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
as
has
been
mentioned
,
KingJames
the
First
of
Scotland
first
beheld
,
from
the
battlements
above
,
the
lovely
Jane
Beaufort
take
her
solitary
walk
,
and
by
his
looks
andgestures
contrived
to
make
her
sensible
of
the
passion
with
which
sheinspired
him
;
and
here
at
last
,
in
an
arbour
which
,
for
the
sake
of
the
oldand
delightful
legend
connected
with
it
,
was
kept
up
at
the
time
of
thischronicle
,
and
then
bore
the
name
of
the
royal
poet
,
they
had
secretlymet
,
and
interchanged
their
vows
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Familiar
with
the
story
,
familiar
also
with
the
poetic
strains
to
which
themonarch
's
passion
gave
birth
,
Surrey
could
not
help
comparing
his
ownfate
with
that
of
the
illustri6us
captive
who
had
visited
the
spot
beforehim
.
 
<EOS>
Full
of
such
thoughts
,
he
pensively
tracked
the
narrow
pathwinding
between
the
grassy
banks
of
the
fosse
--
now
casting
up
hiseyes
to
the
keep
--
now
looking
towards
the
arbour
,
and
wishing
that
hehad
been
favoured
with
such
visitings
as
lightened
the
captivity
of
theScottish
king
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
sought
the
bower
--
<EOS>
a
charming
little
nest
ofgreen
leaves
and
roses
,
sheltering
a
bench
which
seemed
onlycontrived
for
lovers
--
and
taking
out
his
tablets
,
began
to
trace
withinthem
some
stanzas
of
that
exquisite
poem
which
has
linked
his
namefor
ever
with
the
Round
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
occupied
,
the
time
stole
oninsensibly
,
and
he
was
not
aware
that
he
had
over
-
stayed
the
limitsallowed
him
,
till
he
was
aroused
by
the
voice
of
the
officer
<EOS>
,
who
cameto
summon
him
back
to
his
prison
.
<EOS>
"You
will
be
removed
to
your
old
lodging
,
in
the
Round
Tower
,
to
-
morrow
night
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
what
reason
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
earl
,
as
he
followed
his
conductor
upthe
steep
side
of
the
mound
.
 
<EOS>
But
receiving
.
 
<EOS>
no
reply
,
he
did
not
renewthe
inquiryEntering
a
door
in
the
covered
way
at
the
head
of
the
flight
of
stepscommunicating
with
the
Norman
Tower
,
they
descended
them
insilence
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
they
reached
the
foot
of
this
long
staircase
,
the
earlchanced
to
cast
back
his
eyes
,
and
,
to
his
inexpressible
astonishment
,
perceived
on
the
landing
at
the
head
of
the
steps
,
and
just
before
thepiece
of
ordnance
commanding
the
ascent
,
the
figure
of
Herne
theHunter
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
utter
an
exclamation
,
the
figure
retreated
through
theadjoining
archway
.
 
<EOS>
Telling
the
officer
what
he
had
seen
,
Surrey
wouldfain
have
gone
in
quest
of
the
fiendish
spy
;
but
the
other
would
notpermit
him
;
and
affecting
to
treat
the
matter
as
a
mere
creation
offancy
,
he
hurried
the
earl
to
his
chamber
in
the
Curfew
Tower
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
Surrey
was
removed
betimes
to
the
Round
Tower
,
andthe
cause
of
the
transfer
was
soon
explained
by
the
discharge
ofordnance
,
the
braying
of
trumpets
and
the
rolling
of
drums
,
announcingthe
arrival
of
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
mystery
observed
towards
him
,
Surreywas
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
Fair
Geraldine
accompanied
theroyal
party
;
but
he
in
vain
sought
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
truth
of
thesurmise
by
examining
,
through
the
deep
embrasure
of
his
window
,
thecavalcade
that
soon
afterwards
entered
the
upper
quadrangle
.
 
<EOS>
Amidthe
throng
of
beautiful
dames
surrounding
Anne
Boleyn
<EOS>
he
could
not
becertain
that
he
detected
the
Fair
Geraldine
;
but
he
readily
distinguishedthe
Duke
of
Richmond
among
the
nobles
,
and
the
sight
awakened
apang
of
bitter
jealousy
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
The
day
wore
away
slowly
,
for
he
could
not
fix
his
attention
upon
hisbooks
,
neither
was
he
allowed
to
go
forth
upon
the
battlements
of
thetower
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
however
,
the
officer
informed
him
he
might
takeexercise
within
the
dry
moat
if
he
was
so
inclined
,
and
he
gladly
availedhimself
of
the
permission
.
<EOS>
After
pacing
to
and
fro
along
the
walk
for
a
short
time
,
he
entered
thearbour
,
and
was
about
to
throw
himself
upon
the
bench
,
when
heobserved
a
slip
of
paper
lying
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
it
up
,
and
found
a
fewlines
traced
upon
it
in
hurried
characters
.
 
<EOS>
They
ran
thus
:
-"The
Fair
Geraldine
arrived
this
morning
in
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
Earl
ofSurrey
desires
to
meet
her
,
he
will
find
her
within
this
arbour
atmidnight
.
<EOS>
"This
billet
was
read
and
re
-
read
by
the
young
earl
with
feelings
ofindescribable
transport
;
but
a
little
reflection
damped
his
ardour
,
andmade
him
fear
it
might
be
a
device
to
ensnare
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nocertainty
that
the
note
proceeded
in
any
way
from
the
Fair
Geraldine
,
nor
could
he
even
be
sure
that
she
was
in
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
despitethese
misgivings
,
the
attraction
was
too
powerful
to
be
resisted
,
and
heturned
over
the
means
of
getting
out
of
his
chamber
,
but
the
schemeseemed
wholly
impracticable
.
 
<EOS>
The
window
was
at
a
considerableheight
above
the
ramparts
of
the
keep
,
and
even
if
he
could
reachthem
,
and
escape
the
notice
of
the
sentinels
,
he
should
have
to
make
asecond
descent
into
the
fosse
.
<EOS>
And
supposing
all
this
accomplishedhow
was
he
to
return
?
<EOS>
The
impossibility
of
answering
this
latter
mentalinterrogation
compelled
him
to
give
up
all
idea
of
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
On
returning
to
his
prison
-
chamber
,
he
stationed
himself
at
theembrasure
overlooking
the
ramparts
,
and
listened
to
the
regular
treadof
the
sentinel
below
,
half
resolved
,
be
the
consequences
<EOS>
what
theymight
,
to
descend
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
appointed
time
approached
,
his
anxietybecame
almost
intolerable
,
and
quitting
the
window
,
he
began
to
pacehurriedly
to
and
fro
within
the
chamber
,
which
,
as
has
been
previouslyobserved
,
partook
of
the
circular
form
of
the
keep
,
and
was
supportedin
certain
places
by
great
wooden
pillars
and
cross
-
beams
.
 
<EOS>
But
insteadof
dissipating
his
agitation
,
his
rapid
movements
seemed
rather
toincrease
it
,
and
at
last
,
wrought
to
a
pitch
of
uncontrollable
excitement
,
he
cried
aloud
<EOS>
-"If
the
fiend
were
to
present
himself
now
,
and
offer
to
lead
me
to
her
,
Iwould
follow
him
.
<EOS>
"Scarcely
<EOS>
were
the
words
uttered
than
a
hollow
laugh
broke
from
thefarther
end
of
the
chamber
,
and
a
deep
voice
exclaimed--
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
totake
you
to
her
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
need
not
ask
who
addresses
me
,
"
said
Surrey
,
aftera
pause
,
and
straining
his
eyes
to
distinguish
the
figure
of
the
speakerin
the
gloom
.
<EOS>
"I
will
tell
you
who
I
am
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
he
who
visited
youonce
before
--
<EOS>
who
showed
you
a
vision
of
the
Fair
Geraldine
--
and
carriedoff
your
vaunted
relic
--
ho
!
<EOS>
ho!""Avoid
thee
,
false
fiend
!
"
rejoined
Surrey
,
"
thou
temptest
me
now
invain
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
summoned
me
,
"
returned
Herne
;
"
and
I
will
not
be
dismissed
.
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
convey
you
to
your
mistress
,
who
awaits
you
in
KingJames
's
bower
,
and
marvels
at
your
tardiness
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
with
what
design
dost
thou
offer
me
this
service
?
"
demandedSurrey
.
"It
will
be
time
enough
to
put
that
question
when
I
make
any
condition,"replied
<EOS>
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Enough
,
I
am
willing
to
aid
you
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
go?""Lead
on
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Surrey
,
marching
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
Herne
drew
a
lantern
from
beneath
the
cloak
in
which
he
waswrapped
,
and
threw
its
light
on
a
trap
-
door
lying
open
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"Descend!"Surrey
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
plunged
down
the
steps
.
 
<EOS>
Inanother
instant
the
demon
followed
.
 
<EOS>
Some
hidden
machinery
was
thenset
in
motion
,
and
the
trap
-
door
returned
to
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
Surreyarrived
at
a
narrow
passage
,
which
appeared
to
correspond
in
formwith
the
bulwarks
of
the
keep
.
 
<EOS>
Here
Herne
passed
him
,
and
taking
thelead
,
hurried
along
the
gallery
and
descended
another
flight
of
steps
,
which
brought
them
to
a
large
vault
,
apparently
built
in
the
foundationof
the
tower
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
earl
had
time
to
gaze
round
this
chamber
,
thedemon
masked
the
lantern
,
and
taking
his
hand
,
drew
him
through
anarrow
passage
,
terminated
by
a
small
iron
door
,
which
flew
open
at
atouch
,
and
they
emerged
among
the
bushes
clothing
the
side
of
themound
.
<EOS>
"You
can
now
proceed
without
my
aid
,
"
said
Herne
:
"
but
take
care
notto
expose
yourself
to
the
sentinels
.
<EOS>
"Keeping
<EOS>
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
,
for
the
moon
was
shiningbrightly
,
Surrey
hastened
towards
the
arbour
,
and
as
he
entered
it
,
tohis
inexpressible
delight
found
that
he
had
not
been
deceived
,
but
thatthe
Fair
Geraldine
was
indeed
there
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
did
you
contrive
this
meeting
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
after
their
firstgreetings
had
passed
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
how
did
you
learn
I
was
in
the
castle
<EOS>
,
forthe
strictest
instructions
were
given
that
the
tidings
should
not
reachyou
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
only
response
made
by
Surrey
was
to
press
her
lily
hand
devotedlyto
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"I
should
not
have
ventured
hither
,
"
pursued
the
Fair
Geraldine
,
"
unlessyou
had
sent
me
the
relic
as
a
token
.
 
<EOS>
I
knew
you
would
never
part
withit
,
and
I
therefore
felt
sure
there
was
no
deception
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
how
did
you
get
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"Your
messenger
provided
a
rope
-
ladder
,
by
which
I
descended
into
themoat
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
Surrey
was
stupefied
.
<EOS>
"You
seem
astonished
at
my
resolution
,
"
she
continued
;
"
and
,
indeed
,
Iam
surprised
at
it
myself
;
but
I
could
not
overcome
my
desire
to
seeyou
,
especially
as
this
meeting
may
be
our
last
.
 
<EOS>
The
king
,
through
theLady
Anne
Boleyn
,
has
positively
enjoined
me
to
think
no
more
of
youand
has
given
your
father
,
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
to
understand
that
yourmarriage
without
the
royal
assent
will
be
attended
by
the
loss
of
all
thefavour
he
now
enjoys
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
think
you
I
will
submit
to
such
tyranny
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
"
replied
the
Fair
Geraldine
in
a
mournful
tone
,
"
I
feel
we
shallnever
be
united
.
 
<EOS>
This
conviction
,
which
has
lately
forced
itself
upon
mymind
,
has
not
made
me
love
you
less
,
though
it
has
in
some
degreealtered
my
feelings
towards
you
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
may
be
able
to
move
the
king
,
"
cried
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
some
claimbesides
that
of
kindred
on
the
Lady
Anne
Boleyn
--
and
she
will
obtain
hisconsent
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
trust
to
her
,
"
replied
the
Fair
Geraldine
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
may
haverendered
her
an
important
service
,
but
be
not
too
sure
of
a
return
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
Surrey
,
I
here
release
you
from
the
troth
you
plighted
to
me
in
thecloisters
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
be
released
from
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
earl
hastily
;
"
neither
will
Irelease
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hold
the
pledge
as
sacred
and
as
binding
as
if
we
hadbeen
affianced
together
before
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
your
own
sake
,
do
not
say
so
,
my
dear
lord
,
"
rejoined
the
FairGeraldine
;
"
I
beseech
you
,
do
not
.
<EOS>
That
your
heart
is
bound
to
me
now
,
Iwell
believe
--
and
that
you
could
become
inconstant
I
will
not
permitmyself
to
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
But
your
youth
forbids
an
union
between
us
formany
years
;
and
if
during
that
time
you
should
behold
some
fairer
facethan
mine
,
or
should
meet
some
heart
you
may
conceive
more
loving
--
though
that
can
hardly
be
--
I
would
not
have
a
hasty
vow
restrain
you
.
<EOS>
Be
free
,
then
--
free
at
least
for
three
years
--
and
if
at
the
end
of
that
timeyour
affections
are
still
unchanged
,
I
am
willing
you
should
bindyourself
to
me
for
ever
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
act
with
equal
generosity
to
you
,
"
rejoined
Surrey
in
a
tone
ofdeep
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
sooner
part
with
life
than
relinquish
thepledge
I
have
received
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
am
content
that
my
constancyshould
be
put
to
the
test
you
propose
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
long
term
of
myprobation
,
I
will
shrink
from
no
trial
of
faith
.
 
<EOS>
Throughout
Europe
I
willproclaim
your
beauty
in
the
lists
,
and
will
maintain
its
supremacyagainst
all
comers
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
oh
!
<EOS>
sweet
Geraldine
,
since
we
have
met
in
thisspot
,
hallowed
by
the
loves
of
James
of
Scotland
and
Jane
Beaufort
,
letus
here
renew
our
vows
of
eternal
constancy
,
and
agree
to
meet
againat
the
time
you
have
appointed
,
with
hearts
as
warm
and
loving
asthose
we
bring
together
now
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
he
drew
her
towards
him
,
and
imprinted
a
passionatekiss
on
her
lips
.

he
said

<EOS>
"Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
"
laughed
a
deep
voice
without
.
<EOS>
"What
was
that
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
Fair
Geraldine
in
a
tone
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
the
relic
,
have
you
not
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
earl
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
"
she
replied
,
''
your
messenger
merely
showed
it
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
doyou
ask
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
understand
.
 
<EOS>
The
fiendish
laughter
that
just
now
soundedin
my
ears
proceeded
from--""Herne
the
Hunter
,
"
replied
Surrey
,
in
a
whisper
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
fear
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Iwill
defend
you
with
my
life

<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
accursed
chance
!
<EOS>
I
have
no
weapon

<EOS>
""None
would
avail
against
him
,
"
murmured
the
Fair
Geraldine
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leadme
forth
;
I
shall
die
if
I
stay
here

<EOS>
"Supporting
<EOS>
her
in
his
arms
,
Surrey
complied
,
but
they
had
scarcelygained
the
entrance
of
the
arbour
,
when
a
tall
figure
stood
before
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Duke
of
Richmond
.
 
<EOS>
A
gleam
of
moonlight
penetrating
throughthe
leaves
,
fell
upon
the
group
,
and
rendered
them
distinctly
visible
toeach
other
.
"Soh
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
duke
,
after
regarding
the
pair
in
silence
for
amoment
,
"
I
have
not
been
misinformed
.
<EOS>
You
have
contrived
a
meetinghere
.
<EOS>
""Richmond
,
"
said
Surrey
sternly
,
"
we
once
were
dear
and
loving
friends
,
and
we
are
still
honourable
foes
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
am
safe
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
knowyou
will
breathe
no
word
about
this
meeting

either
to
the
FairGeraldine
's
prejudice
or
mine

<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
judge
me
rightly
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
duke
,
in
a
tone
of
equalsternness
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
thought
of
betraying
you
;
though
,
by
a
word
to
myroyal
father
,
I
could
prevent
all
chance
of
future
rivalry
on
your
part
.
 
<EOS>
Ishall
,
however
,
demand
a
strict
account
from
you
on
liberation

"
<EOS>
"
Your
grace
acts
as
beseems
a
loyal
gentleman

replied
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"Hereafter
I
will
not
fail
to
account
to
you
for
my
conduct
in
any
wayyou
please

<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
let
me
interpose
between
you
,
my
lords
,
"
cried
the
Fair
Geraldine,"to
prevent
the
disastrous
consequences
of
this
quarrel
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
alreadytold
your
grace
<EOS>
I
can
not
love
you
,
and
that
my
heart
is
devoted
to
theEarl
of
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
appeal
to
your
noble
nature
--
to
your
generosity
--
not
to
persist
in
a
hopeless
suit
.
<EOS>
""You
have
conquered
madam
,
"
said
the
duke
,
after
a
pause
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
havebeen
to
blame
in
this
matter
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
make
amends
for
my
error

<EOS>
Surrey
,
I
relinquish
her
to
you

<EOS>
""My
friend
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
earl
,
casting
himself
into
the
duke
's
arms
.
<EOS>
"I
will
now
endeavour
to
heal
the
wounds
I
have
unwittinglyoccasioned
,
"
said
the
Fair
Geraldine
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
surprised
your
grace
shouldbe
insensible
to
attractions
so
far
superior
to
mine
as
those
of
the
LadyMary
Howard
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Lady
Mary
is
very
beautiful
,
I
confess
,
"
said
the
duke
;
"
and
if
youhad
not
been
in
the
way
,
I
should
assuredly
have
been
her
captive
.
<EOS>
""I
ought
not
to
betray
the
secret
,
perhaps
,
"
hesitated
the
FairGeraldine
,
"
but
gratitude
prompts
me
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
The
lady
is
not
so
blindto
your
grace
's
merits
as
I
have
been
.
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
it
be
so
,
Surrey
,
we
may
yet
bebrothers
as
well
as
friends

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
that
it
is
so
I
can
avouch
,
Richmond
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
,
"
for
I
am
inmy
sister
's
secret
as
well
as
the
Fair
Geraldine
.
 
<EOS>
But
now
that
thisexplanation
has
taken
place
<EOS>
,
I
must
entreat
your
grace
to
conduct
theFair
<EOS>
Geraldine
back
to
her
lodgings
,
while
I
regain
,
the
best
way
I
can
,
my
chamber
in
the
Round
Tower
.
<EOS>
""I
marvel
how
you
escaped
from
it
,
"
said
Richmond
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
suppose
itwas
by
the
connivance
of
the
officer
.
<EOS>
""He
who
set
me
free
--
who
brought
the
Fair
Geraldine
hither
--
and
who
,
Isuspect
,
acquainted
you
with
our
meeting
,
was
no
other
than
Herne
theHunter
,
"
replied
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"You
amaze
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
duke
;
"
it
was
indeed
a
tall
dark
man
,
muffled
in
a
cloak
,
who
informed
me
that
you
were
to
meet
at
midnightin
King
James
's
bower
in
the
moat
,
and
I
therefore
came
to
surpriseyou
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
informant
was
Herne
,
"
replied
Surrey
.
"Right
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
demon
,
stepping
from
behind
a
tree
,
where
hehad
hitherto
remained
concealed
;
"
it
was
I
--
I
,
Herne
the
Hunter
.
 
<EOS>
And
Icontrived
the
meeting
in
anticipation
of
a
far
different
result
from
thatwhich
has
ensued
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
now
tell
you
,
my
lord
of
Surrey
,
that
it
is
idle
toindulge
a
passion
for
the
Fair
Geraldine
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
never
we
d
her
.
<EOS>
""False
<EOS>
fiend
,
thou
liest
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"Time
will
show
,

replied
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
you
will
we
d
another
--
<EOS>
andmore
,
I
tell
you
,
you
are
blinder
than
Richmond
has
shown
himself
--
forthe
most
illustrious
damsel
in
the
kingdom
has
regarded
you
with
eyesof
affection
,
and
yet
you
have
not
perceived
it

<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Princess
Mary
?
"
demanded
Richmond
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
the
Princess
Mary
,
"
repeated
Herne
.
<EOS>
"
How
say
you
now
,
my
lord
?
<EOS>
--will
<EOS>
you
let
ambition
usurp
the
place
of
love?"No

replied
Surrey

<EOS>
"
But
I
will
hold
no
further
converse
with
thee

Thouwouldst
tempt
to
perdition

Hence
,
fiend!""Unless
you
trust
yourself
to
my
guidance

you
will
never

rejoined
Herne
,
with
a
mocking
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
iron
door
in

can
not
be
opened
on
this
side

and
you
well
know
what
theconsequence

be

Come

I
leave
you
to
your
fate

"And
<EOS>
he
moved
down
the
path
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
"Go
<EOS>
with
him
,
Surrey

"
cried
Richmond
.
<EOS>
Pressing
the
Fair
Geraldine
to
his
breast
,
the
Earl
committed
her
to
thecharge
of
his
friend
,
and
tearing
himself
away
,
followed
the
steps
of
thedemon
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
proceeded
far
when
he
heard
his
name
pronouncedby
a
voice
issuing
from
the
tree
above
him
.
<EOS>
Looking
up
,
he
saw
Herne
inone
of
the
topmost
branches
,
and
at
a
sign
,
instantly
climbed
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
thick
foliage
screened
them
from
observation

arid
Surreyconcluded
his
guide
was
awaiting
the
disappearance
of
the
sentinel
,
who
was
at
that
moment
approaching
the
tree
.
 
<EOS>
But
such
apparentlywas
not
the
other
's
intentions
;
for
the
man
had
scarcely
passed
thanHerne
sprang
upon
the
ramparts
,
and
the
poor
fellow
turning
at
thesound
,
was
almost
scared
out
of
his
senses
at
the
sight
of
the
dreadedfiend
.
 
<EOS>
Dropping
his
halbert
,
he
fell
upon
his
face
with
a
stifled
cry
Hernethen
motioned
Surrey
to
descend
,
and
they
marched
together
quicklyto
a
low
door
opening
into
the
keep
.
 
<EOS>
Passing
through
it
,
and
ascendinga
flight
of
steps
,
they
stood
upon
the
landing
at
the
top
of
the
staircasecommunicating
with
the
Norman
Tower
,
and
adjoining
the
entrance
toSurrey
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
Apparently
familiar
with
the
spot
,
Herne
took
down
a
large
key
from
anail
in
the
wall
,
against
which
it
hung
,
and
unlocked
the
door
.
<EOS>
"Enter
,
"
he
said
to
Surrey
,
"
and
do
not
forget
the
debt
you
owe
to
Hernethe
Hunter

How
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
found
Mabel
in
the
Sandstone
Cave
,
and
whathappened
to
him
thereA
week
after
the
foregoing
occurrence
,
the
Earl
of
Surrey
was
set
free
.
<EOS>
But
his
joy
at
regaining
his
liberty
was
damped
by
learning
that
the
FairGeraldine
had
departed
for
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
left
the
tenderestmessages
for
him
with
his
sister
,
the
Lady
Mary
Howard
,
accompaniedwith
assurances
of
unalterable
attachment
.
<EOS>
But
other
changes
had
taken
place
,
which
were
calculated
to
affordhim
some
consolation
.
 
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
night
on
which
he
had
been
toldthe
<EOS>
Lady
Mary
was
not
indifferent
to
him
,
Richmond
had
devotedhimself
entirely
to
her
;
and
matters
had
already
proceeded
so
far
,
thathe
had
asked
her
in
marriage
of
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
who
,
afterascertaining
the
king
's
pleasure
on
the
subject
,
had
gladly
given
hisconsent
,
and
the
youthful
pair
were
affianced
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Surreyand
Richmond
now
became
closer
friends
than
ever
;
and
if
,
amid
thethousand
distractions
of
Henry
's
gay
and
festive
court
,
the
young
earldid
not
forget
the
Fair
Geraldine
,
he
did
not
,
at
least
,
find
the
time
hangheavily
on
his
hands
,
About
a
week
after
Wolsey
's
dismissal
,
while
the
court
was
stillsojourning
at
Windsor
,
Surrey
proposed
to
Richmond
to
ride
onemorning
with
him
in
the
great
park
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
willingly
assented
,
andmounting
their
steeds
,
they
galloped
towards
Snow
Hill
,
whollyunattended
.
 
<EOS>
While
mounting
this
charming
ascent
at
a
more
leisurelypace
,
the
earl
said
to
his
companion
,
"
I
will
now
tell
you
why
I
proposedthis
ride
to
you
,
Richmond
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
long
determined
to
follow
up
theadventure
of
Herne
the
Hunter
,
and
I
wish
to
confer
with
you
about
it
,
and
ascertain
whether
you
are
disposed
to
join
me
.
<EOS>
""I
know
not
what
to
say
,
Surrey
,
"
replied
the
duke
gravely
,
andspeaking
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
king
,
my
father
,
failed
in
his
endeavours
toexpel
the
demon
,
who
still
lords
it
in
the
forest
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
greater
glory
to
us
if
we
succeed
,
"
said
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"I
will
take
counsel
with
Lady
Mary
on
the
subject
before
I
give
ananswer
,
"
rejoined
Richmond
.
<EOS>
"Then
there
is
little
doubt
what
your
grace
's
decision
will
be
,
"
laughedSurrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
speak
truth
,
it
was
the
fear
of
your
consulting
her
<EOS>
thatmade
me
bring
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
What
say
you
to
a
ride
in
the
forest
to
-
morrownight?""I
have
little
fancy
for
it
,
"
replied
Richmond
;
"
and
if
you
will
be
ruled
byme
,
you
will
not
attempt
the
enterprise
yourself
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
resolution
is
taken
,
"
said
the
earl
;
"
but
now
,
since
we
have
reachedthe
brow
of
the
hill
,
let
us
push
forward
to
the
lake
.
<EOS>
"A
rapid
ride
of
some
twenty
minutes
brought
them
to
the
edge
of
thelake
,
and
they
proceeded
along
the
verdant
path
leading
to
theforester
's
hut
.
 
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
dwelling
,
it
appeared
wholly
deserted
,
but
they
nevertheless
dismounted
,
and
tying
their
horses
to
the
trees
atthe
back
of
the
cottage
,
entered
it
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
examining
thelower
room
,
the
plash
of
oars
reached
their
ears
,
and
rushing
to
thewindow
,
they
descried
the
skiff
rapidly
approaching
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
A
manwas
seated
within
it
,
whose
attire
,
though
sombre
,
seemed
to
proclaimhim
of
some
rank
,
but
as
his
back
was
towards
them
,
they
could
notdiscern
his
features
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
instant
the
skiff
touched
the
strand
,
and
the
rower
leaping
ashore
,
proved
to
be
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
Onmaking
this
discovery
<EOS>
they
both
ran
out
to
him
,
and
the
warmestgreetings
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
When
these
were
over
,
Surreyexpressed
his
surprise
to
Wyat
at
seeing
him
there
,
declaring
he
waswholly
unaware
of
his
return
from
the
court
of
France
.
<EOS>
"I
came
back
about
a
month
ago
,
"
said
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
His
majesty
supposesme
at
Allington
;
nor
shall
I
return
to
court
without
a
summons
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
sorry
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Surrey
;
"
but
what
are
you
doing
<EOS>
here?""My
errand
is
a
strange
and
adventurous
one
,
"
replied
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
mayhave
heard
that
before
I
departed
for
France
I
passed
some
days
in
theforest
in
company
with
Herne
the
Hunter
.
 
<EOS>
What
then
happened
to
me
Imay
not
disclose
;
but
I
vowed
never
to
rest
till
I
have
freed
this
forestfrom
<EOS>
the
weird
being
who
troubles
it
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
you
so
?
"
cried
Surrey
;
"
then
you
are
most
fortunatelyencountered
,
Sir
Thomas

for
I
myself
,
as
Richmond
will
tell
you

expulsion

<EOS>
We
will
be
companions
in
theadventure

<EOS>
""We
will
speak
of
that
anon
,
"
replied
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
sorry
to
find
thiscottage
uninhabited

and
the
fair
damsel
who
dwelt
within
it

gone

<EOS>
What
has
become
of

is
a
strange
story

said
Richmond
.
<EOS>
And
he
proceeded
to
relate
allthat
was
known
to
have
befallen
Mabel
.
<EOS>
Wyat
listened
with
profound
attention
to
the
recital
,
and
at
its
close
,
said
,
"
I
think
I
can
find
a
clue
to
this
mystery

to
obtain
it
I
must
goalone

Meet
me
here
at

""May

some

scheme
?
"
said
Surrey
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
yet
,
"
rejoined
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
freely
confess
to
you
<EOS>
that
there
ismuch
danger
in
the
enterprise
--
danger
that
I
would
not
willingly
any
oneshould
share
with
me
,
especially
you
,
Surrey
,
to
whom
I
owe
so
much
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
find
me
here
,
therefore
,
to
-
morrow
night
,
conclude
that
Ihave
perished
,
or
am
captive
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
be
it
as
you
will
,
Wyat
,
"
said
Surrey
;
"
but
I
would
gladlyaccompany
you
,
and
share
your
danger
.
<EOS>
""I
know
it
,
and
I
thank
you
,
"
returned
Wyat
,
warmly
grasping
the
other'shand
;
"
but
much
--
<EOS>
nay
,
all
--
may
remain
to
be
done
to
-
morrow
night
.
 
<EOS>
Youhad
better
bring
some
force
with
you
,
for
we
may
need
it
.
<EOS>
""I
will
bring
half
a
dozen
stout
archers
,
"
replied
Surrey--
and
if
you
comenot
,
depend
upon
it
,
I
will
either
release
you
or
avenge
you
.
<EOS>
""I
did
not
intend
to
prosecute
this
adventure
further
,
"
said
Richmond;"but
since
you
are
both
resolved
to
embark
in
it
,
I
will
not
desert
you
.
<EOS>
"Soon
<EOS>
after
this
,
the
friends
separated,--Surrey
and
Richmond
takinghorse
and
returning
to
the
castle
,
discoursing
on
the
unlooked
--
formeeting
with
Wyat
,
while
the
latter
again
entered
the
skiff
,
and
roweddown
the
lake
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
hut
was
clear
,
two
persons
descendedthe
steps
of
a
ladder
leading
to
a
sort
of
loft
in
the
roof
,
and
sprangupon
the
floor
of
the
hut"Ho
!
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
"
laughed
the
foremost
,
whose
antlered
helm
and
wild
garbproclaimed
him
to
be
Herne
;
"
they
little
dreamed
who
were
the
hearersof
their
conference
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
think
to
take
me
,
Fenwolf
--
<EOS>
ha!""They
know
not
whom
they
have
to
deal
with
,
"
rejoined
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"They
should
do
so
by
this
time
,
"
said
Herne
;
"
but
I
will
tell
thee
why
SirThomas
Wyat
has
undertaken
this
enterprise
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
capture
me
,
though
that
may
be
one
object
that
moves
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
wishes
to
seeMabel
Lyndwood
.
<EOS>
The
momentary
glimpse
he
caught
of
her
bright
eyeswas
sufficient
to
inflame
him
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Fenwolf
,
"
think
you
so?""I
am
assured
of
it
,
"
replied
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
knows
the
secret
of
the
cave
,
and
will
find
her
there
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
he
will
never
return
to
tell
what
he
has
seen
,
"
said
Fenwolfmoodily
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
not
that
,
"
replied
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
my
own
views
respecting
him
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
renew
my
band
.
<EOS>
""He
will
never
join
you
,
"
rejoined
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
if
I
offer
him
Mabel
as
a
bait
?
<EOS>
"
said
Herne
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
do
so
,
dread
master
?
"
rejoined
Fenwolf
,
trembling
andturning
pale
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
belongs
to
me
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
thee
,
fool
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Herne
,
with
a
derisive
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thinkest
thou
Iwould
resign
such
a
treasure
to
thee
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
But
rest
easy
,
I
will
notgive
her
to
Wyat
.
<EOS>
""You
mean
her
for
yourself
,
then
?
"
said
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"Darest
<EOS>
thou
to
question
me
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Herne
,
striking
him
with
the
handarmed
with
the
iron
gyves
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
to
teach
thee
respect
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
this
to
prove
whether
thou
art
mortal
or
rejoined
Fenwolf
,
pluckinghis
hunting
-
knife
from
his
belt
,
and
striking
it
with
all
his
force
againstthe
other
's
breast
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
surely
and
forcibly
dealt
,
the
blowglanced
off
as
if
the
demon
were
cased
in
steel
,
and
the
intendedassassin
fell
back
in
amazement
,
while
an
unearthly
laugh
rang
in
hisears
.
 
<EOS>
Never
had
Fenwolf
seen
Herne
wear
so
formidable
a
look
as
he
atthat
moment
assumed
.
 
<EOS>
His
giant
frame
dilated
,
his
eyes
flashed
fire
,
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
so
fearful
that
Fenwolfshielded
his
eyes
with
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"Ah
,
miserable
dog
!
"
<EOS>
thundered
Herne
;
"
dost
thou
think
I
am
to
be
hurtby
mortal
hands
,
or
mortal
weapons
?
<EOS>
Thy
former
experience
shouldhave
taught
thee
differently
.
 
<EOS>
But
since
thou
hast
provoked
it
,
take
thyfate!"Uttering
these
words
,
he
seized
Fenwolf
by
the
throat
,
clutching
himwith
a
terrific
gripe
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
miserable
wretch
wouldhave
paid
the
penalty
of
his
rashness
,
if
a
person
had
not
at
themoment
appeared
at
the
doorway
.
 
<EOS>
Flinging
his
prey
hastily
backwards
,
Herne
turned
at
the
interruption
,
and
perceived
old
Tristram
Lyndwood
,
who
looked
appalled
at
what
he
beheld
.
<EOS>
"Ah
,
it
is
thou
,
Tristram
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Herne
;
"
thou
art
just
in
time
to
witnessthe
punishment
of
this
rebellious
hound
.
<EOS>
""Spare
<EOS>
him
,
dread
master
!
<EOS>
oh
,
spare
him
!
"
cried
Tristram
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
said
Herne
,
gazing
at
the
half
-
strangled
caitiff
,
"
he
may
live
.
 
<EOS>
Hewill
not
offend
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
hast
thou
ventured
from
thy
hiding
-
place
,
Tristram?""I
came
to
inform
you
that
I
have
just
observed
a
person
row
across
thelake
in
the
skiff
,
"
replied
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
appears
to
be
taking
thedirection
of
the
secret
entrance
to
the
cave
.
<EOS>
""It
is
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
"
replied
Herne
,
"
I
am
aware
of
his
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Stay
with
Fenwolf
till
he
is
able
to
move
,
and
then
proceed
with
him
tothe
cave
.
 
<EOS>
But
mark
me
,
no
violence
must
be
done
to
Wyat
if
you
findhim
there
.
 
<EOS>
Any
neglect
of
my
orders
in
this
respect
will
be
followed
bysevere
punishment
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
the
cave
ere
long
;
but
,
meanwhile
,
Ihave
other
business
to
transact
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
quitting
the
hut
,
he
plunged
into
the
wood
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
having
crossed
the
lake
,
landed
,
andfastened
the
skiff
to
a
tree
,
struck
into
the
wood
,
and
presentlyreached
the
open
space
in
which
lay
the
secret
entrance
to
the
cave
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
long
in
finding
the
stone
,
though
it
was
so
artfullyconcealed
by
the
brushwood
that
it
would
have
escaped
anyuninstructed
eye
,
and
removing
it
,
the
narrow
entrance
to
the
cave
wasrevealed
.
<EOS>
Committing
himself
to
the
protection
of
Heaven
,
Wyat
entered
,
andhaving
taken
the
precaution
of
drawing
the
stone
after
him
,
which
waseasily
accomplished
by
a
handle
fixed
to
the
inner
side
of
it
,
hecommenced
the
descent
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
had
to
creep
along
,
but
thepassage
gradually
got
higher
,
until
at
length
,
on
reaching
the
levelground
,
he
was
able
to
stand
upright
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
light
to
guide
him
,
but
by
feeling
against
the
sides
of
the
passage
,
he
found
that
he
was
inthe
long
gallery
he
had
formerly
threaded
.
<EOS>
Uncertain
which
way
to
turn
,
he
determined
to
trust
to
chance
for
taking
the
right
direction
,
anddrawing
his
sword
,
proceeded
slowly
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
he
encountered
no
obstacle
,
neither
could
he
detect
theslightest
sound
,
but
he
perceived
that
the
atmosphere
grew
damp
,
andthat
the
sides
of
the
passage
were
covered
with
moisture
.
 
<EOS>
Thuswarned
,
he
proceeded
with
great
caution
,
and
presently
found
,
afteremerging
into
a
more
open
space
,
and
striking
off
on
the
left
,
that
hehad
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
pool
of
water
which
he
knew
lay
at
theend
of
the
large
cavern
.
<EOS>
While
considering
how
he
should
next
proceed
,
a
faint
gleam
of
lightbecame
visible
at
the
upper
end
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
Changing
his
position
,
forthe
pillars
prevented
him
from
seeing
the
source
of
the
glimmer
,
hediscovered
that
it
issued
from
a
lamp
borne
by
a
female
hand
,
who
hehad
no
doubt
was
Mabel
.
 
<EOS>
On
making
this
discovery
,
he
sprangforwards
,
and
called
to
her
,
but
instantly
repented
his
rashness
,
for
ashe
uttered
the
cry
the
light
was
extinguished
.
<EOS>
Wyat
was
now
completely
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
satisfiedthat
Mabel
was
in
the
vault
;
but
in
what
way
to
guide
himself
to
herretreat
he
could
not
tell
,
and
it
was
evident
she
herself
would
not
assisthim
.
 
<EOS>
Persuaded
,
however
,
if
he
could
but
make
himself
known
,
heshould
no
longer
be
shunned
,
he
entered
one
of
the
lateral
passages
,
and
ever
and
anon
,
as
he
proceeded
,
repeated
Mabel
's
name
in
a
low
,
soft
tone
.
 
<EOS>
The
stratagem
was
successful
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
heard
a
lightfootstep
approaching
him
,
and
a
gentle
voice
inquired
-"Who
<EOS>
calls
me?""A
friend
,
"
replied
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"Your
name
?
<EOS>
"
she
demanded
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
know
me
if
I
declare
myself
,
Mabel
,
"
he
replied
,
"
but
I
amcalled
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
name
is
well
known
to
me
,
"
she
replied
,
in
trembling
tones
;
"
and
Ihave
seen
you
once
--
at
my
grandfather
's
cottage
.
 
<EOS>
But
why
have
youcome
here
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
where
you
are?"I
know
that
I
am
in
the
cave
of
Herne
the
Hunter
,
"
replied
Wyat
;
"
andone
of
my
motives
for
seeking
it
was
to
set
you
free
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
isnothing
to
prevent
your
flight
now
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
there
is
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
chained
here
by
bonds
I
cannotbreak
.
 
<EOS>
Herne
has
declared
that
any
attempt
at
escape
on
my
part
shallbe
followed
by
the
death
of
my
grandsire
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
does
not
threatenidly
,
as
no
doubt
you
know
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
most
terrible
vengeance
wouldfall
on
my
own
head
.
 
<EOS>
No,--I
cannot
--
dare
not
fly
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
us
not
talk
inthe
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Come
with
me
to
procure
a
light
.
 
<EOS>
Give
me
your
hand
,
and
Iwill
lead
you
to
my
cell
.
<EOS>
"Taking
<EOS>
the
small
,
trembling
hand
offered
him
,
Wyat
followed
hisconductress
down
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
steps
brought
them
to
a
door
,
which
she
pushed
aside
,
and
disclosed
a
small
chamber
,
hewn
out
ofthe
rock
,
in
a
recess
of
which
a
lamp
was
burning
.
<EOS>
Lighting
the
lampwhich
she
had
recently
extinguished
,
she
placed
it
on
a
rude
table
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
been
long
a
prisoner
here
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Wyat
,
fixing
his
regardsupon
her
countenance
,
which
,
though
it
had
lost
somewhat
of
itsbloom
,
had
gained
much
in
interest
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
three
months
,
I
suppose
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
I
am
not
able
to
calculate
the
lapse
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
seemed
very
--
very
long
.
 
<EOS>
Oh
that
I
could
behold
the
sun
again
,
and
breathe
the
fresh
,
pure
air!"Come
with
me
,
and
you
shall
do
so
,
"
rejoined
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
told
you
I
can
not
fly
,
"
she
answered
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
sacrifice
mygrandsire
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
if
he
is
leagued
with
this
demon
he
deserves
the
worst
fate
<EOS>
thatcan
befall
him
,
"
said
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
should
think
only
of
your
own
safety
.
<EOS>
What
can
be
the
motive
of
your
detention?"I
tremble
to
think
of
it
<EOS>
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
I
fear
that
Herne
hasconceived
a
passion
for
me
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
indeed
you
must
fly
,
"
cried
Wyat
;
"
such
unhallowed
love
will
tendto
perdition
of
soul
and
body
.
<EOS>
""Oh
that
there
was
any
hope
for
me
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
ejaculated
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
hope
,
"
replied
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
protect
you
--
will
care
for
you
--
willlove
you
.
<EOS>
""Love
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mabel
,
a
deep
blush
overspreading
her
palefeatures
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
love
another
.
<EOS>
""Absence
has
enabled
me
to
overcome
the
vehemence
of
my
passion,"replied
Wyat
,
"
and
I
feel
that
my
heart
is
susceptible
of
new
emotions
.
<EOS>
But
you
,
maiden
,
"
he
added
coldly
,
"
you
are
captivated
by
theadmiration
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
love
,
like
yours
,
is
past
,
"
she
answered
,
with
a
faint
smile
;
"
but
if
Iwere
out
of
Herne
's
power
I
feel
that
I
could
love
again
,
and
far
moredeeply
than
I
loved
before
--
for
that
,
in
fact
,
was
rather
the
result
ofvanity
than
of
real
regard
.
<EOS>
""Mabel
,
"
said
Wyat
,
taking
her
hand
,
and
gazing
into
her
eyes
,
"
if
I
setyou
free
,
will
you
love
me?""I
love
<EOS>
you
already
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
if
that
could
be
,
my
whole
lifeshould
be
devoted
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
with
a
sudden
change
oftone
,
"
footsteps
are
approaching
;
it
is
Fenwolf
.
 
<EOS>
Hide
yourself
withinthat
recess
.
"Though
<EOS>
doubting
the
prudence
of
the
course
,
Wyat
yielded
to
herterrified
and
imploring
looks
,
and
concealed
himself
in
the
manner
shehad
indicated
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
scarcely
ensconed
in
the
recess
,
when
the
dooropened
,
and
Morgan
Fenwolf
stepped
in
,
followed
by
her
grandfather
.
<EOS>
Fenwolf
gazed
suspiciously
round
the
little
chamber
,
and
then
glancedsignificantly
at
old
Tristram
,
but
he
made
no
remark
.
<EOS>
"What
brings
you
here
?
"
demanded
Mabel
tremblingly
.
<EOS>
"You
are
wanted

the
cave
,
"
said
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"I
will
follow
you
anon
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"You
must
come
at
once
,
"
rejoined
Fenwolf
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"Herne
<EOS>
willbecome
impatient
.
<EOS>
"Upon
this
Mabel
rose
,
and
,
without
daring
to
cast
a
look
towards
thespot
where
Wyat
was
concealed
,
quitted
the
cell
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
No
soonerwere
they
all
out
,
than
Fenwolf
,
hastily
shutting
the
door
,
turned
thekey
in
the
lock
,
and
taking
it
out
,
exclaimed
,
"
<EOS>
So
we
have
secured
you
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
No
fear
of
your
revealing
the
secret
of
the
cave
now
,
or
flying
with
Mabel
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
<EOS>
to
hereIII
.
 
<EOS>
In
what
manner
Herne
declared
his
Passion
for
Mabel
.
<EOS>
Utterly
disregarding
her
cries
and
entreaties
,
Fenwolf
dragged
Mabelinto
the
great
cavern
,
and
forced
her
to
take
a
seat
on
a
bench
near
thespot
where
a
heap
of
ashes
showed
that
the
fire
was
ordinarily
lighted
.
<EOS>
All
this
while
,
her
grandfather
had
averted
his
face
from
her
,
as
iffearing
to
meet
her
regards
,
and
he
now
busied
himself
in
striking
alight
and
setting
fire
to
a
pile
of
fagots
and
small
logs
of
wood
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
thought
you
told
me
Herne
was
here
,
"
said
Mabel
in
a
tone
of
bitterreproach
,
to
Fenwolf
,
who
seated
himself
beside
her
on
the
bench
.
<EOS>
"He
will
be
here
ere
long
,
"
he
replied
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
do
not
detain
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mabel
piteously
;
"
do
notdeliver
him
to
your
dread
master
!
<EOS>
Do
what
you
will
with
me
--
but
let
himgo
.
<EOS>
""I
will
tell
you
what
I
will
do
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
,
in
a
low
tone
;
"
I
will
setSir
Thomas
at
liberty
,
and
run
all
risks
of
Herne
's
displeasure
,
if
you
willpromise
to
be
mine
.
<EOS>
"Mabel
<EOS>
replied
by
a
look
of
unutterable
disgust
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
he
will
await
Herne
's
coming
where
he
is
,
"
rejoined
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
Saying
which
he
arose
,
and
,
pushing
a
table
near
the
bench
,
took
theremains
of
a
huge
venison
pasty
and
a
loaf
from
a
hutch
standing
onone
side
of
the
cavern
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Old
Tristram
,
having
succeeded
in
lighting
the
fire
,
placedhimself
at
the
farther
end
of
the
table
,
and
fell
to
work
upon
the
viandswith
Fenwolf
.
 
<EOS>
Mabel
was
pressed
to
partake
of
the
repast
,
but
shedeclined
the
offer
.
 
<EOS>
A
large
stone
bottle
was
next
produced
and
emptiedof
its
contents
by
the
pair
,
who
seemed
well
contented
with
theirregale
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Mabel
was
revolving
the
possibility
of
flight
,
and
had
morethan
once
determined
to
make
an
attempt
,
but
fear
restrained
her
.
 
<EOS>
Hergrandsire
,
as
has
been
stated
,
sedulously
avoided
her
gaze
,
and
turneda
deaf
<EOS>
ear
to
her
complaints
and
entreaties
.
 
<EOS>
But
once
,
when
Fenwolf'sback
was
turned
,
she
caught
him
gazing
at
her
with
peculiarsignificance
,
and
then
comprehended
the
meaning
of
his
strangeconduct
.
 
<EOS>
He
evidently
only
awaited
an
opportunity
to
assist
her
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
of
this
,
she
became
more
tranquil
,
and
about
an
hour
havingelapsed
,
during
which
nothing
was
said
by
the
party
,
the
low
winding
ofa
horn
was
heard
,
and
Fenwolf
started
to
his
feet
,
exclaiming--"It
is
Herne!"The
next
moment
the
demon
huntsman
rode
from
one
of
the
lateralpassages
into
the
cave
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
mounted
on
a
wild
-
looking
blackhorse
,
with
flowing
mane
and
tail
,
eyes
glowing
like
carbuncles
,
and
inall
respects
resembling
the
sable
steed
he
had
lost
in
the
forest
.
<EOS>
Springing
to
the
ground
,
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
Fenwolf
in
alow
tone
,
and
delivering
his
steed
to
him
,
with
orders
to
take
it
to
thestable
,
signed
to
Tristram
to
go
with
him
,
and
approached
Mabel
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
you
have
seen
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
<EOS>
,
I
find
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
stern
tone
.
<EOS>
Mabel
made
no
answer
,
and
did
not
even
raise
her
eyes
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
has
told
you
he
loves
you
,
and
has
urged
you
to
fly
with
him
--
ha
?
"
pursued
Herne
.
<EOS>
Mabel
still
did
not
dare
to
look
up
,
but
a
deep
blush
overspread
hercheek
.
<EOS>
"He
was
mad
to
venture
hither
,
"
continued
Herne
;
"
but
having
done
so
,
he
must
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
""You
will
not
destroy
him
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mabel
imploringly
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
He
will
perish
by
a
hand
as
terrible
as
mine
,
"
laughed
Herne
-
"
by
that
of
famine
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
never
quit
the
dungeon
alive
<EOS>
unless--""Unless
what
?
<EOS>
"
gasped
Mabel
.
<EOS>
"Unless
<EOS>
he
is
leagued
with
me
,
"
replied
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
let
him
pass
,
for
I
would
speak
of
myself
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
told
you
that
I
love
you
,
andam
resolved
to
make
you
mine
.
 
<EOS>
You
shudder
,
but
wherefore
?
<EOS>
It
is
aglorious
destiny
to
be
the
'
bride
of
the
wild
hunter
--
the
fiend
who
rulesthe
forest
,
and
who
,
in
his
broad
domain
,
is
more
powerful
than
theking
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
forester
,
Robin
Hood
,
had
his
maid
Marian
;
and
what
washe
compared
to
me
?
<EOS>
He
had
neither
my
skill
nor
my
power
.
 
<EOS>
Be
mine
,
and
you
shall
accompany
me
on
my
midnight
rides
;
shall
watch
thefleet
stag
dart
over
the
moonlight
glade
,
or
down
the
lengthened
vista
.
<EOS>
You
shall
feel
all
the
unutterable
excitement
of
the
chase
.
 
<EOS>
You
shallthread
with
me
the
tangled
grove
,
swim
the
river
and
the
lake
,
andenjoy
a
thousand
pleasures
<EOS>
hitherto
unknown
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Be
mine
,
and
Iwill
make
you
mistress
of
all
my
secrets
,
and
compel
the
band
whom
Iwill
gather
round
me
to
pay
you
homage
.
 
<EOS>
Be
mine
,
and
you
shall
havepower
of
life
and
death
over
them
,
as
if
you
were
absolute
queen

<EOS>
Andfrom
me

all
fear

<EOS>
you
shall
have
love

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
he
would
have
taken
her
hand
;
but
she
recoiled
from
horror
.
<EOS>
"Though
<EOS>
I
now
inspire
you
with
terror
and
aversion
,
"
pursued
"
<EOS>
the
timewill
come
when
you

love

as
passionately
as
I
was
beloved
byone

you
are
the
image

"
<EOS>
And
she
is
dead
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mabel
,
with
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"Dead
I
"
exclaimed
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thrice
fifty
years
have
flown
since
shedwelt
upon
earth
.
 
<EOS>
The
acorn
which
was
shed
in
the
forest
has
growninto
a
lusty
oak
,
while
trees
at
that
time
in
their
pride
have
fallen
anddecayed
away
.
 
<EOS>
Dead!--yes
,
she
has
passed
from
all
memory
save
mine
,
where
she
will
ever
dwell
.
 
<EOS>
Generations
of
men
have
gone
down
to
thegrave
since
her
time
--
a
succession
of
kings
have
lodged
within
thecastle
but
I
am
still
a
denizen
of
the
forest
.
<EOS>
For
crimes
I
then
committedI
am
doomed
to
wander
within
it
,
and
I
shall
haunt
it
,
unless
released
,
tillthe
crack
of
doom
.
<EOS>
""Liberate
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mabel
;
"
liberate
your
other
prisoner
and
we
willpray
for
your
release
.
<EOS>
""No
more
of
this
!
"
cried
Herne
fiercely
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
not
call
downinstant
and
terrible
punishment
on
your
head
-
punishment
that
I
cannotavert
,
and
must
inflict
--
you
will
mention
nothing
sacred
in
my
hearing
,
and
never
allude
to
prayer
,
I
am
beyond
the
reach
of
salvation

<EOS>
""Oh
,
say
not
so
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mabel
,
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
youhow
my
doom
was
accomplished

rejoined
Herne
wildly
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
gain
herof
whom
I
have
just
spoken
,
and
who
was
already
vowed
to
Heaven
,
Iinvoked
the
powers
of
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
I
proffered
my
soul
to
the
Evil
One
ifhe
<EOS>
would
secure
her
to
me
,
and
the
condition
demanded
by
him
wasthat
I
should
become
what
I
am
--
the
fiend
of
the
forest
,
with
power
toterrify

to
tempt
,
and
with
other
more
fearful
and
fatal
powersbesides

<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mabel
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
grasped
at
the
offer
,
"
pursued
Herne
.
<EOS>
"
She
I
loved
became
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Butshe
was
speedily
snatched
from
me
by
death
,
and
since
then
I
haveknown
no
human
passion
except
hatred
and
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
dwelt
inthis
forest
,
sometimes
alone
,
sometimes
at
the
head
of
a
numerousband
,

always
exerting
a
baneful
influence
over
mankind

At

Isaw
the

she
replied

with
a
shudder

"You

rejoined
He
me
,
with
a
triumphant
laugh

I
want
not

I
loveyou

you
rather
by
persuasion

Consent

I
give
Wyat
his

""I

<EOS>
she
replied

<EOS>
"Not

only
do
I
offer
you
Wyat
's
life
as
the
price
of
your
compliance,"persevered
Herne
;
"

you
shall
have
what
ever
else
you
may
seek

jewels

ornaments

costly

I

agoodly

""And

of

"
said
Mabel

<EOS>
"
I

"You

""And

she
demanded

<EOS>
"Tristram
<EOS>
Lyndwood

replied
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
nowclear
up
the
mystery
that
hangs
over
your

<EOS>
You
are
the
offspringof
one

for
years
has
exercised
greater
sway

his

Hispriestly

""Have

demanded
Mabel

<EOS>
"You

replied
Herne
;

he
has
seen
you

little

out

that

maintain

Mabel

And
is
it

You

To

morrow
at
midnight
our

""Nuptials

echoed
Mabel
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
at
that
altar

"
he
cried
,
pointing
to
the
Druid
pile
of
stones
;
"
thereyou
shall
vow
yourself
to
me

I
to
you

<EOS>
Ishall
have
no

<EOS>
Reflect
upon
what
Ihave
said

<EOS>
"With
this
<EOS>
he
placed
the
bugle
to
his
lips
,
blew
a
low
call
upon
it
,
andFenwolf
<EOS>
and
Tristram
immediately
answering
the
summons
,
hewhispered
some
instructions
to
the
former
,
and
disappeared
down
oneof
the
side
passages
.
<EOS>
Fenwolf
's
,
deportment
was
now
more
sullen
than
before
.
 
<EOS>
In
vain
didMabel
inquire
from
him
what
Herne
was
about
to
do
with
Sir
ThomasWyat
.
 
<EOS>
He
returned
no
answer
,
and
at
last
,
wearied
by
her
importunity
,
desired
her
to
hold
her
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Just
then
,
Tristram
quitted
the
cavernfor
a
moment
,
when
he
instantly
changed
his
manner
,
and
'
said
to
herquickly
,
"
I
overheard
what
passed
between
you
and
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
Consent
tobe
mine

and
I
will
deliver
you
from
him

<EOS>
""That

she
replied
,
"
If

Wyat

<EOS>
""I
will
only
deliver
him
on
the

have
mentioned
"
replied
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Tristram
returned
,
and
the
conversation
ceased
.
<EOS>
Fresh
logs
were
then
thrown
on
the
fire
by
Fenwolf
,
and
,
at
his
request
,
Tristram
proceeded
to
a
hole
in
the
rock
,
which
served
as
a
sort
oflarder
,
and
brought
from
it
some
pieces
of
venison

were
broiledupon
the
embers

<EOS>
At
the
close
of
the
repast

of

she
sparingly
partook
,
Mabel
wasconducted
by
Morgan
Fenwolf
into
a
small
chamber
opening
out
of
thegreat
cavern
,
which
was
furnished
like
the
cell
she
had
lately
occupied
,
with
a
small
straw
pallet

Leaving
her
a
lamp

Fenwolf
locked

<EOS>
How
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
was
visited
by
Herne
in
the
Cell

Made
aware
by
the
clangour
of
the
lock
,
and
Fenwolf
's
exultinglaughter
,
of
the
snare
in
which
he
had
been
caught
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyatinstantly
sprang
from
his
hiding

rushed
to
the
door

beingframed
of

nerved
as
they
were
by
rage
and
despair
,
to
burstit
open
.
 
<EOS>
Mabel
's
shrieks
,
as
she
was
dragged
away
,
reached
his
ears
,
and
increased
his
anguish
;
and
he
called
out
loudly
to
her
companionsto
return
,
but
his
vociferations
were
only
treated
with
derision
.
<EOS>
Finding
it
useless
to
struggle
further
,
Wyat
threw
himself
upon
thebench
,
and
endeavoured
to
discover
some
means
of
<EOS>
deliverance
fromhis
present
hazardous
position
.
 
<EOS>
He
glanced
round
the
cell
to
seewhether
<EOS>
there
was
any
other
outlet
than
the
doorway
,
but
he
coulddiscern
none
,
except
a
narrow
grated
loophole
opening
upon
thepassage
,
and
contrived
,
doubtless
,
for
the
admission
of
air
to
thechamber
.
 
<EOS>
No
dungeon
could
be
more
secure
.
<EOS>
Raising
the
lamp
,
he
examined
every
crevice
,
but
all
seemed
solidstone
.
 
<EOS>
The
recess
in
which
he
had
taken
shelter
proved
to
be
a
merehollow
in
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
corner
lay
a
small
straw
pallet
,
which
,
nodoubt
,
had
formed
the
couch
of
Mabel
;
and
this
,
together
with
the
stonebench
and
rude
table
of
the
same
material
,
constituted
the
solefurniture
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
Having
taken
this
careful
survey
of
the
cell
,
Wyat
again
sat
down
uponthe
bench
with
the
conviction
that
escape
was
out
of
the
question
;
andhe
therefore
endeavoured
to
prepare
himself
for
the
worst
,
for
it
<EOS>
wasmore
than
probable
<EOS>
he
would
be
allowed
to
perish
of
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
To
afiery
nature
like
his
,
the
dreadful
uncertainty
in
which
he
was
placedwas
more
difficult
of
endurance
than
bodily
torture
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
wasdestined
to
endure
it
long
.
 
<EOS>
Many
hours
flew
by
,
during
which
nothingoccurred
to
relieve
the
terrible
monotony
of
his
situation
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
inspite
of
his
anxiety
,
slumber
stole
upon
him
unawares
;
but
it
was
filledwith
frightful
visions
.
<EOS>
How
long
he
slept
he
knew
not
,
but
when
he
awoke
,
he
found
that
thecell
must
have
been
visited
in
the
interval
,
<EOS>
for
there
was
a
manchet
ofbread
,
part
of
a
cold
neck
of
venison
,
and
a
flask
of
wine
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
,
therefore
,
that
his
captors
did
not
mean
to
starve
him
,
and
yielding
to
the
promptings
of
appetite
,
he
attacked
the
provisions
,
determined
to
keep
strict
watch
when
his
gaoler
should
next
visit
him
.
<EOS>
The
repast
finished
,
he
again
examined
the
cell
,
but
with
no
bettersuccess
than
before
;
and
he
felt
almost
certain
,
from
the
position
inwhich
the
bench
was
placed
,
that
the
visitor
had
not
found
entrancethrough
the
door
.
<EOS>
After
another
long
and
dreary
interval
,
finding
that
sleep
was
stealingupon
him
fast
,
he
placed
the
bench
near
the
door
,
and
leaned
his
backagainst
the
latter
,
certain
that
in
this
position
he
should
be
awakened
ifany
one
attempted
to
gain
admittance
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
His
slumber
wasagain
disturbed
by
fearful
dreams
;
and
he
was
at
length
aroused
by
atouch
upon
the
shoulder
,
while
a
deep
voice
shouted
his
own
name
inher
ears
.
<EOS>
Starting
to
his
feet
,
and
scarcely
able
to
separate
the
reality
from
thehideous
phantasms
that
had
troubled
him
,
he
found
that
the
door
wasstill
fastened
,
and
the
bench
unremoved
,
while
before
him
stood
Hernethe
Hunter
.
"Welcome
<EOS>
again
to
my
cave
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
I
"
cried
the
demon
,
with
amocking
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
,
on
the
night
of
the
attempt
upon
the
king
,
that
though
you
escaped
him
,
you
would
not
escape
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
it
hascome
to
pass
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
now
wholly
in
my
power
,
body
and
soul
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!""I
defy
you
,
false
fiend
,
"
replied
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
mad
enough
to
proffer
youmy
soul
on
certain
conditions
;
but
they
have
never
been
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
""They
may
yet
be
so
,
"
rejoined
Herne
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Wyat
,
"
I
have
purged
my
heart
from
the
fierce
andunhallowed
passion
that
swayed
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
desire
no
assistance
from
you
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
you
have
changed
your
mind
,
that
is
nought
to
me
,
"
rejoined
thedemon
<EOS>
derisively--
<EOS>
"
I
shall
hold
you
to
your
compact
.
<EOS>
""Again
<EOS>
I
say
I
renounce
you
,
infernal
spirit
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wyat
;
"
you
maydestroy
my
body
--
but
you
can
work
no
mischief
to
my
soul
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
alarm
yourself
without
reason
,
good
Sir
Thomas
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Herne
,
ina
slightly
sneering
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
the
malignant
being
you
supposeme
;
neither
am
I
bent
upon
fighting
the
battles
of
the
enemy
of
mankindagainst
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
be
leagued
with
the
powers
of
darkness
,
but
Ihave
no
wish
to
aid
them
;
and
I
therefore
leave
you
to
take
care
of
yoursoul
in
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
What
I
desire
from
you
is
your
service
while
living
.
<EOS>
Now
listen
to
the
conditions
I
have
to
propose
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
bind
yourselfby
a
terrible
oath
,
the
slightest
infraction
of
which
shall
involve
theperdition
of
the
soul
you
are
so
solicitous
to
preserve
,
not
to
discloseaught
<EOS>
you
may
see
,
or
that
may
be
imparted
to
you

<EOS>
You
must
alsoswear
implicit
obedience
to
me
in
all
things

to
execute
any
secretcommissions

of
whatever
nature
,
I
may
give
you
--
to
bring
associates
tomy
band
--
and
to
join
me
in
any
enterprise
I
may
propose
.
<EOS>
This
oathtaken
,
you
are
free
.
 
<EOS>
Refuse
it
,
and
I
leave
you
to
perish
.
<EOS>
""I
do
refuse
it
,
"
replied
Wyat
boldly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
would
die
a
thousand
deathsrather
than
so
bind
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
<EOS>
do
I
fear
being
left
to
perish
here
.
<EOS>
You
shall
not
quit
this
cell
without
me
.
<EOS>
""You
are
a
stout
soldier
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
"
rejoined
the
demon
,
with
ascornful
laugh
;
"
but
you
are
scarcely
a
match
for
Herne
the
Hunter
<EOS>
,
asyou
will
find
,
if
you
are
rash
enough
to
make
the
experiment
.
 
<EOS>
Beware!"he
exclaimed
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
observing
the
knight
lay
his
handupon
his
sword
,
"
I
am
invulnerable
,
and
you
will
,
therefore
,
vainly
strikeat
me
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
compel
me
to
use
the
dread
means
,
which
I
couldinstantly
employ
,
to
subject
you
to
my
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
you
well
,
and
wouldrather
serve
than
injure
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
let
you
go
,
unless
you
leagueyourself
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
Swear
,
therefore
,
obedience
to
me
,
and
depart
henceto
your
friends
,
Surrey
and
Richmond
,
and
tell
them
you
have
failed
tofind
me
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
know
,
then
,
of
our
meeting
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"Perfectly
<EOS>
well
,
"
laughed
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
now
eventide
,
and
at
midnightthe
meeting
will
take
place
in
the
forester
's
hut
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
attend
it
not
,
Iwill
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
my
prisoners
as
well
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
To
preserve
yourself
andsave
them
,
you
must
join
me
.
<EOS>
""Before
<EOS>
I
return
an
answer
,
"
said
Wyat
,
"
I
must
know
what
has
becomeof
Mabel
Lyndwood
.
<EOS>
"Mabel
<EOS>
Lyndwood
is
nought
to
you
,
Sir
Thomas
,
"
rejoined
Herne
coldly
.
<EOS>
"She
is
so
much
to
me
that
I
will
run
a
risk
for
her
which
I
would
not
runfor
myself
,
"
replied
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
promise
obedience
to
you
,
will
youliberate
her
?
<EOS>
will
you
let
her
depart
with
me?""No
,
"
said
Herne
peremptorily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Banish
all
thoughts
of
her
from
yourbreast
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
never
behold
her
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
time
forreflection
on
my
proposal
.
 
<EOS>
An
hour
before
midnight
I
shall
return
,
and
ifI
find
you
in
the
same
mind
,
I
abandon
you
to
your
fate
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
these
words
he
stepped
back
towards
the
lower
end
of
thecell
.
 
<EOS>
Wyat
instantly
sprang
after
him
,
but
before
he
could
reach
him
aflash
of
fire
caused
him
to
recoil
,
and
to
his
horror
and
amazement
,
hebeheld
the
rock
open
,
and
yield
a
passage
to
the
retreating
figure
.
<EOS>
When
the
sulphureous
smoke
,
with
which
the
little
cell
was
filled
,
had
insome
degree
cleared
off
,
Wyat
examined
the
sides
of
the
rock
,
butcould
not
find
the
slightest
trace
of
a
secret
outlet
,
and
thereforeconcluded
that
the
disappearance
of
the
demon
had
been
effected
bymagic
.

V.
 
<EOS>
How
Mabel
escaped
from
the
Cave
with
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
Mabel
was
set
at
liberty
by
her
gaoler
,
and
the
hours
flewby
without
the
opportunity
of
escape
,
for
which
she
sighed
,
occurringto
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
night
drew
on
,
she
became
more
anxious
,
and
at
lastexpressed
a
wish
to
retire
to
her
cell
.
 
<EOS>
When
about
to
fasten
the
door
,
Fenwolf
found
that
the
lock
had
got
strained
,
and
the
bolts
would
notmove
,
and
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
content
himself
with
placing
abench
against
it
,
on
which
he
took
a
seat
.
<EOS>
About
an
hour
after
Mabel
's
retirement
,
old
Tristram
offered
to
relieve
guard
with
Fenwolf
,
but
this
the
other
positively
declined
,
and
leaning
against
the
door
,
disposed
himself
to
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
Tristram
then
threw
himself
on
the
floor
,
and
in
a
short
time
all
seemed
buried
in
repose
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
however
,
when
Fenwolf
's
heavy
breathing
gave
token
of
thesoundness
of
his
sleep
,
Tristram
raised
himself
upon
his
elbow
,
andgazed
round
.
 
<EOS>
The
lamp
placed
upon
the
table
imperfectly
illumined
thecavern
,
for
the
fire
which
had
been
lighted
to
cook
<EOS>
the
evening
mealhad
gone
out
completely
.
 
<EOS>
Getting
up
cautiously
,
and
drawing
hishunting
-
knife
,
the
old
man
crept
towards
Fenwolf
,
apparently
with
theintent
of
stabbing
him
,
but
he
suddenly
changed
his
resolution
,
anddropped
his
arm
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
,
as
if
preternaturally
warned
,
Fenwolf
opened
his
eyes
,
and
seeing
the
old
forester
standing
by
,
sprang
upon
him
,
and
seizedhim
by
the
throat
.
<EOS>
"Ah
traitor
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
;
"
what
are
you
about
to
do?""I
am
no
traitor
,
"
replied
the
old
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
heard
a
noise
in
the
passageleading
to
Wyat
's
cell
,
and
was
about
to
rouse
you
,
when
you
awakenedof
your
own
accord
,
probably
disturbed
by
the
noise
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
,
satisfied
with
the
excuse
,
andrelinquishing
his
grasp
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fancied
I
heard
something
in
my
dreams
.
 
<EOS>
Butcome
with
me
to
Wyat
's
cell
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
leave
you
here
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
snatching
up
the
lamp
,
he
hurried
with
Tristram
into
the
passage
.
<EOS>
They
were
scarcely
gone
,
when
the
door
of
the
cell
was
opened
byMabel
,
who
.
 
<EOS>
had
overheard
what
had
passed
;
and
so
hurriedly
did
sheissue
forth
that
she
over
-
turned
the
bench
,
which
fell
to
the
ground
witha
considerable
clatter
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
only
just
time
to
replace
it
,
and
toconceal
herself
in
an
a!1joining
passage
,
when
Fenwolf
rushed
backinto
the
cavern
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
false
alarm
,
"
he
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
in
his
cellthrough
the
loop
-
hole
,
and
I
have
brought
the
key
away
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
<EOS>
Iam
sure
I
heard
a
noise
here
.
<EOS>
""It
must
have
been
mere
fancy
,
"
said
Tristram
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
is
as
we
leftit
.
<EOS>
""It
seems
so
,
certes
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
make
sure
.
"
;
While
he
placed
his
ear
to
the
door
,
Mabel
gave
a
signal
to
Tristramthat
<EOS>
she
was
safe
.
 
<EOS>
Persuaded
that
he
heard
some
sound
in
thechamber
<EOS>
,
Fenwolf
nodded
to
Tristram
that
all
was
right
,
and
resumedhis
seat
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
ten
minutes
he
was
again
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
Mabel
then
emergedfrom
her
concealment
,
and
cautiously
approached
Tristram
,
whofeigned
,
also
,
to
slumber
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
approached
him
,
he
rose
noiselesslyto
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
plan
has
succeeded
,
"
he
said
in
a
low
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
I
who
spoiledthe
lock
.
 
<EOS>
But
come
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
lead
you
out
of
the
cavern
.
"Not
<EOS>
without
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
"
she
replied
;
"
I
will
not
leave
him
here
.
<EOS>
""You
will
only
expose
yourself
to
risk
,
and
fail
to
deliver
him
,
"
rejoinedTristram
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fenwolf
has
the
key
of
his
cell
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
you
are
determinedupon
it
,
I
will
not
hinder
you
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
must
find
your
own
way
out
,
for
Ishall
not
assist
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
.
<EOS>
"Motioning
<EOS>
him
to
silence
,
Mabel
crept
slowly
,
and
on
the
points
of
herfeet
,
towards
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
The
key
was
in
his
girdle
.
 
<EOS>
Leaning
over
him
,
she
suddenly
anddexterously
plucked
it
forth
.
<EOS>
At
the
very
moment
she
possessed
herself
of
it
,
Fenwolf
stirred
,
andshe
dived
down
,
and
concealed
herself
beneath
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Fenwolf
,
who
had
been
only
slightly
disturbed
,
looked
up
,
and
seeing
Tristram
inhis
former
position
,
which
he
had
resumed
when
Mabel
commenced
hertask
,
again
disposed
himself
to
slumber
.
<EOS>
Waiting
till
she
was
assured
of
the
soundness
of
his
repose
,
Mabelcrept
from
under
the
table
,
signed
to
Tristram
to
remain
where
he
was
,
and
glided
with
swift
and
noiseless
footsteps
down
the
passage
leadingto
the
cell
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
,
she
was
at
the
door
--
the
key
was
in
the
lock
--
and
shestood
before
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
.
<EOS>
A
few
words
sufficed
to
explain
to
the
astonished
knight
how
she
camethere
,
and
comprehending
that
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
,
hefollowed
her
forth
.
<EOS>
In
the
passage
,
they
held
a
brief
consultation
together
in
a
low
tone
,
asto
the
best
means
of
escape
,
for
they
deemed
it
useless
to
apply
toTristram
.
 
<EOS>
The
outlet
with
which
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
was
acquainted
layon
<EOS>
the
other
side
of
the
cavern
;
nor
did
he
know
how
to
discover
theparticular
passage
leading
to
it
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mabel
,
she
could
offer
no
information
,
but
she
knew
that
thestable
lay
in
an
adjoining
passage
.
<EOS>
Recollecting
,
from
former
experience
,
how
well
the
steeds
weretrained
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
eagerly
caught
at
the
suggestion
,
and
Mabelled
him
farther
down
the
passage
,
and
striking
off
through
an
openingon
the
left
,
brought
him
,
after
a
few
turns
,
to
a
large
chamber
,
in
whichtwo
or
three
black
horses
were
kept
.
<EOS>
Loosening
one
of
them
,
Wyat
placed
a
bridle
on
his
neck
,
sprang
uponhis
back
,
and
took
up
Mabel
beside
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
struck
his
heelsagainst
the
sides
of
the
animal
,
who
needed
no
further
incitement
todash
along
the
passage
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
brought
them
into
thecavern
.
<EOS>
The
trampling
of
the
horse
wakened
Fenwolf
,
who
started
to
his
feet
,
and
ran
after
them
,
shouting
furiously
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
Goaded
byWyat
's
dagger
,
the
steed
dashed
furiously
on
,
and
plunging
with
itsdouble
burden
into
the
pool
at
the
bottom
of
the
cavern
,
disappeared
.

<EOS>
Of
the
Desperate
Resolution
formed
by
Tristram
and
Fenwolf
,
andhow
the
Train
was
laid
.
<EOS>
Transported
with
rage
at
the
escape
of
the
fugitives
,
Fenwolf
turned
toold
Tristram
,
and
drawing
his
knife
,
threatened
to
make
an
end
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
old
man
,
who
was
armed
with
a
short
hunting
-
sword
,
stoodupon
his
defence
,
and
they
remained
brandishing
their
weapons
ateach
other
for
some
minutes
,
but
without
striking
a
blow
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
leave
you
to
Herne
's
vengeance
,
"
said
Fenwolf
,
returning
hisknife
to
his
belt
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
pay
dearly
for
allowing
them
to
escape
.
<EOS>
""I
will
take
my
chance
,
"
replied
Tristram
moodily
:
"
<EOS>
my
mind
is
made
upto
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
no
longer
serve
this
fiend
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
dare
you
break
your
oath
?
"
cried
Fenwolf
.
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
theterrible
consequences
.
<EOS>
""I
care
not
for
them
,
"
replied
Tristram
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Harkee
,
Fenwolf
:
<EOS>
I
know
you
willnot
betray
me
,
<EOS>
for
you
hate
him
as
much
as
I
do
,
and
have
as
great
adesire
for
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
rid
the
forest
of
this
fell
being
.
<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
you
could
make
good
your
words
,
old
man
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fenwolf
.
 
<EOS>
"
Iwould
give
my
life
for
vengeance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
""I
take
the
offer
,
"
said
Tristram
;
"
you
shall
have
vengeance
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
how
?
"
cried
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
proved
that
he
is
invulnerable
andthe
prints
of
his
hands
are
written
in
black
characters
upon
my
throat
.
<EOS>
If
we
could
capture
him
,
and
deliver
him
to
the
king
,
we
might
purchaseour
own
pardon
.
<EOS>
"No
,
that
can
never
be
,
"
said
Tristram
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
plan
is
to
destroy
him
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
let
me
hear
it
,
"
said
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"Come
with
me
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Tristram
.
<EOS>
And
taking
up
the
lamp
,
he
led
the
way
down
a
narrow
lateral
passage
.
<EOS>
When
about
half
-
way
down
it
,
he
stopped
before
a
low
door
,
cased
withiron
,
which
he
opened
,
and
showed
that
the
recess
was
filled
with
largecanvas
bags
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
this
is
the
powder
-
magazine
,
"
said
Fenwolf
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
can
now
guesshow
you
mean
to
destroy
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
I
like
the
scheme
well
enough
;
but
itcannot
be
executed
without
certain
destruction
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
""I
will
take
all
the
risk
upon
myself
,
"
said
Tristram
,
"
I
only
require
youraid
in
the
preparations
.
<EOS>
What
I
propose
to
do
is
this
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
powderenough
in
the
magazine
,
not
only
to
blow
up
the
cave
,
but
to
set
fire
toall
the
wood
surrounding
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
scattered
among
the
dry
brush
-
wood
in
a
great
circle
round
the
cave
,
and
connected
by
a
train
withthis
magazine
.
 
<EOS>
When
Herne
comes
hack
,
I
will
fire
the
train
.
<EOS>
""There
is
much
hazard
in
the
scheme
,
and
I
fear
it
will
fail
,
"
repliedFenwolf
,
after
a
pause
,
"
nevertheless
,
I
will
assist
you
.
<EOS>
""Then
,
let
us
go
to
work
at
once
,
"
said
Tristram
,
"
for
we
have
no
timeto
lose
.
 
<EOS>
Herne
will
be
here
before
midnight
,
and
I
should
like
to
have
allready
for
him
.
<EOS>
"Accordingly
<EOS>
,
they
each
shouldered
a
couple
of
the
bags
,
and
returningto
the
cavern
,
threaded
a
narrow
passage
,
and
emerged
from
thesecret
entrance
in
the
grove
.
<EOS>
While
Fenwolf
descended
for
a
fresh
supply
of
powder
,
Tristramcommenced
operations
.
 
<EOS>
Though
autumn
was
now
far
advanced
,
therehad
been
remarkably
fine
weather
of
late
;
the
ground
was
thicklystrewn
with
yellow
leaves
,
the
fern
was
brown
and
dry
,
and
thebrushwood
crackled
and
broke
as
a
passage
was
forced
through
it
.
<EOS>
The
very
trees
were
parched
by
the
long
-
continued
drought
.
<EOS>
Thusfavoured
in
his
design
,
Tristram
scattered
the
contents
of
one
of
thebags
in
a
thick
line
among
the
fern
and
brushwood
,
depositing
here
andthere
among
the
roots
of
a
tree
,
several
pounds
of
powder
,
andcovering
the
heaps
over
with
dried
sticks
and
leaves
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
employed
,
Fenwolf
appeared
with
two
more
bags
ofpowder
,
and
descended
again
for
a
fresh
supply
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
returned
,
laden
as
before
,
the
old
forester
had
already
described
a
large
portionof
the
circle
he
intended
to
take
.
<EOS>
Judging
that
there
was
now
powder
sufficient
,
Tristram
explained
tohis
companion
how
to
proceed
;
and
the
other
commenced
laying
a
trainon
the
left
of
the
secret
entrance
,
carefully
observing
the
instructionsgiven
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
less
than
an
hour
,
they
met
together
at
a
particular
tree
,
and
the
formidable
circle
was
complete
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
far
,
well
I
"
said
Tristram
,
emptying
the
contents
of
his
bag
beneaththe
tree
,
and
covering
it
with
leaves
and
sticks
,
as
before
;
"
and
now
toconnect
this
with
the
cavern
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
opened
another
bag
,
and
drew
a
wide
train
towards
thecentre
of
the
space
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
paused
at
the
foot
of
a
large
hollowtree
.
<EOS>
"I
have
ascertained
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
this
tree
stands
immediately
overthe
magazine
;
and
by
following
this
rabbit
's
burrow
,
I
have
contrived
tomake
a
small
entrance
into
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
hollow
reed
introduced
through
thehole
,
and
filled
with
powder
,
will
be
sure
to
reach
the
store
below
.
<EOS>
""An
<EOS>
excellent
ideal
"
replied
Fenwolf
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
fetch
one
instantly
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
starting
off
to
the
side
of
the
lake
,
he
presently
returned
withseveral
long
reeds
,
one
of
which
was
selected
by
Tristram
and
thrustinto
the
burrow
.
 
<EOS>
It
proved
of
the
precise
length
required
;
and
as
soonas
it
touched
the
bottom
,
it
was
carefully
filled
with
powder
from
a
horn
.
<EOS>
Having
connected
this
tube
with
the
side
train
,
and
scattered
powderfor
several
yards
around
,
so
as
to
secure
instantaneous
ignition
,
Tristram
pronounced
that
the
train
was
complete
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
have
now
laid
a
trap
from
which
Herne
will
scarcely
escape
,
"
heobserved
,
with
a
moody
laugh
,
to
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
They
then
prepared
to
return
to
the
cave
,
but
had
not
proceeded
manyyards
,
when
Herne
,
mounted
on
his
sable
steed
,
burst
through
thetrees
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
what
make
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
instantly
checking
his
career
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ibade
you
keep
a
strict
watch
over
MabeL
<EOS>
Where
is
she?"She
has
escaped
with
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
,
"
and
wehave
been
in
search
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
Escaped
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Herne
,
springing
from
his
steed
,
and
rushing
up
tohim
;
"
dogs
!
<EOS>
you
have
played
me
false
.
<EOS>
But
your
lives
shall
pay
thepenalty
of
your
perfidy
.
<EOS>
""We
had
no
hand
in
it
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
replied
Fenwolf
doggedly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shecontrived
to
get
out
of
a
chamber
in
which
I
placed
her
,
and
to
liberateSir
Thomas
Wyat
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
procured
a
steed
from
the
stable
,
andplunged
through
the
pool
into
the
lake
.
<EOS>
""Hell
's
malison
upon
them
,
and
upon
you
both
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Herne
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
youshall
pay
dearly
for
your
heedlessness
,
-
if
,
indeed
,
it
has
not
beensomething
worse

<EOS>
How
long
have
they
been
gone?""It
may
be
two
hours

"
replied
Fenwolf
.
<EOS>
"Go
<EOS>
to
the
cave
,
"
cried
Herne
,
"
and
await
my
return
there
;
and
if
Irecover
not
the
prize
,
woe
betide
you
both!"And
<EOS>
with
these
words
,
he
vaunted
upon
his
steed
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
woe
betide
you
too
,
false
fiend

"
<EOS>
cried
Fenwolf
.
 
<EOS>
"
When

shall
meet
with

<EOS>
Would

will
be
time
enough
to
fire
it
on

replied
the
old
forester
;
"
itis
but
postponing
our
vengeance
for
a
short
time

<EOS>
And
now
to
fix
ourpositions

<EOS>
I
will
take
my

""And

said
Fenwolf

<EOS>
Whoever
first
beholds
himshall
fire

""Agreed

"
replied
Tristram

<EOS>
"
Let
us
now
descend
to
the
cave

seethat
all
is

About

Surrey

accompanied
by
the
Duke

Shoreditch
,
and
half
a

set
out
from

took
their

along

park

in

"There

<EOS>
cried
Dacre
;
"
that
were
a
feat
,
<EOS>
indeed!"The
two
strangers
then
rode
apart
for
a
few
moments
,
and
conversedtogether
in
a
low
tone
,
during
which
Richmond
expressed
his
doubts
ofthem
to
Surrey
,
adding
that
he
was
determined
to
get
rid
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
new
-
comers
,
however
,
were
not
easily
shaken
off
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
theyperceived
the
duke
's
design
,
they
stuck
more
pertinaciously
to
him
andthe
earl
than
before
,
and
made
it
evident
they
would
not
be
dismissed
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
passed
Spring
Hill
,
and
were
within
a
mile
of
thevalley
in
which
lay
the
marsh
,
when
a
cry
for
help
was
heard
in
thethicket
on
the
left
,
and
the
troop
immediately
halted
.
 
<EOS>
The
cry
wasrepeated
,
and
Surrey
,
bidding
the
others
follow
him
,
dashed
off
in
thedirection
of
the
sound
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
they
perceived
two
figures
beneath
the
trees
,
whom
theyfound
,
on
a
nearer
approach
,
were
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
with
Mabel
in
astate
of
insensibility
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Dismounting
by
the
side
of
his
friend
,
Surrey
hastily
demanded
how
hecame
there
,
and
what
had
happened?"It
is
too
long
a
story
to
relate
now
,
"
said
Wyat
;
"
but
the
sum
of
it
is
,
that
I
have
escaped
,
by
the
aid
of
this
damsel
,
from
the
clutches
of
thedemon
.
 
<EOS>
Our
escape
was
effected
on
horseback
,
and
we
had
to
plungeinto
the
lake
.
 
<EOS>
The
immersion
deprived
my
fair
preserver
of
sensibility
,
so
that
as
soon
as
I
landed
,
and
gained
a
covert
where
I
fancied
myselfsecure
,
I
dismounted
,
and
tried
to
restore
her
.
 
<EOS>
While
I
was
thusoccupied
,
the
steed
I
had
brought
with
me
broke
his
bridle
,
and
dartedoff
into
the
woods
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
Mabel
opened
her
eyes
,
but
she
wasso
weak
that
she
could
not
move
,
and
I
was
fain
to
make
her
a
couch
inthe
fern
,
in
the
hope
that
she
would
speedily
revive
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
fright
andsuffering
had
been
too
much
for
her
,
and
a
succession
of
fainting
-
fitsfollowed
,
during
which
I
thought
she
would
expire
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
all
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
letus
prepare
a
litter
for
her
,
and
convey
her
where
proper
assistance
canbe
rendered
.
<EOS>
"Meanwhile
,
the
others
had
come
up
,
and
Hugh
Dacre
,
flinging
himselffrom
his
horse
,
and
pushing
Surrey
somewhat
rudely
aside
,
advancedtowards
Mabel
,
and
,
taking
her
hand
,
said
,
in
a
voice
of
some
emotion,"Alas
!
<EOS>
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
I
did
not
expect
to
meet
thee
again
in
this
state
.
<EOS>
""You
knew
her
,
then
?
"
said
Surrey
.
<EOS>
Dacre
muttered
an
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
is
this
man
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Wyat
of
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"I
know
him
not
,
"
answered
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
joined
us
on
the
road
hither
.
<EOS>
""I
am
well
known
to
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
"
replied
Dacre
,
in
a
significanttone
,
"
as
he
will
avouch
when
I
recall
certain
matters
to
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Butdo
not
let
us
lose
time
here
.
 
<EOS>
This
damsel
claims
our
first
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Shemust
be
conveyed
to
a
place
of
safety
,
and
where
she
can
be
welltended
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
then
return
to
search
for
Herne
.
<EOS>
"Upon
this
,
<EOS>
a
litter
of
branches
were
speedily
made
,
and
Mabel
being
laidupon
it
,
the
simple
conveyance
was
sustained
by
four
of
the
archers
.
<EOS>
The
little
cavalcade
then
quitted
the
thicket
,
and
began
to
retrace
itscourse
towards
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
Wyat
had
been
accommodated
with
a
horseby
one
of
the
archers
,
and
rode
in
a
melancholy
manner
by
the
side
ofthe
litter
.
<EOS>
They
had
got
back
nearly
as
far
as
the
brow
of
Spring
Hill
,
when
ahorseman
,
in
a
wild
garb
,
and
mounted
on
a
coal
black
steed
,
lashedsuddenly
and
at
a
furious
pace
,
out
of
the
trees
on
the
right
.
 
<EOS>
He
madetowards
the
litter
,
over
-
turning
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
and
before
anyopposition
could
be
offered
him
,
seized
the
inanimate
form
of
Mabel
,
and
placing
her
before
him
on
his
steed
,
dashed
off
as
swiftly
as
hecame
,
and
with
a
burst
of
loud
,
exulting
laughter
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
Herne
!
<EOS>
it
is
Herne
!
"
<EOS>
burst
from
every
lip
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
all
started
in
pursuit
,
urging
the
horses
to
their
utmost
speed
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
had
instantly
remounted
his
steed
,
and
he
came
up
with
the
others
.
<EOS>
Herne
's
triumphant
and
demoniacal
laugh
was
heard
as
he
scouredwith
the
swiftness
of
the
wind
down
the
long
glade
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
fiercestdetermination
animated
his
pursuers
,
who
,
being
all
admirablymounted
,
<EOS>
managed
to
keep
him
fully
in
view
.
<EOS>
Away
!
<EOS>
away
!
<EOS>
he
speeded
in
the
direction
of
the
lake
;
and
after
him
theythundered
,
straining
every
sinew
in
the
desperate
chase
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
wildand
extraordinary
sight
,
and
partook
of
the
fantastical
character
of
adream
.
<EOS>
At
length
Herne
reached
the
acclivity
,
at
the
foot
of
which
lay
thewaters
of
the
lake
glimmering
in
the
starlight
;
and
by
the
time
he
haddescended
to
its
foot
,
his
pursuers
had
gained
its
brow
.
<EOS>
The
exertions
made
by
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
had
brought
him
a
little
inadvance
of
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
Furiously
goading
his
horse
,
he
dashed
downthe
hillside
at
a
terrific
pace
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
as
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
flying
figure
of
the
demon
,
he
wasstartled
by
a
sudden
burst
of
flame
in
the
valley
.
 
<EOS>
A
wide
circle
of
lightwas
rapidly
described
,
a
rumbling
sound
was
heard
like
that
precedingan
earth
-
quake
,
and
a
tremendous
explosion
followed
,
hurling
trees
andfragments
of
rock
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
Astounded
at
the
extraordinary
occurrence
,
and
not
knowing
whatmight
ensue
,
the
pursuers
reined
in
their
steeds
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
terror
of
thescene
was
not
yet
over
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
brushwood
had
caught
fire
,
and
blazed
up
with
the
fury
and
swiftness
of
lighted
flax
.
 
<EOS>
The
flamescaught
<EOS>
the
parched
branches
of
the
trees
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
thewhole
grove
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
The
sight
was
awfully
grand
,
for
the
wind
,
which
was
blowing
strongly
,
swept
the
flames
forward
,
so
that
they
devoured
all
before
them
.
<EOS>
When
the
first
flash
was
seen
the
demon
had
checked
his
steed
andbacked
him
,
so
that
he
had
escaped
without
injury
,
and
he
stood
at
theedge
of
the
flaming
circle
watching
the
progress
of
the
devastatingelement
;
but
at
last
,
finding
that
his
pursuers
had
taken
heart
and
wereapproaching
him
,
he
bestirred
himself
,
and
rode
round
the
blazing
zone
.
<EOS>
Having
by
this
time
recovered
from
their
surprise
,
Wyat
and
Surreydashed
after
him
,
and
got
so
near
him
that
they
made
sure
of
hiscapture
.
 
<EOS>
But
at
the
very
moment
they
expected
to
reach
him
,
he
turnedhis
horse
's
head
,
and
forced
him
to
leap
over
the
blazing
boundary
.
<EOS>
In
vain
the
pursuers
attempted
to
follow
.
 
<EOS>
Their
horses
refused
toencounter
the
flames
;
while
Wyat
's
steed
,
urged
on
by
its
franticmaster
,
reared
bolt
upright
,
and
dislodged
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
demon
held
on
his
way
,
apparently
unscathed
in
the
midst
ofthe
flames
,
casting
a
look
of
grim
defiance
at
his
pursuers
.
 
<EOS>
As
hepassed
a
tree
,
from
which
volumes
of
fire
were
bursting
,
the
mostappalling
shrieks
reached
his
ear
,
and
he
beheld
Morgan
Fenwolfemerging
from
a
hole
in
the
trunk
.
 
<EOS>
But
without
bestowing
more
than
aglance
upon
his
unfortunate
follower
,
he
dashed
forward
,
and
becominginvolved
in
the
wreaths
of
flame
and
smoke
,
was
lost
to
sight
.
<EOS>
Attracted
by
Fenwolf
's
cries
,
the
beholders
perceived
him
crawl
out
ofthe
hole
,
and
clamber
into
the
upper
part
of
the
tree
,
where
he
roaredto
them
most
piteously
for
aid
.
 
<EOS>
But
even
if
they
had
been
disposed
torender
it
,
it
was
impossible
to
do
so
now
;
and
after
terrible
andprotracted
suffering
,
the
poor
wretch
,
half
stifled
with
smoke
,
andunable
longer
to
maintain
his
hold
of
the
branch
to
which
he
crept
,
fellinto
the
flames
beneath
,
and
perished
.
<EOS>
Attributing
its
outbreak
to
supernatural
agency
,
the
party
gazed
on
inwonder
at
the
fire
,
and
rode
round
it
as
closely
as
their
steeds
wouldallow
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
though
they
tarried
till
the
flames
had
abated
,
and
littlewas
left
of
the
noble
grove
but
a
collection
of
charred
and
smokingstumps
,
nothing
was
seen
of
the
fiend
or
of
the
hapless
girl
he
hadcarried
off
.
 
<EOS>
It
served
to
confirm
the
notion
of
the
supernatural
origin
ofthe
fire
,
in
that
it
was
confined
within
the
mystic
circle
,
and
did
notextend
farther
into
the
woods
.
<EOS>
At
the
time
that
the
flames
first
burst
forth
,
and
revealed
thecountenances
of
the
lookers
--
on
,
it
was
discovered
that
the
self
-
styledDacre
and
Cryspyn
were
no
other
than
the
king
and
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
this
mysterious
being
is
mortal
,
he
must
have
perished
now,"observed
Henry
;
"
and
if
he
is
not
,
it
is
useless
to
seek
for
him
further
.
"Day
<EOS>
had
begun
to
break
as
the
party
quitted
the
scene
of
devastation
.
<EOS>
The
king
and
Suffolk
,
with
the
archers
,
returned
to
the
castle
;
but
Wyat
,
Surrey
,
and
Richmond
rode
towards
the
lake
,
and
proceeded
along
itsbanks
in
the
direction
of
the
forester
's
hut
.
<EOS>
Their
progress
was
suddenly
arrested
by
the
sound
of
lamentation
,
andthey
perceived
,
in
a
little
bay
overhung
by
trees
,
which
screened
it
fromthe
path
,
an
old
man
kneeling
beside
the
body
of
a
female
,
which
hehad
partly
dragged
out
of
the
lake
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
Tristram
Lyndwood
,
and
thebody
was
that
of
Mabel
.
 
<EOS>
Her
tresses
were
dishevelled
,
and
drippingwith
wet
,
as
were
her
garments
;
and
her
features
white
as
marble
.
 
<EOS>
Theold
man
was
weeping
bitterly
.
<EOS>
With
Wyat
,
to
dismount
and
grasp
the
cold
hand
of
the
hapless
maidenwas
the
work
of
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"She
is
dead
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
in
a
despairing
voice
,
removing
the
danktresses
from
her
brow
,
and
imprinting
a
reverent
kiss
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
<EOS>
--lost
to
me
for
ever!""I
found
her
entangled
among
those
water
-
weeds
,
"
said
Tristram
,
intones
broken
by
emotion
,
"
and
had
just
dragged
her
to
shore
when
youcame
up
.
 
<EOS>
As
you
hope
to
prosper
,
now
and
hereafter
,
give
her
a
decentburial
.
 
<EOS>
For
me
all
is
over
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
,
with
a
lamentable
cry
,
he
plunged
into
the
lake
,
struck
out
to
ashort
distance
,
and
then
sank
to
rise
no
more
.

JANE

.
 
<EOS>
Of
Henry
's
Attachment
to
Jane
Seymour
.
<EOS>
ON
the
anniversary
of
Saint
George
,
1536
,
and
exactly
seven
years
<EOS>
fromthe
opening
of
this
chronicle
<EOS>
,
Henry
assembled
the
knights
-
companionswithin
Windsor
Castle
to
hold
the
grand
feast
of
the
most
noble
Order
ofthe
Garter
.
<EOS>
Many
important
events
had
occurred
in
the
wide
interval
thus
sufferedto
elapse
.
 
<EOS>
Wolsey
had
long
since
sunk
under
his
reverses
-
for
he
neverregained
the
royal
favour
after
his
dismissal
--
and
had
expired
atLeicester
Abbey
,
on
the
26th
November
1530.But
the
sufferings
of
Catherine
of
Arragon
were
prolonged
up
to
thecommencement
of
the
year
under
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
divorce
andthe
elevation
of
Anne
Boleyn
to
the
throne
in
her
stead
,
she
withdrew
toKimbolten
Castle
,
where
she
dwelt
in
the
greatest
retirement
,
under
thestyle
of
the
Princess
Dowager
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
her
end
approaching
,
she
sent
ahumble
message
to
the
king
,
imploring
him
to
allow
her
one
lastinterview
with
her
daughter
,
that
she
might
bestow
her
blessing
uponher
;
but
the
request
was
refused
.
<EOS>
A
touching
letter
,
however
,
which
she
wrote
to
the
king
on
her
death
-
bed
,
moved
him
to
tears
;
and
having
ejaculated
a
few
expressions
ofhis
sense
of
her
many
noble
qualities
,
he
retired
to
his
closet
to
indulgehis
grief
in
secret
.
 
<EOS>
Solemn
obsequies
were
ordered
to
be
performed
atWindsor
and
Greenwich
on
the
day
of
her
interment
,
and
the
king
andthe
whole
of
his
retinue
put
on
mourning
for
her
.
<EOS>
With
this
arrangement
Anne
Boleyn
cared
not
to
comply
.
 
<EOS>
Though
shehad
attained
the
summit
of
her
ambition
;
though
the
divorce
had
beenpronounced
,
and
she
was
crowned
queen
;
though
she
had
given
birthto
a
daughter
--
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
afterwards
the
illustrious
queenof
that
name
two
years
before
;
and
though
she
could
have
noreasonable
apprehensions
from
her
,
the
injured
Catherine
,
during
herlifetime
,
had
always
been
an
object
of
dread
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
heard
of
herdeath
with
undisguised
satisfaction
,
clapped
her
hands
,
exclaiming
toher
attendants
,
"
Now
I
am
indeed
queen
!
"
and
put
the
crowning
point
toher
unfeeling
conduct
by
decorating
herself
and
her
dames
in
thegayest
apparel
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
she
little
knew
that
at
that
very
moment
the
work
of
retributioncommenced
,
and
that
the
wrongs
of
the
injured
queen
,
whose
memoryshe
thus
outraged
,
were
soon
to
be
terribly
and
bloodily
avenged
.
<EOS>
Other
changes
had
likewise
taken
place
,
which
may
be
here
recorded
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Surrey
had
made
the
tour
of
France
,
Italy
,
and
the
Empire
,
and
had
fully
kept
his
word
,
by
proclaiming
the
supremacy
of
the
FairGeraldine
's
beauty
at
all
tilts
and
tournaments
,
at
which
he
constantlybore
away
the
prize
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
greatest
reward
,
and
that
which
he
hopedwould
crown
his
fidelity
<EOS>
--
the
hand
of
his
mistress
-
was
not
reserved
forhim
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
three
years
,
he
returned
home
,
polished
by
travel
,
and
accounted
one
of
the
bravest
and
most
accomplished
cavaliers
ofthe
day
.
 
<EOS>
His
reputation
had
preceded
him
,
and
he
was
received
withmarks
of
the
highest
distinction
and
favour
by
Henry
,
as
well
as
byAnne
Boleyn
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
king
was
still
averse
to
the
match
,
and
forbadethe
Fair
Geraldine
to
return
to
court
.
<EOS>
Finding
so
much
opposition
on
all
sides
,
the
earl
was
at
last
brought
toassent
to
the
wish
of
the
Fair
Geraldine
,
that
their
engagement
shouldbe
broken
off
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
letters
,
she
assured
him
that
her
love
hadundergone
no
abatement
--
and
never
would
do
so
--
but
that
she
felt
theymust
give
up
all
idea
of
an
union
.
<EOS>
These
letters
,
probably
the
result
of
some
manoeuvring
on
his
own
part
,
set
on
foot
by
the
royal
mandate
,
were
warmly
seconded
by
the
Duke
ofNorfolk
,
and
after
many
and
long
solicitations
,
he
succeeded
inwringing
from
his
son
a
reluctant
acquiescence
to
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
The
disappointment
produced
its
natural
consequences
on
the
ardenttemperament
of
the
young
earl
,
and
completely
chilled
and
blighted
hisfeelings
.
 
<EOS>
He
became
moody
and
discontented
;
took
little
share
in
theamusement
and
pastimes
going
forward
;
and
from
being
the
blithestcavalier
at
court
,
became
the
saddest
.
 
<EOS>
The
change
in
his
demeanourdid
not
escape
the
notice
of
Anne
Boleyn
,
who
easily
divined
the
cause
,
and
she
essayed
by
raillery
and
other
arts
to
wean
him
from
his
grief
.
<EOS>
But
all
was
for
some
time
of
no
avail
.
 
<EOS>
The
earl
continued
inconsolable
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
however
,
by
the
instrumentality
of
the
queen
and
his
father
,
hewas
contracted
to
the
Lady
Frances
Vere
,
daughter
of
the
Earl
ofOxford
,
and
was
married
to
her
in
1535.Long
before
this
the
Duke
of
Richmond
had
been
wedded
to
the
LadyMary
Howard
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
previous
to
the
present
era
of
this
chronicle
,
AnneBoleyn
had
observed
a
growing
coolness
towards
her
on
the
part
of
theking
,
and
latterly
it
had
become
evident
that
his
passion
for
her
wasfast
subsiding
,
if
indeed
it
had
not
altogether
expired
.
<EOS>
Though
Anne
had
never
truly
loved
her
royal
consort
,
and
though
atthat
very
time
she
was
secretly
encouraging
the
regards
of
another
,
she
felt
troubled
by
this
change
,
and
watched
all
the
king
's
movementswith
jealous
anxiety
,
to
ascertain
if
any
one
had
supplanted
her
in
hisaffections
.
<EOS>
At
length
her
vigilance
was
rewarded
by
discovering
a
rival
in
one
ofthe
loveliest
of
her
dames
,
Jane
Seymour
.
 
<EOS>
This
fair
creature
,
thedaughter
of
Sir
John
Seymour
,
of
Wolff
Hall
,
in
Wiltshire
,
and
who
wasafterwards
<EOS>
,
it
is
almost
needless
to
say
,
raised
to
as
high
a
dignity
asAnne
Boleyn
herself
,
was
now
in
the
very
pride
of
her
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Tall
,
exquisitely
proportioned
,
with
a
complexion
of
the
utmost
brilliancy
anddelicacy
,
large
liquid
blue
eyes
,
bright
chestnut
tresses
,
and
lovelyfeatures
,
she
possessed
charms
that
could
not
fall
to
captivate
theamorous
monarch
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
marvellous
that
Anne
Boleyn
should
havesuch
an
attendant
;
but
perhaps
she
felt
confident
in
her
ownattractions
.
<EOS>
Skilled
in
intrigue
herself
,
Anne
,
now
that
her
eyes
were
opened
,
perceived
all
the
allurements
thrown
out
by
Jane
to
ensnare
the
king
,
and
she
intercepted
many
a
furtive
glance
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Still
she
didnot
dare
to
interfere
.
 
<EOS>
The
fierceness
of
Henry
's
temper
kept
her
in
awe
,
and
she
knew
well
that
the
slightest
opposition
would
only
make
himthe
more
determined
to
run
counter
to
her
will
.
 
<EOS>
Trusting
,
therefore
,
toget
rid
of
Jane
Seymour
by
some
stratagem
,
she
resolved
not
toattempt
to
dismiss
her
,
except
as
a
last
resource
.
<EOS>
A
slight
incident
occurred
,
which
occasioned
a
departure
from
theprudent
course
she
had
laid
down
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
her
dames
,
she
was
traversing
the
great
gallery
of
thepalace
at
Greenwich
,
when
she
caught
the
reflection
of
Jane
Seymour
,
who
was
following
her
,
in
a
mirror
,
regarding
a
jewelled
miniature
.
 
<EOS>
Sheinstantly
turned
round
at
the
sight
,
and
Jane
,
in
great
confusion
,
thrustthe
picture
into
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
"Ah
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
what
have
you
there
?
"
cried
Anne
.
<EOS>
"A
picture
of
my
father
,
Sir
John
Seymour
,
"
replied
Jane
,
blushingdeeply
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
look
at
it
,
"
cried
Anne
,
snatching
the
picture
from
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
callyou
this
your
father
?
<EOS>
To
my
thinking
it
is
much
more
like
my
royalhusband
.
 
<EOS>
Answer
me
frankly
,
minion
--
answer
me
,
as
you
value
your
life!Did
<EOS>
the
king
give
you
<EOS>
this?""I
must
decline
answering
the
question
,
"
replied
Jane
,
who
by
this
timehad
recovered
her
composure
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
am
I
to
be
thus
insolently
treated
by
one
of
my
own
dames
?
"
<EOS>
criedAnne
.
<EOS>
"I
intend
no
disrespect
to
your
majesty
,
"
replied
Jane
,
"
and
I
will
,
sinceyou
insist
upon
it
,
freely
confess
that
I
received
the
portrait
from
theking
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
not
conceive
there
could
be
any
harm
in
doing
so
,
because
Isaw
your
majesty
present
your
own
portrait
,
the
other
day
,
to
Sir
HenryNorris
.
<EOS>
"Anne
Boleyn
turned
as
pale
as
death
,
and
Jane
Seymour
perceived
thatshe
had
her
in
her
power
.
<EOS>
"I
gave
the
portrait
to
Sir
Henry
as
a
recompense
for
an
importantservice
he
rendered
me
,
"
said
Anne
,
after
a
slight
pause
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
doubt
,
"
replied
Jane
;
"
and
I
marvel
not
that
he
should
press
it
sofervently
to
his
lips
,
seeing
he
must
value
the
gift
highly
.
 
<EOS>
The
kinglikewise
bestowed
his
portrait
upon
me
for
rendering
him
a
service
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
was
that
?
"
asked
Anne
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
there
your
majesty
must
hold
me
excused
,
"
replied
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
"
Itwere
to
betray
his
highness
's
confidence
to
declare
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
refer
youto
him
for
explanation
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
you
are
in
the
right
to
keep
the
secret
,
"
said
Anne
,
forcing
alaugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
there
is
no
harm
in
the
portrait
<EOS>
--
indeed
,
I
am
surethere
is
not
,
if
it
was
given
with
the
same
intent
that
mine
wasbestowed
upon
Norris
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
we
will
say
no
more
upon
the
matter
,
except
that
I
beg
you
to
be
discreet
with
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
If
others
shouldcomment
upon
your
conduct
,
I
may
be
compelled
to
dismiss
you
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
majesty
shall
be
obeyed
,
"
said
Jane
,
with
a
look
that
intimatedthat
the
request
had
but
slight
weight
with
her
.
<EOS>
"Catherine
will
be
avenged
by
means
of
this
woman
,
"
muttered
Anne
asshe
turned
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
already
feel
some
of
the
torments
with
which
shethreatened
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
suspects
Norris
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
impress
more
cautionon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
when
a
man
loves
deeply
,
as
he
loves
me
,
due
restraint
isseldom
maintained
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
though
alarmed
,
Anne
was
by
no
means
aware
of
the
criticalposition
in
which
she
stood
.
 
<EOS>
She
could
not
persuade
herself
that
shehad
entirely
lost
her
influence
with
the
king
;
and
she
thought
that
whenhis
momentary
passion
had
subsided
,
it
would
return
to
its
oldchannels
.
<EOS>
She
was
mistaken
.
 
<EOS>
Jane
Seymour
was
absolute
mistress
of
his
heart;and
<EOS>
Anne
was
now
as
great
a
bar
to
him
as
she
had
before
been
anattraction
.
 
<EOS>
Had
her
conduct
been
irreproachable
,
it
might
have
beendifficult
to
remove
her
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
she
had
placed
herself
at
hismercy
,
by
yielding
to
the
impulses
of
vanity
,
and
secretly
encouragingthe
passion
of
Sir
Henry
Norris
,
groom
of
the
stole
.
<EOS>
This
favoured
personage
was
somewhat
above
the
middle
Size
,
squarely
and
strongly
built
.
 
<EOS>
His
features
were
regularly
and
finelyformed
,
and
he
had
a
ruddy
complexion
,
brown
curling
hair
,
good
teeth
,
and
fine
eyes
of
a
clear
blue
.
 
<EOS>
He
possessed
great
personal
strength
,
was
expert
in
all
manly
exercises
,
and
shone
especially
at
the
joustsand
the
manege
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
of
an
ardent
temperament
,
and
Anne
Boleynhad
inspired
him
with
so
desperate
a
passion
that
he
set
at
nought
thefearful
risk
he
ran
to
obtain
her
favour
.
<EOS>
In
all
this
seemed
traceable
the
hand
of
fate
--
in
Henry
's
passion
<EOS>
forJane
Seymour
,
and
Anne
's
insane
regard
for
Norris
--
as
if
in
this
way
,
and
by
the
same
means
in
which
she
herself
had
been
wronged
,
theinjured
Catherine
of
Arragon
was
to
be
avenged
.
<EOS>
How
far
Henry
's
suspicions
of
his
consort
's
regard
for
Norris
had
beenroused
did
not
at
the
time
appear
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
he
felt
in
secret
,
he
tookcare
that
no
outward
manifestation
should
betray
him
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contraryhe
loaded
Norris
,
who
had
always
been
a
favourite
with
him
,
with
newmarks
of
regard
,
and
encouraged
rather
than
interdicted
his
approachto
the
queen
.
<EOS>
Things
were
in
this
state
when
the
court
proceeded
to
Windsor
,
asbefore
related
,
on
Saint
George
's
day

<EOS>
How
Anne
Boleyn
received
Proof
of
Henry
's
Passion
for
JaneSeymour
.
<EOS>
On
the
day
after
the
solemnisation
of
the
Grand
Feast
of
the
Order
ofthe
Garter
,
a
masqued
fete
of
great
splendour
and
magnificence
washeld
within
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
state
apartments
were
thrownopen
to
the
distinguished
guests
,
and
universal
gaiety
prevailed
.
 
<EOS>
Norestraint
was
offered
to
the
festivity
by
the
king
,
for
though
he
wasknown
to
be
present
,
he
did
not
choose
to
declare
himself
.
<EOS>
The
queen
sat
apart
on
a
fauteuil
in
the
deep
embrasure
of
a
window;and
as
various
companies
of
fantastic
characters
advanced
towardsher
,
she
more
than
once
fancied
she
detected
amongst
them
the
king
,
but
the
voices
convinced
her
of
her
mistake
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
evening
waswearing
,
a
mask
in
a
blue
domino
drew
near
her
,
and
whispered
in
adevoted
and
familiar
tone
,
"
<EOS>
My
queen!""Is
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
you
,
Norris
?
"
demanded
Anne
,
under
her
breath
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
madam
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
gazing
at
you
the
wholeevening
,
but
have
not
dared
to
approach
you
till
now
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sorry
you
have
addressed
me
at
all
,
Norris
,
"
she
rejoined
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yourregard
for
me
has
been
noticed
by
others
,
and
may
reach
the
king'sears
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
promise
never
to
address
me
in
the
language
ofpassion
again
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
may
not
utter
my
love
<EOS>
I
shall
go
mad
,
"
replied
Norris
.
 
<EOS>
"
After
raisingme
to
the
verge
of
Paradise
,
do
not
thrust
me
to
the
depths
ofTartarus
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
neither
raised
you
nor
do
I
cast
you
down
,
"
rejoined
Anne
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
I
am
sensible
of
your
devotion
,
and
grateful
for
it
,
I
admit
,
butnothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
My
love
and
allegiance
are
due
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
""True
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Norris
bitterly
;
"
they
are
so
,
but
he
is
wholly
insensibleto
your
merits
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
very
moment
he
is
pouring
his
love
-
vows
in
theear
of
Jane
Seymour
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
is
he
so
?
"
cried
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
me
have
proof
of
his
perfidy
,
and
I
mayincline
a
more
favourable
ear
to
you
.
<EOS>
""I
will
instantly
obtain
you
the
proof
,
madam
,
"
replied
Norris
,
bowingand
departing
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
he
quitted
the
queen
,
and
mixed
with
the
throng
ofdancers
,
than
he
felt
a
pressure
upon
his
arm
,
and
turning
at
the
touch
,
beheld
a
tall
monk
,
the
lower
part
of
whose
face
was
muffled
up
,
leaving
only
a
pair
of
fierce
black
eyes
and
a
large
aquiline
nose
visible
.
<EOS>
"I
know
what
you
want
,
Sir
Henry
Norris
,
"
said
the
tall
monk
in
a
lowdeep
voice
;
"
you
wish
to
give
the
queen
proof
of
her
royal
lord'sinconstancy
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
easily
done
.
 
<EOS>
Come
with
me
.
"
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
?
"
demanded
Norris
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
"
What
matters
it
who
I
am
?
"
rejoined
the
other
;
"
I
am
one
of
themasquers
,
and
chance
to
know
what
is
passing
around
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
notinquire
into
your
motives
,
and
therefore
you
have
no
right
to
inquire
intomine
.
<EOS>
""It
is
not
for
my
own
satisfaction
that
I
desire
this
proof
,
"
said
Norris,"because
I
would
rather
shield
the
king
's
indiscretions
than
betraythem
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
queen
has
conceived
suspicions
which
she
isdetermined
to
verify""Think
not
to
impose
upon
me
,
"
replied
the
monk
with
a
sneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bringthe
queen
this
way
,
and
she
shall
be
fully
satisfied
.
<EOS>
""I
can
run
no
risk
in
trusting
you
,
"
said
Norris
,
"
and
therefore
I
acceptyour
offer
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
no
more
,
"
cried
the
monk
disdainfully
,
"
I
will
await
you
here
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
Norris
returned
to
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
discovered
anything
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"Come
with
me
,
madam
,
"
said
Norris
,
bowing
and
taking
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
thus
they
glided
through
the
throng
of
dancers
,
whorespectfully
cleared
a
passage
for
them
as
they
walked
along
until
theyapproached
the
spot
where
the
tall
monk
was
standing
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
drewnear
him
he
moved
on
,
and
Norris
and
the
queen
followed
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Passing
from
the
great
hall
in
which
the
crowd
of
dancers
wereassembled
,
they
descended
a
short
flight
of
steps
,
at
the

monk
paused
,
and
pointed
with
his
right
hand
to
a
chamber
,
partlyscreened
by
the
folds
of
a
curtain
.
<EOS>
At
this
intimation
the
queen
and
her
companion
stepped
quickly
on
,
andas
she
advanced
,
Anne
Boleyn
perceived
Jane
Seymour
and
the
kingseated
on
a
couch
within
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
was
habited
like
apilgrim
,
but
he
had
thrown
down
his
hat
,
ornamented
with
the
scallop
-
shell
,
his
vizard
,
and
his
staff
,
and
had
just
forced
his
fair
companion
tounmask
.
<EOS>
At
the
sight
,
Anne
was
tranfixed
with
jealous
rage
,
and
was
for
themoment
almost
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
Norris
,
or
of
the
monk
,
who
remained
behind
the
curtain
,
pointing
to
what
was
taking
place
.
<EOS>
"Your
majesty
is
determined
to
expose
my
blushes
,
"
said
JaneSeymour
,
slightly
struggling
with
her
royal
lover
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
I
only
want
to
be
satisfied
that
it
is
really
yourself
,
sweetheart,"cried
<EOS>
Henry
passionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
in
mercy
to
me
,
I
suppose
,
that
youinsisted
upon
shrouding
those
beauteous
features
from
my
view
.
<EOS>
"Hear
you
that
,
madam
?
"
<EOS>
whispered
Norris
to
Anne
.
<EOS>
The
queen
answered
by
a
convulsive
clasp
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"Your
majesty
but
jests
with
me
,
"
said
Jane
Seymour
.
<EOS>
"
Jests
!
"
criedHenry
passionately
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
my
faith
!
<EOS>
I
never
understood
the
power
ofbeauty
till
now
.
 
<EOS>
No
charms
ever
moved
my
heart
like
yours
;
nor
shall
Iknow
a
moment
's
peace
till
you
become
mine
.
<EOS>
""I
am
grieved
to
hear
it
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
Jane
Seymour
,
"
for
I
nevercan
be
yours
,
unless
as
your
queen
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
Norris
hazarded
a
whisper
to
Anne
Boleyn
,
which
was
answeredby
another
nervous
grasp
of
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"That
is
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
pursued
Jane
,
seeing
the
gloomy
reverieinto
which
her
royal
lover
was
thrown
,
"
I
can
give
your
majesty
nohopes
at
all""You
have
been
schooled
by

"
said
Henry
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
so
,
my
liege
?
"
demanded
Jane
Seymour
.
<EOS>
"Those
<EOS>
are
the
very
words
she
used
to
me
when
I
wooed
her
,
and
whichinduced
me
to
divorce

Arragon

replied
Henry
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
they
may
bring
about
her
own
removal""Just
Heaven

"
<EOS>
murmured
Anne
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
listen
to
your
majesty

"
said
Jane
Seymour
,
in
a
tremuloustone
;
"
and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
I
dared
speak
-"Speak
on
,
fearlessly
,
sweetheart
,
"
said
Henry
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
am
well
assured
,
"
said
Jane
,
.
<EOS>
"
that
the
queen
no
longer
lovesyou
;
nay
,
that
she
loves
another

<EOS>
""It

minion

"
cried
Anne
Boleyn
,
rushing
forward
,
while
Norrishastily
retreated
,
"
it
is
false

<EOS>
It
is
you

would
deceive
the

<EOS>
But
I
have
fortunately
been
brought
hither
toprevent
the
injury
you
would
do

<EOS>
Oh

Henry

<EOS>
have
I
deserved

ofyou?""You

said
the
king
.
<EOS>
"I
have
chanced
to
arrive
most
opportunely
for
myself
,
"
said
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Asfor

I

<EOS>
""Catherine

should
have
made
that
speech

retorted
JaneSeymour
bitterly
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
had
reason

she
never

""Nor

""It

Henry
in

cried
the

sternly

""And

Jane

walking
up
toAnne

speaking
in

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
queen
looked
as
if
stricken
by
a
thunderbolt
.
 
<EOS>
She
heard
thetriumphant
laugh
of
her

she
saw
her

forth

all

by

she

a

After

she
was
about

"I

""Would

"If

I

""Oh

then

<EOS>
pursued
Norris
,
"
<EOS>
since
the

is
so
regardless

There

""Oh

tenderly

rapturously

"Do

said
Anne
mournfully

<EOS>
"Your

"And
<EOS>
extending

she
cried
suddenly

almost
with
a
shriek

<EOS>
"Rise

instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
,
to
his
inexpressible
dismay
,
sawthe
figure
of
a
tall
monk
gliding
away
.
 
<EOS>
Throwing
a
meaning
look
at
thealmost
sinking
queen
,
he
followed
the
mysterious
observer
into
thegreat
hall
,
determined
to
rid
himself
of
him
in
some
way
before
heshould
have
time
to
make
any
revelations
.
<EOS>
Avoiding
the
brilliant
throng
,
the
monk
entered
the
adjoining
corridor
,
and
descending
the
great
staircase
,
passed
into
the
upper
quadrangle
.
<EOS>
From
thence
he
proceeded
towards
the
cloisters
near
St.
George'sChapel
,
where
he
was
overtaken
by
Norris
,
who
had
followed
himclosely
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
would
you
with
me
,
Sir
Henry
Norris
?
"
cried
the
monk
,
halting
.
<EOS>
"You
may
guess
,
"
said
Norris
,
sternly
and
drawing
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thereare
secrets
which
are
dangerous
to

Unless

tall

laughed
derisively

<EOS>
"You

know
that
your

said

<EOS>
Well

e'en
take
it

if
you

<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
drew
a
sword
from
beneath
his
robe
,
and
stood
uponhis
defence
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
few
passes
,
Norris
's
weapon
was
beaten
from
hisgrasp

<EOS>
"You
are
now
completely
at
my
mercy

"
said
the
monk
,
"
and
I
havenothing
to

to
call
the
guard
,
and
declare
all
I
have
heard
to
theking

<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
would
rather
you
plunged
your
sword
into
my
heart

said
Norris
.
<EOS>
"There
is
one
way
--
and
only
one
--
by
which
my
secrecy
may
bepurchased

"
said
the
monk
.
<EOS>
"Name
it

replied
Norris
.
 
<EOS>
"
Were
it
to
be

I
would
embrace

<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
hit
the
point
exactly

rejoined
the
monk
drily
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
you
notguess
with
whom
you
have
to
deal?""Partly
,
"
replied
Norris
<EOS>
"
I
never
found
such
force
in
mortal
arm
as
youhave
displayed
.
<EOS>
""Probably
not
,
"
laughed
the
other
:
"
most
of
those
who
have
venturedagainst
me
have
found
their
match

<EOS>
But
come
with
me
into

park
,
and
you
shall
learn
the
condition

my
secrecy

<EOS>
""I
can
not
quit
the
castle

"
replied
Norris
;
"
but
I
will
take
you
to
mylodgings
,
where
we
shall
be
wholly
unobserved

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
crossing
the
lower
ward
,
they
proceeded
to
the
tower
on
the
southside
of
it

now
appropriated
to

governor
of

alms
knights

<EOS>
About
an
hour
after
this
Norris
returned
to
the
revel

<EOS>
His
wholedemeanour
was
altered
,
and
his
looks
ghastly

<EOS>
He
sought
the
queen

who
had
returned
to
the
seat
in
the
embrasure
.
<EOS>
"What
has
happened

"
said
Anne
,
in
a
low
tone
,
as
he
approached
her
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
killed
him?""No

"
he
replied
;
"

I
have
purchased

a
terrible
price

<EOS>
""You

<EOS>
she
cried

I

<EOS>
Henry
's
attentions
to
Jane
Seymour
at
the
masqued

were
somarked

that
the
whole
court
was
made
aware
of
his
passion

<EOS>
But
itwas
not
anticipated
that
any
serious
and
extraordinary
consequenceswould
result
from
the
intoxication
--
far
less
that
the
queen
herself
wouldbe
removed
to
make
way
for
her
successful
rival

<EOS>
It
was
afterwards

however

remembered
that
at

Henry
held
frequent

long
,
andgrave
conferences
with
the
Dukes
of
Suffolk

appearedto

meditation
of
some
project
.
<EOS>
After
the
scene
at
the
revel
,
Anne
did
not
make
another
exhibition
ofjealousy
;
but
it
was
not
that
she
was
reconciled
to
her
situation
,
or
inany
way
free
from
uneasiness
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
the
unhappy
Catherineof

did
not
suffer
more
in
secret

but
she
knew
,
from
experience

that
with
her

all
reproaches
would
be
unavailing

look
,
my
dear
lord
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
motioned
himto
a
seat
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
good
reason
,
"
he
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Anne
!
<EOS>
words
can
not
expressmy
anxiety
at
the
present
state
of
things
.
<EOS>
""It
will
speedily
pass
by
,
my
lord
,
"
she
replied
;
"
the
king
will
soon
betired
of
his
new
idol
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
before
he
has
overthrown
the
old
one
,
I
fear
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
.
<EOS>
"Jane
<EOS>
Seymour
's
charms
have
usurped
entire
sovereignty
over
him
.
<EOS>
With
all
her
air
of
ingenuousness
and
simplicity
,
the
minion
is
artful
anddangerous
She
has
a
high
mark
,
I
am
persuaded
--
no
less
than
thethrone
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
Henry
can
not
we
d
her
<EOS>
--
he
can
not
divorce
me
,
"
said
Anne
.
<EOS>
"So
thought
Catherine
of
Arragon
,
"
replied
her
father
;
"
and
yet
she
wasdivorced
.
 
<EOS>
Anne
,
I
am
convinced
a
plot
is
hatching
against
you
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
not
fear
for
my
life
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
"I
trust
there
are
no
grounds
for
charges
against
you
by
which
it
mightbe
brought
in
jeopardy
,
"
replied
the
earl
gravely
.
<EOS>
"None
,
father
--
none
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
rejoined
the
earl
;
"
for
I
have
heard
that
the
king
said
toone
who
suggested
another
divorce
to
him
,
'
No
,
if
the
queen
comeswithin
the
scope
of
the
divorce
,
she
also
comes
within
the
pale
of
thescaffold
.
<EOS>
'""A
<EOS>
pledge
was
extorted
from
him
to
that
effect
,
"
said
Anne
,
in
a
hollowvoice
.
<EOS>
"That
an
attempt
will
be
made
against
you
,
I
firmly
believe
,
"
replied
theearl
;
"
but
if
you
are
wholly
innocent
you
have
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
to
fear
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
father
!
<EOS>
I
know
not
that
,
"
cried
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Innocence
avails
little
withthe
stony
-
hearted
Henry
.
<EOS>
""It
will
prove
your
best
safeguard
,
"
said
the
earl
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
now
farewell
,
daughter
!
<EOS>
Heaven
guard
you
!
<EOS>
Keep
the
strictest
watch
upon
yourself
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
quitted
the
apartment
,
and
as
soon
as
she
was
left
alone
,
the
unhappy
Anne
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
.
<EOS>
From
this
state
of
affliction
she
was
roused
by
hearing
her
own
namepronounced
in
low
accents
,
and
looking
up
,
she
beheld
Sir
Henry
Norris
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
Norris
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
in
a
tone
of
reproach
,
"
you
have
come
hither
todestroy
me
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
one
knows
of
my
coming
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
at
least
,
no
one
who
will
betrayme
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
brought
hither
by
one
who
will
take
care
we
are
notobserved
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
Herne
?
"
demanded
Anne
.
<EOS>
Norris
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
"
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
had
never
leagued
yourself
with
him
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
;
"
I
fearthe
rash
act
will
bring
destruction
upon
us
both
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
to
retract
now
,
"
he
replied
;
"
besides
,
there
was
no
helpfor
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
sacrificed
myself
to
preserve
you
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
will
the
sacrifice
preserve
me
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
fear
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
justbeen
told
that
the
king
is
preparing
some
terrible
measure
against
me
--
that
he
meditates
removing
me
,
to
make
way
for
Jane
Seymour
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
heard
the
truth
,
madam
,
"
replied
<EOS>
Norris.;he
will
try
to
bringyou
to
the
block
.
""And
<EOS>
with
him
,
to
try
is
to
achieve
,
"
said
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Norris
!
<EOS>
it
is
a
fearfulthing
to
contemplate
such
a
death!""But
why
contemplate
it
,
madam
?
"
said
Norris
;
"
why
,
if
you
are
satisfiedthat
the
king
has
such
designs
against
you
-
why
,
if
you
feel
that
he
willsucceed
,
tarry
for
the
fatal
blow
?
<EOS>
Fly
with
me
--
fly
with
one
who
lovesyou
,
and
will
devote
his
whole
life
to
you
--
who
regards
you
,
not
as
thequeen
,
but
as
Anne
Boleyn
.
<EOS>
Relinquish
this
false
and
hollow
grandeur
,
and
fly
with
me
to
happiness
and
peace
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
relinquish
my
throne
to
Jane
Seymour
?
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Anne
"
Never
!
<EOS>
Ifeel
that
all
you
assert
is
true
--
that
my
present
position
is
hazardous
--
<EOS>
that
Jane
Seymour
is
in
the
ascendant
,
while
I
am
on
the
decline
,
if
notwholly
sunk
--
that
you
love
me
entirely
,
and
would
devote
your
life
tome
--
still
,
with
all
these
motives
for
dread
,
I
can
not
prevail
upon
myselfvoluntarily
to
give
up
my
title
,
and
to
abandon
my
post
to
a
rival
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
not
love
me
,
then
,
as
I
love
you
,
Anne
,
"
said
Norris
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
aking
,
I
would
abandon
my
throne
for
you
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
think
so
now
,
Norris
,
because
you
are
not
king
,
"
she
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
ButI
am
queen
,
and
will
remain
so
,
till
I
am
forced
to
abandon
my
dignity
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
understand
,
madam
,
"
rejoined
Norris
gloomily
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
oh
I
bethink
youto
what
risks
you
expose
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
the
king
's
terribledetermination
--
his
vindictiveness
,
his
ferocity
.
<EOS>
""Full
<EOS>
well
,
"
she
replied--
"
<EOS>
full
well
;
but
I
will
rather
die
a
queen
than
livedisgrace
and
ruined
.
 
<EOS>
In
wedding
Henry
the
Eighth
,
I
laid
my
account
tocertain
risks
,
and
those
I
must
brave
.
"Before
<EOS>
Norris
could
urge
anything
further
,
the
door
was
suddenlyopened
,
and
a
tall
dark
figure
entered
the
chamber
,
and
said
hastily
-"The
<EOS>
king
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
""One
word
more
,
and
it
is
my
last
,
"
said
Norris
to
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
you
fly
withme
to
-
night?--all
shall
be
ready
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
,
"
replied
Anne
.
<EOS>
"Away
!
"
cried
Herne
,
dragging
Norris
forcibly
behind
the
tapestry
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
they
disappeared
when
Henry
entered
the
chamber
.
 
<EOS>
Hewas
in
a
gayer
mood
than
had
been
usual
with
him
of
late
.
<EOS>
"I
am
come
to
tell
you
,
madam
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
am
about
to
hold
joustsin
the
castle
on
the
first
of
May
,
at
which
your
good
brother
and
mine
,
the
Lord
Rochford
,
will
be
the
challenger
,
while
I
myself
shall
be
thedefendant
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
adjudge
the
prize
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
not
make
Jane
Seymour
queen
of
the
jousts
?
"
said
Anne
,
unableto
resist
the
remark
.
<EOS>
"She
will
be
present
at
them
,
"
said
Henry
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
my
own
reasons,"he
added
significantly
,
"
for
not
wishing
her
to
appear
as
queen
on
thisoccasion
.
<EOS>
""Whatever
may
be
your
reasons
,
the
wish
is
sufficient
for
me
,
"
saidAnne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
will
you
tarry
a
moment
with
me
?
<EOS>
It
is
long
since
we
havehad
any
converse
in
private
together
.
<EOS>
""I
am
busy
at
this
moment
,
"
replied
Henry
bluffly
;
"
but
what
is
it
youwould
say
to
me?""I
would
only
reproach
you
for
some
lack
of
tenderness
,
and
muchneglect
,
"
said
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Henry
!
<EOS>
do
you
remember
how
you
swore
byyour
life
--
your
crown
--
your
faith
--
all
that
you
held
sacred
or
dear
--
thatyou
would
love
me
<EOS>
ever?""And
<EOS>
so
I
would
,
<EOS>
if
I
could
,
"
replied
the
king
;
"
but
unfortunately
the
heartis
not
entirely
under
control
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
yourself
,
for
instance
,
experienced
no
change
in
your
affections?""No
,
"
replied
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
certainly
suffered
severely
from
your
tooevident
regard
for
Jane
Seymour
;
but
,
though
deeply
mortified
anddistressed
,
I
have
never
for
a
moment
been
shaken
in
my
love
for
yourmajesty
.
<EOS>
""A
loyal
and
loving
reply
,
"
said
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
had
perceived
someslight
diminution
in
your
regard
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
did
yourself
grievous
injustice
by
the
supposition
,
"
replied
Anne
.
<EOS>
"I
would
fain
believe
so
,
"
said
the
king
;
"
but
there
are
some
personswho
would
persuade
me
that
you
have
not
only
lost
your
affection
forme
,
but
have
even
cast
eyes
of
regard
on
another
.
<EOS>
""Those
who
told
you
so
lied
!
"
cried
Anne
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
Never
womanwas
freer
from
such
imputation
than
myself
.
<EOS>
""Never
<EOS>
woman
was
more
consummate
hypocrite
,
"
muttered
Henry
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
do
not
credit
me
,
I
see
,
"
cried
Anne
.
<EOS>
"If
I
did
not
,
I
should
know
how
to
act
,
"
replied
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
Youremember
my
pledge?""Full
<EOS>
well
,
"
replied
Anne
;
"
and
if
love
and
duty
would
not
restrain
me
,
fear
would
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
felt
,
"
rejoined
the
king
;
"
but
there
are
some
of
your
sex
uponwhom
nothing
will
operate
as
a
warning
--
<EOS>
so
faithless
and
inconstant
arethey
by
nature
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
hinted
to
me
that
you
are
one
of
these
;
but
Icannot
think
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
never
believe
that
a
woman
for
whom
I
haveplaced
my
very
throne
in
jeopardy
--
for
whom
I
have
divorced
my
queen
-
whose
family
I
have
elevated
and
ennobled
--
and
whom
I
have
placedupon
the
throne
would
play
me
false
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
monstrous-
<EOS>
incredible!"It
is
--
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Anne
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
farewell
,
"
said
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
stayed
longer
than
I
intended
,
and
I
should
not
have
mentioned
these
accusations
,
which
I
regard
aswholly
groundless
,
unless
you
had
reproached
me
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
quitted
the
chamber
,
leaving
Anne
in
a
strange
state
ofperplexity
and
terror
.
<EOS>
V.
 
<EOS>
What
happened
at
the
Jousts
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
May
arrived
;
and
though
destined
to
set
in
darkness
anddespair
,
it
arose
in
sunshine
and
smiles
.
<EOS>
All
were
astir
at
an
early
hour
within
the
castle
,
and
preparations
weremade
for
the
approaching
show
.
 
<EOS>
Lists
were
erected
in
the
upperquadrangle
,
and
the
whole
of
the
vast
area
was
strewn
with
sand
.
 
<EOS>
Infront
of
the
royal
lodgings
was
raised
a
gallery
,
the
centre
of
which
,
being
set
apart
for
the
queen
and
her
dames
,
was
covered
with
cloth
ofgold
and
crimson
velvet
,
on
which
the
royal
arms
were
gorgeouslyemblazoned
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
wings
were
likewise
richly
decorated
,
andadorned
with
scutcheons
and
pennons
,
while
from
the
battlements
ofthe
eastern
side
of
the
court
were
hung
a
couple
of
long
flags
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
these
preparations
were
completed
,
a
throng
of
pages
,
esquires
,
armourers
,
archers
,
and
henchmen
,
entered
it
from
theNorman
gateway
,
and
took
up
positions
within
the
barriers
,
the
spacewithout
the
pales
being
kept
by
a
double
line
of
halberdiers
.
 
<EOS>
Next
camethe
trumpeters
,
mounted
on
richly
caparisoned
horses
,
and
having
theirclarions
decorated
with
silken
bandrols
,
fringed
with
gold
.
<EOS>
Stationingthemselves
at
the
principal
entrance
of
the
lists
,
they
were
speedilyjoined
by
the
heralds
,
pursuivants
,
and
other
officers
of
the
tilt
-
yard
.
<EOS>
Presently
afterwards
,
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
who
was
appointed
judge
ofthe
lists
,
appeared
,
and
rode
round
the
arena
to
see
that
all
was
inorder
.
 
<EOS>
Apparently
well
satisfied
with
the
survey
,
he
dismounted
,
andproceeded
to
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
crowd
within
the
court
was
increased
by
a
great
influxof
the
different
members
of
the
household
,
amongst
whom
wereShoreditch
,
Paddington
,
and
Hector
Cutbeard
.
<EOS>
"Marry
<EOS>
,
this
promises
to
be
a
splendid
sight
!
"
said
the
clerk
of
thekitchen
;
"
the
king
will
,
no
doubt
,
do
his
devoir
gallantly
for
the
sake
ofthe
bright
eyes
that
will
look
upon
him
.
<EOS>
""You
mean
the
queen
's
,
of
course
?
"
said
Shoreditch
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
mean
hers
who
may
be
queen
,
"
replied
Cutbeard
;
"
Mistress
JaneSeymour
.
""May
be
queen
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Shoreditch
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
surely
do
not
think
theking
will
divorce
his
present
consort?""Stranger
things
have
happened
,
"
replied
Cutbeard
significantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
Iam
not
greatly
out
of
my
reckoning
,
"
he
added
,
"
these
are
the
lastjousts
Queen
Anne
will
behold
.
<EOS>
""The
saints
forefend
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Shoreditch
;
"
what
reason
have
you
forthinking
so?""That
<EOS>
I
may
not
declare
,
"
replied
Cutbeard
;
"
<EOS>
but
before
the
jousts
areover
you
will
see
whether
I
have
been
rightly
informed
or
not
.
<EOS>
""Hush
!
"
exclaimed
Shoreditch
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
a
tall
monk
eyeing
us
<EOS>
strangely;and
<EOS>
I
am
not
certain
that
he
has
not
overheard
what
you
have
said
.
<EOS>
""He
is
welcome
to
the
intelligence
,
"
replied
Cutbeard
;
"
the
end
willprove
its
truth
.
<EOS>
"Though
<EOS>
this
was
uttered
in
a
confident
tone
,
he
nevertheless
glancedwith
some
misgiving
at
the
monk
,
who
stood
behind
Paddington
.
<EOS>
Theobject
of
the
investigation
was
a
very
tall
man
,
with
a
cowl
drawn
overhis
brow
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
ragged
black
beard
,
fierce
dark
eyes
,
and
acomplexion
like
bronze
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
Cutboard
's
glance
anxiously
fixed
uponhim
,
he
advanced
towards
him
,
and
said
in
a
low
tone
-"You
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
;
but
talk
not
so
loud
if
you
value
yourhead
.

""So
<EOS>
saying
he
proceeded
to
another
part
of
the
lists
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
is
that
tall
monk
?
"
asked
Paddington
.
<EOS>
"Devil
knows
!
"
<EOS>
answered
Cutbeard
;
"
I
never
saw
him
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
hasa
villainous

<EOS>
"Soon
afterwards
<EOS>
a
flourish
of
trumpets
was
heard
,
and
amid
theirjoyous
bruit
the
queen
,
sumptuously
arrayed
in
cloth
of
gold
andermine
,
and
having
a
small
crown
upon
her
brow
,
entered
the
gallery
,
and
took
her
seat
within
it
.
 
<EOS>
Never
had
she
looked
more
beautiful
thanon
this
fatal
morning
,
and
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
beholders
shecompletely
eclipsed
her
rival
,
Jane
Seymour
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
,
who
stood
onher
right
hard
,
and
was
exquisitely
attired
,
had
a
thoughtful
andanxious
air
,
as
if
some
grave
matter
weighed
upon
herWhile
the
queen
's
attendants
were
taking
their
places
,
Lord
Rochford
,
accompanied
by
Sir
Henry
Norris
and
the
Earls
of
Surrey
and
Essex
,
entered
the
lists
.
 
<EOS>
The
four
knights
were
completely
armed
,
andmounted
on
powerful
steeds
barded
with
rich
cloth
of
gold
,
embroidered
with
silver
letters
.
 
<EOS>
Each
had
a
great
crimson
plume
in
hishelmet
.
 
<EOS>
They
rode
singly
round
the
arena
,
and
bowed
as
they
passedthe
royal
gallery
,
Norris
bending
almost
to
his
saddle
-
bow
whileperforming
his
salutation
to
the
queen
.
<EOS>
The
field
being
thus
taken
by
the
challengers
,
who
retired
to
the
upperend
of
the
court
,
a
trumpet
was
thrice
sounded
by
a
herald
,
and
ananswer
was
immediately
made
by
another
herald
stationed
oppositeHenry
the
Seventh
's
buildings
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
clamour
ceased
,
the
king
fullyarmed
,
and
followed
by
the
Marquis
of
Dorset
,
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
,
and
theLord
Clifford
,
rode
into
the
lists
.
<EOS>
Henry
was
equipped
in
a
superb
suit
of
armour
,
inlaid
with
gold
,
andhaving
a
breastplate
of
the
globose
form
,
then
in
vogue
;
his
helmet
wasdecorated
with
a
large
snow
-
white
plume
.
 
<EOS>
The
trappings
of
his
steedwere
of
crimson
velvet
,
embroidered
with
the
royal
arms
,
and
edgedwith
great
letters
of
massive
gold
bullion
,
full
of
pearls
and
preciousstones
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
attended
by
a
hundred
gentlemen
,
armourers
,
andother
officers
,
arrayed
in
white
velvet
.
<EOS>
Having
ridden
round
the
court
like
the
others
,
and
addressed
hissalutation
exclusively
to
Jane
Seymour
,
Henry
took
his
station
with
hiscompanions
near
the
base
of
the
Round
Tower
,
the
summit
of
whichwas
covered
with
spectators
,
as
were
the
towers
and
battlementsaround
.
<EOS>
A
trumpet
was
now
sounded
,
and
the
king
and
the
Lord
Rochfordhaving
each
taken
a
lance
from
his
esquire
,
awaited
the
signal
to
startfrom
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
who
was
seated
in
the
left
wing
of
the
royalgallery
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
delayed
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
clarion
sounded
clearly
andloudly
for
the
third
time
,
he
called
out
that
the
champions
might
go
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
were
the
words
uttered
,
than
the
thundering
tramp
of
thesteeds
resounded
,
and
the
opponents
met
midway
.
 
<EOS>
Both
their
lanceswere
shivered
;
but
as
the
king
did
not
,
in
the
slightest
degree
,
changehis
position
,
he
was
held
to
have
the
best
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Courses
were
then
runby
the
others
,
with
varied
success
,
the
Marquis
of
Dorset
beingunhorsed
by
Sir
Henry
Norris
,
whose
prowess
was
rewarded
by
theplaudits
of
the
assemblage
,
and
what
was
infinitely
more
dear
to
him
,
by
the
smiles
of
the
queen
.
<EOS>
"You
have
ridden
well
,
Norris
,
"
cried
Henry
,
advancing
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"Place
<EOS>
yourself
opposite
me
,
and
let
us
splinter
a
lance
together
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Norris
reined
back
his
steed
,
in
compliance
with
the
injunction
,
thetall
monk
stepped
from
out
the
line
,
and
drawing
near
him
,
said
,
"
If
youwish
to
prove
victorious
,
aim
at
the
upper
part
of
the
king
's
helmet
.
<EOS>
"And
with
these
words
he
withdrew
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
Norris
had
placed
his
lance
in
the
rest
,
the
trumpetsounded
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
moment
the
word
was
given
,
and
the
championsstarted
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
rode
with
great
impetuosity
,
and
struck
Norris
in
thegorget
with
such
good
will
that
both
he
and
his
steed
were
shaken
.
<EOS>
But
Norris
was
more
fortunate
.
 
<EOS>
Following
the
advice
of
the
monk
,
hemade
the
upper
part
of
the
king
's
helmet
his
mark
,
and
the
blow
was
sowell
dealt
,
that
,
though
he
did
not
dislodge
the
royal
horseman
,
it
droveback
his
steed
on
its
haunches
.
<EOS>
The
success
was
so
unequivocal
that
Norris
was
at
once
declared
thevictor
by
the
judge
.
 
<EOS>
No
applause
,
however
,
followed
the
decision
,
froma
fear
of
giving
offence
to
the
king
.
<EOS>
Norris
dismounted
,
and
committing
his
steed
to
the
care
of
an
esquire
,
and
his
lance
to
a
page
,
took
off
his
helmet
and
advanced
towards
theroyal
gallery
,
near
which
the
Earl
of
Surrey
and
Sir
Thomas
Wyat
werestanding
talking
with
the
other
dames
.
 
<EOS>
As
Norris
drew
near
,
Anneleaned
over
the
edge
of
the
gallery
,
and
smiled
at
him
tenderly
,
and
,
whether
by
design
or
accident
,
let
fall
her
embroidered
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
Norris
stooped
to
pick
it
up
,
regarding
her
as
he
did
so
with
a
glance
ofthe
most
passionate
devotion
.
 
<EOS>
A
terrible
gaze
,
however
,
was
fixed
onthe
unfortunate
pair
at
that
moment
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
that
of
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
WhileHenry
was
careering
in
front
of
the
gallery
to
display
himself
beforeJane
Seymour
,
a
tall
monk
approached
him
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Look
at
<EOS>
SirHenry
Norris!"Thus
addressed
,
Henry
raised
his
beaver
,
that
he
might
see
moredistinctly
,
and
beheld
Norris
take
up
the
embroidered
handkerchief
,
which
he
recognised
as
one
that
he
had
given
,
in
the
early
days
of
hisaffection
,
to
the
queen
.
<EOS>
The
sight
stung
him
almost
to
madness
,
and
he
had
great
difficulty
inrepressing
his
choler
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
this
slight
action
,
heightened
toimportance
,
as
it
was
,
by
the
looks
of
the
parties
,
roused
his
ire
,
it
wasnothing
to
what
followed
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
restoring
it
to
the
queen
,
Norris
,
unconscious
of
the
danger
in
which
he
stood
,
pressed
the
handkerchieffervently
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"I
am
hitherto
the
victor
of
the
jousts
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
may
I
keep
this
as
theprize?"Anne
smiled
assent
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
proudest
I
ever
obtained
,
"
pursued
Norris
.
<EOS>
And
he
placed
itwithin
his
helmet
.
<EOS>
Does
your
majesty
see
that
?
"
cried
the
tall
monk
,
who
still
remainedstanding
near
the
king"Death
of
my
life
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Henry
,
"
it
is
the
very
handkerchief
I
gaveher
before
our
union
!
<EOS>
I
can
contain
myself
no
longer
,
and
must
perforceprecipitate
matters
.
 
<EOS>
What
ho
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
riding
up
to
that
part
of
thegallery
<EOS>
where
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
was
seated
-
"
let
the
jousts
bestopped!""Wherefore
,
my
dear
liege
?
"
said
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Earl
of
Surrey
and
<EOS>
SirThomas
Wyat
are
about
to
run
a
course
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
them
<EOS>
he
stopped
I
say
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Henry
,
in
a
tone
that
admitted
of
nodispute
.
 
<EOS>
And
wheeling
round
his
charger
,
he
dashed
into
the
middle
ofthe
barriers
,
shouting
in
loud
,
authoritative
accents
,
"
The
jousts
are
atan
end
!
<EOS>
Disperse!"The
<EOS>
utmost
consternation
was
occasioned
by
the
announcement
.
 
<EOS>
TheDuke
of
Suffolk
instantly
quitted
his
seat
,
and
pressed
through
thecrowd
to
the
king
,
who
whispered
a
few
hasty
words
in
his
ear
.
 
<EOS>
Henrythen
called
to
the
Earl
of
Surrey
,
the
Marquis
of
Dorset
,
the
LordClifford
,
Wyat
,
and
some
others
,
and
bidding
them
attend
him
,
preparedto
quit
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
passed
the
royal
gallery
,
Anne
called
to
him
<EOS>
inan
agonised
voice-
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Henry
!
<EOS>
what
is
the
matter?--what
have
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
done?"But
<EOS>
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
her
,
he
dashed
through
theNorman
Gate
,
galloped
down
the
lower
quadrangle
,
and
quitted
thecastle
.
<EOS>
The
confusion
that
ensued
may
be
imagined
.
 
<EOS>
All
saw
that
somethingextraordinary
and
terrible
had
taken
place
,
though
few
knew
preciselywhat
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Dismay
sat
in
every
countenance
,
and
the
general
anxietywas
heightened
by
the
agitation
of
the
queen
,
who
,
uttering
a
piercingscream
,
fell
back
,
and
was
borne
off
in
a
state
of
insensibility
by
herattendants
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
control
himself
at
the
sight
,
Norris
burst
through
the
guard
,
and
rushing
up
the
great
staircase
,
soon
gained
the
apartment
to
whichthe
queen
had
been
conveyed
.
 
<EOS>
Owing
to
the
timely
aid
afforded
her
,
she
was
speedily
restored
,
and
the
first
person
her
eyes
fell
upon
washer
lover
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
him
a
glance
of
affection
illumined
herfeatures
,
but
it
was
instantly
changed
into
an
expression
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
who
,
with
Bouchier
and
a
party
ofhalberdiers
,
had
entered
the
room
,
stepped
up
to
the
queen
,
and
said-"Will
<EOS>
it
please
you
,
madam
,
to
retire
to
an
inner
apartment

<EOS>
I
grieve

""Arrest

exclaimed
Anne
;
"
for
what
crime
,
your

charged
with

Suffolk
sternly

<EOS>
"But

cried
Anne
-

""Then

I
am

exclaimed
Anne
distractedly
.
<EOS>
Do
not

false
and
malignant
accusations
alarm

<EOS>
Norri
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

<EOS>
""Sir

"
said
the
duke
coldly
,
"
<EOS>
your
own
imprudence
hasbrought
about
this
sad
result

<EOS>
""I
feel
it
,
"
replied
Norris
;
"
and
I
deserve
the
worst
punishment
that
canbe
inflicted
upon

for

<EOS>
But
I
declare
to
you
as
I
will
declare
upon

if
I
am
placed
upon

--
that
the

wholly
innocent

<EOS>
Let

<EOS>
""You

Sir

says

"
cried
Anne
;
"
and
I
call
upon
you
torecollect
the
testimony

has
borne

<EOS>
""I
shall
not
fail
to

"
replied
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your

willhave
strict
justice

""Justice

"
echoed
Anne
,
with
a
laugh
of
bitter
incredulity
.
 
<EOS>
"
Justice
fromHenry
the
Eighth?""Beseech
you
,

not

said
Norris
,
prostratinghimself
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
Recollect
by

you
are
surrounded

<EOS>
My
follyand

""You

said
Anne
;
"
it
is

,
not

<EOS>
The

dealt

<EOS>
""Captain

said
the

addressing
that

stood
near

At

What
passed
between
Anne
Boleyn
and
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
and
howHerne
the
Hunter
appeared
to
her
in
the
Oratory
.
<EOS>
For
some
hours
Anne
Boleyn
's
attendants
were
alarmed
for
her
reason
,
and
there
seemed
good
grounds
for
the
apprehension
,
so
wildly
andincoherently
did
she
talk
,
and
so
violently
comport
herself
--
<EOS>
she
whowas
usually
so
gentle
now
weeping
as
if
her
soul
would
pass
away
intears
--
now
breaking
into
fearful
hysterical
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
piteoussight
,
and
deeply
moved
all
who
witnessed
it
.

But
towards
evening
shebecame
calmer
,
and
desired
to
be
left
by
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Her
wish
beingcomplied
with
,
she
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
besought
Heaven'sforgiveness
for
her
manifold
offences
.
"May

she
cried

"

a
shameful
death

what
worse
can
befall
me
?
<EOS>
Thineanguish
was
great
,
but
it
was
never
sharpened
by
remorse
like
mine
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
could
live
my
life
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
resist
all
the
dazzlingtemptations
I
have
yielded
to
--
above
all
,
I
would
not
injure
thee

<EOS>
Oh!that
I
had
resisted
Henry
's
love
--
his
false
vows
--
his
fatal
lures
!
<EOS>
But
it
isuseless
to
repine
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
acted
wrongfully
and
must
pay
the
penalty
ofmy
crime
.
 
<EOS>
May
my
tears
,
my
penitence
,
my

operate
as
anatonement

procure
me
pardon
from
the
merciful
Judge

<EOS>
I
shall
shortly
appear

"In
<EOS>
such
prayers

lamentations
<EOS>
she
passed
more
than
an
hour
,
whenher
attendants
entered
to
inform
her
that
the
Duke

Suffolk

theLords
Audley

Cromwell
were
without

desired
to
see
her

<EOS>
Sheimmediately
went
forth
to
them

<EOS>
"We
are
come
to
acquaint
you

said
Suffolk
,
that
you

beremoved
at

hour
tomorrow
morning

to
the
Tower

there
toabide
during

pleasure

<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
the
king
will
have
it
so
,
my
lords
<EOS>

"
she
replied
,
"
I
must
needs
go
;
butI
protest
my
innocence
,
and
will
protest
it
to
the
last

<EOS>
I
have
ever
beena
faithful
and
loyal
consort
to
his
highness
,
and
though
I
may
not
havedemeaned
myself
to
him
so
humbly
and
gratefully
as
I
ought
to
havedone
--
seeing
how
much
I
owe
him-
 
<EOS>
yet
I
have
lacked
nothing
inaffection
and
duty
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
jealous
fancies
and
suspicions
of
him
,
especially
of
late
,
and
have
troubled
him
with
them
;
but
I
pray
hisforgiveness
for
my
folly
,
which
proceeded
from
too
much
regard
,
and
if
Iam
acquitted
of
my
present
charge
,
I
will
offend
him
so
no
more

<EOS>
""We
will
report
what
you
say
to
the
king

"
rejoined
Suffolk
gravely
;
"
butwe
are
bound
to
add
that
his
highness
does
not
act
on
mere
suspicion

<EOS>
the
proofs

guilt
being
strong
against
you

with

she
cried
passionately

I

<EOS>
""Were

""Oh

prostrating
herself

him

this
Suffolk

remained

uponthe

all
at

raising

figure
near

<EOS>
Even
in

she
recognised
Herne

with

a
scream

How
Herne
appeared
to
Henry
In
the
Home
Park
.
<EOS>
On
that
same
night
,
at
a
late
hour
,
a
horseman
,
mounted
on
a
powerfulsteed
,
entered
the
eastern
side
of
the
home
park
,
and
stationed
himselfbeneath
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
there
long
,
when
the
castle
clocktolled
forth
the
hour
of
midnight
,
and
ere
the
deep
strokes
died
away
,
asecond
horseman
was
seen
galloping
across
the
moonlit
glade
towardshim
.
<EOS>
"Has
<EOS>
all
been
done
as
I
directed
,
Suffolk
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
,
as
thenewcomer
approached
him
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
has
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
queen
is
imprisoned
withinher
chamber
,
and
will
be
removed
,
at
early
dawn
,
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
""You
had
better
start
in
an
hour
from
this
time
,
"
said
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
along
passage
by
water
,
and
I
am
anxious
to
avoid
all
chance
of
attemptat
rescue
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
wishes
shall
be
obeyed
,
"
replied
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
her
griefwas
most
agonizing
,
and
I
had
much
ado
to
maintain
my
composure
.
<EOS>
She
implored
,
in
the
most
passionate
manner
,
to
be
allowed
to
see
yourhighness
before
her
removal
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
it
was
impossible
;
and
that
evenif
you
were
at
the
castle
,
you
would
not
listen
to
her
supplications
.
<EOS>
""You
did
right
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Henry
;
"
I
will
never
see
her
more
--
<EOS>
not
that
I
fearbeing
moved
by
her
prayers
,
but
that
,
.
 
<EOS>
knowing
how
deceitful
andfaithless
she
is
,
I
loathe
to
look
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
expressed
upon
thematter
by
the
household
?
<EOS>
Speak
frankly

<EOS>
""Frankly
<EOS>
then
,
"
replied
the
duke
,
"
your
highness
's
proceedings
areregarded
as
harsh
and
unjustifiable
.
 
<EOS>
The
general
opinion
is
,
that
youonly
desire
to
remove
Anne
to
make
way
for
Mistress
Jane
Seymour
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
they
talk
thus
,
do
they
?
"
cried
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
silence
their
saucyprating
ere
long
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
all
who
venture
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subjectthat
I
have
long
suspected
the
queen
of
a
secret
liking
for
Norris
,
butthat
I
determined
to
conceal
my
suspicions
till
I
found
I
had
goodwarrant
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
occurred
,
as
you
know
,
some
weeks
ago
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
awaited
a
pretext
for
proceeding
against
them
,
and
it
wasfurnished
by
their
own
imprudence
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Convinced
that
somethingwould
occur
,
I
had
made
my
preparations
;
nor
was
I
deceived

<EOS>
You
mayadd
,
also
,
that
not
until
my
marriage
is
invalidated
<EOS>
,
Anne

offspringillegitimatised

and
herself
beheaded
,
shall
I
consider
the
foul
blot
uponmy
name
removed

<EOS>
""Has
<EOS>
your
majesty
any
further
commands

said
Suffolk

<EOS>

I
saw
Norrisin
his
prison
before
I
rode
forth
to
you

""Let

Lord

I

the

Shall

powerful
steed
,
entered
the
eastern
side
of
the
home
 
park
,
and
stationed
himself
beneath
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
there
 
long
,
when
the
castle
clock
tolled
forth
the
hour
of
midnight
,
and
ere
 
<EOS>
the
deep
strokes
died
away
,
a
second
horseman
was
seen
galloping
 
across
the
moonlit
glade
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"Has
<EOS>
all
been
done
as
I
directed
,
Suffolk
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
,
as
thenewcomer
approached
him
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
has
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
queen
is
imprisoned
withinher
chamber
,
and
will
be
removed
,
at
early
dawn
,
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
""You
had
better
start
in
an
hour
from
this
time
,
"
said
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
along
passage
by
water
,
and
I
am
anxious
to
avoid
all
chance
of
attemptat
rescue
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
wishes
shall
be
obeyed
,
"
replied
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
soul
!
<EOS>
her
griefwas
most
agonizing
,
and
I
had
much
ado
to
maintain
my
composure
.
<EOS>
She
implored
,
in
the
most
passionate
manner
,
to
be
allowed
to
see
yourhighness
before
her
removal
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
her
it
was
impossible
;
and
that
evenif
you
were
at
the
castle
,
you
would
not
listen
to
her
supplications
.
<EOS>
""You
did
right
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Henry
;
"
I
will
never
see
her
more
--
<EOS>
not
that
I
fearbeing
moved
by
her
prayers
,
but
that
,
.
 
<EOS>
knowing
how
deceitful
andfaithless
she
is
,
I
loathe
to
look
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
expressed
upon
thematter
by
the
household
?
<EOS>
Speak
frankly
.
<EOS>
""Frankly
<EOS>
then
,
"
replied
the
duke
,
"
your
highness
's
proceedings
areregarded
as
harsh
and
unjustifiable
.
 
<EOS>
The
general
opinion
is
,
that
youonly
desire
to
remove
Anne
to
make
way
for
Mistress
Jane
Seymour
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
they
talk
thus
,
do
they
?
"
cried
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
silence
their
saucyprating
ere
long
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
all
who
venture
to
speak
to
you
on
the
subjectthat
I
have
long
suspected
the
queen
of
a
secret
liking
for
Norris
,
butthat
I
determined
to
conceal
my
suspicions
till
I
found
I
had
goodwarrant
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
occurred
,
as
you
know
,
some
weeks
ago
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
awaited
a
pretext
for
proceeding
against
them
,
and
it
wasfurnished
by
their
own
imprudence
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Convinced
that
somethingwould
occur
,
I
had
made
my
preparations
;
nor
was
I
deceived
.
 
<EOS>
You
mayadd
,
also
,
that
not
until
my
marriage
is
invalidated
<EOS>
,
Anne
's
offspringillegitimatised
,
and
herself
beheaded
,
shall
I
consider
the
foul
blot
uponmy
name
removed
.
<EOS>
""Has
<EOS>
your
majesty
any
further
commands
?
"
said
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
saw
Norrisin
his
prison
before
I
rode
forth
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
him
be
taken
to
the
Tower
,
under
a
strong
escort
,
at
once
,
"
saidHenry

<EOS>
"
Lord
Rochford
,
I
suppose
,
has
already
been
removed
there?""He
<EOS>
has

"
replied
the
duke

<EOS>
"
Shall
I
attend
your
majesty
to

needless

the

They

"So

wheeled
round
,
and
striking
spurs
into
his

dashedthrough
the
trees
,
while
the
duke
rode
back
to
the

<EOS>
Henry
had
not
proceeded
far
,
when
a
horseman
,
mounted
on
a
sablesteed

emerged
from
the
thicket

galloped
up
to
him

The

<EOS>
"Ah

cried
the

his

fear

What

thou?""You

Herne

Itold
you

<EOS>
""To

not

rejoined
the

<EOS>
"
AnneBoleyn

<EOS>
""Think

with
a

I

<EOS>
Anne
Boleyn
's
arraignment
took
place
in
the
great
hall
of
the
WhiteTower
,
on
the
16th
of
May
,
before
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
who
was
createdlord
high
steward
for
the
occasion
,
and
twenty
-
six
peers
.
<EOS>
The
duke
hadhis
seat
under
a
canopy
of
state
,
and
beneath
him
sat
the
Earl
of
Surreyas
deputy
earl
-
marshal
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
an
eloquent
and
impassioned
defence
,
Anne
wasfound
guilty
;
and
having
been
required
to
lay
aside
her
crown
and
theother
insignia
of
royalty
,
was
condemned
to
be
burned
or
beheaded
atthe
king
's
pleasure
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
,
she
was
summoned
to
the
archiepiscopal
palaceat
Lambeth
,
whither
she
was
privately
conveyed
;
and
her
marriage
<EOS>
withthe
king
was
declared
by
Cranmer
to
be
null
and
void
,
and
to
havealways
been
so
.
<EOS>
Death
by
the
axe
was
the
doom
awarded
to
her
by
theking
,
and
the
day
appointed
for
the
execution
was
Friday
the
19th
ofMay
,
at
the
hour
of
noon
.
<EOS>
Leaving
the
conduct
of
the
fatal
ceremony
to
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
whohad
orders
to
have
a
signal
gun
fired
from
the
summit
of
the
WhiteTower
,
which
was
to
be
answered
from
various
points
,
when
all
wasover
,
Henry
repaired
to
Windsor
Castle
on
the
evening
of
Thursday
.
<EOS>
Before
this
,
he
had
formally
offered
his
hand
to
Jane
Seymour
;
andwhile
the
unfortunate
queen
was
languishing
within
the
Tower
,
he
wasbasking
in
the
smiles
of
his
new
mistress
,
and
counting
the
hours
tillhe
.
<EOS>
could
make
her
his
own
.
<EOS>
On
the
Tuesday
before
the
execution
,
JaneSeymour
retired
to
her
father
's
mansion
,
Wolff
Hall
,
in
Wiltshire
,
wherepreparations
were
made
for
the
marriage
,
which
it
was
arranged
shouldtake
place
there
in
private
on
the
Saturday
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
castle
,
Henry
gave
out
that
he
should
hunt
on
thefollowing
morning
in
the
great
park
,
and
retired
to
his
closet
.
<EOS>
But
he
didnot
long
remain
there
,
and
putting
on
the
garb
of
a
yeoman
of
theguard
,
descended
by
the
narrow
flight
of
steps
<EOS>
(
already
mentioned
asoccupying
the
same
situation
as
the
existing
Hundred
Steps
)
to
thetown
,
and
proceeded
to
the
Garter
,
where
he
found
several
guestsassembled
,
discussing
the
affairs
of
the
day
,
and
Bryan
Bowntance'sstrong
ale
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Amongst
the
number
were
the
Duke
ofShoreditch
,
Paddington
,
Hector
Cutbeard
,
and
Kit
Coo
.
<EOS>
At
the
momentof
the
king
's
entrance
,
they
were
talking
of
the
approaching
execution
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
the
vanity
of
worldly
greatness
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Bryan
,
lifting
up
hishands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Only
seven
years
ago
,
last
Saint
George
's
Day
,
this
lovely
queenfirst
entered
the
castle
with
the
king
,
amid
pomp
and
splendour
andpower
,
and
with
a
long
life
--
apparently
--
of
happiness
before
her
.
<EOS>
Andnow
she
is
condemned
to
die
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
if
she
has
played
the
king
false
she
deserves
her
doom
,
"
repliedShoreditch
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
behead
my
own
wife
if
she
served
me
the
sametrick
--
that
is
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
right
to
say
'
if
you
could
,
'
"
rejoined
Paddington
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
beheadingof
a
wife
is
a
royal
privilege
,
and
can
not
be
enjoyed
by
a
subject
.
<EOS>
""Many
,
I
wonder
how
the
king
could
prefer
Mistress
Jane
Seymour
,
formy
part
!
"
said
Hector
Cutbeard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
my
thinking
she
is
not
to
becompared
with
Queen
Anne
.
"She
<EOS>
has
a
lovely
blue
eye
,
and
a
figure
as
straight
as
an
arrow,"returned
Shoreditch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
master
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
turning
to
theking
;
"
what
think
you
of
Mistress
Jane
<EOS>
Seymour?""That
<EOS>
she
is
passably
fair
,
friend
,
"
replied
Henry
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
how
as
compared
with
the
late
--
that
is
,
the
present
queen
,
for
,
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
she
has
yet
some
hours
to
live

"
rejoined
Shoreditch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
,
as
compared
with
her?""Why
,
I
think
Jane
Seymour
the
more
lovely
,
Undoubtedly
,
"
repliedHenry
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
may
be
prejudiced
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
in
the
least
,
friend
,
"
said
Cutbeard
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
but
partake
of
your
royalmaster

<EOS>
Jane

is
beautiful
,
no

and
so
was
AnneBoleyn

<EOS>
Marry

<EOS>
we
shall
see
many
fair
queens

<EOS>
The

has
good
taste

good

<EOS>
He
sets
his
subjects
arare
example

and
shows
them
how
to
get
rid
of
troublesome
wives

<EOS>
Weshall
all
divorce
or
hang
our
spouses
when
we

I
might
try

experiment

<EOS>
ha!""Well

here

<EOS>
cried
Shoreditch
,
"
and
wishing
him
asmany
wives
as
he
may
desire

<EOS>
What
say
you

friend

"
<EOS>
he
added
,
turningto
Henry
.
"
<EOS>
Will
you
not
drink
that
toast?"I"That
will
I
,
"
replied
Henry
;
"
but
I
fancy
the
king
will
be
content
for
thepresent
with
Mistress
Jane
Seymour
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
the
present
,
no
doubt
,
"
said
Hector
Cutbeard
;
"
but
the
time
willcome
--
and
ere
long
--
when
Jane
will
be
as
irksome
to
him
as
Anne

.
<EOS>
""Ah
,
<EOS>
God
's
death
,
knave
!
<EOS>
darest
thou
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Henry
furiously
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
I
have
said
nothing
treasonable
,
I
hope
?
"
rejoined
Cutbeard
,
turning
pale
;
"
I
only
wish
the
king
to
be
happy
in
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
And
as
heseems
to
delight
in
change
of
wives

I
pray
that
he
may
have
it

content

""A

replied
Henry
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
give
a
health

"
<EOS>
cried
a
tall
archer
,
whom
no
onehad
hitherto
noticed
,
rising
in
one
corner
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
It

"
<EOS>
cried
Hector
Cutbeard
.
<EOS>
"Seize
<EOS>
him
who
has
proposed
it
!
"
cried
the
king
,
rising
;
"
it
is
Herne
theHunter!""I
laugh
at
your
threats
here
as
elsewhere

Harry

"
cried
Herne
.
"
<EOS>
Weshall

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
flinging
the
horn
cup
in
the
face
of
the
man
nearest
him
,
he
sprangthrough
an
open
window
at
the
back
,
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Both
Cutbeard
and
Shoreditch
were
much
alarmed
lest
the
freedom
oftheir
expressions
should
be
taken
in
umbrage
by
the
king
;
but
hecalmed
their
fears
by
bestowing
a
good
humoured
buffet
on
the
cheekof
the
latter
of
them
,
and
quitting
the
hostel
,
returned
to
the
castle
bythe
same
way
he
had
left
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
he
rode
into
the
great
park
,
attended
by
a
numerous
train
.
<EOS>
His
demeanour
was
moody
and
stern
,
and
a
general
gloom
pervaded
the
company
.
<EOS>
Keeping
on
the
westernside
of
the
park
,
the
party
crossed
Cranbourne
chase
;
but
though
theyencountered
several
fine
herds
of
deer
,
the
king
gave
no
orders
touncouple
the
hounds
.
<EOS>
At
last
they
arrived
at
that
part
of
the
park
where
Sandpit
Gate
is
nowsituated
,
and
pursuing
a
path
bordered
by
noble
trees
,
a
fine
buck
wassuddenly
unharboured
,
upon
which
Henry
gave
orders
to
the
huntsmenand
others
to
follow
him
,
adding
that
he
.
<EOS>
himself
should
proceed
toSnow
Hill
,
where
they
would
find
him
an
hour
hence
.
<EOS>
All
understood
why
the
king
wished
to
be
alone
,
and
for
what
purposehe
was
about
to
repair
to
the
eminence
in
question
,
and
therefore
,
without
a
word
,
the
whole
company
started
off
in
the
chase
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
king
rode
slowly
through
the
woods
,
often
pausing
tolisten
to
the
distant
sounds
of
the
hunters
,
and
noticing
the
shadows
onthe
greensward
as
they
grew
shorter
,
and
proclaimed
the
approach
ofnoon
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
arrived
at
Snow
Hill
,
and
stationed
himself
beneaththe
trees
on
its
summit
.
<EOS>
From
this
point
a
magnificent
view
of
the
castle
,
towering
over
its
pompof
woods
,
now
covered
with
foliage
of
the
most
vivid
green
,
wascommanded
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
bright
and
beautiful
,
the
sky
cloudless
,
and
a
gentle
rain
had
fallen
over
night
,
which
had
tempered
the
air
andfreshened
the
leaves
and
the
greensward
.
<EOS>
The
birds
were
singingblithely
in
the
trees
,
and
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
crouched
a
herd
of
deer
.
<EOS>
All
was
genial
and
delightful
,
breathing
of
tenderness
and
peace
,
calculated
to
soften
the
most
obdurate
heart
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
not
without
its
effect
upon
Henry
;
but
a
fierce
tumultraged
within
his
breast
.
<EOS>
He
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
Round
Tower
,
whichwas
distinctly
visible
,
and
from
which
he
expected
the
signal
,
and
thentried
to
peer
into
the
far
horizon
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
discern
nothing
.
<EOS>
A
cloudpassed
over
the
sun
,
and
cast
a
momentary
gloom
over
the
smilinglandscape
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
Henry
's
fancy
was
so
powerfully
excited
,
that
he
fancied
he
could
behold
the
terrible
tragedy
enacting
at
the
.
<EOS>
Tower
.
<EOS>
"She
is
now
issuing
forth
into
the
green
in
front
of
Saint
Peter
's
Chapel,"said
Henry
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
her
as
distinctly
as
if
I
were
there
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
how
.
<EOS>
beautiful
she
looks
!
<EOS>
and
how
she
moves
all
hearts
to
pity
!
<EOS>
Suffolk
,
Richmond
,
Cromwell
,
and
the
Lord
Mayor
are
there
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
Shetakes
leave
of
her
weeping
attendants
<EOS>
--
she
mounts
the
steps
of
thescaffold
firmly
-
<EOS>
she
looks
round
,
and
addresses
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
Howsilent
they
are
,
and
how
clearly
and
musically
her
voice
sounds
!
<EOS>
Sheblesses
me.--I
hear
It!--I
feel
it
here
!
<EOS>
Now
she
disrobes
herself
,
andprepares
for
the
fatal
axe
.
<EOS>
It
is
wielded
by
the
skilful
executioner
ofCalais
,
and
he
is
now
feeling
its
edge
.
<EOS>
Now
she
takes
leave
of
herdames
,
and
bestows
a
parting
gift
on
each
.
<EOS>
Again
she
kneels
.
<EOS>
andprays
.
<EOS>
She
rises
.
<EOS>
The
fatal
moment
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Even
now
she
retains
hercourage--
<EOS>
she
approaches
the
block
,
and
places
her
head
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Theaxe
is
raised
--
ha!"The
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
a
flash
of
fire
from
the
battlementsof
the
Round
Tower
,
followed
by
a
volume
of
smoke
,
and
in
anothersecond
the
deep
boom
of
a
gun
was
heard
.
<EOS>
At
the
very
moment
that
the
flash
was
seen
,
a
wild
figure
,
mounted
on
acoal
-
black
steed
,
galloped
from
out
the
wood
,
and
dashed
towardsHenry
,
whose
horse
reared
and
plunged
as
he
passed
.
<EOS>
"There
spoke
the
knell
of
Anne
Boleyn
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Herne
,
regarding
Henrysternly
,
and
pointing
to
the
Round
Tower
.
<EOS>
"
The
bloody
deed
is
done
,
and
thou
