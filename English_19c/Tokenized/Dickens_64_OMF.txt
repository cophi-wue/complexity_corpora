ON
THE
LOOK
OUT
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
times
of
ours
,
though
concerning
the
exact
year
there
is
no
need
to
be
precise
,
a
boat
of
dirty
and
disreputable
appearance
,
with
two
figures
in
it
,
floated
on
the
Thames
,
between
Southwark
Bridge
which
is
of
iron
,
and
London
Bridge
which
is
of
stone
,
as
an
autumn
evening
was
closing
in
.
  
<EOS>
The
figures
in
this
boat
were
those
of
a
strong
man
with
ragged
grizzled
hair
and
a
sun
-
browned
face
,
and
a
dark
girl
of
nineteen
or
twenty
,
sufficiently
like
him
to
be
recognizable
as
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
girl
rowed
,
pulling
a
pair
of
sculls
very
easily
;
the
man
,
with
the
rudder
-
lines
slack
in
his
hands
,
and
his
hands
loose
in
his
waistband
,
kept
an
eager
look
out
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
net
,
hook
,
or
line
,
and
he
could
not
be
a
fisherman
;
his
boat
had
no
cushion
for
a
sitter
,
no
paint
,
no
inscription
,
no
appliance
beyond
a
rusty
boathook
and
a
coil
or
rope
,
and
he
could
not
be
a
waterman
;
his
boat
was
too
crazy
and
too
small
to
take
in
cargo
for
delivery
,
and
he
could
not
be
a
lighterman
or
river
-
carrier
;
there
was
no
clue
to
what
he
looked
for
,
but
he
looked
for
something
,
with
a
most
intent
and
searching
gaze
.
<EOS>
The
tide
,
which
had
turned
an
hour
before
,
was
running
down
,
and
his
eyes
watched
every
little
race
and
eddy
in
its
broad
sweep
,
as
the
boat
made
slight
head
-
way
against
it
,
or
drove
stern
foremost
before
it
,
according
as
he
directed
his
daughter
by
a
movement
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
She
watched
his
face
as
earnestly
as
he
watched
the
river
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
intensity
of
her
look
there
was
a
touch
of
dread
or
horror
.
  
<EOS>
Allied
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
rather
than
the
surface
,
by
reason
of
the
slime
and
ooze
with
which
it
was
covered
,
and
its
sodden
state
,
this
boat
and
the
two
figures
in
it
obviously
were
doing
something
that
they
often
did
,
and
were
seeking
what
they
often
sought
.
<EOS>
Half
savage
as
the
man
showed
,
with
no
covering
on
his
matted
head
,
with
his
brown
arms
bare
to
between
the
elbow
and
the
shoulder
,
with
the
loose
knot
of
a
looser
kerchief
lying
low
on
his
bare
breast
in
a
wilderness
of
beard
and
whisker
,
with
such
dress
as
he
wore
seeming
to
be
made
out
of
the
mud
that
begrimed
his
boat
,
still
there
was
business
-
like
usage
in
his
steady
gaze
.
<EOS>
So
with
every
lithe
action
of
the
girl
,
with
every
turn
of
her
wrist
,
perhaps
most
of
all
with
her
look
of
dread
or
horror
;
they
were
things
of
usage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
her
out
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Tide
runs
strong
here
.
<EOS>
Keep
her
well
afore
the
sweep
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Trusting
to
the
girl
's
skill
and
making
no
use
of
the
rudder
,
he
eyed
the
coming
tide
with
an
absorbed
attention
.
<EOS>
So
the
girl
eyed
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
it
happened
now
,
that
a
slant
of
light
from
the
setting
sun
glanced
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
and
,
touching
a
rotten
stain
there
which
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
outline
of
a
muffled
human
form
,
coloured
it
as
though
with
diluted
blood
.
<EOS>
This
caught
the
girl
's
eye
,
and
she
shivered
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
ails
you
?
"
said
the
man
,
immediately
aware
of
it
,
though
so
intent
on
the
advancing
waters
;
"
I
see
nothing
afloat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
red
light
was
gone
,
the
shudder
was
gone
,
and
his
gaze
,
which
had
come
back
to
the
boat
for
a
moment
,
travelled
away
again
.
<EOS>
Wheresoever
the
strong
tide
met
with
an
impediment
,
his
gaze
paused
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
At
every
mooring
-
chain
and
rope
,
at
every
stationary
boat
or
barge
that
split
the
current
into
a
broad
-
arrow
-
head
,
at
the
offsets
from
the
piers
of
Southwark
Bridge
,
at
the
paddles
of
the
river
steamboats
as
they
beat
the
filthy
water
,
at
the
floating
logs
of
timber
lashed
together
lying
off
certain
wharves
,
his
shining
eyes
darted
a
hungry
look
.
<EOS>
After
a
darkening
hour
or
so
,
suddenly
the
rudder
-
lines
tightened
in
his
hold
,
and
he
steered
hard
towards
the
Surrey
shore
.
  
<EOS>
Always
watching
his
face
,
the
girl
instantly
answered
to
the
action
in
her
sculling
;
presently
the
boat
swung
round
,
quivered
as
from
a
sudden
jerk
,
and
the
upper
half
of
the
man
was
stretched
out
over
the
stern
.
  
<EOS>
The
girl
pulled
the
hood
of
a
cloak
she
wore
,
over
her
head
and
over
her
face
,
and
,
looking
backward
so
that
the
front
folds
of
this
hood
were
turned
down
the
river
,
kept
the
boat
in
that
direction
going
before
the
tide
.
<EOS>
Until
now
,
the
boat
had
barely
held
her
own
,
and
had
hovered
about
one
spot
;
but
now
,
the
banks
changed
swiftly
,
and
the
deepening
shadows
and
the
kindling
lights
of
London
Bridge
were
passed
,
and
the
tiers
of
shipping
lay
on
either
hand
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
now
that
the
upper
half
of
the
man
came
back
into
the
boat
.
<EOS>
His
arms
were
wet
and
dirty
,
and
he
washed
them
over
the
side
.
<EOS>
In
his
right
hand
he
held
something
,
and
he
washed
that
in
the
river
too
.
<EOS>
It
was
money
.
<EOS>
He
chinked
it
once
,
and
he
blew
upon
it
once
,
and
he
spat
upon
it
once
,
---
"
for
luck
,
"
he
hoarsely
said
---
before
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
turned
her
face
towards
him
with
a
start
,
and
rowed
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
very
pale
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
hook
-
nosed
man
,
and
with
that
and
his
bright
eyes
and
his
ruffled
head
,
bore
a
certain
likeness
to
a
roused
bird
of
prey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
that
thing
off
your
face
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
put
it
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
!
<EOS>
and
give
me
hold
of
the
sculls
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
the
rest
of
the
spell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
no
,
father
!
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
indeed
.
<EOS>
Father
!
<EOS>
---
I
can
not
sit
so
near
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
moving
towards
her
to
change
places
but
her
terrified
expostulation
stopped
him
and
he
resumed
his
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
hurt
can
it
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
,
none
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
bear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
belief
<EOS>
you
hate
the
sight
of
the
very
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
do
not
like
it
,
father
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
if
it
was
n't
your
living
!
<EOS>
As
if
it
was
n't
meat
and
drink
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
these
latter
words
the
girl
shivered
again
,
and
for
a
moment
paused
in
her
rowing
,
seeming
to
turn
deadly
faint
.
<EOS>
It
escaped
his
attention
,
for
he
was
glancing
over
the
stern
at
something
the
boat
had
in
tow
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
be
so
thankless
to
your
best
friend
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
The
very
fire
that
warmed
you
when
you
were
a
babby
,
was
picked
out
of
the
river
alongside
the
coal
barges
.
<EOS>
The
very
basket
that
you
slept
in
,
the
tide
washed
ashore
.
<EOS>
The
very
rockers
that
I
put
it
upon
to
make
a
cradle
of
it
,
I
cut
out
of
a
piece
of
wood
that
drifted
from
some
ship
or
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
took
her
right
hand
from
the
scull
it
held
,
and
touched
her
lips
with
it
,
and
for
a
moment
held
it
out
lovingly
towards
him
;
 
then
,
without
speaking
,
she
resumed
her
rowing
,
as
another
boat
of
similar
appearance
,
though
in
rather
better
trim
,
came
out
from
a
dark
place
and
dropped
softly
alongside
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
luck
again
,
Gaffer
?
<EOS>
"
said
a
man
with
a
squinting
leer
,
who
sculled
her
and
who
was
alone
.
<EOS>
"
I
know'd
<EOS>
you
was
in
luck
again
,
by
your
wake
as
you
come
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
replied
the
other
,
drily
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
're
out
,
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
pardner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
now
a
tender
yellow
moonlight
on
the
river
,
and
the
new
comer
,
keeping
half
his
boat
's
length
astern
of
the
other
boat
,
looked
hard
at
its
track
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
says
to
myself
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
<EOS>
directly
you
hove
in
view
,
Yonder
's
Gaffer
,
and
in
luck
again
,
by
George
if
he
ai
n't
!
<EOS>
Scull
it
is
,
pardner
---
<EOS>
do
n't
fret
yourself
---
<EOS>
I
did
n't
touch
him
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
in
answer
to
a
quick
impatient
movement
on
the
part
of
Gaffer
:
the
speaker
at
the
same
time
unshipping
his
scull
on
that
side
,
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
gunwale
of
Gaffer
's
boat
and
holding
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
had
touches
enough
not
to
want
no
more
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
I
make
him
out
,
Gaffer
!
<EOS>
Been
a
knocking
about
with
a
pretty
many
tides
,
ai
n't
he
pardner
?
<EOS>
Such
is
my
out
-
of
-
luck
ways
,
you
see
!
<EOS>
He
must
have
passed
me
when
he
went
up
last
time
,
for
I
was
on
the
lookout
below
bridge
here
.
<EOS>
I
a'most
think
you
're
like
the
wulturs
,
pardner
,
and
scent
'em
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
a
dropped
voice
,
and
with
more
than
one
glance
at
Lizzie
who
had
pulled
on
her
hood
again
.
<EOS>
Both
men
then
looked
with
a
weird
unholy
interest
at
the
wake
of
Gaffer
's
boat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Easy
does
it
,
betwixt
us
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
take
him
aboard
,
pardner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
other
.
<EOS>
In
so
surly
a
tone
that
the
man
,
after
a
blank
stare
,
acknowledged
it
with
the
retort
:
  
"
---
Arn't
been
eating
nothing
as
has
disagreed
with
you
,
have
you
,
pardner
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
I
have
,
"
said
Gaffer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
swallowing
too
much
of
that
word
,
Pardner
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
pardner
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Since
when
was
you
no
pardner
of
mine
,
Gaffer
Hexam
Esquire
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Since
you
was
accused
of
robbing
a
man
.
<EOS>
Accused
of
robbing
a
live
man
!
"
said
Gaffer
,
with
great
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
if
I
had
been
accused
of
robbing
a
dead
man
,
Gaffer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
   
COULDN'T
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
you
,
Gaffer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
Has
a
dead
man
any
use
for
money
?
<EOS>
Is
it
possible
for
a
dead
man
to
have
money
?
<EOS>
What
world
does
a
dead
man
belong
to
?
"
<EOS>
Tother
world
.
<EOS>
What
world
does
money
belong
to
?
<EOS>
This
world
.
<EOS>
How
can
money
be
a
corpse
's
?
<EOS>
Can
a
corpse
own
it
,
want
it
,
spend
it
,
claim
it
,
miss
it
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
try
to
go
confounding
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
things
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
worthy
of
the
sneaking
spirit
that
robs
a
live
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
---
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
you
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
You
've
got
off
with
a
short
time
of
it
for
putting
your
hand
in
the
pocket
of
a
sailor
,
a
live
sailor
.
<EOS>
Make
the
most
of
it
and
think
yourself
lucky
,
but
do
n't
think
after
that
to
come
over
me
with
your
pardners
.
<EOS>
We
have
worked
together
in
time
past
,
but
we
work
together
no
more
in
time
present
nor
yet
future
.
<EOS>
Let
go
.
<EOS>
Cast
off
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gaffer
!
<EOS>
If
you
think
to
get
rid
of
me
this
way

<EOS>
"
  
"
If
I
do
n't
get
rid
of
you
this
way
,
I
'll
try
another
,
and
chop
you
over
the
fingers
with
the
stretcher
,
or
take
a
pick
at
your
head
with
the
boat
-
hook
.
<EOS>
Cast
off
!
<EOS>
Pull
you
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Pull
home
,
since
you
wo
n't
let
your
father
pull
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
shot
ahead
,
and
the
other
boat
fell
astern
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
's
father
,
composing
himself
into
the
easy
attitude
of
one
who
had
asserted
the
high
moralities
and
taken
an
unassailable
position
,
slowly
lighted
a
pipe
,
and
smoked
,
and
took
a
survey
of
what
he
had
in
tow
.
<EOS>
What
he
had
in
tow
,
lunged
itself
at
him
sometimes
in
an
awful
manner
when
the
boat
was
checked
,
and
sometimes
seemed
to
try
to
wrench
itself
away
,
though
for
the
most
part
it
followed
submissively
.
<EOS>
A
neophyte
might
have
fancied
that
the
ripples
passing
over
it
were
dreadfully
like
faint
changes
of
expression
on
a
sightless
face
;
but
Gaffer
was
no
neophyte
and
had
no
fancies
.

THE
MAN
FROM
SOMEWHERE

<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Veneering
were

<EOS>
Everything
about
the
Veneerings
was
spick
and
span
new
.
<EOS>
All
their
furniture
was
new
,
all
their
friends
were
new
,
all
their
servants
were
new
,
their
plate
was
new
,
their
carriage
was
new

their
harness
was
new
,
their
horses
were
new
,
their
pictures
were
new
,
they
themselves
were
new
,
they
were
as
newly
married
as
was
lawfully
compatible
with
their
having
a
bran

new

,
and
if
they
had
set
up
a
great

,
he
would
have
come
home
in
matting
from
the
Pantechnicon
,
without
a

upon
him
,
French
polished
to
the
crown
of
his

<EOS>
For

in
the
Veneering
establishment
,
from
the
hall
-
chairs
with
the
new
coat
of
arms
,
to
the
grand
pianoforte
with
the
new
action
,
and
upstairs
again
to
the
new
fire
-
escape
,
all
things
were
in
a
state
of
high
varnish
and
polish
.
<EOS>
And
what
was
observable
in
the
furniture
,
was
observable
in
the
Veneerings
---
the
surface
smelt
a
little
too
much
of
the
workshop
and
was
a
trifle
stickey
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
innocent
piece
of
dinner
-
furniture
that
went
upon
easy
castors
and
was
kept
over
a
livery
stable
-
yard
in
Duke
Street
,
Saint
James
's
,
when
not
in
use
,
to
whom
the
Veneerings
were
a
source
of
blind
confusion
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
this
article
was
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
Being
first
cousin
to
Lord
Snigsworth
,
he
was
in
frequent
requisition
,
and
at
many
houses
might
be
said
to
represent
the
dining
-
table
in
its
normal
state
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Veneering
,
for
example
,
arranging
a
dinner
,
habitually
started
with
Twemlow
,
and
then
put
leaves
in
him
,
or
added
guests
to
him
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
the
table
consisted
of
Twemlow
and
half
a
dozen
leaves
;
sometimes
,
of
Twemlow
and
a
dozen
leaves
;
sometimes
,
Twemlow
was
pulled
out
to
his
utmost
extent
of
twenty
leaves
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Veneering
on
occasions
of
ceremony
faced
each
other
in
the
centre
of
the
board
,
and
thus
the
parallel
still
held
;
for
,
it
always
happened
that
the
more
Twemlow
was
pulled
out
,
the
further
he
found
himself
from
the
centre
,
and
the
nearer
to
the
sideboard
at
one
end
of
the
room
,
or
the
window
-
curtains
at
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
it
was
not
this
which
steeped
the
feeble
soul
of
Twemlow
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
This
he
was
used
to
,
and
could
take
soundings
of
.
<EOS>
The
abyss
to
which
he
could
find
no
bottom
,
and
from
which
started
forth
the
engrossing
and
ever
-
swelling
difficulty
of
his
life
,
was
the
insoluble
question
whether
he
was
Veneering
's
oldest
friend
,
or
newest
friend
.
<EOS>
To
the
excogitation
of
this
problem
,
the
harmless
gentleman
had
devoted
many
anxious
hours
,
both
in
his
lodgings
over
the
livery
stable
-
yard
,
and
in
the
cold
gloom
,
favourable
to
meditation
,
of
Saint
James
's
Square
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
Twemlow
had
first
known
Veneering
at
his
club
,
where
Veneering
then
knew
nobody
but
the
man
who
made
them
known
to
one
another
,
who
seemed
to
be
the
most
intimate
friend
he
had
in
the
world
,
and
whom
he
had
known
two
days
---
the
bond
of
union
between
their
souls
,
the
nefarious
conduct
of
the
committee
respecting
the
cookery
of
a
fillet
of
veal
,
having
been
accidently
cemented
at
that
date
.
<EOS>
Immediately
upon
this
,
Twemlow
received
an
invitation
to
dine
with
Veneering
,
and
dined
:
the
man
being
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Immediately
upon
that
,
Twemlow
received
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
man
,
and
dined
:
<EOS>
Veneering
being
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
At
the
man
's
were
a
Member
,
an
Engineer
,
a
Payer
-
off
of
the
National
Debt
,
a
Poem
on
Shakespeare
,
a
Grievance
,
and
a
Public
Office
,
who
all
seemed
to
be
utter
strangers
to
Veneering
.
<EOS>
And
yet
immediately
after
that
,
Twemlow
received
an
invitation
to
dine
at
Veneerings
,
expressly
to
meet
the
Member
,
the
Engineer
,
the
Payer
-
off
of
the
National
Debt
,
the
Poem
on
Shakespeare
,
the
Grievance
,
and
the
Public
Office
,
and
,
dining
,
discovered
that
all
of
them
were
the
most
intimate
friends
Veneering
had
in
the
world
,
and
that
the
wives
of
all
of
them
(
who
were
all
there
)
were
the
objects
of
Mrs.
Veneering
's
most
devoted
affection
and
tender
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
it
had
come
about
,
that
Mr.
Twemlow
had
said
to
himself
in
his
lodgings
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
:
"
I
must
not
think
of
this
.
<EOS>
This
is
enough
to
soften
any
man
's
brain
.
"
<EOS>
---
and
yet
was
always
thinking
of
it
,
and
could
never
form
a
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
This
evening
the
Veneerings
give
a
banquet
.
<EOS>
Eleven
leaves
in
the
Twemlow
;
fourteen
in
company
all
told
.
<EOS>
Four
pigeon
-
breasted
retainers
in
plain
clothes
stand
in
line
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
A
fifth
retainer
,
proceeding
up
the
staircase
with
a
mournful
air
---
as
who
should
say
,
"
Here
is
another
wretched
creature
come
to
dinner
;
such
is
life
!
"
<EOS>
---
  
announces
,
"
Mits
-
ter
Twemlow

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
welcomes
her
sweet
Mr.
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Veneering
welcomes
his
dear
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
does
not
expect
that
Mr.
Twemlow
can
in
nature
care
much
for
such
insipid
things
as
babies
,
but
so
old
a
friend
must
please
to
look
at
baby
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
You
will
know
the
friend
of
your
family
better
,
Tootleums
,
"
says
Mr.
Veneering
,
nodding
emotionally
at
that
new
article
,
"
when
you
begin
to
take
notice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
then
begs
to
make
his
dear
Twemlow
known
to
his
two
friends
,
Mr.
Boots
and
Mr.
Brewer
---
and
clearly
has
no
distinct
idea
which
is
which
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
a
fearful
circumstance
occurs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mis
-
ter
and
Mis
-
sis
Podsnap
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
says
Mr.
Veneering
to
Mrs.
Veneering
,
with
an
air
of
much
friendly
interest
,
while
the
door
stands
open
,
"
the
Podsnaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
too
,
too
smiling
large
man
,
with
a
fatal
freshness
on
him
,
appearing
with
his
wife
,
instantly
deserts
his
wife
and
darts
at
Twemlow
with
:
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
So
glad
to
know
you
.
<EOS>
Charming
house
you
have
here
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
are
not
late
.
<EOS>
So
glad
of
this
opportunity
,
I
am
sure
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
first
shock
fell
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Twemlow
twice
skipped
back
in
his
neat
little
shoes
and
his
little
silk
stockings
of
a
bygone
fashion
,
as
if
impelled
to
leap
over
a
sofa
behind
him
;
but
the
large
man
closed
with
him
and
proved
too
strong
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
,
"
says
the
large
man
,
trying
to
attract
the
attention
of
his
wife
in
the
distance
,
"
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
Mrs.
Podsnap
to
her
host
.
<EOS>
She
will
be
,
"
in
his
fatal
freshness
he
seems
to
find
perpetual
verdure
and
eternal
youth
in
the
phrase
,
"
she
will
be
so
glad
of
the
opportunity
,
I
am
sure
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Mrs.
Podsnap
,
unable
to
originate
a
mistake
on
her
own
account
,
because
Mrs.
Veneering
is
the
only
other
lady
there
,
does
her
best
in
the
way
of
handsomely
supporting
her
husband
's
,
by
looking
towards
Mr.
Twemlow
with
a
plaintive
countenance
and
remarking
to
Mrs.
Veneering
in
a
feeling
manner
,
firstly
,
that
she
fears
he
has
been
rather
bilious
of
late
,
and
,
secondly
,
that
the
baby
is
already
very
like
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
questionable
whether
any
man
quite
relishes
being
mistaken
for
any
other
man
;
but
,
Mr.
Veneering
having
this
very
evening
set
up
the
shirt
-
front
of
the
young
Antinous
(
in
new
worked
cambric
just
come
home
)
,
is
not
at
all
complimented
by
being
supposed
to
be
Twemlow
,
who
is
dry
and
weazen
and
some
thirty
years
older
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
equally
resents
the
imputation
of
being
the
wife
of
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
As
to
Twemlow
,
he
is
so
sensible
of
being
a
much
better
bred
man
than
Veneering
,
that
he
considers
the
large
man
an
offensive
ass
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
complicated
dilemma
,
Mr.
Veneering
approaches
the
large
man
with
extended
hand
and
,
smilingly
assures
that
incorrigible
personage
that
he
is
delighted
to
see
him
:
who
in
his
fatal
freshness
instantly
replies
:
  
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
to
say
that
I
can
not
at
this
moment
recall
where
we
met
,
but
I
am
so
glad
of
this
opportunity
,
I
am
sure
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
pouncing
upon
Twemlow
,
who
holds
back
with
all
his
feeble
might
,
he
is
haling
him
off
to
present
him
,
as
Veneering
,
to
Mrs.
Podsnap
,
when
the
arrival
of
more
guests
unravels
the
mistake
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
having
re
-
shaken
hands
with
Veneering
as
Veneering
,
he
re
-
shakes
hands
with
Twemlow
as
Twemlow
,
and
winds
it
all
up
to
his
own
perfect
satisfaction
by
saying
to
the
last
-
named
,
"
Ridiculous
opportunity
---
but
so
glad
of
it
,
I
am
sure
!
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Twemlow
having
undergone
this
terrific
experience
,
having
likewise
noted
the
fusion
of
Boots
in
Brewer
and
Brewer
in
Boots
,
and
having
further
observed
that
of
the
remaining
seven
guests
four
discreet
characters
enter
with
wandering
eyes
and
wholly
decline
to
commit
themselves
as
to
which
is
Veneering
,
until
Veneering
has
them
in
his
grasp
;
---
Twemlow
having
profited
by
these
studies
,
finds
his
brain
wholesomely
hardening
as
he
approaches
the
conclusion
that
he
really
is
Veneering
's
oldest
friend
,
when
his
brain
softens
again
and
all
is
lost
,
through
his
eyes
encountering
Veneering
and
the
large
man
linked
together
as
twin
brothers
in
the
back
drawing
-
room
near
the
conservatory
door
,
and
through
his
ears
informing
him
in
the
tones
of
Mrs.
Veneering
that
the
same
large
man
is
to
be
baby
's
godfather
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dinner
is
on
the
table
!
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
the
melancholy
retainer
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
Come
down
and
be
poisoned
,
ye
unhappy
children
of
men
!
"
  
<EOS>
Twemlow
,
having
no
lady
assigned
him
,
goes
down
in
the
rear
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
Boots
and
Brewer
,
thinking
him
indisposed
,
whisper
,
"
<EOS>
Man
faint
.
<EOS>
Had
no
lunch
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
is
only
stunned
by
the
unvanquishable
difficulty
of
his
existence
.
  
<EOS>
Revived
by
soup
,
Twemlow
discourses
mildly
of
the
Court
Circular
with
Boots
and
Brewer
.
<EOS>
Is
appealed
to
,
at
the
fish
stage
of
the
banquet
,
by
Veneering
,
on
the
disputed
question
whether
his
cousin
Lord
Snigsworth
is
in
or
out
of
town
?
<EOS>
Gives
it
that
his
cousin
is
out
of
town
.
"
<EOS>
At
Snigsworthy
Park
?
"
Veneering
inquires
.
"
At
Snigsworthy
,
"
Twemlow
rejoins
.
<EOS>
Boots
and
Brewer
regard
this
as
a
man
to
be
cultivated
;
and
Veneering
is
clear
that
he
is
a
remunerative
article
.
<EOS>
Meantime
the
retainer
goes
round
,
like
a
gloomy
Analytical
Chemist
:
always
seeming
to
say
,
after
"
Chablis
,
sir
?
"
  
---
"
You
would
n't
if
you
knew
what
it
's
made
of

"
  
<EOS>
The
great
looking

glass
above
the
sideboard
,
reflects
the
table
and
the
company
.
<EOS>
Reflects
the
new
Veneering
crest
,
in
gold
and
eke
in
silver
,
frosted
and
also
thawed
,
a
camel
of
all
work

<EOS>
The
Heralds
'
College
found
out
a
Crusading
ancestor
for
Veneering
who
bore
a
camel
on
his
shield
(
or
might
have
done
it
if
he
had
thought
of
it

,
and
a

of

take

Reflects
a

Mortimer

another
of
Veneering
's
oldest
friends
;
who
never
was
in
the
house
before
,
and
appears
not
to
want
to
come
again
,
who
sits
disconsolate
on
Mrs.
Veneering
's
left
,
and
who
was
inveigled
by
Lady
Tippins
(
a
friend
of
his
boyhood
)
to
come
to
these
people
's
and
talk
,
and
who
wo
n't
talk

<EOS>
Reflects
Eugene
,
friend
of
Mortimer
;
<EOS>
buried
alive
in
the
back
of
his
chair
,
behind
a
shoulder
---
with
a
powder
-
epaulette
on
it
---
of
the
mature
young
lady
,
and
gloomily
resorting
to
the
champagne
chalice
whenever
proffered
by
the
Analytical
Chemist
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
the
looking
-
glass
reflects
Boots
and
Brewer
,
and
two
other
stuffed
Buffers
interposed
between
the
rest
of
the
company
and
possible
accidents
.
  
<EOS>
The
Veneering
dinner
are
excellent
dinners
---
or
now
people
would
n't
come
---
and
all
goes
well
.
<EOS>
Notably
,
Lady
Tippins
has
made
a
series
of
experiments
on
her
digestive
functions
,
so
extremely
complicated
and
daring
,
that
if
they
could
be
published
with
their
results
it
might
benefit
the
human
race
.
<EOS>
Having
taken
in
provisions
from
all
parts
of
the
world
,
this
hardy
old
cruiser
has
last
touched
at
the
North
Pole
,
when
,
as
the
ice
-
plates
are
being
removed
,
the
following
words
fall
from
her
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
Veneering
---
"
  
(
Poor
Twemlow
's
hand
approaches
his
forehead
,
for
it
would
seem
now
,
that
Lady
Tippins
is
going
to
be
the
oldest
friend
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
Veneering
,
that
it
is
the
oddest
affair
!
<EOS>
Like
the
advertising
people
,
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
trust
me
,
without
offering
a
respectable
reference
.
<EOS>
Mortimer
there
,
is
my
reference
,
and
knows
all
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
raises
his
drooping
eyelids
,
and
slightly
opens
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
But
a
faint
smile
,
expressive
of
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
use
!
"
<EOS>
passes
over
his
face
,
and
he
drops
his
eyelids
and
shuts
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mortimer
,
"
says
Lady
Tippins
,
rapping
the
sticks
of
her
closed
green
fan
upon
the
knuckles
of
her
left
hand
---
which
is
particularly
rich
in
knuckles
,

I
insist
upon
your
telling
all

Give
you
my

Engene
strikes
in
:
so
unexpectedly
that
the
mature
young
lady
,
who
has
forgotten
all
about
him
,
with
a
start
takes
the
epaulette
out
of
his
way
:
"
except
our
friend
who
long
lived
on
rice
-
pudding
and
isinglass
,
till
at
length
to
his
something
or
other
,
his
physician
said
something
else
,
and
a
leg
of
mutton
somehow
ended
in
daygo
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
reviving
impression
goes
round
the
table
that
Eugene
is
coming
out
.
<EOS>
An
unfulfilled
impression
,
for
he
goes
in
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Veneering
,
"
quoth
Lady
Tippins
,
"
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
you
whether
this
is
not
the
basest
conduct
ever
known
in
this
world
?
<EOS>
I
carry
my
lovers
about
,
two
or
three
at
a
time
,
on
condition
that
they
are
very
obedient
and
devoted
;
and
here
is
my
old
lover
-
in
-
chief
,
the
head
of
all
my
slaves
,
throwing
off
his
allegiance
before
company
!
<EOS>
And
here
is
another
of
my
lovers
,
a
rough
Cymon
at
present
certainly
,
but
of
whom
I
had
most
hopeful
expectations
as
to
his
turning
out
well
in
course
of
time
,
pretending
that
he
ca
n't
remember
his
nursery
rhymes
!
<EOS>
On
purpose
to
annoy
me
,
for
he
knows
how
I
doat
upon
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
grisly
little
fiction
concerning
her
lovers
is
Lady
Tippins
's
point
.
<EOS>
She
is
always
attended
by
a
lover
or
two
,
and
she
keeps
a
little
list
of
her
lovers
,
and
she
is
always
booking
a
new
lover
,
or
striking
out
an
old
lover
,
or
putting
a
lover
in
her
black
list
,
or
promoting
a
lover
to
her
blue
list
,
or
adding
up
her
lovers
,
or
otherwise
posting
her
book
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
is
charmed
by
the
humour
,
and
so
is
Veneering
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
is
enhanced
by
a
certain
yellow
play
in
Lady
Tippins
's
throat
,
like
the
legs
of
scratching
poultry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
banish
the
false
wretch
from
this
moment
,
and
I
strike
him
out
of
my
Cupidon
(
my
name
for
my
Ledger
,
my
dear
,
)
<EOS>
this
very
night
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
resolved
to
have
the
account
of
the
man
from
Somewhere
.
<EOS>
and
I
beg
you
to
elicit
it
for
me
,
my
love
,
"
to
Mrs.
Veneering
,
"
as
I
have
lost
my
own
influence
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
perjured
man
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
to
Mortimer
,
with
a
rattle
of
her
fan
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
very
much
interested
in
the
man
from
Somewhere
,
"
 
Veneering
observes
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
four
Buffers
,
taking
heart
of
grace
all
four
at
once
,
say
:
  
"
Deeply
interested
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
excited
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dramatic
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Man
from
Nowhere
,
perhaps
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
Mrs.
Veneering
---
for
Lady
Tippins
's
winning
wiles
are
contagious
<EOS>
---
folds
her
hands
in
the
manner
of
a
supplicating
child
,
turns
to
her
left
neighbour
,
and
says
,
"
Tease
!
<EOS>
Pay
!
<EOS>
Man
from
Tumwhere
!
"
<EOS>
At
which
the
four
Buffers
,
again
mysteriously
moved
all
four
at
once
,
exclaim
,
"
You
ca
n't
resist
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
,
"
says
Mortimer
languidly
,
"
I
find
it
immensely
embarrasssing
to
have
the
eyes
of
Europe
upon
me
to
this
extent
,
and
my
only
consolation
is
that
you
will
all
of
you
execrate
Lady
Tippins
in
your
secret
hearts
when
you
find
,
as
you
inevitably
will
,
the
man
from
Somewhere
a
bore
.
<EOS>
Sorry
to
destroy
romance
by
fixing
him
with
a
local
habitation
,
but
he
comes
from
the
place
,
the
name
of
which
escapes
me
,
but
will
suggest
itself
to
everybody
else
here
,
where
they
make
the
wine

"
  
<EOS>
Eugene
suggests
"
Day
and
Martin
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
that
place
,
"
returns
the
unmoved
Mortimer
,
"
that
's
where
they
make
the
Port
.
<EOS>
My
man
comes
from
the
country
where
they
make
the
Cape
Wine
.
<EOS>
But
look
here
,
old
fellow
;
it
's
not
at
all
statistical
and
it
's
rather
odd
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
always
noticeable
at
the
table
of
the
Veneerings
,
that
no
man
troubles
himself
much
about
the
Veneerings
themselves
,
and
that
any
one
who
has
anything
to
tell
,
generally
tells
it
to
anybody
else
in
preference
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
man
,
"
Mortimer
goes
on
,
addressing
Eugene
,
"
whose
name
is
Harmon
,
was
only
son
of
a
tremendous
old
rascal
who
made
his
money
by
Dust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Red
velveteens
and
a
bell
?
"
<EOS>
the
gloomy
Eugene
inquires
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
a
ladder
and
basket
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
By
which
means
,
or
by
others
,
he
grew
rich
as
a
Dust
Contractor
,
and
lived
in
a
hollow
in
a
hilly
country
entirely
composed
of
Dust
.
<EOS>
On
his
own
small
estate
the
growling
old
vagabond
threw
up
his
own
mountain
range
,
like
an
old
volcano
,
and
its
geological
formation
was
Dust
.
<EOS>
Coal
-
dust
,
vegetable
-
dust
,
bone
-
dust
,
crockery
dust
,
rough
dust
and
sifted
dust
,
 
---
all
manner
of
Dust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
passing
remembrance
of
Mrs.
Veneering
,
here
induces
Mortimer
to
address
his
next
half
-
dozen
words
to
her
;
after
which
he
wanders
away
again
,
tries
Twemlow
and
finds
he
does
n't
answer
,
ultimately
takes
up
with
the
Buffers
who
receive
him
enthusiastically
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
moral
being
---
I
believe
that
's
the
right
expression
---
of
this
exemplary
person
,
derived
its
highest
gratification
from
anathematizing
his
nearest
relations
and
turning
them
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
Having
begun
(
as
was
natural
)
by
rendering
these
attentions
to
the
wife
of
his
bosom
,
he
next
found
himself
at
leisure
to
bestow
a
similar
recognition
on
the
claims
of
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
chose
a
husband
for
her
,
entirely
to
his
own
satisfaction
and
not
in
the
least
to
hers
,
and
proceeded
to
settle
upon
her
,
as
her
marriage
portion
,
I
do
n't
know
how
much
Dust
,
but
something
immense
.
<EOS>
At
this
stage
of
the
affair
the
poor
girl
respectfully
intimated
that
she
was
secretly
engaged
to
that
popular
character
whom
the
novelists
and
versifiers
call
Another
,
and
that
such
a
marriage
would
make
Dust
of
her
heart
and
Dust
of
her
life
---
in
short
,
would
set
her
up
,
on
a
very
extensive
scale
,
in
her
father
's
business
.
<EOS>
Immediately
,
the
venerable
parent
---
on
a
cold
winter
's
night
,
it
is
said
---
anathematized
and
turned
her
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
,
the
Analytical
Chemist
(
who
has
evidently
formed
a
very
low
opinion
of
Mortimer
's
story)concedes
a
little
claret
to
the
Buffers
;
 
who
,
again
mysteriously
moved
all
four
at
once
,
screw
it
slowly
into
themselves
with
a
peculiar
twist
of
enjoyment
,
as
they
cry
in
chorus
,
"
Pray
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
pecuniary
resources
of
Another
were
,
as
they
usually
are
,
of
a
very
limited
nature
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
am
not
using
too
strong
an
expression
when
I
say
that
Another
was
hard
up
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
married
the
young
lady
,
and
they
lived
in
a
humble
dwelling
,
probably
possessing
a
porch
ornamented
with
honeysuckle
and
woodbine
twinning
,
until
she
died
.
<EOS>
I
must
refer
you
to
the
Registrar
of
the
District
in
which
the
humble
dwelling
was
situated
,
for
the
certified
cause
of
death
;
but
early
sorrow
and
anxiety
may
have
had
to
do
with
it
,
though
they
may
not
appear
in
the
ruled
pages
and
printed
forms
.
<EOS>
Indisputably
this
was
the
case
with
Another
,
for
he
was
so
cut
up
by
the
loss
of
his
young
wife
that
if
he
outlived
her
a
year
it
was
as
much
as
he
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
is
that
in
the
indolent
Mortimer
,
which
seems
to
hint
that
if
good
society
might
on
any
account
allow
itself
to
be
impressible
,
he
,
one
of
good
society
,
might
have
the
weakness
to
be
impressed
by
what
he
here
relates
.
<EOS>
It
is
hidden
with
great
pains
,
but
it
is
in
him
.
<EOS>
The
gloomy
Eugene
too
,
is
not
without
some
kindred
touch
;
for
,
when
that
appalling
Lady
Tippins
declares
that
if
Another
had
survived
,
he
should
have
gone
down
at
the
head
of
her
list
of
lovers
---
and
also
when
the
mature
young
lady
shrugs
her
epaulettes
,
and
laughs
at
some
private
and
confidential
comment
from
the
mature
young
gentleman
<EOS>
---
his
gloom
deepens
to
that
degree
that
he
trifles
quite
ferociously
with
his
dessert
-
knife
.
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
proceeds
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
now
return
,
as
the
novelists
say
,
and
as
we
all
wish
they
would
n't
,
to
the
man
from
Somewhere
.
<EOS>
Being
a
boy
of
fourteen
,
cheaply
educating
at
Brussels
when
his
sister
's
expulsion
befell
,
it
was
some
little
time
before
he
heard
of
it
---
probably
from
herself
,
for
the
mother
was
dead
;
but
that
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Instantly
,
he
absconded
,
and
came
over
here
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
a
boy
of
spirit
and
resource
,
to
get
here
on
a
stopped
allowance
of
five
sous
a
week
;
 
but
he
did
it
somehow
,
and
he
burst
in
on
his
father
,
and
pleaded
his
sister
's
cause
.
<EOS>
Venerable
parent
promptly
resorts
to
anathematization
,
and
turns
him
out
.
<EOS>
Shocked
and
terrified
boy
takes
flight
,
seeks
his
fortune
,
gets
aboard
ship
,
ultimately
turns
up
on
dry
land
among
the
Cape
wine
:
small
proprietor
,
farmer
,
grower
---
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
shuffling
is
heard
in
the
hall
,
and
tapping
is
heard
at
the
dining
-
room
door
.
<EOS>
Analytical
Chemist
goes
to
the
door
,
confers
angrily
with
unseen
tapper
,
appears
to
become
mollified
by
descrying
reason
in
the
tapping
,
and
goes
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
he
was
discovered
,
only
the
other
day
,
after
having
been
expatriated
about
fourteen
years

<EOS>
A
Buffer
,
suddenly
astounding
the
other
three
,
by
detaching
himself
,
and
asserting
individuality
,
inquires
:
"
How
discovered

and
why

<EOS>
"
Ah

<EOS>
To
be
sure

<EOS>
Thank

<EOS>
Same
Buffer
,
emboldened
by
success
,
says
:
"
When

"
The
other

Ten

twelve
months
ago

Same
Buffer
inquires
with
smartness
,
"
What
of

<EOS>
But
herein
perishes
a
melancholy
example
;
being
regarded
by
the
three
other
Buffers
with
a
stony
stare
,
and
attracting
no
further
attention
from
any
mortal

<EOS>
"
Venerable

Mortimer
repeats
with
a
passing
remembrance
that
there
is
a
Veneering
at
table
,

for
the
first
time
addressing
him

gravely

folds
his

composes
his
brow
to
hear
it
out
in

he
finds
himself
again
deserted
in
the
bleak
world

catching
Mrs.

Not

Mrs.

inquires
whether

is
a
young
person

<EOS>
Mortimer
is
unable

Mr.

inquires
what
would
become
of
the
very
large
fortune
,
in
the
event
of
the
marriage
condition
not
being

<EOS>
Mortimer
replies
,
that
by
special
testamentary
clause
it
would
then
go
to
the
old
servant
above
mentioned
,
passing
over
and
excluding
the
son
;
also
,
that
if

Mrs.

from

by
dexterously
shunting
a

plates
and
dishes
at
her
knuckles
across
the
table
;
when
everybody
but
Mortimer
himself
becomes
aware
that
the
Analytical
Chemist
is
,
in
a
ghostly
manner
,
offering
him
a
folded
paper

<EOS>
Curiosity
detains
Mrs.
Veneering
a
few
moments
.
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
,
in
spite
of
all
the
arts
of
the
chemist
,
placidly
refreshes
himself
with
a
glass
of
Madeira
,
and
remains
unconscious
of
the
document
which
engrosses
the
general
attention
,
until
Lady
Tippins
(
who
has
a
habit
of
waking
totally
insensible
)
,
having
remembered
where
she
is
,
and
recovered
a
perception
of
surrounding
objects
,
says
:
"
Falser
man
than
Don
Juan
<EOS>
;
why
do
n't
you
take
the
note
from
the
Commendatore

"
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
the
chemist
advances
it
under
the
nose
of
Mortimer
,
who
looks
round
at
him
,
and
says
:
  
"
What
's
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
Analytical
Chemist
bends
and
whispers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who

says
Mortimer
.
  
<EOS>
Analytical
Chemist
again
bends
and
whispers
.
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
stares
at
him
,
and
unfolds
the
paper
.
<EOS>
Reads
it
,
reads
it
twice
,
<EOS>
turns
it
over
to
look
at
the

outside

reads
it
a
third

<EOS>
"
This
arrives
in
an
extraordinarily
opportune
manner
,
"
says
Mortimer
then
,
looking
with
an
altered
face
round
the
table
:
"
this
is
the
conclusion

says
Mortimer
;
"

ANOTHER
MAN

<EOS>
As
the
disappearing
skirts
of
the
ladies
ascended
the
Veneering
stair
-
case
,
Mortimer
,
following
them
forth
from
the
dining
-
room
,
turned
into
a
library
of
bran
-
new
books
,
in
bran
-
new
bindings
liberally
gilded
,
and
requested
to
see
the
messenger
who
had
brought
the
paper
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
boy
of
about
fifteen
.
<EOS>
Mortimer
looked
at
the
boy
,
and
the
boy
looked
at
the
bran
-
new
pilgrims
on
the
wall
,
going
to
Canterbury
in
more
gold
frame
than
procession
,
and
more
carving
than
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
writing
is
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mine
,
sir
,
"
  
"
Who
told
you
to
write
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
father
,
Jesse
Hexam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
he
who
found
the
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
father
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
hesitated
,
looked
reproachfully
at
the
pilgrims
as
if
they
had
involved
him
in
a
little
difficulty
,
then
said
,
folding
a
plait
in
the
right
leg
of
his
trousers
,
"
He
gets
his
living
along
-
shore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
far
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
which
far
?
;
asked
the
boy
,
upon
his
guard
,
and
again
upon
the
road
to
Canterbury
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
your
father
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
goodish
stretch
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
come
up
in
a
cab
,
and
the
cab
's
waiting
to
be
paid
.
<EOS>
We
could
go
back
in
it
before
you
paid
it
,
if
you
liked
.
<EOS>
I
went
first
to
your
office
,
according
to
the
direction
of
the
papers
found
in
the
pockets
,
and
there
I
see
nobody
but
a
chap
of
about
my
age
who
sent
me
on
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
curious
mixture
in
the
boy
,
of
uncompleted
savagery
,
and
uncompleted
civilization
.
<EOS>
His
voice
was
hoarse
and
coarse
,
and
his
face
was
coarse
,
and
his
stunted
figure
was
coarse
;
but
he
was
cleaner
than
other
boys
of
his
type
;
and
his
writing
,
though
large
and
round
,
was
good
;
and
he
glanced
at
the
backs
of
the
books
,
with
an
awakened
curiosity
that
went
below
the
binding
.
<EOS>
No
one
who
can
read
,
ever
looks
at
a
book
,
even
unopened
on
a
shelf
,
like
one
who
can
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Were
any
means
taken
,
do
you
know
,
boy
,
to
ascertain
if
it
was
possible
to
restore
life
?
"
<EOS>
Mortimer
inquired
,
as
he
sought
for
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
ask
,
sir
,
if
you
knew
his
state
.
<EOS>
Pharaoh
's
multitude
that
were
drowned
in
the
Red
Sea
,
ai
n't
more
beyond
restoring
to
life
.
<EOS>
If
Lazarus
was
only
half
as
far
gone
,
that
was
the
greatest
of
all
the
miracles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
cried
Mortimer
,
turning
round
with
his
hat
upon
his
head
,
"
you
seem
to
be
at
home
in
the
Red
Sea
,
my
young
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Read
of
it
with
teacher
at
the
school
,
"
said
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Lazarus
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
him
too
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
tell
my
father
!
<EOS>
We
should
have
no
peace
in
our
place
,
if
that
got
touched
upon
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
sister
's
contriving
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
have
a
good
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
ai
n't
half
bad
,
"
said
the
boy
;
"
but
if
she
knows
her
letters
it
's
the
most
she
does
---
and
<EOS>
them
I
learned
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
gloomy
Eugene
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
had
strolled
in
and
assisted
at
the
latter
part
of
the
dialogue
;
when
the
boy
spoke
these
words
slightingly
of
his
sister
,
he
took
him
roughly
enough
by
the
chin
,
and
turned
up
his
face
to
look
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
sure
,
sir
!
"
said
the
boy
,
resisting
;
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
'll
know
me
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eugene
vouchsafed
no
answer
;
but
made
the
proposal
to
Mortimer
,
"
I
'll
go
with
you
,
if
you
like
?
"
<EOS>
So
,
they
all
three
went
away
together
in
the
vehicle
that
had
brought
the
boy
;
the
two
friends
(
once
boys
together
at
a
public
school
)
inside
,
smoking
cigars
;
the
messenger
on
the
box
beside
the
driver
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
as
they
went
along
;
"
I
have
been
,
Eugene
,
upon
the
honourable
roll
of
solicitors
of
the
High
Court
of
Chancery
,
and
attorneys
at
Common
Law
,
five
years
;
and
---
except
gratuitously
taking
instructions
,
on
an
average
once
a
fortnight
,
for
the
will
of
Lady
Tippins
who
has
nothing
to
leave
<EOS>
---
I
have
had
no
scrap
of
business
but
this
romantic
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
I
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
have
been
`
`
called
"
"
seven
years
,
and
have
had
no
business
at
all
,
and
never
shall
have
any
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
had
,
I
should
n't
know
how
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
far
from
being
clear
as
to
the
last
particular
,
"
returned
Mortimer
,
with
great
composure
,
"
that
I
have
much
advantage
over
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
,
"
said
Eugene
,
putting
his
legs
up
on
the
opposite
seat
,
"
I
hate
my
profession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
incommode
you
,
if
I
put
mine
up
too
?
"
returned
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
hate
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
forced
upon
me
,
"
said
the
gloomy
Eugene
,
"
because
it
was
understood
that
we
wanted
a
barrister
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
We
have
got
a
precious
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
forced
upon

,
"
said
Mortimer
,
"

And

<EOS>
"
There
are
four
of
us
,
with
our
names
painted
on
a
door
-
post
in
right
of
one
black
hole
called
a
set
of
chambers
,
"
said
Eugene
;
 
"
and
each
of
us
had
the
fourth
of
a
clerk
---
Cassim
Baba
,
in
the
robber
's
cave
---
and
Cassim
is
the
only
respectable
member
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
one
by
myself
,
one
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
"
high
up
an
awful
staircase
commanding
a
burial
-
ground
,
and
I
have
a
whole
clerk
to
myself
,
and
he
was
nothing
to
do
but
look
at
the
burial
-
ground
,
and
what
he
will
turn
out
when
arrived
at
maturity
,
<EOS>
I
can
not
conceive
.
<EOS>
Whether
,
in
that
shabby
rook
's
nest
,
he
is
always
plotting
wisdom
,
or
plotting
murder
;
whether
he
will
grow
up
,
after
so
much
solitary
brooding
,
to
enlighten
his
fellow
-
creatures
,
or
to
poison
them
;
 
is
the
only
speck
of
interest
that
presents
itself
to
my
professional
view
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
me
a
light
?
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
idiots
talk
,
"
said
Eugene
,
leaning
back
,
folding
his
arms
,
smoking
with
his
eyes
shut
,
and
speaking
slightly
through
his
nose
,
"
of
Energy
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
a
word
in
the
dictonary
under
any
letter
from
A
to
Z
that
I
abominate
,
it
is
energy
.
<EOS>
it
is
such
a
conventional
superstition
,
such
parrot
gabble
!
<EOS>
What
the
deuce
!
<EOS>
Am
I
to
rush
out
into
the
street
,
collar
the
first
man
of
a
wealthy
appearance
that
I
meet
,
shake
him
,
and
say
,
`
`
Go
to
law
upon
the
spot
,
you
dog
,
and
retain
me
,
or
I
'll
be
the
death
of
you
"
"
?
<EOS>
Yet
that
would
be
energy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Precisely
my
view
of
the
case
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
But
show
me
a
good
opportunity
,
show
me
something
really
worth
being
energetic
about
,
and
I
'll
show
you
energy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
so
will
I
,
"
said
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
And
it
is
likely
enough
that
ten
thousand
other
young
men
,
within
the
limits
of
the
London
Post
-
office
town
delivery
,
made
the
same
hopeful
remark
in
the
course
of
the
same
evening
.
  
<EOS>
The
wheels
rolled
on
,
and
rolled
down
by
the
Monument
and
by
the
Tower
,
and
by
the
Docks
;
down
by
Ratcliffe
,
and
by
Rotherhithe
;
 
down
by
where
accumulated
scum
of
humanity
seemed
to
be
washed
from
higher
grounds
,
like
so
much
moral
sewage
,
and
to
be
pausing
until
its
own
weight
forced
it
over
the
bank
sunk
it
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
In
and
out
among
vessels
that
seemed
to
have
got
ashore
,
and
houses
that
seemed
to
have
got
afloat
---
among
bowsprits
staring
into
windows
,
and
windows
staring
into
ships
---
the
wheels
rolled
on
,
until
they
stopped
at
a
dark
corner
,
river
-
washed
and
otherwise
not
washed
at
all
,
where
the
boy
alighted
and
opened
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
walk
the
rest
,
sir
;
it
's
not
many
yards
.
"
<EOS>
He
spoke
in
the
singular
number
,
to
the
express
exclusion
of
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
confoundedly
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
place
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
slipping
over
the
stones
and
refuse
on
the
shore
,
as
the
boy
turned
the
corner
sharp
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
my
father
's
,
sir
;
where
the
light
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
low
building
had
the
look
of
having
once
been
a
mill
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
rotten
wart
of
wood
upon
its
forehead
that
seemed
to
indicate
where
the
sails
had
been
,
but
the
whole
was
very
indistinctly
seen
in
the
obscurity
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
boy
lifted
the
latch
of
the
door
,
and
they
passed
at
once
into
a
low
circular
room
,
where
a
man
stood
before
a
red
fire
,
looking
down
into
it
,
and
a
girl
sat
engaged
in
needlework
.
<EOS>
The
fire
was
in
a
rusty
brazier
,
not
fitted
to
the
hearth
;
and
a
common
lamp
,
shaped
like
a
hyacinth
-
root
,
smoked
and
flared
in
the
neck
of
a
stone
bottle
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
wooden
bunk
or
berth
in
a
corner
,
and
in
another
corner
a
wooden
stair
leading
above
---
so
clumsy
and
steep
that
it
was
little
better
than
a
ladder
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
old
sculls
and
oars
stood
against
the
wall
,
and
against
another
part
of
the
wall
was
a
small
dresser
,
making
a
spare
show
of
the
commonest
articles
of
crockery
and
cooking
-
vessels
.
<EOS>
The
roof
of
the
room
was
not
plastered
,
but
was
formed
of
the
flooring
of
the
room
above
.
<EOS>
This
,
being
very
old
,
knotted
,
seamed
,
and
beamed
,
gave
a
lowering
aspect
to
the
chamber
;
 
and
roof
,
and
walls
,
and
floor
,
alike
abounding
in
old
smears
of
flour
,
red
-
lead
(
or
some
such
stain
which
it
had
probably
acquired
in
warehousing
)
,
and
damp
,
alike
had
a
look
of
decomposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
,
father
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
figure
at
the
red
fire
turned
,
raised
its
ruffled
head
,
and
looked
like
a
bird
of
prey
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
Mortimer
Lightwood
Esquire
:
are
you
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mortimer
Lightwood
is
my
name
.
<EOS>
What
you
found
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
glancing
rather
shrinkingly
towards
the
bunk
;
"
is
it
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
'
Tain't
not
to
say
here
,
but
it
's
close
by
.
<EOS>
I
do
everything
reg'lar
.
<EOS>
I
've
giv
'
notice
of
the
circumstance
to
the
police
,
and
the
police
have
took
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
No
time
ai
n't
been
lost
,
on
any
hand
.
<EOS>
The
police
have
put
it
into
print
already
,
and
here
's
what
the
print
says
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Taking
up
the
bottle
with
the
lamp
in
it
,
he
held
it
near
a
paper
on
the
wall
,
with
the
police
heading
,
Body
Found
.
<EOS>
The
two
friends
read
the
handbill
as
it
stuck
against
the
wall
,
and
Gaffer
read
them
as
he
held
the
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
papers
on
the
unfortunate
man
,
I
see
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
glancing
from
the
description
of
what
was
found
,
to
the
finder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
papers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
girl
arose
with
her
work
in
her
hand
,
and
went
out
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
money
,
"
pursued
Mortimer
;
"
but
threepence
in
one
of
the
skirt
-
pockets
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Three
.
<EOS>
Penny
.
<EOS>
Pieces
,
"
said
Gaffer
Hexam
,
in
as
many
sentences
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
trousers
pockets
empty
,
and
turned
inside
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gaffer
Hexam
nodded
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
that
's
common
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
's
the
wash
of
the
tide
or
no
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
Now
,
here
,
"
moving
the
light
to
another
similar
placard
,
"
his
pockets
was
found
empty
,
and
turned
inside
out
.
<EOS>
And
here
,
"
moving
the
light
to
another
,
"
her
pocket
was
found
empty
,
and
turned
inside
out
.
<EOS>
And
so
was
this
one
's
.
<EOS>
And
so
was
that
one
's
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
read
,
nor
I
do
n't
want
to
it
,
for
I
know
'em
by
their
places
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
This
one
was
a
sailor
,
with
two
anchors
and
a
flag
and
G.
F.
T.
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Look
and
see
if
he
warn't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
one
was
the
young
woman
in
grey
boots
,
and
her
linen
marked
with
a
cross
.
<EOS>
Look

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
him
as
had
a
nasty
cut
over
the
eye
.
<EOS>
This
them
two
young
sisters
what
tied
themselves
together
with
a
handkecher
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
drunken
old
chap
,
in
a
pair
of
list
slippers
and
a
nightcap
,
wot
had
offered
---
it
afterwards
come
out
---
to
make
a
hole
in
the
water
for
a
quartern
of
rum
stood
aforehand
,
and
kept
to
his
word
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
They
pretty
well
papers
the
room
,
you
see
;
but
I
know
'em
all
.
<EOS>
I
'm
scholar
enough
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
waved
the
light
over
the
whole
,
as
if
to
typify
the
light
of
his
scholarly
intelligence
,
and
then
put
it
down
on
the
table
and
stood
behind
it
looking
intently
at
his
visitors
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
special
peculiarity
of
some
birds
of
prey
,
that
when
he
knitted
his
brow
,
his
ruffled
crest
stood
highest
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
not
find
all
these
yourself
;
did
you
?
"
asked
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
To
which
the
bird
of
prey
slowly
rejoined
,
"
<EOS>
And
what
might
your
name
be
,
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
friend
,
"
Mortimer
Lightwood
interposed
;
"
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
And
what
might
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
have
asked
of
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
you
,
simply
,
if
you
found
all
these
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
answer
you
,
simply
,
most
on
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
there
has
been
much
violence
and
robbery
,
beforehand
,
among
these
cases
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
suppose
at
all
about
it
,
"
returned
Gaffer
.
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
one
of
the
supposing
sort
.
<EOS>
If
you
'd
got
your
living
to
haul
out
of
the
river
every
day
of
your
life
,
you
might
n't
be
much
given
to
supposing
.
<EOS>
Am
I
to
show
the
way
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
opened
the
door
,
in
pursuance
of
a
nod
from
Lightwood
,
an
extremely
pale
and
disturbed
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
---
the
face
of
a
man
much
agitated
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
body
missing
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Gaffer
Hexam
stopping
short
;
"
or
a
body
found
?
<EOS>
Which
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
lost
!
"
<EOS>
replied
the
man
,
in
a
hurried
and
an
eager
manner
  
"
<EOS>
Lost
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
---
am
a
stranger
,
and
do
n't
know
the
way
.
<EOS>
I
---
I
---
want
to
find
the
place
where
I
can
see
what
is
described
here
.
<EOS>
It
is
possible
I
may
know
it
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
panting
,
and
could
hardly
speak
;
but
,
he
showed
a
copy
of
the
newly
-
printed
bill
that
was
still
wet
upon
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
its
newness
,
or
perhaps
the
accuracy
of
his
observation
of
its
general
look
,
guided
Gaffer
to
a
ready
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
gentleman
,
Mr.
Lightwood
,
is
on
that
business
.
"
  
"
Mr.
Lightwood
?
"
  
<EOS>
During
a
pause
,
Mortimer
and
the
stranger
confronted
each
other
.
<EOS>
Neither
knew
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
sir
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
breaking
the
awkward
silence
with
his
airy
self
-
possession
,
"
that
you
did
me
the
honor
to
mention
my
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
repeated
it
,
after
this
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
you
were
a
stranger
in
London
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
utter
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
seeking
a
Mr.
Harmon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
believe
I
can
assure
you
that
you
are
on
a
fruitless
errand
,
and
will
not
find
what
you
fear
to
find
.
<EOS>
Will
you
come
with
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
winding
through
some
muddy
alleys
that
might
have
been
deposited
by
the
last
ill
-
savoured
tide
,
brought
them
to
the
wicketgate
and
bright
lamp
of
a
Police
Station
;
where
they
found
the
Night
-
Inspector
,
with
a
pen
and
ink
,
and
ruler
,
posting
up
his
books
in
a
whitewashed
office
,
as
studiously
as
if
he
were
in
a
monastery
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
,
and
no
howling
fury
of
a
drunken
woman
were
banging
herself
against
a
cell
-
door
in
the
back
-
yard
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
With
the
same
air
of
a
recluse
much
given
to
study
,
he
desisted
from
his
books
to
bestow
a
distrustful
nod
of
recognition
upon
Gaffer
,
plainly
importing
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
we
know
all
about
you
,
and
you
'll
overdo
it
some
day
;
"
and
to
inform
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
and
friends
,
that
he
would
attend
them
immediately
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
finished
ruling
the
work
he
had
in
hand
<EOS>
(
it
might
have
been
illuminating
a
missal
,
he
was
so
calm
)
,
in
a
very
neat
and
methodical
manner
,
showing
not
the
slightest
consciousness
of
the
woman
who
was
banging
herself
with
increased
violence
,
and
shrieking
most
terrifically
for
some
other
woman
's
liver
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
bull's
-
eye
,
"
said
the
Night
-
Inspector
,
taking
up
his
keys
.
<EOS>
Which
a
deferential
satellite
produced
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
one
of
his
keys
,
he
opened
a
cool
grot
at
the
end
of
the
yard
,
and
they
all
went
in
.
<EOS>
They
quickly
came
out
again
,
no
one
speaking
but
Eugene
:
who
remarked
to
Mortimer
,
in
a
whisper
,
"
Not
much
worse
than
Lady
Tippins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
back
to
the
whitewashed
library
of
the
monastery
---
with
that
liver
still
in
shrieking
requisition
,
as
it
had
been
loudly
,
while
they
looked
at
the
silent
sight
they
came
to
see
---
and
there
through
the
merits
of
the
case
as
summed
up
by
the
Abbot
.
<EOS>
No
clue
to
how
body
came
into
river
.
<EOS>
Very
often
was
no
clue
.
<EOS>
Too
late
to
know
for
certain
,
whether
injuries
received
before
or
after
death
;
one
excellent
surgical
opinion
said
,
before
;
other
excellent
surgical
opinion
said
,
after
.
<EOS>
Steward
of
ship
in
which
gentleman
came
home
passenger
,
had
been
round
to
view
,
and
could
swear
to
identity
.
<EOS>
Likewise
could
swear
to
clothes
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
you
see
,
you
had
the
papers
,
too
.
<EOS>
How
was
it
he
had
totally
disappeared
on
leaving
ship
,
'
till
found
in
river
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Probably
had
been
upon
some
little
game
.
<EOS>
Probably
thought
it
a
harmless
game
,
was
n't
up
to
things
,
and
it
turned
out
a
fatal
game
.
<EOS>
Inquest
to
-
morrow
,
and
no
doubt
open
verdict
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
appears
to
have
knocked
your
friend
over
---
knocked
him
completely
of
his
legs
,
"
Mr.
Inspector
remarked
,
when
he
had
finished
his
summing
up
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
given
him
a
bad
turn
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
This
was
said
in
a
very
low
voice
,
and
with
a
searching
look
(
not
the
first
he
had
cast
)
at
the
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
explained
that
it
was
no
friend
of
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
?
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
with
an
attentive
ear
;
"
where
did
you
pick
him
up
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
explained
further
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
had
delivered
his
summing
up
,
and
had
added
these
words
,
with
his
elbows
leaning
on
his
desk
,
and
the
fingers
and
thumb
of
his
right
hand
,
fitting
themselves
to
the
fingers
and
thumb
of
his
left
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
moved
nothing
but
his
eyes
,
as
he
now
added
,
raising
his
voice
:
  
"
<EOS>
Turned
you
faint
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Seems
you
're
not
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
work
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
who
was
leaning
against
the
chimneypiece
with
drooping
head
,
looked
round
and
answered
,
"
No
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
horrible
sight
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
expected
to
identify
,
I
am
told
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
"
Have
you
identified
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
It
's
horrible
sight
.
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
a
horrible
,
horrible
sight
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
did
you
think
it
might
have
been
?
"
asked
Mr.
Inspector
.
"
<EOS>
Give
us
a
description
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
we
can
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
the
stranger
;
"
it
would
be
quite
useless
.
<EOS>
Goodnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
had
not
moved
,
and
had
given
no
order
;
but
,
the
satellite
slipped
his
back
against
the
wicket
,
and
laid
his
left
arm
along
the
top
of
it
,
and
with
his
right
hand
turned
the
bull's
-
eye
he
had
taken
from
his
chief
---
in
quite
a
casual
manner
---
towards
the
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
missed
a
friend
,
you
know
;
or
you
missed
a
foe
,
you
know

or
you
would
n't
have
come
here
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Well
,
then
;
ai
n't
it
reasonable
to
ask
,
who
was
it
?
"
<EOS>
Thus
,
Mr.
Inspector
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
excuse
my
telling
you
.
<EOS>
No
class
of
man
can
understand
better
than
you
,
that
families
may
not
choose
to
publish
their
disagreements
and
misfortunes
,
except
on
the
last
necessity
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
dispute
that
you
discharge
your
duty
in
asking
me
the
question
;
 
you
will
not
dispute
my
right
to
withhold
the
answer

Goodnight

<EOS>
Again
he
turned
towards
the
wicket
,
where
the
satellite
,
with
his
eye
upon
his
chief

At

Mr.

,
"
you
will
not
object
to
leave
me
your
card

"
  
<EOS>
"
I

I
had
one

I
have
not

He
reddened
and
was
much
confused
as
he
gave
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
least

"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
with
no
change
of
voice
or
manner

Mr.
Inspector
dipped
a
pen
in
his
inkstand
,
and
deftly
laid
it
on
a
piece
of
paper
close
beside
him
;
then
resumed
his
former
attitude

The
stranger
stepped
up
to
the
desk
,
and
wrote
in
a
rather
tremulous
hand
---
Mr.
Inspector
taking
sidelong
note
of
every
hair
of
his
head
when
it
was
bent
down
for

Staying

Yes

"
Good

The
satellite
removed
his
arm
and
opened
the
wicket
,
and
Mr.
Julius
Handford
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Reserve
!
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
Take
care
of
this
piece
of
paper
,
keep
him
in
view
without
giving
offence
,
ascertain
that
he
is
staying
there

and
find
out
anything
you
can
about
him

"
  
<EOS>
The
satellite
was
gone
;
and
Mr.
Inspector
,
becoming
once
again
the
quiet
Abbot
of
that
Monastery
,
dipped
his
pen
in
his
ink
and
resumed
his
books
.
<EOS>
The
two
friends
who
had
watched
him
,
more
amused
by
the
professional
manner
than
suspicious
of
Mr.
Julius
Handford
,
inquired
before
taking
their
departure
too
whether
he
believed
there
was
anything
that
really
looked
bad
here
?
  
<EOS>
The
Abbot
replied
with
reticence
,
could
n't
say
.
<EOS>
If
a
murder
,
anybody
might
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
Burglary
or
pocket
-
picking
wanted
'
prenticeship
.
<EOS>
Not
so
,
murder
.
<EOS>
We
were
all
of
us
up
to
that
.
<EOS>
Had
seen
scores
of
people
come
to
identify
,
and
never
saw
one
person
struck
in
that
particular
way
.
<EOS>
Might
,
however
,
have
been
Stomach
and
not
Mind
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
rum
stomach
.
<EOS>
But
to
be
sure
there
were
rum
everythings
.
<EOS>
Pity
there
was
not
a
word
of
truth
in
that
superstition
about
bodies
bleeding
when
touched
by
the
hand
of
the
right
person
;
 
you
never
got
a
sign
out
of
bodies
.
<EOS>
You
got
row
enough
out
of
such
as
her
---
she
was
good
for
all
night
now
"
(
referring
here
to
the
banging
demands
for
the
liver
)
,
"
but
you
got
nothing
out
of
bodies
if
it
was
ever
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
being
nothing
more
to
be
done
until
the
Inquest
was
held
next
day
,
the
friends
went
away
together
,
and
Gaffer
Hexam
and
his
son
went
their
separate
way
.
<EOS>
But
,
arriving
at
the
last
corner
,
Gaffer
bade
his
boy
go
home
while
he
turned
into
a
red
-
curtained
tavern
,
that
stood
dropsically
bulging
over
the
causeway
,
"
for
a
half
-
a
-
pint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
lifted
the
latch
he
had
lifted
before
,
and
found
his
sister
again
seated
before
the
fire
at
her
work
.
<EOS>
Who
raised
her
head
upon
his
coming
in
and
asking
:
  
"
Where
did
you
go
,
Liz
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
went
out
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
necessity
for
that
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
right
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
the
gentlemen
,
the
one
who
did
n't
speak
while
I
was
there
,
looked
hard
at
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
afraid
he
might
know
what
my
face
meant
.
<EOS>
But
there
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
me
,
Charley
!
<EOS>
I
was
all
in
a
tremble
of
another
sort
when
you
owned
to
father
you
could
write
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
But
I
made
believe
I
wrote
so
badly
,
as
that
it
was
odds
if
any
one
could
read
it
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
wrote
slowest
and
smeared
out
with
my
finger
most
,
father
was
best
pleased
,
as
he
stood
looking
over
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
put
aside
her
work
,
and
drawing
her
seat
close
to
his
seat
by
the
fire
,
laid
her
arm
gently
on
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
make
the
most
of
your
time

<EOS>
Charley
;
wo
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
I
?
<EOS>
Come

<EOS>
I
like
that

<EOS>
Do
n't
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Charley
,
yes
.
<EOS>
You
work
hard
at
your
learning
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
And
I
work
a
little
,
Charley
,
and
plan
and
contrive
a
little
(
wake
out
of
my
sleep
contriving
sometimes
)
,
how
to
get
together
a
shilling
now
,
and
a
shilling
then
,
that
shall
make
father
believe
you
are
beginning
to
earn
a
stray
living
along
shore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
father
's
favourite
,
and
can
make
him
believe
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
,
Charley
!
<EOS>
For
if
I
could
make
him
believe
that
learning
was
a
good
thing
,
and
that
we
might
lead
better
lives
,
I
should
be
a'most
content
to
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
talk
stuff
about
dying
,
Liz
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
placed
her
hands
in
one
another
on
his
shoulder
,
and
laying
her
rich
brown
cheek
against
them
as
she
looked
down
at
the
fire
,
went
on
thoughtfully
:
  
"
Of
an
evening
,
Charley
,
when
you
are
at
the
school
,
and
father
's
---
"
  
"
At
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
-
Porters
,
"
the
boy
struck
in
,
with
a
backward
nod
of
his
head
towards
the
public
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Then
as
I
sit
a
-
looking
at
the
fire
,
I
seem
to
see
in
the
burning
coal
---
like
where
that
glow
is
now
---
"
  
"
That
's
gas
,
that
is
,
"
said
the
boy
,
"
coming
out
of
a
bit
of
a
forest
that
's
been
under
the
mud
that
was
under
the
water
in
the
days
of
Noah
's
Ark.
Look
here
!
<EOS>
When
I
take
the
poker
---
<EOS>
so
---
and
give
it
a
dig
---
"
  
"
Do
n't
disturb
it
,
Charley
,
or
it
'll
be
all
in
a
blaze
.
<EOS>
It
's
that
dull
glow
near
it
,
coming
and
going
,
that
I
mean
.
<EOS>
When
I
look
at
it
of
an
evening
,
it
comes
like
pictures
to
me
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Show
us
a
picture
,
"
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
us
where
to
look
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
It
wants
my
eyes
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cut
away
then
,
and
tell
us
what
your
eyes
make
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
are
you
and
me
,
Charley
,
when
you
were
quite
a
baby
that
never
knew
a
mother
---
"
  
"
Do
n't
go
saying
I
never
knew
a
mother
,
"
interposed
the
boy
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
knew
a
little
sister
that
was
sister
and
mother
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
girl
laughed
delightedly
,
and
her
eyes
filled
with
pleasant
tears
,
as
he
put
both
his
arms
round
her
waist
and
so
held
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
you
and
me
,
Charley
,
when
father
was
away
at
work
and
locked
us
out
,
for
fear
we
should
set
ourselves
afire
or
fall
out
of
window
,
sitting
on
the
door
-
sill
,
sitting
on
other
door
-
steps
,
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
river
,
wandering
about
to
get
through
the
time
.
<EOS>
You
are
rather
heavy
to
carry
,
Charley
,
and
I
am
often
obliged
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
we
are
sleepy
and
fall
asleep
together
in
a
corner
,
sometimes
we
are
very
hungry
,
sometimes
we
are
a
little
frightened
,
but
what
is
oftenest
hard
upon
us
is
the
cold
.
<EOS>
You
remember
,
Charley
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
remember
,
"
said
the
boy
,
pressing
her
to
him
twice
or
thrice
,
"
that
I
snuggled
under
a
little
shawl
,
and
it
was
warm
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
it
rains
,
and
we
creep
under
a
boat
or
the
like
of
that
:
sometimes
it
's
dark
,
and
we
get
among
the
gaslights
,
sitting
watching
the
people
as
they
go
along
the
streets
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
up
comes
father
and
takes
us
home
.
<EOS>
And
home
seems
such
a
shelter
after
out
of
doors
!
<EOS>
And
father
pull
my
shoes
off
,
and
dries
my
feet
at
the
fire
,
and
has
me
to
sit
by
him
while
he
smokes
his
pipe
long
after
you
are
abed
,
and
I
notice
that
father
's
is
a
large
hand
but
never
a
heavy
one
when
it
touches
me
,
and
that
father
's
is
a
rough
voice
but
never
an
angry
one
when
it
speaks
to
me
.
<EOS>
So
,
I
grow
up
,
and
little
by
little
father
trusts
me
,
and
makes
me
his
companion
,
and
,
let
him
be
put
out
as
he
may
,
never
once
strikes
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
listening
boy
gave
a
grunt
here
,
as
much
as
to
say
"
But
he
strikes
me
though
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
are
some
of
the
pictures
of
what
is
past
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cut
away
again
,
"
said
the
boy
,
"
and
give
us
a
fortune
-
telling
one
;
a
future
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
There
am
I
,
continuing
with
father
and
holding
to
father
,
because
father
loves
me
and
I
love
father
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
so
much
as
read
a
book
,
because
if
I
had
learned
,
father
would
have
thought
I
was
deserting
him
,
and
I
should
have
lost
my
influence
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
influence
I
want
to
have
,
I
can
not
stop
some
dreadful
things
I
try
to
stop
,
but
I
go
on
in
the
hope
and
trust
that
the
time
will
come
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
I
know
that
I
am
in
some
things
a
stay
to
father
,
and
that
if
I
was
not
faithful
to
him
he
would
---
in
revenge
-
like
,
or
in
disappointment
,
or
both
---
go
wild
and
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
us
a
touch
of
the
fortune
-
telling
pictures
about
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
passing
on
to
them
Charley
,
"
said
the
girl
,
who
had
not
changed
her
attitude
since
she
began
,
and
who
now
mournfully
shook
her
head
;
"
the
others
were
all
leading
up
.
<EOS>
There
are
you
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Where
am
I
,
Liz
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Still
in
the
hollow
down
by
the
flare
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
seems
to
be
the
deuce
-
and
-
all
in
the
hollow
down
by
the
flare

said
the
boy
,
glancing
from
her
eyes
to
the
brazier
,
which
had
a
grisly
skeleton
look
on
its
long
thin
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
you
,
Charley
,
working
your
way
,
in
secret
from
father
,
at
the
school
;
and
you
get
prizes
;
and
you
go
on
better
and
better
;
 
and
you
come
to
be
a

what
was
it
<EOS>
you
called
it
when
you
told
me
about
that

<EOS>

"
Ha

ha
!
<EOS>
Fortune
-
telling

know
the
name

"
<EOS>
cried
the
boy
,
seeming
to
be
rather
relieved
by
this
default
on
the
part
of
the
hollow
down
by
the
flare
.
<EOS>
"
Pupil
-
teacher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
come
to
be
a
pupil
-
teacher
,
and
you
still
go
on
better
and
better
,
and
you
rise
to
be
a
master
full
of
learning
and
respect
.
<EOS>
But
the
secret
has
come
to
father
's
knowledge
long
before
,
and
it
has
divided
you
from
father
,
and
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
it
has
n't
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
it
has
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
I
see
,
as
plain
as
plain
can
be
,
that
your
way
is
not
ours
,
and
that
even
if
father
could
be
got
to
forgive
your
taking
it
(
which
he
never
could
be
)
,
that
way
of
yours
would
be
darkened
by
our
way
.
<EOS>
But
I
see
too
,
Charley
---
"
  
"
Still
as
plain
as
plain
can
be
,
Liz
?
"
asked
the
boy
playfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Still
.
<EOS>
That
it
is
a
great
work
to
have
cut
you
away
from
father
's
life
,
and
to
have
made
a
new
and
good
beginning
.
<EOS>
So
there
and
I
,
Charley
,
left
alone
with
father
,
keeping
him
as
straight
as
I
can
,
watching
for
more
influence
than
I
have
,
and
hoping
that
through
some
fortunate
chance
,
or
when
he
is
ill
,
or
when
---
I
do
n't
know
what

I
may
turn
him
to
wish
to
do
better
things
.

<EOS>

You
said
you
could
n't
read
a
book
,
Lizzie

<EOS>
Your
library
of
books
is
the
hollow
down
by
the
flare

I
think

<EOS>
"
I
should
be
very
glad
to
be
able
to
read
real
books

<EOS>
I
feel
my
want
of
learning
very
much
,
Charley

<EOS>
But
I
should
feel
it
much
more
,
if
I
did
n't
know
it
to

a
tie
between
me
and
father

It
being
now
past
midnight

the
bird
of
prey
went
straight
to

At
mid
-
day
following
he
reappeared
at
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
-
Porters
,
in
the
character
,
not
new
to
him
,
of
a
witness
before
a
Coroner
's
Jury
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
,
besides
sustaining
the
character
of
one
of
the
witnesses
,
doubled
the
part
with
that
of
the
eminent
solicitor
who
watched
the
proceedings
on
behalf
of
the
representatives
of
the
deceased
,
as
was
duly
recorded
in
the
newspapers
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
watched
the
proceedings
too
,
and
kept
his
watching
closely
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Julius
Handford
having
given
his
right
address
,
and
being
reported
in
solvent
circumstances
as
to
his
bill
,
though
nothing
more
was
known
of
him
at
his
hotel
except
that
his
way
of
life
was
very
retired
,
had
no
summons
to
appear
,
and
was
merely
present
in
the
shades
of
Mr.
Inspector
's
mind
.
  
<EOS>
The
case
was
made
interesting
to
the
public
,
by
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
's
evidence
touching
the
circumstances
under
which
the
deceased
,
Mr.
John
Harmon
,
had
returned
to
England
;
exclusive
private
proprietorship
in
which
circumstances
was
set
up
at
dinner
-
tables
for
several
days
,
by
Veneering
,
Twemlow
,
Podsnap
,
and
all
the
Buffers
:
who
all
related
them
irreconcilably
with
one
another
,
and
contradicted
themselves
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
made
interesting
by
the
testimony
of
Job
Potterson
,
the
ship
's
steward
,
and
one
Mr.
Jacob
Kibble
,
a
fellow
-
passenger
,
that
the
deceased
Mr.
John
Harmon
did
bring
over
,
in
a
hand
-
valise
with
which
he
did
disembark
,
the
sum
realized
by
the
forced
sale
of
his
little
landed
property
,
and
that
the
sum
exceeded
,
in
ready
money
,
seven
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
It
was
further
made
interesting
,
by
the
remarkable
experiences
of
Jesse
Hexam
in
having
rescued
from
the
Thames
so
many
dead
bodies
,
and
for
whose
behoof
a
rapturous
admirer
subscribing
himself
<EOS>
"
A
friend
to
Burial
"
(
perhaps
an
undertaker
)
,
sent
eighteen
postage
stamps
,
and
five
"
Now
Sir"s
to
the
editor
of
the
Times
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
evidence
adduced
before
them
,
the
Jury
found
,
That
the
body
of
Mr.
John
Harmon
had
been
discovered
floating
in
the
Thames
,
in
an
advanced
state
of
decay
,
and
much
injured
;
and
that
the
said
Mr.
John
Harmon
had
come
by
his
death
under
highly
suspicious
circumstances
,
though
by
whose
act
or
in
what
precise
manner
there
was
no
evidence
before
this
Jury
to
show
.
<EOS>
And
they
appended
to
their
verdict
,
a
recommendation
to
the
Home
Office
(
which
Mr.
Inspector
appeared
to
think
highly
sensible
)
,
to
offer
a
reward
for
the
solution
of
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
Within
eight
-
and
-
forty
hours
,
a
reward
of
One
Hundred
Pounds
was
proclaimed
,
together
with
a
free
pardon
to
any
person
or
persons
not
the
actual
perpetrator
or
perpetrators
,
and
so
forth
in
due
form
.
  
<EOS>
This
Proclamation
rendered
Mr.
Inspector
additionally
studious
,
and
caused
him
to
stand
meditating
on
river
-
stairs
and
causeways
,
and
to
go
lurking
about
in
boats
,
putting
this
and
that
together
.
<EOS>
But
,
according
to
the
success
with
which
you
put
this
and
that
together
,
you
get
a
woman
and
a
fish
apart
,
or
a
Mermaid
in
combination
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Inspector
could
turn
out
nothing
better
than
a
Mermaid
,
which
no
Judge
and
Jury
would
believe
in
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
like
the
tides
on
which
it
had
been
borne
to
the
knowledge
of
men
,
the
Harmon
Murder
---
as
it
came
to
be
popularly
called
---
  
went
up
and
down
,
and
ebbed
and
flowed
,
now
in
the
town
,
now
in
the
country
,
now
among
palaces
,
now
among
hovels
,
now
among
lords
and
ladies
and
gentlefolks
,
now
among
labourers
and
hammerers
and
ballast
-
heavers
,
until
at
last
,
after
a
long
interval
of
slack
water
it
got
out
to
sea
and
drifted
away
.

THE
R.
WILFER
FAMILY
.
 
<EOS>
Reginald
Wilfer
is
a
name
with
rather
a
grand
sound
,
suggesting
on
first
acquaintance
brasses
in
country
churches
,
scrolls
in
stained
-
glass
windows
,
and
generally
the
De
Wilfers
who
came
over
with
the
Conqueror
.
<EOS>
For
,
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
in
genealogy
that
no
<EOS>
De
Any
ones
ever
came
over
with
Anybody
else
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
Reginald
Wilfer
family
were
of
such
commonplace
extraction
and
pursuits
that
their
forefathers
had
for
generations
modestly
subsisted
on
the
Docks
,
the
Excise
Office
,
and
the
Custom
House
,
and
the
existing
R.
Wilfer
was
a
poor
clerk
.
<EOS>
So
poor
a
clerk
,
though
having
a
limited
salary
and
an
unlimited
family
,
that
he
had
never
yet
attained
the
modest
object
of
his
ambition
:
which
was
,
to
wear
a
complete
new
suit
of
clothes
,
hat
and
boots
included
,
at
one
time
.
<EOS>
His
black
hat
was
brown
before
he
could
afford
a
coat
,
his
pantaloons
were
white
at
the
seams
and
knew
before
he
could
buy
a
pair
of
boots
,
his
boots
had
worn
out
before
he
could
treat
himself
to
new
pantaloons
,
and
,
by
the
time
he
worked
round
to
the
hat
again
,
that
shining
modern
article
roofed
-
in
an
ancient
ruin
of
various
periods
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
conventional
Cherub
could
ever
grow
up
and
be
clothed
,
he
might
be
photographed
as
a
portrait
of
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
His
chubby
,
smooth
,
innocent
appearance
was
a
reason
for
his
being
always
treated
with
condescension
when
he
was
not
put
down
.
<EOS>
A
stranger
entering
his
own
poor
house
at
about
ten
o'clock
P.M.
might
have
been
surprised
to
find
him
sitting
up
to
supper
.
<EOS>
So
boyish
was
he
in
his
curves
and
proportions
,
that
his
old
schoolmaster
meeting
him
in
Cheapside
,
might
have
been
unable
to
withstand
the
temptation
of
caning
him
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
In
shot
,
he
was
the
conventional
cherub
,
after
the
supposititious
shoot
just
mentioned
,
rather
grey
,
with
signs
of
care
on
his
expression
,
and
in
decidedly
insolvent
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
shy
,
and
unwilling
to
own
to
the
name
of
Reginald
,
as
being
too
aspiring
and
self
-
assertive
a
name
.
<EOS>
In
his
signature
he
used
only
the
initial
R.
,
and
imparted
what
it
really
stood
for
,
to
none
but
chosen
friends
,
under
the
seal
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
Out
of
this
,
the
facetious
habit
had
arisen
in
the
neighbourhood
surrounding
Mincing
Lane
of
making
christian
names
for
him
of
adjectives
and
participles
beginning
with
<EOS>
R.
Some
of
these
were
more
or
less
appropriate
:
as
Rusty
,
Retiring
,
Ruddy
,
Round
,
Ripe
,
Ridiculous
,
Ruminative
;
others
,
derived
their
point
from
their
want
of
application
:
as
Raging
,
Rattling
,
Roaring
,
Raffish
.
<EOS>
But
,
his
popular
name
was
Rumty
,
which
in
a
moment
of
inspiration
had
been
bestowed
upon
him
by
a
gentleman
of
convivial
habits
connected
with
the
drug
-
market
,
as
the
beginning
of
a
social
chorus
,
his
leading
part
in
the
execution
of
which
had
led
this
gentleman
to
the
Temple
of
Fame
,
and
of
which
the
whole
expressive
burden
ran
:
   
"
Rumty
iddity
,
row
dow
dow
,
  
Sing
toodlely
,
teedlely
,
bow
wow
wow
.
<EOS>
"
Thus
he
was
constantly
addressed
,
even
in
minor
notes
on
business
,
as
"
Dear
Rumty
;
"
in
answer
to
which
,
he
sedately
signed
himself
,
"
Yours
truly
,
R.
Wilfer
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
clerk
in
the
drug
-
house
of
Chicksey
,
Veneering
,
and
Stobbles
.
<EOS>
Chickesey
and
Stobbles
,
his
former
masters
,
had
both
become
absorbed
in
Veneering
,
once
their
traveller
or
commission
agent
:
who
had
signalized
his
accession
to
supreme
power
by
bringing
into
the
business
a
quantity
of
plate
-
glass
window
and
French
-
polished
mahogany
partition
,
and
a
gleaming
and
enormous
door
-
plate
.
  
<EOS>
R.
Wilfer
locked
up
his
desk
one
evening
,
and
,
putting
his
bunch
of
keys
in
his
pocket
much
as
if
it
were
his
peg
-
top
,
made
for
home
.
<EOS>
His
home
was
in
the
Holloway
region
north
of
London
,
and
then
divided
from
it
by
fields
and
trees
.
<EOS>
Between
Battle
Bridge
and
that
part
of
the
Holloway
district
in
which
he
dwelt
,
was
a
tract
of
suburban
Sahara
,
where
tiles
and
bricks
were
burnt
,
bones
were
boiled
,
carpets
were
beat
,
rubbish
was
shot
,
dogs
were
fought
,
and
dust
was
heaped
by
contractors
.
<EOS>
Skirting
the
border
of
this
desert
,
by
the
way
he
took
,
when
the
light
of
its
kiln
-
fires
made
lurid
smears
on
the
fog
,
R.
Wilfer
sighed
and
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
me
!
<EOS>
"
said
he
,
"
what
might
have
been
is
not
what
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
which
commentary
on
human
life
,
indicating
an
experience
of
it
not
exclusively
his
own
,
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
end
of
his
journey
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
was
,
of
course
,
a
tall
woman
and
an
angular
.
<EOS>
Her
lord
being
cherubic
,
she
was
necessarily
majestic
,
according
to
the
principle
which
matrimonially
units
contrasts
.
<EOS>
She
was
much
given
to
tying
up
her
head
in
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
knotted
under
the
chin
.
<EOS>
This
head
-
gear
,
in
conjunction
with
a
pair
of
gloves
worn
within
doors
,
she
seemed
to
consider
as
at
once
a
kind
of
armour
against
misfortune
(
invariably
assuming
it
when
in
low
spirits
or
difficulties
)
,
and
as
a
species
of
full
dress
.
<EOS>
It
was
therefore
with
some
sinking
of
the
spirit
that
her
husband
beheld
her
thus
heroically
attired
,
putting
down
her
candle
in
the
little
hall
,
and
coming
down
the
doorsteps
through
the
little
front
court
to
open
the
gate
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
Something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
house
-
door
,
for
R.
Wilfer
stopped
on
the
steps
,
staring
at
it
,
and
cried
:
  
"
<EOS>
Hal
---
loa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
the
man
came
himself
with
a
pair
of
pincers
,
and
took
it
off
,
and
took
it
away
.
<EOS>
He
said
that
as
he
had
no
expectation
of
ever
being
paid
for
it
,
and
as
he
had
an
order
for
another
Ladies
'
School
door
-
plate
,
it
was
better
(
burnished
up
)
for
the
interests
of
all
parties
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
was
,
my
dear
;
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
master
here
,
R.
W.
,
"
returned
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
you
think
;
not
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
might
have
been
better
if
the
man
had
taken
the
door
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
we
could
n't
have
done
without
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Could
n't
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
Could
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
you
think
,
R.
W.
;
not
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
those
submissive
words
,
the
dutiful
wife
preceded
him
down
a
few
stairs
to
a
little
basement
front
room
,
half
kitchen
,
half
parlour
,
where
a
girl
of
about
nineteen
,
with
an
exceedingly
pretty
figure
and
face
,
but
with
an
impatient
and
petulant
expression
both
in
her
face
and
in
her
shoulders
(
which
in
her
sex
and
at
her
age
are
very
expressive
of
discontent
)
,
sat
playing
draughts
with
a
younger
girl
,
who
was
the
youngest
of
the
House
of
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
Not
to
encumber
this
page
by
telling
off
the
Wilfers
in
detail
and
casting
them
up
in
the
gross
,
it
is
enough
for
the
present
that
the
rest
were
what
is
called
"
out
in
the
world
,
"
in
various
ways
,
and
that
they
were
Many
.
<EOS>
So
many
,
that
when
one
of
his
dutiful
children
called
in
to
see
him
,
R.
Wilfer
generally
seemd
to
say
to
himself
,
after
a
little
mental
arithmetic
,
"
Oh

here

<EOS>
before
adding
aloud
,
"
How

as
the
case
might
be

<EOS>
"

said
R.
W.
,
"

<EOS>
What

my

to
Mrs.
Wilfer
already
seated
in
a
corner
with
folded

was

<EOS>
"
The
milkman
said
he
knew
of
two
young
ladies
of
the
highest
respectability
who
were
in
search
of
a
suitable
establishment
,
and
he
took
a
card
,
"
interposed
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
severe
monotony
,
as
if
she
were
reading
an
Act
of
Parliament
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
your
father
whether

<EOS>
"
But
we
never

said
Bella
,
the
elder
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
addition

her
husband
urged
,

<EOS>
"
  
"
Pardon
me

Mrs.
Wilfer
again
interposed
;
"
they
were
not
young
persons

<EOS>
Two
young
ladies
of
the
highest
respectability

<EOS>
Tell
your

said

"
  
<EOS>
"
No

said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
the

impressive
monotony
.
<EOS>
"

Pardon

<EOS>
"
I

my

said
her
husband
,
making
the
stipulation
at
once
in
a
conciliatory
,
complimentary
,
and
argumentative
tone
---
"

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
a
meek
renunciatory
action
of
her
gloves
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
you
think
,
R.
W.
;
not
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
,
the
huffing
of
Miss
Bella
and
the
loss
of
three
of
her
men
at
a
swoop
,
aggravated
by
the
coronation
of
an
opponent
,
led
to
that
young
lady
's
jerking
the
draught
-
board
and
pieces
off
the
table
:
<EOS>
which
her
sister
went
down
on
her
knees
to
pick
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Bella
!
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
poor
Lavinia
,
perhaps
,
my
dear
?
"
suggested
R.
W.
  
"
Pardon
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
worthy
woman
's
specialities
that
she
had
an
amazing
power
of
gratifying
her
splenetic
or
worldly
-
minded
humours
by
extolling
her
own
family
:
which
she
thus
proceeded
,
in
the
present
case
,
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
R.
W.
Lavinia
has
not
known
the
trial
that
Bella
has
known
.
<EOS>
The
trial
that
your
daughter
Bella
has
undergone
,
is
,
perhaps
,
without
a
parallel
,
and
has
been
borne
,
I
will
say
,
Nobly
.
<EOS>
When
you
see
your
daughter
Bella
in
her
black
dress
,
which
she
alone
of
all
the
family
wears
,
and
when
you
remember
the
circumstances
which
have
led
to
her
wearing
it
,
and
when
you
know
how
those
circumstances
have
been
sustained
,
then
,
R.
W.
,
lay
your
head
upon
your
pillow
and
say
,
`
`
Poor
Lavinia
!
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
Here
,
Miss
Lavinia
,
from
her
kneeling
situation
under
the
table
,
put
in
that
she
did
n't
want
to
be
"
poored
by
pa
,
"
or
anybody
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
do
not
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
her
mother
,
"
for
you
have
a
fine
brave
spirit
.
<EOS>
And
your
sister
Cecilia
has
a
fine
brave
spirit
of
another
kind
,
a
spirit
of
pure
devotion
,
a
beau
-
ti
-
ful
spirit
!
<EOS>
The
self
-
sacrifice
of
Cecilia
reveals
a
pure
and
womanly
character
,
very
seldom
equalled
,
never
surpassed
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
in
my
pocket
a
letter
from
your
sister
Cecilia
,
received
this
morning
---
received
three
months
after
her
marriage
,
poor
child
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
in
which
she
tells
me
that
her
husband
must
unexpectedly
shelter
under
their
roof
his
reduced
aunt
.
<EOS>
`
<EOS>
`
But
I
will
be
true
to
him
,
mamma
,
"
"
she
touchingly
writes
,
`
`
I
will
not
leave
him
,
I
must
not
forget
that
he
is
my
husband
.
<EOS>
Let
his
aunt
come
!
"
<EOS>
"
If
this
is
not
pathetic
,
if
this
is
not
woman
's
devotion
---
!
"
The
good
lady
waved
her
gloves
in
a
sense
of
the
impossibility
of
saying
more
,
and
tied
the
pocket
-
handkerchief
over
her
head
in
a
tighter
knot
under
her
chin
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
,
who
was
now
seated
on
the
rug
to
warm
herself
,
with
her
brown
eyes
on
the
fire
and
a
handful
of
her
brown
curls
in
her
mouth
,
laughed
at
this
,
and
then
pouted
and
half
cried
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
she
,
"
<EOS>
though
you
have
no
feeling
for
me
,
pa
,
I
am
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
girls
that
ever
lived
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
poor
we
are
"
<EOS>
(
it
is
probable
he
did
,
having
some
reason
to
know
it
!
)
,
"
and
what
a
glimpse
of
wealth
I
had
,
and
how
it
melted
away
,
and
how
I
am
here
in
this
ridiculous
mourning
---
which
I
hate
!
---
<EOS>
a
kind
of
a
widow
who
never
was
married
.
<EOS>
And
yet
you
do
n't
feel
for
me
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Yes
you
do
,
yes
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
abrupt
change
was
occasioned
by
her
father
's
face
.
<EOS>
She
stopped
to
pull
him
down
from
his
chair
in
an
attitude
highly
favourable
to
strangulation
,
and
to
give
him
a
kiss
and
a
pat
or
two
on
the
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
ought
to
feel
for
me
,
you
know
,
pa

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
I
say
you
ought
to
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
only
left
me
alone
and
told
me
nothing
about
it
,
it
would
have
mattered
much
less
.
<EOS>
But
that
nasty
Mr.
Lightwood
feels
it
his
duty
,
as
he
says
,
to
write
and
tell
me
what
is
in
reserve
for
me
,
and
then
I
am
obliged
to
get
rid
of
George
Sampson
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
,
Lavinia
,
rising
to
the
surface
with
the
last
draughtman
rescued
,
interposed
,
"
You
never
cared
for
George
Sampson
,
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
I
say
I
did
,
miss
?
"
<EOS>
Then
,
pouting
again
,
with
the
curls
in
her
mouth
;
"
George
Sampson
was
very
fond
of
me
,
and
admired
me
very
much
,
and
put
up
with
everything
I
did
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
rude
enough
to
him
,
"
Lavinia
again
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
I
say
I
was
n't
miss
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
setting
up
to
be
sentimental
about
George
Sampson
.
<EOS>
I
only
say
George
Sampson
was
better
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
show
him
that
you
thought
even
that
,
"
Lavinia
again
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
chit
and
a
little
idiot
,
"
returned
Bella
,
"
or
you
would
n't
make
such
a
dolly
speech
.
<EOS>
What
did
you
expect
me
to
do
?
<EOS>
Wait
till
you
are
a
woman
,
and
do
n't
talk
about
what
you
do
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
You
only
show
your
ignorance
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
whimpering
again
,
and
at
intervals
biting
the
curls
,
and
stopping
to
look
how
much
was
bitten
off
,
"
It
's
a
shame
!
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
hard
case
!
<EOS>
I
should
n't
care
so
much
if
it
was
n't
so
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
It
was
ridiculous
enough
to
have
a
stranger
coming
over
to
marry
me
,
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
.
<EOS>
It
was
ridiculous
enough
to
know
what
an
embarrassing
meeting
it
would
be
,
and
how
we
never
could
pretend
to
have
an
inclination
of
our
own
,
either
of
us
.
<EOS>
It
was
ridiculous
enough
to
know
<EOS>
I
should
n't
like
him
<EOS>
---
how
could
I
like
him
,
left
to
him
in
a
will
,
like
a
dozen
of
spoons
,
with
everything
cut
and
dried
beforehand
,
like
orange
chips
.
<EOS>
Talk
of
orange
flowers
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
declare
again
it
's
a
shame
!
<EOS>
Those
ridiculous
points
would
have
been
smoothed
away
by
the
money
,
for
I
love
money
,
and
want
money
---
want
it
dreadfully
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
be
poor
,
and
we
are
degradingly
poor
,
offensively
poor
,
miserably
poor
,
beastly
poor
.
<EOS>
But
here
I
am
,
left
with
all
the
ridiculous
parts
of
the
situation
remaining
,
and
,
added
to
them
all
the
ridiculous
dress
!
<EOS>
And
if
the
truth
was
known
,
when
the
Harmon
murder
was
all
over
the
town
,
and
people
were
speculating
on
it
's
being
suicide
,
I
dare
say
those
impudent
wretches
at
the
clubs
and
places
made
jokes
about
the
miserable
creature
's
having
preferred
a
watery
grave
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
likely
enough
they
took
such
liberties
:
I
should
n't
wonder
!
<EOS>
I
declare
it
's
a
very
hard
case
indeed
,
and
I
am
a
most
unfortunate
girl
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
being
a
kind
of
a
widow
,
and
never
having
been
married
!
<EOS>
And
the
idea
of
being
as
poor
as
ever
after
all
,
and
going
into
black
,
besides
,
for
a
man
I
never
saw
,
and
should
have
hated
---
as
far
as
he
.
<EOS>
was
concerned
---
if
I
had
seen
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
lady
's
lamentations
were
checked
at
this
point
by
a
knuckle
,
knocking
at
the
half
-
open
door
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
knuckle
had
knocked
two
or
three
times
already
,
but
had
not
been
heard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
?
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
in
her
Act
-
of
-
Parliament
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Enter
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
gentleman
coming
in
,
Miss
Bella
,
with
a
short
and
sharp
exclamation
,
scrambled
off
the
hearth
-
rug
and
massed
the
bitten
curls
together
in
their
right
place
on
her
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
servant
girl
had
her
key
in
the
door
as
I
came
up
,
and
directed
me
to
this
room
telling
me
I
was
expected
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
should
have
asked
her
to
announce
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Wifler
.
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
Two
of
my
daughters

<EOS>
R.
W.
this
is
the
gentleman
who
has
taken
your
first
-
floor
,
He
was
so
good
as
to
make
an
appointment
for
to
-
night
,
when
you
would
be
at
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
dark
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Thirty
at
the
utmost
.
<EOS>
An
expressive
,
one
might
say
handsome
,
face
.
<EOS>
A
very
bad
manner
.
<EOS>
In
the
last
degree
constrained
,
reserved
,
diffident
,
troubled
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
on
Miss
Bella
for
an
instant
,
and
then
looked
at
the
ground
as
he
addressed
the
master
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seeing
that
I
am
quite
satisfied
,
Mr.
Wilfer
,
with
the
rooms
,
and
with
their
situation
,
and
with
their
price
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
a
memorandum
between
us
of
two
or
three
lines
,
and
a
payment
down
,
will
bind
the
bargain
?
<EOS>
I
wish
to
send
in
furniture
without
delay
.
"
  
<EOS>
Two
or
three
times
during
this
short
address
,
the
cherub
addressed
had
made
chubby
motions
towards
a
chair
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
now
took
it
,
laying
a
hesitating
hand
on
a
corner
of
the
table
,
and
with
another
hesitating
hand
lifting
the
crown
of
his
hat
to
his
lips
,
and
drawing
it
before
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
,
R.
W.
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
proposes
to
take
your
apartments
by
the
quarter

<EOS>
A
quarter
's
notice
on
either
side

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
mention
,
sir
,
"
insinuated
the
landlord
,
expecting
it
to
be
received
as
a
matter
of
course
,
"
the
form
of
a
reference
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
returned
the
gentleman
,
after
a
pause
,
"
that
a
reference
is
not
necessary
;
neither
,
to
say
the
truth
,
is
it
convenient
,
for
I
am
a
stranger
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
require
no
reference
from
you
,
and
perhaps
,
therefore
,
you
will
require
none
from
me
.
<EOS>
That
will
be
fair
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
show
the
greater
confidence
of
the
two
,
for
I
will
pay
in
advance
<EOS>
whatever
you
please
,
and
I
am
going
to
trust
my
furniture
here
.
<EOS>
Whereas
,
if
you
were
in
embarrassed
circumstances
 
---
this
is
merely
supposititious
---
"
  
Conscience
causing
R.
Wilfer
to
colour
,
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
from
a
corner
<EOS>
(
she
always
got
into
stately
corners
)
came
to
the
rescue
with
a
deeptoned
"
Per
-
fectly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
---
Why
then
I
---
might
lose
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
observed
R.
Wilfer
,
cheerfully
,
"
money
and
goods
are
certainly
the
best
of
references
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
think
they
are
the
best
,
pa
?
"
asked
Miss
Bella
,
in
a
low
voice
,
and
without
looking
over
her
shoulder
as
she
warmed
her
foot
on
the
fender
.
  
<EOS>
"
Among
the
best
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
,
myself
,
it
was
so
easy
to
add
the
usual
kind
of
one
,
"
said
Bella
,
with
a
toss
of
her
curls
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
listened
to
her
,
with
a
face
of
marked
attention
,
though
he
neither
looked
up
nor
changed
his
attitude
.
<EOS>
He
sat
,
still
and
silent
,
until
his
future
landlord
accepted
his
proposals
,
and
brought
writing
materials
to
complete
the
business
.
<EOS>
He
sat
,
still
and
silent
,
while
the
landlord
wrote
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
agreement
was
ready
in
duplicate
(
the
landlord
having
worked
at
it
like
some
cherubic
scribe
,
in
what
is
conventionally
called
a
doubtful
,
which
means
a
not
at
all
doubtful
,
Old
Master
)
,
it
was
signed
by
the
contracting
parties
,
Bella
looking
on
as
scornful
witness
.
<EOS>
The
contracting
parties
were
R.
Wilfer
,
and
John
Rokesmith
Esquire
.
  
<EOS>
When
it
came
to
Bella
's
turn
to
sign
her
name
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
who
was
standing
,
as
he
had
sat
,
with
a
hesitating
hand
upon
the
table
,
looked
at
her
stealthily
,
but
narrowly
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
pretty
figure
bending
down
over
the
paper
and
saying
,
"
Where
am
I
to
go
,
pa
?
<EOS>
Here
,
in
this
corner
?
"
He
looked
at
the
beautiful
brown
hair
,
shading
the
coquettish
face
;
he
looked
at
the
free
dash
of
the
signature
,
which
was
a
bold
one
for
a
woman
's
;
and
then
they
looked
at
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Much
obliged
to
you
,
Miss
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Obliged
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
given
you
so
much
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Signing
my
name
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
your
landlord
's
daughter
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
but
pay
eight
sovereigns
in
earnest
of
the
bargain
,
pocket
the
agreement
,
appoint
a
time
for
the
arrival
of
his
furniture
and
himself
,
and
go
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
did
that
as
awkwardly
as
it
might
be
done
,
and
was
escorted
by
his
landlord
to
the
outer
air
.
<EOS>
When
R.
Wilfer
returned
,
candlestick
in
hand
,
to
the
bosom
of
his
family
,
he
found
the
bosom
agitated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
we
have
got
a
Murderer
for
a
tenant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pa
,
"
said
Lavinia
,
"
we
have
got
a
Robber
,
"
  
"
To
see
him
unable
for
his
life
to
look
anybody
in
the
face
!
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
There
never
was
such
an
exhibition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dears
,
"
said
their
father
,
"
he
is
a
diffident
gentleman
,
and
I
should
say
particularly
so
in
the
society
of
girls
of
your
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
our
age
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
,
impatiently
,
"
What
's
that
got
to
do
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
we
are
not
of
the
same
age
:
---
which
age
?
"
demanded
Lavinia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Never
you
mind
,
Lavvy
,
"
retorted
Bella
;
"
you
wait
till
you
are
of
an
age
to
ask
such
questions
.
<EOS>
Pa
,
mark
my
words
!
<EOS>
Between
Mr.
Rokesmith
and
me
,
there
is
a
natural
antipathy
and
a
deep
distrust
;
 
and
something
will
come
of
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
and
girls
,
"
said
the
cherub
-
patriarch
,
"
between
Mr.
Rokesmith
and
me
<EOS>
,
there
is
a
matter
of
eight
sovereigns
,
and
something
for
super
shall
come
of
it
,
if
you
'll
agree
upon
the
article
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
neat
and
happy
turn
to
give
the
subject
,
treats
being
rare
in
the
Wilfer
household
,
where
a
monotonous
appearance
of
Dutch
-
cheese
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
evening
had
been
rather
frequently
commented
on
by
the
dimpled
shoulders
of
Miss
Bella
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
modest
Dutchman
himself
seemed
conscious
of
his
want
of
variety
,
and
generally
came
before
the
family
in
a
state
of
apologetic
perspiration
.
<EOS>
After
some
discussion
on
the
relative
merits
of
veal
-
cutlet
,
sweetbread
,
and
lobster
,
a
decision
was
pronounced
in
favour
of
veal
-
cutlet
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
then
solemnly
divested
herself
of
her
handkerchief
and
gloves
,
as
a
preliminary
sacrifice
to
preparing
the
frying
-
pan
,
and
R.
W.
himself
went
out
to
purchase
the
viand
.
<EOS>
He
soon
returned
,
bearing
the
same
in
a
fresh
cabbage
-
leaf
,
where
it
coyly
embraced
a
rasher
of
ham
.
<EOS>
Melodious
sounds
were
not
long
in
rising
from
the
frying
-
pan
on
the
fire
,
or
in
seeming
,
as
the
firelight
danced
in
the
mellow
halls
of
a
couple
of
full
bottles
on
the
table
,
to
play
appropriate
dance
-
music
.
  
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
laid
by
Lavvy
.
<EOS>
Bella
,
as
the
acknowledged
ornament
of
the
family
,
employed
both
her
hands
in
giving
her
hair
an
additional
wave
while
sitting
in
the
easiest
chair
,
and
occasionally
threw
in
a
direction
touching
the
supper
:
as
,
"
Very
brown
,
ma
;
"
or
,
to
her
sister
,
"
Put
the
saltcellar
straight
,
miss
,
and
do
n't
be
a
dowdy
little
puss
.
"
  
<EOS>
Meantime
her
father
,
chinking
Mr.
Rokesmith
's
gold
as
he
sat
expectant
between
his
knife
and
fork
,
remarked
that
six
of
those
sovereigns
came
just
in
time
for
their
landlord
,
and
stood
them
in
a
little
pile
on
the
white
tablecloth
to
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
our
landlord
!
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
observing
a
fall
in
her
father
's
face
,
she
went
and
sat
down
by
him
at
the
table
,
and
began
touching
up
his
hair
with
the
handle
of
a
fork
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
girl
's
spoilt
ways
to
be
always
arranging
the
family
's
hair
---
perhaps
because
her
own
was
so
pretty
,
and
occupied
so
much
of
her
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
deserve
to
have
a
house
of
your
own
;
do
n't
you
,
poor
pa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
deserve
it
better
than
another
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
I
,
for
one
,
want
it
more
than
another
,
"
said
Bella
,
holding
him
by
the
chin
,
as
she
stuck
his
flaxen
hair
on
end
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
grudge
this
money
going
to
the
Monster
that
swallows
up
so
much
,
when
we
all
want
---
Everything
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
say
(
as
you
want
to
say
;
 
I
know
you
want
to
say
so
,
pa
)
`
`
that
's
neither
reasonable
nor
honest
,
Bella
,
"
"
then
I
answer
,
`
`
Maybe
not
,
pa
---
very
likely
---
<EOS>
but
it
's
one
of
the
consequences
of
being
poor
,
and
of
thoroughly
hating
and
detesting
to
be
poor
,
and
that
's
my
case
.
"
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
look
lovely
,
pa
;
 
why
do
n't
you
always
wear
your
hair
like
that
?
<EOS>
And
here
's
the
cutlet
!
<EOS>
If
it
is
n't
very
brown
,
ma
,
I
ca
n't
eat
it
,
and
must
have
a
bit
put
back
to
be
done
expressly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
However
,
as
it
was
brown
,
even
to
Bella
's
taste
,
the
young
lady
graciously
partook
of
it
without
reconsignment
to
the
frying
-
pan
,
and
also
,
in
due
course
,
of
the
contents
of
the
two
bottles
:
whereof
one
held
Scotch
ale
and
the
other
rum
.
<EOS>
The
latter
perfume
,
with
the
fostering
aid
of
boiling
water
and
lemon
-
peel
,
diffused
itself
throughout
the
room
,
and
became
so
highly
concentrated
around
the
warm
fireside
,
that
the
wind
passing
over
the
house
roof
must
have
rushed
off
charged
with
a
delicious
whiff
of
it
,
after
buzzing
like
a
great
bee
at
that
particular
chimneypot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
sipping
the
fragrant
mixture
and
warming
her
favourite
ankle
;
"
when
old
Mr.
Harmon
made
such
a
fool
of
me
(
not
to
mention
himself
,
as
he
is
dead
)
,
what
do
you
suppose
he
did
it
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
to
say
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
told
you
times
out
of
number
since
his
will
was
brought
to
light
,
I
doubt
if
I
ever
exchanged
a
hundred
words
with
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
his
whim
to
surprise
us
,
his
whim
succeeded
.
<EOS>
For
he
certainly
did
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
was
stamping
my
foot
and
screaming
,
when
he
first
took
notice
of
me
;
was
I
?
"
said
Bella
,
contemplating
the
ankle
before
mentioned
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
stamping
your
little
foot
,
my
dear
,
and
screaming
with
your
little
voice
,
and
laying
into
me
with
your
little
bonnet
,
which
you
had
snatched
off
for
the
purpose
,
"
returned
her
father
,
as
if
the
remembrance
gave
a
relish
to
the
rum
;
"
you
were
doing
this
one
Sunday
morning
when
I
took
you
out
,
because
I
did
n't
go
the
exact
way
you
wanted
,
when
the
old
gentleman
,
sitting
on
a
seat
near
,
said
,
`
`
<EOS>
That
's
a
nice
girl
;
that
's
a
very
nice
girl
;
a
promising
girl
!
"
<EOS>
"
And
so
you
were
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
he
asked
my
name
,
did
he
,
pa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
asked
your
name
,
my
dear
,
and
mine
;
and
on
other
Sunday
morning
,
when
we
walked
his
way
,
we
saw
him
again
,
and
---
  
<EOS>
and
really
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
that
was
all
the
rum
and
water
too
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
as
R.
W.
delicately
signified
that
his
glass
was
empty
,
by
throwing
back
his
head
and
standing
the
glass
upside
down
on
his
nose
and
upper
lip
,
it
might
have
been
charitable
in
Mrs.
Wilfer
to
suggest
replenishment
.
<EOS>
But
that
heroine
briefly
suggesting
"
Bedtime
"
instead
,
the
bottles
were
put
away
,
and
the
family
retired
;
she
cherubically
escorted
,
like
some
severe
saint
in
a
painting
,
or
merely
human
matron
allegorically
treated
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
by
this
time
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Lavinia
when
the
two
girls
were
alone
in
their
room
,
"
we
shall
have
Mr.
Rokesmith
here
,
and
shall
be
expecting
to
have
our
throats
cut
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
stand
between
me
and
the
candle
for
all
that
,
"
 
retorted
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
another
of
the
consequences
of
being
poor
!
<EOS>
The
idea
of
a
girl
with
a
really
fine
head
of
hair
,
having
to
do
it
by
one
flat
candle
and
a
few
inches
of
looking
-
glass
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
caught
George
Sampson
with
it
,
Bella
,
bad
as
your
means
of
dressing
it
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
low
little
thing
.
<EOS>
Caught
George
Sampson
with
it
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
talk
about
catching
people
,
miss
,
till
your
own
time
for
catching
---
as
you
call
it
---
comes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
has
come
,
"
muttered
Lavvy
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Bella
,
very
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
say
,
miss
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lavvy
declining
equally
to
repeat
or
to
explain
,
Bella
gradually
lapsed
over
her
hair
-
dressing
into
a
soliloquy
on
the
miseries
of
being
poor
,
as
exemplified
in
having
nothing
to
put
on
,
nothing
to
go
out
in
,
nothing
to
dress
by
,
only
a
nasty
box
to
dress
at
instead
of
a
commodious
dressing
-
table
,
and
being
obliged
to
take
in
suspicious
lodgers
.
<EOS>
On
the
last
grievance
as
her
climax
,
she
laid
great
stress
---
and
might
have
laid
greater
,
<EOS>
had
she
known
that
if
Mr.
Julius
Handford
had
a
twin
brother
upon
earth
,
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
was
the
man
.
   
<EOS>
BOFFIN
'S
BOWER
.
 
<EOS>
Over
against
a
London
house
,
a
corner
house
not
far
from
Cavendish
Square
,
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg
had
sat
for
some
years
,
with
his
remaining
foot
in
a
basket
in
cold
weather
,
picking
up
a
living
on
this
wise
:
---
<EOS>
Every
morning
at
eight
o'clock
,
he
stumped
to
the
corner
,
carrying
a
chair
,
a
clothes
-
horse
,
a
pair
of
trestles
,
a
board
,
a
basket
,
and
an
umbrella
,
all
strapped
together
.
<EOS>
Separating
these
,
the
board
and
trestles
became
a
counter
,
the
basket
supplied
the
few
small
lots
of
fruit
and
sweets
that
he
offered
for
sale
upon
it
and
became
a
foot
-
warmer
,
the
unfolded
clothes
-
horse
displayed
a
choice
collection
of
halfpenny
ballads
and
became
a
screen
,
and
the
stool
planted
within
it
became
his
post
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
All
weathers
saw
the
man
at
the
post
.
<EOS>
This
is
to
be
accepted
in
a
double
sense
,
for
he
contrived
a
back
to
his
wooden
stool
,
by
placing
it
against
the
lamp
-
post
.
<EOS>
When
the
weather
was
wet
,
he
put
up
his
umbrella
over
his
stock
in
trade
,
not
over
himself
;
when
the
weather
was
dry
,
he
furled
that
faded
article
,
tied
it
round
with
a
piece
of
yarn
,
and
laid
it
cross
-
wise
under
the
trestles
:
where
it
looked
like
an
unwholesomely
-
forced
lettuce
that
had
lost
in
color
and
crispness
what
it
had
gained
in
size
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
established
his
right
to
the
corner
,
by
imperceptible
prescription
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
varied
his
ground
an
inch
,
but
had
in
the
beginning
diffidently
taken
the
corner
upon
which
the
side
of
the
house
gave
.
<EOS>
A
howling
corner
in
the
winter
time
,
a
dusty
corner
in
the
summer
time
,
an
undesirable
corner
at
the
best
of
times
.
<EOS>
Shelterless
fragments
of
straw
and
paper
got
up
revolving
storms
there
,
when
the
main
street
was
at
peace
;
and
the
water
-
cart
,
as
if
it
were
drunk
or
short
-
sighted
,
came
blundering
and
jolting
round
it
,
making
it
muddy
when
all
else
was
clean
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
front
of
his
sale
-
board
hung
a
little
placard
,
like
a
kettle
-
holder
,
bearing
the
inscription
in
his
own
small
text
:
  
<EOS>
Errands
gone
 
On
with
fi
Delity
By
 
Ladies
and
Gentlemen
 
<EOS>
I
remain
 
Your
humble
Servt
:
 
Silas
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
only
settled
it
with
himself
in
course
of
time
,
that
he
was
errand
-
goer
by
appointment
to
the
house
at
the
corner
(
though
he
received
such
commissions
not
half
a
dozen
times
in
a
year
,
and
then
only
as
some
servant
's
deputy
)
,
but
also
that
he
was
one
of
the
house
's
retainers
and
owed
vassalage
to
it
and
was
bound
to
leal
and
loyal
interest
in
it
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
he
always
spoke
of
it
as
"
Our
House
,
"
and
,
though
his
knowledge
of
its
affairs
was
mostly
speculative
and
all
wrong
,
claimed
to
be
in
its
confidence
.
<EOS>
On
similar
grounds
he
never
beheld
an
inmate
at
any
one
of
its
windows
but
he
touched
his
hat
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
he
knew
so
little
about
the
inmates
that
he
gave
them
names
of
his
own
invention
:
as
"
Miss
Elizabeth
,
"
"
Master
George
,
"
"
Aunt
Jane
,
"
"
Uncle
Parker
"
---
having
no
authority
whatever
for
any
such
designations
,
but
particularly
the
last
---
to
which
,
as
a
natural
consequence
,
he
stuck
with
great
obstinacy
.
  
<EOS>
Over
the
house
itself
,
he
exercised
the
same
imaginary
power
as
over
its
inhabitants
and
their
affairs
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
been
in
it
,
the
length
of
a
piece
of
fat
black
water
-
pipe
which
trailed
itself
over
the
area
-
door
into
a
damp
stone
passage
,
and
had
rather
the
air
of
a
leech
on
the
house
that
had
"
taken
"
wonderfully
;
but
this
was
no
impediment
to
his
arranging
it
according
to
a
plan
of
his
own
.

It
was
a
great
dingy
house
with
a
quantity
of
dim
side
window
and
blank
back
premises
,
and
it
cost
his
mind
a
world
of
trouble
so
to
lay
it
out
as
to
account
for
everything
in
its
external
appearance
.
<EOS>
But
,
this
once
done
,
was
quite
satisfactory
,
and
he
rested
persuaded
,
that
he
knew
his
way
about
the
house
blindfold
:
from
the
barred
garrets
in
the
high
roof
,
to
the
two
iron
extinguishers
before
the
main
door
---
which
seemed
to
request
all
lively
visitors
to
have
the
kindness
to
put
themselves
out
,
before
entering
.
  
<EOS>
Assuredly
,
this
stall
of
Silas
Wegg
's
was
the
hardest
little
stall
of
all
the
sterile
little
stalls
in
London
.
<EOS>
It
gave
you
the
face
-
ache
to
look
at
his
apples
,
the
stomach
-
ache
to
look
at
his
oranges
,
the
toothache
to
look
at
his
nuts
.
<EOS>
Of
the
latter
commodity
he
had
always
a
grim
little
heap
,
on
which
lay
a
little
wooden
measure
which
had
no
discernible
inside
,
and
was
considered
to
represent
the
penn'orth
appointed
by
Magna
Charta
.
<EOS>
Whether
from
too
much
east
wind
or
no
---
it
was
an
easterly
corner
---
the
stall
,
the
stock
,
and
the
keeper
,
were
all
as
dry
as
the
Desert
.
<EOS>
Wegg
was
a
knotty
man
,
and
a
close
-
grained
,
with
a
face
carved
out
of
very
hard
material
,
that
had
just
as
much
play
of
expression
as
a
watchman
's
rattle
.
<EOS>
When
he
laughed
,
certain
jerks
occurred
in
it
,
and
the
rattle
sprung
.
<EOS>
Sooth
to
say
,
he
was
so
wooden
a
man
that
he
seemed
to
have
taken
his
wooden
leg
naturally
,
and
rather
suggested
to
the
fanciful
observer
,
that
he
might
be
expected
---
if
his
development
received
no
untimely
check
---
to
be
completely
set
up
with
a
pair
of
wooden
legs
in
about
six
months
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
was
an
observant
person
,
or
,
as
he
himself
said
,
"
took
a
powerful
sight
of
notice
.
"
<EOS>
He
saluted
all
his
regular
passers
-
by
every
day
,
as
he
sat
on
his
stool
backed
up
by
the
lamp
-
post
;
and
on
the
adaptable
character
of
these
salutes
he
greatly
plumed
himself
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
to
the
rector
,
he
addressed
a
bow
,
compounded
of
lay
deference
,
and
a
slight
touch
of
the
shady
preliminary
meditation
at
church
;
to
the
doctor
,
a
confidential
bow
,
as
to
a
gentleman
whose
acquaintance
with
his
inside
he
begged
respectfully
to
acknowledge
;
before
the
Quality
he
delighted
to
abase
himself
;
and
for
Uncle
Parker
,
who
was
in
the
army
(
at
least
,
so
he
had
settled
it
)
,
he
put
his
open
hand
to
the
side
of
his
hat
,
in
a
military
manner
which
that
angry
-
eyed
buttoned
-
up
inflammatory
-
faced
old
gentleman
appeared
but
imperfectly
to
appreciate
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
article
in
which
Silas
dealt
,
that
was
not
hard
,
was
gingerbread
.
<EOS>
On
a
certain
day
,
some
wretched
infant
having
purchased
the
damp
gingerbread
-
horse
(
fearfully
out
of
condition
)
,
and
the
adhesive
bird
-
cage
,
which
had
been
exposed
for
the
day
's
sale
,
he
had
taken
a
tin
box
from
under
his
stool
to
produce
a
relay
of
those
dreadful
specimens
,
and
was
going
to
look
in
at
the
lid
,
when
he
said
to
himself
,
pausing
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Here
you
are
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
words
referred
to
a
broad
,
round
-
shouldered
,
one
-
sided
old
fellow
in
mourning
,
coming
comically
ambling
towards
the
corner
,
dressed
in
a
pea
over
-
coat
,
and
carrying
a
large
stick
.
<EOS>
He
wore
thick
shoes
,
and
thick
leather
gaiters
,
and
thick
gloves
like
a
hedger
's
.
<EOS>
Both
as
to
his
dress
and
to
himself
,
he
was
of
an
overlapping
rhinoceros
build
,
with
folds
in
his
cheeks
,
and
his
forehead
,
and
his
eyelids
,
and
his
lips
,
and
his
ears
;
but
with
bright
,
eager
,
childishly
-
inquiring
,
grey
eyes
,
under
his
ragged
eyebrows
,
and
broad
-
brimmed
hat
.
<EOS>
A
very
odd
-
looking
old
fellow
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
you
are
again
,
"
repeated
Mr.
Wegg
,
musing
.
"
<EOS>
And
what
are
you
now
?
<EOS>
Are
you
in
the
Funns
,
or
where
are
you
?
<EOS>
Have
you
lately
come
to
settle
in
this
neighbourhood
,
or
do
you
own
to
another
neighbourhood
?
<EOS>
Are
you
in
independent
circumstances
,
or
is
it
wasting
the
motions
of
a
bow
on
you
?
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
I
'll
speculate
!
<EOS>
I
'll
invest
a
bow
in
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Which
Mr.
Wegg
,
having
replaced
his
tin
box
,
accordingly
did
,
as
he
rose
to
bait
his
gingerbread
-
trap
for
some
other
devoted
infant
.
<EOS>
The
salute
was
acknowledged
with
:
  
"
Morning
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Morning
!
<EOS>
Morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
Calls
me
Sir

"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
answer
.
<EOS>
A
bow
gone
!
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
Morning
,
morning

morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Appears
to
be
rather
a
'
arty
old
cock
,
too
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
as
before
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
morning
to
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
me
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
asked
his
new
acquaintance
,
stopping
in
his
amble
,
one
-
sided
,
before
the
stall
,
and
speaking
in
a
pouncing
way
,
though
with
great
good
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
noticed
you
go
past
our
house
,
sir
,
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
last
week
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
house
,
"
repeated
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Meaning
---
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
nodding
,
as
the
other
pointed
the
clumsy
forefinger
of
his
right
glove
at
the
corner
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Now
,
what
,
"
pursued
the
old
fellow
,
in
an
inquisitive
manner
,
carrying
his
knotted
stick
in
his
left
arm
as
if
it
were
a
baby
,
"
what
do
they
allow
you
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
job
work
that
I
do
for
our
house
,
"
returned
Silas
,
drily
,
and
with
reticence
;
"
it
's
not
yet
brought
to
an
exact
allowance
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
It
's
not

brought
to
an
exact

<EOS>
No

<EOS>
It

not

brought
to
an
exact
allowance
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
---
Morning
,
morning
,
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Appears
to
be
rather
a
cracked
old
cock
,
"
thought
Silas
,
qualifying
his
former
good
opinion
,
as
the
other
ambled
off
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
a
moment
he
was
back
again
with
the
question
:
  
"
How
did
you
get
your
wooden
leg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
replied
,
(
tartly
to
this
personal
inquiry
)
,
"
In
an
accident
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
I
have
n't
got
to
keep
it
warm
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
made
answer
,
in
a
sort
of
desperation
occasioned
by
the
singularity
of
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
n't
,
"
repeated
the
other
to
his
knotted
stick
,
as
he
gave
it
a
hug
;
"
he
has
n't
got
---
ha
!
---
ha
!
---
to
keep
it
warm
!
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
of
the
name
of
Boffin
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
who
was
growing
restive
under
this
examination
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
did
hear
of
the
name
of
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
no
,
"
retorted
Mr.
Wegg
,
again
approaching
desperation
;
 
"
I
ca
n't
say
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
I
do
n't
,
"
retorted
Mr.
Wegg
,
approaching
frenzy
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
do
n't
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
something
that
'll
make
you
sorry
for
that
,
"
 
said
the
stranger
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
My
name
's
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
it
!
"
returned
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
Implying
in
his
manner
the
offensive
addition
,
"
and
if
I
could
,
I
would
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
another
chance
for
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
smiling
still
,
"
Do
you
like
the
name
of
Nicodemus
?
<EOS>
Think
it
over
.
<EOS>
Nick
,
or
Noddy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
,
sir
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
rejoined
,
as
he
sat
down
on
his
stool
,
with
an
air
of
gentle
resignation
,
combined
with
melancholy
candour
;
 
"
it
is
not
a
name
as
I
could
wish
any
one
that
I
had
a
respect
for
,
to
call
me
by
;
but
there
may
be
persons
that
would
not
view
it
with
the
same
objections
.
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
know
why
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
added
,
anticipating
another
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Noddy
Boffin
,
"
said
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Noddy
.
<EOS>
That
's
my
name
.
<EOS>
Noddy
---
or
Nick
---
Boffin
.
<EOS>
What
's
your
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Silas
Wegg
.
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
bestirring
himself
to
take
the
same
precaution
as
before
,
"
I
do
n't
know
why
Silas
,
and
I
do
n't
know
why
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Wegg
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
hugging
his
stick
closer
,
"
I
want
to
make
a
sort
of
offer
to
you
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
when
you
first
see
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
wooden
Wegg
looked
at
him
with
a
meditative
eye
,
and
also
with
a
softened
air
as
descrying
possibility
of
profit
.
"
<EOS>
Let
me
think
.
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
quite
sure
,
and
yet
I
generally
take
a
powerful
sight
of
notice
,
too
.
<EOS>
Was
it
on
a
Monday
morning
,
when
the
butcher
-
boy
had
been
to
our
house
for
orders
,
and
bought
a
ballad
of
me
,
which
,
being
unacquainted
with
the
tune
<EOS>
,
I
run
it
over
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Right
,
Wegg
,
right
!
<EOS>
But
he
bought
more
than
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
sir
;
he
bought
several
;
and
wishing
to
lay
out
his
money
to
the
best
,
he
took
my
opinion
to
guide
his
choice
,
and
we
went
over
the
collection
together
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
we
did
.
<EOS>
Here
was
him
as
it
might
be
,
and
here
was
myself
as
it
might
be
,
and
there
was
you
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
as
you
identically
are
,
with
your
self
-
same
stick
under
your
very
same
arm
,
and
your
very
same
back
towards
us
.
<EOS>
To
---
be
---
sure
!
<EOS>
"
added
Mr.
Wegg
,
looking
a
little
round
Mr.
Boffin
,
to
take
him
in
the
rear
,
and
identify
this
last
extraordinary
coincidence
,
"
your
wery
self
-
same
back
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
I
was
doing
,
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
judge
,
sir
,
that
you
might
be
glancing
your
eye
down
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
listening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
you
,
indeed
?
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
dubiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
a
dishonorable
way
,
Wegg
,
because
you
was
singing
to
the
butcher
;
and
you
would
n't
sing
secrets
to
a
butcher
in
the
street
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
never
happened
that
I
did
so
yet
,
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
,
"
 
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
cautiously
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
might
do
it
.
<EOS>
A
man
ca
n't
say
what
he
might
wish
to
do
some
day
or
another
.
"
<EOS>
(
This
,
not
to
release
any
little
advantage
he
might
derive
from
Mr.
Boffin
's
avowal
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
repeated
Boffin
,
"
<EOS>
I
was
a
listening
to
you
and
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
---
you
have
n't
got
another
stool
,
have
you
?
<EOS>
I
'm
rather
thick
in
my
breath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
got
another
,
but
you
're
welcome
to
this
,
"
said
Wegg
,
resigning
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
treat
to
me
to
stand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lard
!
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
a
tone
of
great
enjoyment
,
as
he
settled
himself
down
,
still
nursing
his
stick
like
a
baby
,
"
it
's
a
pleasant
place
,
this
!
<EOS>
And
then
to
be
shut
in
on
each
side
,
with
these
ballads
,
like
so
many
book
-
leaf
blinkers
!
<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
delightful
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
not
mistaken
,
sir
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
delicately
hinted
,
resting
a
hand
on
his
stall
,
and
bending
over
the
discursive
Boffin
,
"
you
alluded
to
some
offer
or
another
that
was
in
your
mind
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
coming
to
it
!
<EOS>
All
right
.
<EOS>
I
'm
coming
to
it
!
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
say
that
when
I
listened
that
morning
,
I
listened
with
hadmiration
amounting
to
haw
.
<EOS>
I
thought
to
myself
,
`
`
Here
's
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg

a
literary
man
with

"
N

<EOS>
not
exactly
so

said
Mr.
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>

you

cried
Mr.

.
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
at
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr.
Wegg
,
with
a
conscious
inclination
of
the
head
;
"
we
'll
say
literary
,
then
.

"
`
`
A
literary

<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
thought
to
myself
,
that
morning
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Boffin
,
leaning
forward
to
describe
,
uncramped
by
the
clothes
-
horse
,
as
large
an
arc
as
his
right
arm
could
make
;
"
`
`
all

open
to

<EOS>

And
it
is
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
truly
,
sir
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
admitted
,
with
modesty
;
"
I
believe
you
could
n't
show
me
the
piece
of

that
I
would
n't
be
equal

collaring

said
Mr.

<EOS>
"
On

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
know'd
it

Then
consider
this

<EOS>
Here
am
I

a
man

all

shut
to

<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir

"
<EOS>
Mr.

returned
with
increasing
self
-
complacency

<EOS>
Education
neglected

repeated
Boffin
,
with
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
That
ai
n't
no
word
for
it

<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to

what
if
you
showed
me

B

I
could
so

give
you

for

to

"

Mr.

,
throwing
in
a
little
encouragement

that
's
something

too

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
something

answered
Mr.

I
'll
take
my

By

tapping

paying

<EOS>
"
Hem

Flattered

beginning
to
regard
himself
in
quite
a
new
light
.
<EOS>
"

<EOS>
Twopence

"
said
Boffin
,
taking
a
piece
of
chalk
from
his
pocket
and
getting
off
the
stool
to
work
the
sum
on
the
top
of
it
in
his
own
way
;

<EOS>
Pointing
to
this
result
as
a
large
and
satisfactory
one
,
Mr.
Boffin
smeared
it
out
with
his
moistened
glove
,
and
sat
down
on
the
remains
.
  
<EOS>

Wegg

<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
As
to
the
amount
of
strain
upon
the
intellect
now
.
<EOS>
Was
you
thinking
at
all
of
poetry
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
inquired
,
musing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
it
come
dearer
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
come
dearer
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
returned
.
<EOS>
"
For
when
a
person
comes
to
grind
off
poetry
night
after
night
,
it
is
but
right
he
should
expect
to
be
paid
for
its
weakening
effect
on
his
mind
.
"
  
"
To
tell
you
the
truth
Wegg
,
"
said
Boffin
,
"
I
was
n't
thinking
of
poetry
,
except
in
so
fur
as
this
:
---
If
you
was
to
happen
now
and
then
to
feel
yourself
in
the
mind
to
tip
me
and
Mrs.
<EOS>
Boffin
one
of
your
ballads
,
why
then
we
should
drop
into
poetry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
follow
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
But
not
being
a
regular
musical
professional
,
I
should
be
loath
to
engage
myself
for
that
;
and
therefore
when
I
dropped
into
poetry
,
I
should
ask
to
be
considered
so
fur
,
in
the
light
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
,
Mr.
Boffin
's
eyes
sparkled
,
and
he
shook
Silas
earnestly
by
the
hand
:
protesting
that
it
was
more
than
he
could
have
asked
,
and
that
he
took
it
very
kindly
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
the
terms
,
Wegg
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
then
demanded
,
with
unconcealed
anxiety
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
,
who
had
stimulated
this
anxiety
by
his
hard
reserve
of
manner
,
and
who
had
begun
to
understand
his
man
very
well
,
replied
with
an
air
;
as
if
he
were
saying
something
extraordinarily
generous
and
great
:
  
"
Mr.
Boffin
,
I
never
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
should
have
thought
of
you
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
admiringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
I
never
did
'
aggle
<EOS>
and
I
never
will
'
aggle
.
<EOS>
Consequently
I
meet
you
at
once
,
free
and
fair
,
with
---
Done
,
for
double
the
money
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
seemed
a
little
unprepared
for
this
conclusion
,
but
assented
,
with
the
remark
,
"
You
know
better
what
it
ought
to
be
than
I
do
,
Wegg
,
"
and
again
shook
hands
with
him
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
begin
to
night
,
Wegg
?
"
<EOS>
he
then
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
careful
to
leave
all
the
eagerness
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
no
difficulty
if
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
provided
with
the
needful
implement

Bought

said
Mr.
Boffin

<EOS>
"
The

"
inquired
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
might
have
know'd
him
without
it

"
said
Mr
Boffin
slightly
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
name
is
Decline

And

Fall

Off
The

Rooshan

Empire

<EOS>
(
Mr.
Boffin
went
over
these
stones
slowly
and
with
much
caution
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
indeed
!
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
nodding
his
head
with
an
air
of
friendly
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
him
,
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
been
not
to
say
right
slap
through
him
,
very
lately

"
 
Mr.
Wegg
made
answer
,
"
having
been
otherways
employed
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
But
know
him
?
<EOS>
Old
familiar
declining
and
falling
off
the
Rooshan
?
<EOS>
Rather
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Ever
since
I
was
not
so
high
as
your
stick
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
my
eldest
brother
left
our
cottage
to
enlist
into
the
army
.
<EOS>
On
which
occasion
,
as
the
ballad
that
was
made
about
it
describes
:
   
"
<EOS>
Beside
that
cottage
door
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
INDENT=1
   
<EOS>
A
girl
was
on
her
knees
;
  
<EOS>
She
held
aloft
a
snowy
scarf
,
Sir
,
<EOS>
INDENT=1
   
Which
(
my
eldest
brother
noticed
)
fluttered
in
the
breeze
.
  
<EOS>
She
breathed
a
prayer
for
him
,
Mr.
Boffin;INDENT=1
   
<EOS>
A
prayer
he
coold
not
hear
.
  
<EOS>
And
my
eldest
brother
lean'd
upon
his
sword
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
INDENT=1
   
And
wiped
away
a
tear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Much
impressed
by
this
family
circumstance
,
and
also
by
the
friendly
disposition
of
Mr.
Wegg
,
as
exemplified
in
his
so
soon
dropping
into
poetry
,
Mr.
Boffin
again
shook
hands
with
that
ligneous
sharper
,
and
besought
him
to
name
his
hour
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
named
eight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
I
live
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
is
called
The
Bower
.
<EOS>
Boffin
's
Bower
is
the
name
Mrs.
Boffin
christened
it
when
we
come
into
it
as
a
property
.
<EOS>
If
you
should
meet
with
anybody
that
do
n't
know
it
by
that
name
(
which
hardly
anybody
does
)
,
when
you
've
got
nigh
upon
about
a
odd
mile
,
or
say
and
a
quarter
<EOS>
if
you
like
,
up
Maiden
Lane
,
Battle
Bridge
,
<EOS>
ask
for
Harmony
Jail
,
and
you
'll
be
put
right
.
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
you
,
Wegg
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
,
"
most
jyfully
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
no
peace
or
patience
till
you
come
.
<EOS>
Print
is
now
opening
ahead
of
me
.
<EOS>
This
night
,
a
literary
man
---
with
a
wooden
leg
---
"
he
bestowed
an
admiring
look
upon
that
decoration
,
as
if
it
greatly
enhanced
the
relish
of
Mr.
Wegg
's
attainments
---
"
will
begin
to
lead
me
a
new
life
!
<EOS>
My
fist
again
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
Morning
,
morning
,
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Left
alone
at
his
stall
as
the
other
ambled
off
,
Mr.
Wegg
subsided
into
his
screen
,
produced
a
small
pocket
-
handkerchief
of
a
penitentially
-
scrubbing
character
,
and
took
himself
by
the
nose
with
a
thoughtful
aspect
.
<EOS>
Also
,
while
he
still
grasped
that
feature
,
he
directed
several
thoughtful
looks
down
the
street
,
after
the
retiring
figure
of
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
But
,
profound
gravity
sat
enthroned
on
Wegg
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
For
,
while
he
considered
within
himself
that
this
was
an
old
fellow
of
rare
simplicity
,
that
this
was
an
opportunity
to
be
improved
,
and
that
here
might
be
money
to
be
got
beyond
present
calculation
,
still
he
compromised
himself
by
no
admission
that
his
new
engagement
was
at
all
out
of
his
way
,
or
involved
the
least
element
of
the
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
would
even
have
picked
a
handsome
quarrel
with
any
one
who
should
have
challenged
his
deep
acquaintance
with
those
aforesaid
eight
volumes
of
Decline
and
Fall
.
<EOS>
His
gravity
was
unusual
,
portentous
,
and
immeasurable
,
not
because
he
admitted
any
doubt
of
himself
,
but
because
he
perceived
it
necessary
to
forestall
any
doubt
of
himself
in
others
.
<EOS>
And
herein
he
ranged
with
that
very
numerous
class
of
impostors
,
who
are
quite
as
determined
to
keep
up
appearances
to
themselves
,
as
to
their
neighbours
.
  
<EOS>
A
certain
loftiness
,
likewise
,
took
possession
of
Mr.
Wegg
;
a
condescending
sense
of
being
in
request
as
an
official
expounder
of
mysteries
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
move
him
to
commercial
greatness
,
but
rather
to
littleness
,
<EOS>
insomuch
that
if
it
had
been
within
the
possibilities
of
things
for
the
wooden
measure
to
hold
fewer
nuts
than
usual
,
it
would
have
done
so
that
day
.
<EOS>
But
,
when
night
came
,
and
with
her
veiled
eyes
beheld
him
stumping
towards
Boffin
's
Bower
,
he
was
elated
too
.
  
<EOS>
The
Bower
was
as
difficult
to
find
,
as
Fair
Rosamond
's
without
the
clue
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
having
reached
the
quarter
indicated
,
inquired
for
the
Bower
half
a
dozen
times
without
the
least
success
,
until
he
remembered
to
ask
for
Harmony
Jail
.
<EOS>
This
occasioned
a
quick
change
in
the
spirits
of
a
hoarse
gentleman
and
a
donkey
,
whom
he
had
much
perplexed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yer
mean
Old
Harmon
's
,
do
yer
?
"
said
the
hoarse
gentleman
,
who
was
driving
his
donkey
in
a
truck
,
with
a
carrot
for
a
whip
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did'nt
yer
niver
say
so
?
<EOS>
Eddard
and
me
is
a
goin'
by
him
!
<EOS>
Jump
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
complied
,
and
the
hoarse
gentleman
invited
his
attention
to
the
third
person
in
company
,
thus
;
  
"
<EOS>
Now
,
you
look
at
Eddard
's
ears
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
as
you
named
,
agin
?
<EOS>
Whisper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
whispered
,
"
Boffin
's
Bower
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eddard
!
<EOS>
(
keep
yer
hi
on

cut
away

"
  
<EOS>
Edward
,
with
his
ears
lying
back
,
remained
immoveable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eddard
!
<EOS>
(
keep
yer
hi
on
his
ears
)
cut
away
to
Old
Harmon
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
Edward
instantly
pricked
up
his
ears
to
their
utmost
,
and
rattled
off
at
such
a
pace
that
Mr.
Wegg
's
conversation
was
jolted
out
of
him
in
a
most
dislocated
state
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
-
it
-
Ev
-
verajail

"
asked
Mr.
Wegg
,
holding
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
proper
jail
,
wot
you
and
me
would
get
committed
to
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
returned
his
escort
;
"
they
giv
'
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
the
name
,
on
accounts
of
Old

living
solitary
there

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
-
why
-
did
-
they

"
asked
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
accounts
of
his
never
agreeing
with
nobody
.
<EOS>
Like
a
speeches
of
chaff
.
<EOS>
Harmon

Jail
;
Harmony

<EOS>
Working

<EOS>
"
Doyouknow

"
asked
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
!
<EOS>
Everybody
do
about
here
.
<EOS>
Eddard
knows
him
.
<EOS>
(
Keep
yer
hi
on
his
ears

)
<EOS>
Noddy
Boffin
,
Eddard
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
effect
of
the
name
was
so
very
alarming
,
in
respect
of
causing
a
temporary
disappearance
of
Edward
's
head
,
casting
his
hind
hoofs
in
the
air
,
greatly
accelerating
the
pace
and
increasing
the
jolting
,
that
Mr.
Wegg
was
fain
to
devote
his
attention
exclusively
to
holding
on
,
and
to
relinquish
his
desire
of
ascertaining
whether
this
homage
to
Boffin
was
to
be
considered
complimentary
or
the
reverse
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
,
Edward
stopped
at
a
gateway
,
and
Wegg
discreetly
lost
no
time
in
slipping
out
at
the
back
of
the
truck
.
<EOS>
The
moment
he
was
landed
,
his
late
driver
with
a
wave
of
the
carrot
,
said
"
Supper
,
Eddard
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
,
the
hind
hoofs
,
the
truck
,
and
Edward
,
all
seemed
to
fly
into
the
air
together
,
in
a
kind
of
apotheosis
.
  
<EOS>
Pushing
the
gate
,
which
stood
ajar
,
Wegg
looked
into
an
enclosed
space
where
certain
tall
dark
mounds
rose
high
against
the
sky
,
and
where
the
pathway
to
the
Bower
was
indicated
,
as
the
moonlight
showed
,
between
two
lines
of
broken
crockery
set
in
ashes
.
<EOS>
A
white
figure
advancing
along
this
path
,
proved
to
be
nothing
more
ghostly
than
Mr.
Boffin
,
easily
attired
for
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
,
in
an
undress
garment
of
short
white
smock
-
frock
.
<EOS>
Having
received
his
literary
friend
with
great
cordiality
,
he
conducted
him
to
the
interior
of
the
Bower
and
there
presented
him
to
Mrs.
Boffin
:
---
a
stout
lady
of
a
rubieund
and
cheerful
aspect
,
dressed
(
to
Mr.
Wegg
's
consternation
)
in
a
low
evening
-
dress
of
sable
satin
,
and
a
large
black
velvet
hat
and
feathers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Boffin
,
Wegg
,
"
said
Boffin
,
"
is
a
highflyer
at
Fashion
.
<EOS>
And
her
make
is
such
,
that
she
does
it
credit
.
<EOS>
As
to
myself
,
I
ai
n't
yet
as
Fash'nable
as
I
may
come
to
be
.
<EOS>
Henerietty
,
old
lady
<EOS>
,
this
is
the
gentleman
that
's
a
going
to
decline
and
fall
off
the
Rooshan
Empire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
sure
I
hope
it
'll
do
you
both
good
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
queerest
of
rooms
,
fitted
and
furnished
more
like
a
luxurious
amateur
tap
-
room
than
anything
else
within
the
ken
of
Silas
Wegg
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
wooden
settles
by
the
fire
,
one
on
either
side
of
it
,
with
a
corresponding
table
before
each
.
<EOS>
On
one
of
these
tables
,
the
eight
volumes
were
ranged
flat
,
in
a
row
,
like
a
galvanic
battery
;
on
the
other
,
certain
squat
case
-
bottles
of
inviting
appearance
seemed
to
stand
on
tiptoe
to
exchange
glances
with
Mr.
Wegg
over
a
front
row
of
tumblers
and
a
basin
of
white
sugar
.
<EOS>
On
the
hob
,
a
kettle
steamed
;
on
the
hearth
,
a
cat
reposed
.
<EOS>
Facing
the
fire
between
the
settles
,
a
sofa
,
a
footstool
,
and
a
little
table
,
formed
a
centrepiece
devoted
to
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
They
were
garish
in
taste
and
color
,
but
were
expensive
articles
of
drawing
-
room
furniture
that
had
a
very
odd
look
beside
the
settles
and
the
flaring
gaslight
pendent
from
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
flowery
carpet
on
the
floor
;
but
,
instead
of
reaching
to
the
fireside
,
its
glowing
vegetation
stopped
short
at
Mrs.
Boffin
's
footstool
,
and
gave
place
to
a
region
of
sand
and
sawdust
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
also
noticed
,
with
admiring
eyes
,
that
,
while
the
flowery
land
displayed
such
hollow
ornamentation
as
stuffed
birds
and
waxen
fruits
under
glass
-
shades
,
there
were
,
in
the
territory
where
vegetation
ceased
,
compensatory
shelves
on
which
the
best
part
of
a
large
pie
and
likewise
of
a
cold
joint
were
plainly
discernible
among
other
solids
.
<EOS>
The
room
itself
was
large
,
though
low
;
and
the
heavy
frames
of
its
old
-
fashioned
windows
,
and
the
heavy
beams
in
its
crooked
ceiling
,
seemed
to
indicate
that
it
had
once
been
a
house
of
some
mark
standing
alone
in
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
it
,
Wegg
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
his
pouncing
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
admire
it
greatly
,
sir
,
"
said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Peculiar
comfort
at
this
fireside
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
understand
it
,
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
in
a
general
way
,
sir
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
was
beginning
slowly
and
knowingly
,
with
his
head
stuck
on
one
side
,
as
evasive
people
do
begin
,
when
the
other
cut
him
short
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
understand
it
,
Wegg
,
and
I
'll
explain
it
.
<EOS>
These
arrangements
is
made
by
mutual
consent
between
Mrs.
Boffin
and
me
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
,
as
I
've
mentioned
,
is
a
highflyer
at
Fashion
;
at
present
I
'm
not
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
go
higher
than
comfort
,
and
comfort
of
the
sort
that
I
'm
equal
to
the
enjyment
of
.
<EOS>
Well
then
.
<EOS>
Where
would
be
the
good
of
Mrs.
Boffin
and
me
quarrelling
over
it
?
<EOS>
We
never
did
quarrel
,
before
we
come
into
Boffin
's
Bower
as
a
property
;
why
quarrel
when
we
have
come
into
Boffin
's
Bower
as
a
property
?
<EOS>
So
Mrs.
Boffin
,
she
keeps
up
her
part
of
the
room
,
in
her
way
;
I
keep
up
my
part
of
the
room
in
mine
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
which
we
have
at
once
,
Sociability
(
I
should
go
melancholy
mad
without
Mrs.
Boffin
)
,
Fashion
,
and
Comfort
.
<EOS>
If
I
get
by
degress
to
be
a
higher
-
flyer
at
Fashion
,
then
Mrs.
Boffin
will
by
degrees
come
for'arder
.
<EOS>
If
Mrs.
Boffin
should
ever
be
less
of
a
dab
at
Fashion
than
she
is
at
the
present
time
,
then
Mrs.
Boffin
's
carpet
would
go
back'arder
.
<EOS>
If
we
should
both
continny
as
we
are
,
why
then
here
we
are
,
and
give
us
a
kiss
,
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
who
,
perpetually
smiling
,
had
approached
and
drawn
her
plump
arm
though
her
lord
's
,
most
willingly
complied
.
<EOS>
Fashion
,
in
the
form
of
her
black
velvet
hat
and
feathers
,
tried
to
prevent
it
;
 
but
got
deservedly
crushed
in
the
endeavour
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
now
,
Wegg
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
wiping
his
mouth
with
an
air
of
much
refreshment
,
"
you
begin
to
know
us
as
we
are
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
charming
spot
,
is
the
Bower
,
but
you
must
get
to
apprechiate
it
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
spot
to
find
out
the
merits
of
,
little
by
little
,
and
a
new'un
every
day
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
serpentining
walk
up
each
of
the
mounds
,
that
gives
you
the
yard
and
neighbourhood
changing
every
moment
.
<EOS>
When
you
get
to
the
top
,
there
's
a
view
of
the
neighbouring
premises
,
not
to
be
surpassed
.
<EOS>
The
premises
of
Mrs.
Boffin
's
late
father
(
Canine
Provision
Trade
)
,
you
look
down
into
,
as
if
they
was
your
own
.
<EOS>
And
the
top
of
the
High
Mound
is
crowned
with
a
lattiee
-
work
Arbour
,
in
which
,
if
you
do
n't
read
out
loud
many
a
book
in
the
summer
,
ay
,
and
as
a
friend
,
drop
many
a
time
into
poetry
too
,
it
sha
n't
be
my
fault
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
'll
you
read
on
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
Wegg
,
as
if
there
were
nothing
new
in
his
reading
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
I
generally
do
it
on
gin
and
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keeps
the
organ
moist
,
does
it
,
Wegg
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
innocent
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
"
N
-
no
,
sir
,
"
replied
Wegg
,
coolly
<EOS>
,
"
I
should
hardly
describe
it
so
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
should
say
,
mellers
it
.
<EOS>
Mellers
it
,
is
the
word
I
should
employ
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
wooden
conceit
and
craft
kept
exact
pace
with
the
delighted
expectation
of
his
victim
.
<EOS>
The
visions
rising
before
his
mercenary
mind
,
of
the
many
ways
in
which
this
connexion
was
to
be
turned
to
account
,
never
obscured
the
foremost
idea
natural
to
a
dull
over
-
reaching
man
,
that
he
must
not
make
himself
too
cheap
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
's
Fashion
,
as
a
less
inexorable
deity
than
the
idol
usually
worshipped
under
that
name
,
did
not
forbid
her
mixing
for
her
literary
guest
,
or
asking
if
he
found
the
result
to
his
liking
.
<EOS>
On
his
returning
a
gracious
answer
and
taking
his
place
at
the
literary
settle
,
Mr.
Boffin
began
to
compose
himself
as
a
listener
,
at
the
opposite
settle
,
with
exultant
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sorry
to
deprive
you
of
a
pipe
,
Wegg
,
"
he
said
,
filling
his
own
,
"
<EOS>
but
you
ca
n't
do
both
together
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
and
another
thing
I
forgot
to
name
!
<EOS>
When
you
come
in
here
of
an
evening
,
and
look
round
you
,
and
notice
anything
on
a
shelf
that
happens
to
catch
your
fancy
,
mention
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wegg
,
who
had
been
going
to
put
on
his
spectacles
,
immediately
laid
them
down
,
with
the
sprightly
observation
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
read
my
thoughts
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Do
my
eyes
deceive
me
,
or
is
that
object
up
there
a
---
a
pie
?
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
a
pie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
a
pie
,
Wegg
,
"
replied
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
glance
of
some
little
discomfiture
at
the
Decline
and
Fall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
lost
my
smell
for
fruits
,
or
is
it
a
apple
pie
,
sir
?
"
asked
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
veal
and
ham
pie
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
indeed
,
sir
?
<EOS>
And
it
would
be
hard
,
sir
,
to
name
the
pie
that
is
a
better
pie
than
a
weal
and
hammer
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
nodding
his
head
emotionally
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
some
,
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
I
think
I
will
,
at
your
invitation
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
at
any
other
party
's
,
at
the
present
juncture
;
but
at
yours
,
sir
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
And
meaty
jelly
too
,
especially
when
a
little
salt
,
which
is
the
case
where
there
's
ham
,
is
mellering
to
the
organ
,
is
very
mellering
to
the
organ
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
did
not
say
what
organ
,
but
spoke
with
a
cheerful
generality
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
the
pie
was
brought
down
,
and
the
worthy
Mr.
Boffin
exercised
his
patience
until
Wegg
,
in
the
exercise
of
his
knife
and
fork
,
<EOS>
had
finished
the
dish
:
only
profiting
by
the
opportunity
to
inform
Wegg
that
although
it
was
not
strictly
Fashionable
to
keep
the
contents
of
a
larder
thus
exposed
to
view
,
he
(
Mr.
Boffin
)
considered
it
hospitable
;
for
the
reason
,
that
instead
of
saying
,
in
a
comparatively
unmeaning
manner
,
to
a
visitor
,
`
`
There
are
such
and
such
edibles
down
stairs
;
will
you
have
anything
up
?
"
<EOS>
"
you
took
the
bold
practical
course
of
saying
,
`
`
Cast
your
eye
along
the
shelves
,
and
,
if
you
see
anything
you
like
there
,
have
it
down
.

"
  
And
now
,
Mr.
Wegg
at
length
pushed
away
his
plate
and
put
on
his
spectacles
,
and
Mr.
Boffin
lighted
his
pipe
and
looked
with
beaming
eyes
into
the
opening
world
before
him
,
and
Mrs.
Boffin
reclined
in
a
fashionable
manner
on
her
sofa
:
as
one
who
would
be
part
of
the
audience
if
she
found
she
could
,
and
would
go
to
sleep
if
she
found
she
could
n't
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
"
began
Wegg
,
"
This
,
Mr.
Boffin
and
Lady
,
is
the
first
chapter
of
the
first
wollume
of
the
Decline
and
Fall
off
---
"
here
he
looked
hard
at
the
book
,
and
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
Wegg
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
comes
into
my
mind
,
<EOS>
do
you
know
,
sir
,
"
said
Wegg
with
an
air
of
insinuating
frankness
(
having
first
again
looked
hard
at
the
book
)
,
"
that
you
made
a
little
mistake
this
morning
,
which
I
had
meant
to
set
you
right
in
,
only
something
put
it
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
said
Rooshan
Empire
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
Rooshan
;
ai
n't
it
,
Wegg
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Roman
.
<EOS>
Roman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
difference
,
Wegg
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
difference
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
was
faltering
and
in
danger
of
breaking
down
,
when
a
bright
thought
flashed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
difference
,
sir
?
<EOS>
There
you
place
me
in
a
difficulty
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
to
observe
,
that
the
difference
is
best
postponed
to
some
other
occasion
when
Mrs.
Boffin
does
not
honor
us
with
her
company
.
<EOS>
In
Mrs.
Boffin
's
presence
,
sir
,
we
had
better
drop
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
thus
came
out
of
his
disadvantage
with
quite
a
chivalrous
air
,
and
not
only
that
,
but
by
dint
of
repeating
with
a
manly
delicacy
,
"
In
Mrs.
Boffin
's
presence
,
sir
,
we
had
better
drop
it
!
"
turned
the
disadvantage
on
Boffin
,
who
felt
that
he
had
committed
himself
in
a
very
painful
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
in
a
dry
unflinching
way
,
entered
on
his
task
;
 
going
straight
across
country
at
everything
that
came
before
him
;
 
taking
all
the
hard
words
,
biographical
and
geographical
;
getting
rather
shaken
by
Hadrian
,
Trajan
,
and
the
Antonines
;
stumbling
at
Polybius
(
pronounced
Polly
Beeious
,
and
supposed
by
Mr.
Boffin
to
be
a
Roman
virgin
,
and
by
Mrs.
Boffin
to
be
responsible
for
that
necessity
of
dropping
it
)
;
heavily
unseated
by
Titus
Antoninus
Pius
;
 
up
again
and
galloping
smoothly
with
Augustus
;
finally
,
getting
over
the
ground
well
with
Commodus
:
who
,
under
the
appellation
of
Commodious
,
was
held
by
Mr.
Boffin
to
have
been
quite
unworthy
of
his
English
origin
,
and
"
not
to
have
acted
up
to
his
name
"
in
his
government
of
the
Roman
people
.
<EOS>
With
the
death
of
this
personage
,
Mr.
Wegg
terminated
his
first
reading
;
long
before
which
consummation
several
total
eclipses
of
Mrs.
Boffin
's
candle
behind
her
black
velvet
disc
,
would
have
been
very
alarming
,
but
for
being
regularly
accompanied
by
a
potent
smell
of
burnt
pens
when
her
feathers
took
fire
,
which
acted
as
a
restorative
and
woke
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
having
read
on
by
rote
and
attached
as
few
ideas
as
possible
to
the
text
,
came
out
of
the
encounter
fresh
:
but
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
who
had
soon
laid
down
his
unfinished
pipe
,
and
had
ever
since
sat
intently
staring
with
his
eyes
and
mind
at
the
confounding
enormities
of
the
Romans
,
was
so
severely
punished
that
he
could
hardly
wish
his
literary
friend
Good
-
night
,
and
articulate
"
To
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Commodious
,
"
gasped
Mr.
Boffin
,
staring
at
the
moon
,
after
letting
Wegg
out
at
the
gate
and
fastening
it
:
"
Commodious
fights
in
that
wild
-
beast
-
show
,
seven
hundred
and
thirty
-
five
times
,
in
one
character
only
!
<EOS>
As
if
that
was
n't
stunning
enough
,
a
hundred
lions
is
turned
into
the
same
wild
-
beast
-
show
all
at
once
!
<EOS>
As
if
that
was
n't
stunning
enough
,
Commodious
,
in
another
character
,
kills
'em
all
off
in
a
hundred
goes

<EOS>
As
if
that
was
n't
stunning
enough

and
well
named
too
)
eats
six
millions

worth
,
English

<EOS>
Wegg
takes
it
easy
,
but
upon
-
my
-
soul
to
a
old
bird
like
myself
these
are
scarers
.
<EOS>
And
even
now
that
Commodious
is
strangled
,
I
do
n't
see
a
way
to
our
bettering
ourselves
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
added
as
he
turned
his
pensive
steps
towards
the
Bower
and
shook
his
head
,
"
I
did
n't
think
this
morning
there
was
half
so
many
Scarers

But

CUT

<EOS>
The
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
-
Porters
,
already
mentioned
as
a
tavern
of
a
dropsical
appearance
,
had
long
settled
down
into
a
state
of
hale
infirmity
.
<EOS>
In
its
whole
constitution
it
had
not
a
straight
floor
,
and
hardly
a
straight
line
;
but
it
had
outlasted
,
and
clearly
would
yet
outlast
,
many
a
better
-
trimmed
building
,
many
a
sprucer
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
Externally
,
it
was
a
narrow
lopsided
wooden
jumble
of
corpulent
windows
heaped
one
upon
another
as
you
might
heap
as
many
toppling
oranges
,
with
a
crazy
wooden
verandah
impending
over
the
water
;
 
indeed
the
whole
house
,
inclusive
of
the
complaining
flag
-
staff
on
the
roof
,
impended
over
the
water
,
but
seemed
to
have
got
into
the
condition
of
a
faint
-
hearted
diver
who
has
paused
so
long
on
the
brink
that
he
will
never
go
in
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
This
description
applies
to
the
river
-
frontage
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
-
Porters
.
<EOS>
The
back
of
the
establishment
,
though
the
chief
entrance
was
there
,
so
contracted
that
it
merely
represented
in
its
connexion
with
the
front
,
the
handle
of
a
flat
iron
set
upright
on
its
broadest
end
.
<EOS>
This
handle
stood
at
the
bottom
of
a
wilderness
of
court
and
alley
:
which
wilderness
pressed
so
hard
and
close
upon
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
-
Porters
as
to
leave
the
hostelry
not
an
inch
of
ground
beyond
its
door
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
in
combination
with
the
fact
that
the
house
was
all
but
afloat
at
high
water
,
when
the
Porters
had
a
family
wash
the
linen
subjected
to
that
operation
might
usually
be
seen
drying
on
lines
stretched
across
the
reception
-
rooms
and
bed
-
chambers
.
  
<EOS>
The
wood
forming
the
chimney
-
pieces
,
beams
,
partitions
,
floors
and
doors
,
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
-
Porters
,
seemed
in
its
old
age
fraught
with
confused
memories
of
its
youth
.
<EOS>
In
many
places
it
had
become
gnarled
and
riven
,
according
to
the
manner
of
old
trees
;
 
knots
started
out
of
it
;
and
here
and
there
it
seemed
to
twist
itself
into
some
likeness
of
boughs
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
second
childhood
,
it
had
an
air
of
being
in
its
own
way
garrulous
about
its
early
life
.
<EOS>
Not
without
reason
was
it
often
asserted
by
the
regular
frequenters
of
the
Porters
,
that
when
the
light
shone
full
upon
the
grain
of
certain
panels
,
and
particularly
upon
an
old
corner
cupboard
of
walnut
-
wood
in
the
bar
,
you
might
trace
little
forests
there
,
and
tiny
trees
like
the
parent
tree
,
in
full
umbrageous
leaf
.
  
<EOS>
The
bar
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
-
Porters
was
a
bar
to
soften
the
human
breast
.
<EOS>
The
available
space
in
it
was
not
much
larger
than
a
hackney
-
coach
;
but
no
one
could
have
wished
the
bar
bigger
,
that
space
was
so
girt
in
by
corpulent
little
casks
,
and
by
cordial
-
bottles
radiant
with
fictitious
grapes
in
bunches
,
and
by
lemons
in
nets
,
and
by
biscuits
in
baskets
,
and
by
the
polite
beer
-
pulls
that
made
low
bows
when
customers
were
served
with
beer
,
and
by
the
cheese
in
a
snug
corner
,
and
by
the
landlady
's
own
small
table
in
a
snugger
corner
near
the
fire
,
with
the
cloth
everlastingly
laid
.
<EOS>
This
haven
was
divided
from
the
rough
world
by
a
glass
partition
and
a
half
-
door
,
with
a
leaden
sill
upon
it
for
the
convenience
of
resting
your
liquor
;
but
,
over
this
half
-
door
the
bar
's
snugness
so
gushed
forth
,
that
,
albeit
customers
drank
there
standing
,
in
a
dark
and
draughty
passage
where
they
were
shouldered
by
other
customers
passing
in
and
out
,
they
always
appeared
to
drink
under
an
enchanting
delusion
that
they
were
in
the
bar
itself
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
both
the
tap
and
parlor
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
-
Porters
gave
upon
the
river
,
and
had
red
curtains
matching
the
noses
of
the
regular
customers
,
and
were
provided
with
comfortable
fireside
tin
utensils
,
like
models
of
sugar
-
loaf
hats
,
made
in
that
shape
that
they
might
,
with
their
pointed
ends
,
seek
out
for
themselves
glowing
nooks
in
the
depths
of
the
red
coals
,
when
they
mulled
your
ale
,
or
heated
for
you
those
delectable
drinks
,
Purl
,
Flip
,
and
Dog
's
Nose
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
humming
compounds
was
a
speciality
of
the
Porters
,
which
,
through
an
inscription
on
its
door
-
posts
,
gently
appealed
to
your
feelings
as
,
"
The
Early
Purl
House
.
<EOS>
"
For
,
it
would
seem
that
Purl
must
always
be
taken
early
;
though
whether
for
any
more
distinctly
stomachic
reason
than
that
,
as
the
early
bird
catches
the
worm
,
so
the
early
purl
catches
the
customer
,
can
not
here
be
resolved
.
<EOS>
It
only
remains
to
add
that
in
the
handle
of
the
flat
iron
,
and
opposite
the
bar
,
was
a
very
little
room
like
a
three
-
cornered
hat
,
into
which
no
direct
ray
of
sun
,
moon
,
or
star
,
ever
penetrated
,
but
which
was
superstitiously
regarded
as
a
sanctuary
replete
with
comfort
and
retirement
by
gaslight
,
and
on
the
door
of
which
was
therefore
painted
its
alluring
name
:
Cosy
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Potterson
,
sole
proprietor
and
manager
of
the
Fellowship
-
Porters
,
reigned
supreme
on
her
throne
,
the
Bar
,
and
a
man
must
have
drunk
himself
mad
drunk
indeed
if
he
thought
he
could
contest
a
point
with
her
.
<EOS>
Being
known
on
her
own
authority
as
Miss
Abbey
Potterson
,
some
water
-
side
heads
,
which
(
like
the
water
)
were
none
of
the
clearest
,
harboured
muddled
notions
that
,
because
of
her
dignity
and
firmness
,
she
was
named
after
,
or
in
some
sort
related
to
,
the
Abbey
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
But
,
Abbey
was
only
short
for
Abigail
,
by
which
name
Miss
Potterson
had
been
christened
at
Limehouse
Church
,
some
sixty
and
odd
years
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
mind
,
you
Riderhood
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
Potterson
,
with
emphatic
forefinger
over
the
half
-
door
,
"
the
Fellowships
do
n't
want
you
at
all
,
and
would
rather
by
far
have
your
room
than
your
company
;
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
were
as
welcome
here
as
you
are
not
,
you
should
n't
even
then
have
another
drop
of
drink
here
this
night
,
after
this
present
pint
of
beer
.
<EOS>
So
make
the
most
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
know
,
Miss
Potterson
,
"
this
was
suggested
very
meekly
though
,
"
if
I
behave
myself
,
you
ca
n't
help
serving
me
,
miss
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't

"
said
Abbey
,
with
infinite
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
No

Miss
Potterson
;
because
,
you
see
,
the
law
---
"
  
"
I
am
the
law
here
,
my
man
,
"
returned
Miss
Abbey
,
"
and
I
'll
soon
convince
you
of
that
,
if
you
doubt
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
said
I
did
doubt
it
at
all
,
Miss
Abbey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
better
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Abbey
the
supreme
threw
the
customer
's
halfpence
into
the
till
,
and
,
seating
herself
in
her
fireside
-
chair
,
resumed
the
newspaper
she
had
been
reading
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
tall
,
upright
,
well
-
favoured
woman
,
though
severe
of
countenance
,
and
had
more
of
the
air
of
a
schoolmistress
than
mistress
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
-
Porters
.
<EOS>
The
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
half
-
door
,
was
a
waterside
-
man
with
a
squinting
leer
,
and
he
eyed
her
as
if
he
were
one
of
her
pupils
in
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
cruel
hard
upon
me
,
Miss
Potterson
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Potterson
read
her
newspaper
with
contracted
brows
,
and
took
no
notice
until
he
whispered
:
  
"
Miss
Potterson
!
<EOS>
Ma'am
!
<EOS>
Might
I
have
half
a
word
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Deigning
then
to
turn
her
eyes
sideways
towards
the
suppliant
,
Miss
Potterson
beheld
him
knuckling
his
low
forehead
,
and
ducking
at
her
with
his
head
,
as
if
he
were
asking
leave
to
fling
himself
<EOS>
head
foremost
over
the
half
-
door
and
alight
on
his
feet
in
the
bar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
said
Miss
Potterson
,
with
a
manner
as
short
as
she
herself
was
long
,
"
say
your
half
word
.
<EOS>
Bring
it
out

"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss

take
objections
to

<EOS>
"
Certainly

said
Miss
Potterson
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
that
you
're
afraid
of
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not

interposed
Miss

,
"

"
But
I
humbly
do
n't
mean
that
,
Miss
Abbey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
really
are
so
cruel
hard
upon
me
!
<EOS>
What
I
was
going
to
make
inquiries
was
no
more
than
,
might
you
have
any
apprehensions
 
---
leastways
beliefs
or
suppositions
---
that
the
company
's
property
might
n't
be
altogether
to
be
considered
safe
,
if
I
used
the
house
too
regular
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
to
know
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
Abbey
,
respectfully
meaning
no
offence
to
you
,
it
would
be
some
satisfaction
to
a
man
's
mind
,
to
understand
why
the
Fellowship
-
Porters
is
not
to
be
free
to
such
as
me
,
and
is
to
be
free
to
such
as
Gaffer
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
face
of
the
hostess
darkened
with
some
shadow
of
perplexity
,
as
she
replied
<EOS>
:
"
Gaffer
has
never
been
where
you
have
been
.
"
  
"
Signifying
in
Quod
,
Miss
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
But
he
may
have
merited
it
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
suspected
of
far
worse
than
ever
I
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
suspects
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Many
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
One
,
beyond
all
doubts
.
<EOS>
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
much
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
Potterson
,
knitting
her
brows
again
with
disdain
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
was
his
pardner
.
<EOS>
Mind
you
,
Miss
Abbey
,
I
was
his
pardner
.
<EOS>
As
such
I
know
more
of
the
ins
and
outs
of
him
than
any
person
living
does
.
<EOS>
Notice
this
!
<EOS>
I
am
the
man
that
was
his
pardner
,
and
I
am
the
man
that
suspects
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
suggested
Miss
Abbey
,
though
with
a
deeper
shade
of
perplexity
than
before
,
"
you
criminate
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
I
do
n't
,
Miss
Abbey
.
<EOS>
For
how
does
it
stand
?
<EOS>
It
stands
this
way
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
his
pardner
,
I
could
n't
never
give
him
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Why
could
n't
I
never
give
him
satisfaction
?
<EOS>
Because
my
luck
was
bad
;
because
I
could
n't
find
many
enough
of
'em
.
<EOS>
How
was
his
luck
?
<EOS>
Always
good
.
<EOS>
Notice
this
!
<EOS>
Always
good
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
There
's
a
many
games
,
Miss
Abbey
,
in
which
there
's
chance
,
but
there
's
a
many
others
in
which
there
's
skill
too
,
mixed
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
Gaffer
has
a
skill
in
finding
what
he
finds
,
who
doubts
,
man
?
"
asked
Miss
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
skill
in
purwiding
what
he
finds
,
perhaps
<EOS>
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
shaking
his
evil
head
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Abbey
knitted
her
brow
at
him
,
as
he
darkly
leered
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
out
upon
the
river
pretty
nigh
every
tide
,
and
if
you
want
to
find
a
man
or
woman
in
the
river
,
you
'll
greatly
help
your
luck
,
Miss
Abbey
,
by
knocking
a
man
or
woman
on
the
head
aforehand
and
pitching
'em
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gracious
Lud
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
involuntary
exclamation
of
Miss
Potter
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
you
!
"
returned
the
other
,
stretching
forward
over
the
half
door
to
throw
his
words
into
the
bar
;
for
his
voice
was
as
if
the
head
of
his
boat
's
mop
were
down
his
throat
;
"
I
say
so
,
Miss
Abbey
!
<EOS>
And
mind
you
!
<EOS>
I
'll
follow
him
up
,
Miss
Abbey
!
<EOS>
And
mind
you
!
<EOS>
I
'll
bring
him
to
book
at
last
,
if
its
twenty
year
<EOS>
hence
,
I
will
!
<EOS>
Who
's
he
,
to
be
favoured
along
of
his
daughter
?
<EOS>
Ai
n't
I
got
a
daughter
of
my
own
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
flourish
,
and
seeming
to
have
talked
himself
rather
more
drunk
and
much
more
ferocious
than
he
had
begun
by
being
,
Mr.
Riderhood
took
up
his
pint
pot
and
swaggered
off
to
the
tap
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Gaffer
was
not
there
,
but
a
pretty
strong
muster
of
Miss
Abbey
's
pupils
were
,
who
exhibited
,
when
occasion
required
,
the
greatest
docility
.
<EOS>
On
the
clock
's
striking
ten
,
and
Miss
Abbey
's
appearing
at
the
door
,
and
addressing
a
certain
person
in
a
faded
scarlet
jacket
,
with
"
George
Jones
,
your
time
's
up
!
<EOS>
I
told
your
wife
you
should
be
punctual
,
"
Jones
submissively
rose
,
gave
the
company
good
-
night
,
and
retired
.
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
ten
,
on
Miss
Abbey
's
looking
in
again
,
and
saying
,
"
William
Williams
,
Bob
Glamour
,
and
Jonathan
,
you
are
all
due
,
"
Williams
,
Bob
,
and
Jonathan
with
similar
meekness
took
their
leave
and
evaporated
.
<EOS>
Greater
wonder
than
these
,
when
a
bottle
-
nosed
person
in
a
glazed
hat
had
after
some
considerable
hesitation
ordered
another
glass
of
gin
and
water
of
the
attendant
potboy
,
and
when
Miss
Abbey
,
instead
of
sending
it
,
appeared
in
person
,
saying
,
"
Captain
Joey
,
you
have
had
as
much
as
will
do
you
good
,
"
not
only
did
the
captain
feebly
rub
his
knees
and
contemplate
the
fire
without
offering
a
word
of
protest
,
but
the
rest
of
the
company
murmured
,
"
Ay
,
ay
,
Captain
!
<EOS>
Miss
Abbey
's
right
;
 
<EOS>
you
be
guided
by
Miss
Abbey
,
Captain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
,
was
Miss
Abbey
's
vigilance
in
anywise
abated
by
this
submission
,
but
rather
sharpened
;
 
for
,
looking
round
on
the
deferential
faces
of
her
school
,
and
descrying
two
other
young
persons
in
need
of
admonition
<EOS>
,
she
thus
bestowed
it
:
<EOS>
"
Tom
Tootle
,
it
's
time
for
a
young
fellow
who
's
going
to
be
married
next
month
,
to
be
at
home
and
asleep
.
<EOS>
And
you
need
n't
nudge
him
,
Mr.
Jack
Mullins
,
for
I
know
your
work
begins
early
to
-
morrow
,
and
I
say
the
same
to
you
.
<EOS>
So
come
!
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
like
good
lads
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
the
blushing
Tootle
looked
to
Mullins
,
and
the
blushing
Mullins
looked
to
Tootle
,
on
the
question
who
should
rise
first
,
and
finally
both
rose
together
and
went
out
on
the
broad
grin
,
followed
by
Miss
Abbey
;
in
whose
presence
the
company
did
not
take
the
liberty
of
grinning
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
In
such
an
establishment
,
the
white
-
aproned
pot
-
boy
with
his
shirt
-
sleeves
arranged
in
a
tight
roll
on
each
bare
shoulder
,
was
a
mere
hint
of
the
possibility
of
physical
force
,
thrown
out
as
a
matter
of
state
and
form
.
<EOS>
Exactly
at
the
closing
hour
,
all
the
guests
who
were
left
,
filed
out
in
the
best
order
:
Miss
Abbey
standing
at
the
half
door
of
the
bar
,
to
hold
a
ceremony
of
review
and
dismissal
.
<EOS>
All
wished
Miss
Abbey
good
-
night
,
and
Miss
Abbey
wished
good
-
night
to
all
,
except
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
The
sapient
pot
-
boy
,
looking
on
officially
,
then
had
the
conviction
borne
in
upon
his
soul
,
that
the
man
was
evermore
outcast
and
excommunicate
from
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
-
Porters
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
Bob
Glibbery
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
to
this
pot
-
boy
,
"
run
round
to
Hexam
's
and
tell
his
daughter
Lizzie
that
I
want
to
speak
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
examplary
swiftness
Bob
Glibbery
departed
,
and
returned
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
following
him
,
arrived
as
one
of
the
two
female
domestics
of
the
Fellowship
-
Porters
arranged
on
the
snug
little
table
by
the
bar
fire
,
Miss
Potterson
's
supper
of
hot
sausages
and
mashed
potatoes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
and
sit
ye
down
,
girl
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Can
you
eat
a
bit
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
thank
you
,
Miss.
<EOS>
I
have
had
my
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
mine
too
,
I
think
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
,
pushing
away
the
untasted
dish
,
"
and
more
than
enough
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
put
out
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
for
it
,
<EOS>
Miss.
"
  
"
Then
why
,
in
the
name
of
Goodness
,
"
quoth
Miss
Abbey
,
sharply
,
"
do
you
do
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
it
,
Miss
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
Do
n't
look
astonished
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
begun
with
a
word
of
explanation
,
but
it
's
my
way
to
make
short
cuts
at
things
.
<EOS>
I
always
was
a
pepperer
.
<EOS>
You
Bob
Glibbery
there
,
put
the
chain
upon
the
door
and
get
ye
down
to
your
supper
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
an
alacrity
that
seemed
no
less
referable
to
the
pepperer
fact
than
to
the
supper
fact
,
Bob
obeyed
,
and
his
boots
were
heard
descending
towards
the
bed
of
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
Hexam
,
Lizzie
Hexam
,
"
then
began
Miss
Potterson
,
"
how
often
have
I
held
out
to
you
the
opportunity
of
getting
clear
of
your
father
,
and
doing
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
often
,
Miss.
"
  
"
Very
often
?
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
And
I
might
as
well
have
spoken
to
the
iron
funnel
of
the
strongest
sea
-
going
steamer
that
passes
the
Fellowship
-
Porters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
,
"
Lizzie
pleaded
;
"
because
that
would
not
be
thankful
,
and
I
am
.
"
  
"
I
vow
and
declare
I
am
half
ashamed
of
myself
for
taking
such
an
interest
in
you
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
,
pettishly
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
do
n't
believe
I
should
do
it
if
you
were
not
good
-
looking
.
<EOS>
Why
ai
n't
you
ugly
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
merely
answered
this
difficult
question
with
an
apologetic
glance
.
  
<EOS>
"
However
,
you
ai
n't
,
"
resumed
Miss
Potterson
,
"
<EOS>
so
it
's
no
use
going
into
that
.
<EOS>
I
must
take
you
as
I
find
you
.
<EOS>
Which
indeed
is
what
I
've
done
.
<EOS>
And
you
mean
to
say
you
are
still
obstinate
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
obstinate
,
Miss
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Firm
(
I
suppose
you
call
it
)
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
<EOS>
Miss.
Fixed
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
was
an
obstinate
person
yet
,
who
would
own
to
the
word
!
"
 
remarked
Miss
Potterson
,
rubbing
her
vexed
nose
;
"
I
'm
sure
I
would
,
if
I
was
obstinate
;
but
I
am
a
pepperer
,
which
is
different
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Hexam
,
Lizzie
Hexam
,
think
again
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
the
worst
of
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
know
the
worst
of
father
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
,
opening
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
the
suspicions
to
which
your
father
makes
himself
liable
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
the
suspicions
that
are
actually
about
,
against
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
consciousness
of
what
he
habitually
did
,
oppressed
the
girl
heavily
,
and
she
slowly
cast
down
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
?
"
urged
Miss
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Please
to
tell
me
what
the
suspicions
are
,
Miss
,
"
she
asked
after
a
silence
,
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
an
easy
thing
to
tell
a
daughter
,
but
it
must
be
told
.
<EOS>
It
is
thought
by
some
,
then
,
that
your
father
helps
to
their
death
a
few
of
those
that
he
finds
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
relief
of
hearing
what
she
felt
sure
was
a
false
suspicion
,
in
place
of
the
expected
real
and
true
one
,
so
lightened
Lizzie
's
breast
for
the
moment
,
that
Miss
Abbey
was
amazed
at
her
demeanour
.
<EOS>
She
raised
her
eyes
quickly
,
shook
her
head
,
and
,
in
a
kind
of
triumph
,
almost
laughed
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
little
know
father
who
talk
like
that
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
She
takes
it
,
"
thought
Miss
Abbey
,
"
very
quietly
.
<EOS>
She
takes
it
with
extraordinary
quietness
!
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
And
perhaps
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
as
a
recollection
flashed
upon
her
,
"
it
is
some
one
who
has
a
grudge
against
father
;
some
one
who
has
threatened
father
!
<EOS>
Is
it
Riderhood
,
Miss
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
;
yes
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
He
was
father
's
partner
,
and
father
broke
with
him
,
and
now
he
revenges
himself
.
<EOS>
Father
broke
with
him
when
I
was
by
,
and
he
was
very
angry
at
it
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
Miss
Abbey
!
---
Will
you
never
,
without
strong
reason
,
lot
pass
your
lips
what
I
am
going
to
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
bent
forward
to
say
it
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
on
the
night
when
the
Harmon
murder
was
found
out
,
through
father
,
just
above
bridge
.
<EOS>
And
just
below
bridge
,
as
we
were
sculling
home
,
Riderhood
crept
out
of
the
dark
in
his
boat
.
<EOS>
And
many
and
many
times
afterwards
,
when
such
great
pains
were
taken
to
come
to
the
bottom
of
the
crime
,
and
it
never
could
be
come
near
,
I
thought
in
my
own
thoughts
,
could
Riderhood
himself
have
done
the
murder
,
and
did
he
purposely
let
father
find
the
body
?
<EOS>
It
seemed
a'most
wicked
and
cruel
to
so
much
as
think
such
a
thing
;
but
now
that
he
tries
to
throw
it
upon
father
,
I
go
back
to
it
as
if
it
was
a
truth
.
<EOS>
Can
it
be
a
truth
?
<EOS>
That
was
put
into
my
mind
by
the
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
asked
this
question
,
rather
of
the
fire
than
of
the
hostess
of
the
Fellowship
-
Porters
,
and
looked
round
the
little
bar
with
troubled
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
Miss
Potterson
,
as
a
ready
schoolmistress
accustomed
to
bring
her
pupils
to
book
,
set
the
matter
in
a
light
that
was
essentially
of
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
poor
deluded
girl
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
"
do
n't
you
see
that
you
ca
n't
open
your
mind
to
particular
suspicions
of
one
of
the
two
,
without
opening
your
mind
to
general
suspicions
of
the
other
?
<EOS>
They
had
worked
together
.
<EOS>
Their
goings
-
on
had
been
going
on
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Even
granting
that
it
was
as
you
have
had
in
your
thoughts
,
what
the
two
had
done
together
would
come
familiar
to
the
mind
of
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
father
,
Miss
,
when
you
talk
like
that
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
indeed
,
you
do
n't
know
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lizzie
,
Lizzie
,
"
said
Miss
Potterson
.
<EOS>
"
Leave
him
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
break
with
him
altogether
,
but
leave
him
.
<EOS>
Do
well
away
from
him
;
 
not
because
of
what
I
have
told
you
to
-
night
---
we
'll
pass
no
judgment
upon
that
,
and
we
'll
hope
it
may
not
be
---
but
because
of
what
I
have
urged
on
you
before
.
<EOS>
No
matter
whether
it
's
owing
to
your
good
looks
or
not
,
I
like
you
<EOS>
and
I
want
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
come
under
my
direction
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
fling
yourself
away
,
my
girl
,
but
be
persuaded
into
being
respectable
and
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
sound
good
feeling
and
good
sense
of
her
entreaty
,
Miss
Abbey
had
softened
into
a
soothing
tone
,
and
had
even
drawn
her
arm
<EOS>
round
the
girl
's
waist
.
<EOS>
But
,
she
only
replied
,
"
Thank
you
,
thank
you
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
harder
father
is
borne
upon
,
the
more
he
needs
me
to
lean
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
Miss
Abbey
,
who
,
like
all
hard
people
when
they
do
soften
,
felt
that
there
was
considerable
compensation
owing
to
her
,
underwent
reaction
and
became
frigid
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
what
I
can
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
you
must
go
your
way
.
<EOS>
You
make
your
bed
,
and
you
must
lie
on
it
.
<EOS>
But
tell
your
father
one
thing
:
he
must
not
come
here
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Miss
,
will
you
forbid
him
the
house
where
I
know
he
's
safe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Fellowships
,
"
returned
Miss
Abbey
,
"
has
itself
to
look
to
,
as
well
as
others
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
hard
work
to
establish
order
here
,
and
make
the
Fellowships
what
it
is
,
and
it
is
daily
and
nightly
hard
work
to
keep
it
so
.
<EOS>
The
Fellowships
must
not
have
a
taint
upon
it
that
may
give
it
a
bad
name
.
<EOS>
I
forbid
the
house
to
Riderhood
,
and
I
forbid
the
house
to
Gaffer
.
<EOS>
I
forbid
both
,
equally
.
<EOS>
I
find
from
Riderhood
and
you
together
,
that
there
are
suspicions
against
both
men
,
and
I
'm
not
going
to
take
upon
myself
to
decide
betwixt
them
.
<EOS>
They
are
both
tarred
with
a
dirty
brush
,
and
I
ca
n't
have
the
Fellowships
tarred
with
the
same
brush
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Good
-
night
,
Miss
!
"
said
Lizzie
Hexam
,
sorrowfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
---
Good
-
night
!
"
returned
Miss
Abbey
with
a
shake
of
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Believe
me
,
Miss
Abbey
,
I
am
truly
grateful
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
believe
a
good
deal
,
"
returned
the
stately
Abbey
,
"
<EOS>
so
I
'll
try
to
believe
that
too
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
supper
did
Miss
Potterson
take
that
night
,
and
only
half
her
usual
tumbler
of
hot
Port
Negus
.
<EOS>
And
the
female
domestics
---
two
robust
sisters
,
with
staring
black
eyes
,
shining
flat
red
faces
,
blunt
noses
,
and
strong
black
curls
,
like
dolls
---
interchanged
the
sentiment
that
Missis
had
had
her
hair
combed
the
wrong
way
by
somebody
.
<EOS>
And
the
pot
-
boy
afterwards
remarked
,
that
he
had
n't
been
"
so
rattled
to
bed
,
"
since
his
late
mother
had
systematically
accelerated
his
retirement
to
rest
with
a
poker
.
  
<EOS>
The
chaining
of
the
door
behind
her
,
as
she
went
forth
,
disenchanted
Lizzie
Hexam
of
that
first
relief
she
had
felt
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
black
and
shrill
,
the
river
-
side
wilderness
was
melancholy
,
and
there
was
a
sound
of
casting
-
out
,
in
the
rattling
of
the
iron
-
links
,
and
the
grating
of
the
bolts
and
staples
under
Miss
Abbey
's
hand
.
<EOS>
As
she
came
beneath
the
lowering
sky
,
a
sense
of
being
involved
in
a
murky
shade
of
Murder
dropped
upon
her
;
and
,
as
the
tidal
swell
of
the
river
broke
at
her
feet
without
her
seeing
how
it
gathered
,
so
,
her
thoughts
startled
her
by
rushing
out
of
an
unseen
void
and
striking
at
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Of
her
father
's
being
groundlessly
suspected
,
she
felt
sure
.
<EOS>
Sure
.
<EOS>
Sure
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
repeat
the
word
inwardly
as
often
as
she
would
,
the
attempt
to
reason
out
and
prove
that
she
was
sure
,
always
came
after
it
and
failed
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
had
done
the
deed
,
and
entrapped
her
father
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
had
not
done
the
deed
,
but
had
resolved
in
his
malice
to
turn
against
her
father
,
the
appearances
that
were
ready
to
his
hand
to
distort
.
<EOS>
Equally
and
swiftly
upon
either
putting
of
the
case
,
followed
the
frightful
possibility
that
her
father
,
being
innocent
,
yet
might
come
to
be
believed
guilty
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
of
people
suffering
Death
for
bloodshed
of
which
they
were
afterwards
proved
pure
,
and
those
ill
-
fated
persons
were
not
,
first
,
in
that
dangerous
wrong
in
which
her
father
stood
.
<EOS>
Then
at
the
best
,
the
beginning
of
his
being
set
apart
,
whispered
against
,
and
avoided
,
was
a
certain
fact
.
<EOS>
It
dated
from
that
very
night
.
<EOS>
And
as
the
great
black
river
with
its
dreary
shores
was
soon
lost
to
her
view
in
the
gloom
,
so
,
she
stood
on
the
river
's
brink
unable
to
see
into
the
vast
blank
misery
of
a
life
suspected
,
and
fallen
away
from
by
good
and
bad
,
but
knowing
that
it
lay
there
dim
before
her
,
stretching
away
to
the
great
ocean
,
Death
.
  
<EOS>
One
thing
only
,
was
clear
to
the
girl
's
mind
.
<EOS>
Accustomed
from
her
very
babyhood
promptly
to
do
the
thing
that
could
be
done
---
  
whether
to
keep
out
weather
,
to
ward
off
cold
,
to
postpone
hunger
,
or
what
not
---
she
started
out
of
her
meditation
,
and
ran
home
.
  
<EOS>
The
room
was
quiet
,
and
the
lamp
burnt
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
In
the
bunk
in
the
corner
,
her
brother
lay
asleep
.
<EOS>
She
bent
over
him
softly
,
kissed
him
,
and
came
to
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
the
time
of
Miss
Abbey
's
closing
,
and
by
the
run
of
the
tide
,
it
must
be
one
.
<EOS>
Tide
's
running
up
.
<EOS>
Father
at
Chiswick
,
would
n't
think
of
coming
down
,
till
after
the
turn
,
and
that
's
at
half
after
four
.
<EOS>
I
'll
call
Charley
at
six
.
<EOS>
I
shall
hear
the
church
-
clocks
strike
,
as
I
sit
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Very
quietly
,
she
placed
a
chair
before
the
scanty
fire
,
and
sat
down
in
it
,
drawing
her
shawl
about
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
's
hollow
down
by
the
flare
is
not
there
now
.
<EOS>
Poor
Charley
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
clock
struck
two
,
and
the
clock
struck
three
,
and
the
clock
struck
four
,
and
she
remained
there
,
with
a
woman
's
patience
and
her
own
purpose
.
<EOS>
When
the
morning
was
well
on
between
four
and
five
,
she
slipped
off
her
shoes
(
that
her
going
about
,
might
not
wake
Charley
)
,
trimmed
the
fire
sparingly
,
put
water
on
to
boil
,
and
set
the
table
the
table
for
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Then
she
went
up
the
ladder
,
lamp
in
hand
,
and
came
down
again
,
and
glided
about
and
about
,
making
a
little
bundle
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
from
her
pocket
,
and
from
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
from
an
inverted
basin
on
the
highest
shelf
,
she
brought
halfpence
,
a
few
sixpences
,
fewer
shillings
,
and
fell
to
laboriously
and
noiselessly
counting
them
,
and
setting
aside
one
little
heap
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
so
engaged
,
when
she
was
startled
by
:
  
"
Hal
-
loa
!
"
<EOS>
From
her
brother
,
sitting
up
in
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
made
me
jump
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jump
!
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
make
me
jump
,
when
I
opened
my
eyes
a
moment
ago
,
and
saw
you
sitting
there
,
like
the
ghost
of
a
girl
-
miser
,
in
the
dead
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
the
dead
of
the
night
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
It
's
nigh
six
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
though
?
<EOS>
But
what
are
you
up
to
,
Liz
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Still
telling
your
fortune
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
be
a
precious
small
one
,
if
that
's
it
,
"
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
putting
that
little
pile
of
money
by
itself
for
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
For
you
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Get
out
of
bed
,
Charley
,
and
get
washed
and
dressed
,
and
then
I
'll
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
composed
manner
,
and
her
low
distinct
voice
,
always
had
an
influence
over
him
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
soon
in
a
basin
of
water
,
and
out
of
it
again
,
and
staring
at
her
through
a
storm
of
towelling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
,
"
towelling
at
himself
as
if
he
were
his
bitterest
enemy
,
"
saw
such
a
girl
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
What
is
the
move
,
Liz
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
almost
ready
for
breakfast
,
Charley
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
pour
it
out
.
<EOS>
Hal
-
loa
!
<EOS>
I
say
?
<EOS>
And
a
bundle
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
a
bundle
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
it
's
for
me
,
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Charley
;
I
do
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
More
serious
of
face
,
and
more
slow
of
action
,
than
he
had
been
,
the
boy
completed
his
dressing
,
and
came
and
sat
down
at
the
little
breakfast
-
table
,
with
his
eyes
amazedly
directed
to
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Charley
dear
,
I
have
made
up
my
mind
that
this
is
the
right
time
for
your
going
away
from
us
.
<EOS>
Over
and
above
all
the
blessed
change
of
by
-
and
-
bye
,
you
'll
be
much
happier
,
and
do
much
better
,
even
so
soon
as
next
month
.
<EOS>
Even
so
soon
as
next
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
I
shall
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
quite
know
how
,
Charley
,
but
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
spite
of
her
unchanged
manner
of
speaking
,
and
her
unchanged
appearance
of
composure
,
she
scarcely
trusted
herself
to
look
at
him
,
but
kept
her
eyes
employed
on
the
cutting
and
buttering
of
his
bread
,
and
on
the
mixing
of
his
tea
,
and
other
such
little
preparations
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
leave
father
to
me
,
Charley
---
I
will
do
what
I
can
with
him
---
  
<EOS>
but
you
must
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
stand
upon
ceremony
,
I
think
,
"
grumbled
the
boy
,
throwing
his
bread
and
butter
about
,
in
an
ill
-
humour
.
  
<EOS>
She
made
him
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
"
said
the
boy
,
then
,
bursting
out
into
an
angry
whimpering
,
"
you
're
a
selfish
jade
,
and
you
think
there
's
not
enough
for
three
of
us
,
and
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
believe
so
,
Charley
,
---
yes
,
then
I
believe
too
,
that
I
am
a
selfish
jade
,
and
that
I
think
there
's
not
enough
for
three
of
us
,
and
that
I
want
to
get
rid
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
the
boy
rushed
at
her
,
and
threw
his
arms
round
her
neck
,
that
she
lost
her
self
-
restraint
.
<EOS>
But
she
lost
it
then
,
and
wept
over
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
cry
,
do
n't
cry
!
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied
to
go
,
Liz
;
I
am
satisfied
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
send
me
away
for
my
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
,
Charley
,
Charley
,
Heaven
above
us
knows
I
do
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
mind
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
remember
it
.
<EOS>
Kiss
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
silence
,
she
loosed
him
,
to
dry
her
eyes
and
regain
her
strong
quiet
influence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
listen
,
Charley
dear
.
<EOS>
We
both
know
it
must
be
done
,
and
I
alone
know
there
is
good
reason
for
its
being
done
at
once
.
<EOS>
Go
straight
to
the
school
,
and
say
that
you
and
I
agreed
upon
it
---
that
we
ca
n't
overcome
father
's
opposition
---
that
father
will
never
trouble
them
,
but
will
never
take
you
back
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
credit
to
the
school
,
and
you
will
be
a
greater
credit
to
it
yet
,
and
they
will
help
you
to
get
a
living
.
<EOS>
Show
what
clothes
you
have
brought
,
and
what
money
,
and
say
that
I
will
send
some
more
money
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
get
some
in
no
other
way
,
I
will
ask
a
little
help
of
those
two
gentlemen
who
came
here
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
"
cried
her
brother
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
have
it
of
that
chap
that
took
hold
of
me
by
the
chin
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
have
it
of
that
Wrayburn
one
!
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
a
slight
additional
tinge
of
red
flashed
up
into
her
face
and
brow
,
as
with
a
nod
she
laid
a
hand
upon
his
lips
to
keep
him
silently
attentive
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
above
all
things
mind
this
,
Charley
!
<EOS>
Be
sure
you
always
speak
well
of
father
.
<EOS>
Be
sure
you
always
give
father
his
full
due
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
deny
that
because
father
has
no
learning
himself
he
is
set
against
it
in
you
;
but
favour
nothing
else
against
him
,
and
be
sure
you
say
---
as
you
know
---
that
your
sister
is
devoted
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
should
ever
happen
to
hear
anything
said
against
father
that
is
new
to
you
,
it
will
not
be
true
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
Charley
!
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
true
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
looked
at
her
with
some
doubt
and
surprise
,
but
she
went
on
again
without
heeding
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Above
all
things
remember
!
<EOS>
It
will
not
be
true
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
<EOS>
Charley
dear
,
except
,
be
good
,
and
get
learning
,
and
only
think
of
some
things
in
the
old
life
here
,
as
if
you
had
dreamed
them
in
a
dream
last
night
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
my
Darling
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Though
so
young
,
she
infused
into
these
parting
words
a
love
that
was
far
more
like
a
mother
's
than
a
sister
's
,
and
before
which
the
boy
was
quite
bowed
down
.
<EOS>
After
holding
her
to
his
breast
with
a
passionate
cry
,
he
took
up
his
bundle
and
darted
out
at
the
door
,
with
an
arm
across
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
The
white
face
of
the
winter
day
came
sluggishly
on
,
veiled
in
a
frosty
mist
;
and
the
shadowy
ships
in
the
river
slowly
changed
to
black
substances
;
and
the
sun
,
blood
-
red
on
the
eastern
marshes
behind
dark
masts
and
yards
,
seemed
filled
with
the
ruins
of
a
forest
it
had
set
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
looking
for
her
father
,
saw
him
coming
,
and
stood
upon
the
causeway
that
he
might
see
her
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
with
him
but
his
boat
,
and
came
on
apace
.
<EOS>
A
knot
of
those
amphibious
human
-
creatures
who
appear
to
have
some
mysterious
power
of
extracting
a
subsistence
out
of
tidal
water
by
looking
at
it
,
were
gathered
together
about
the
causeway
.
<EOS>
As
her
father
's
boat
grounded
,
they
became
contemplative
of
the
mud
,
and
dispersed
themselves
.
<EOS>
She
saw
that
the
mute
avoidance
had
begun
.
  
<EOS>
Gaffer
saw
it
,
too
,
in
so
far
as
that
he
was
moved
when
he
set
foot
on
shore
,
to
stare
around
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
he
promptly
set
to
work
to
haul
up
his
boat
,
and
make
her
fast
,
and
take
the
sculls
and
rudder
and
rope
out
of
her
.
<EOS>
Carrying
these
with
Lizzie
's
aid
,
he
passed
up
to
his
dwelling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
close
to
the
fire
,
father
,
dear
,
while
I
cook
your
breakfast
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
ready
for
cooking
,
and
only
been
waiting
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
frozen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Lizzie
,
I
ai
n't
of
a
glow
;
that
's
certain
.
<EOS>
And
my
hands
seemed
nailed
through
to
the
sculls
.
<EOS>
See
how
dead
they
are
!
"
<EOS>
Something
suggestive
in
their
colour
,
and
perhaps
in
her
face
,
struck
him
as
he
held
them
up
;
he
turned
his
shoulder
and
held
them
down
to
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
out
in
the
perishing
night
,
I
hope
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Lay
aboard
a
barge
,
by
a
blazing
coal
-
fire
.
<EOS>
---
  
<EOS>
Where
's
that
boy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
drop
of
brandy
for
your
tea
,
father
,
if
you
'll
put
it
in
while
I
turn
this
bit
of
meat
.
<EOS>
If
the
river
was
to
get
frozen
,
there
would
be
a
deal
of
distress
;
would
n't
there
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
there
's
always
enough
of
that
,
"
said
Gaffer
,
dropping
the
liquor
into
his
cup
from
a
squat
black
bottle
,
and
dropping
it
slowly
that
it
might
seem
more
;
"
distress
is
for
ever
a
going
about
,
like
sut
in
the
air
---
<EOS>
Ai
n't
that
boy
up
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
meat
's
ready
now
,
father
.
<EOS>
Eat
it
while
it
's
hot
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
After
you
have
finished
,
we
'll
turn
round
to
the
fire
and
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
he
perceived
that
he
was
evaded
,
and
,
having
thrown
a
hasty
angry
glance
towards
the
bunk
,
plucked
at
a
corner
of
her
apron
and
asked
:
  
"
What
's
gone
with
that
boy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
if
you
'll
begin
your
breakfast
,
I
'll
sit
by
and
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
,
stirred
his
tea
and
took
two
or
three
gulps
,
then
cut
at
his
piece
of
hot
steak
with
his
case
-
knife
,
and
said
,
eating
:
  
"
Now
then
.
<EOS>
What
's
gone
with
that
boy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
angry
,
dear
.
<EOS>
It
seems
,
father
,
that
he
has
quite
a
gift
of
learning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unnat'ral
young
beggar
!
"
said
the
parent
,
shaking
his
knife
in
the
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
And
that
having
this
gift
,
and
not
being
equally
good
at
other
things
,
he
has
made
shift
to
get
some
schooling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unnat'ral
young
beggar
!
"
said
the
parent
again
,
with
his
former
action
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
And
that
knowing
you
have
nothing
to
spare
,
father
,
and
not
wishing
to
be
a
burden
on
you
,
he
gradually
made
up
his
mind
to
go
seek
his
fortune
out
of
learning
.
<EOS>
He
went
away
this
morning
.
<EOS>
father
,
and
he
cried
very
much
at
going
,
and
he
hoped
you
would
forgive
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
never
come
a
nigh
me
to
ask
me
my
forgiveness
,
"
said
the
father
,
again
emphasizing
his
words
with
the
knife
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
him
never
come
within
sight
of
my
eyes
,
nor
yet
within
reach
of
my
arm
.
<EOS>
His
own
father
ai
n't
good
enough
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
disowned
his
own
father
.
<EOS>
His
own
father
therefore
,
disowns
him
for
ever
and
ever
,
as
a
unnat'ral
young
beggar
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
pushed
away
his
plate
.
<EOS>
With
the
natural
need
of
a
strong
rough
man
in
anger
,
to
do
something
forcible
,
he
now
clutched
his
knife
overhand
,
and
struck
downward
with
it
at
the
end
of
every
succeeding
sentence
.
<EOS>
As
he
would
have
struck
with
his
own
clenched
fist
if
there
had
chanced
to
be
nothing
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
welcome
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
's
more
welcome
to
go
than
to
stay
.
<EOS>
But
let
him
never
come
back
.
<EOS>
Let
him
never
put
his
head
inside
that
door
.
<EOS>
And
let
you
never
speak
a
word
more
in
his
favour
,
or
you
'll
disown
your
own
father
,
likewise
,
and
what
your
father
says
of
him
he
'll
have
to
come
to
say
of
you
.
<EOS>
Now
I
see
why
them
men
yonder
held
aloof
from
me
.
<EOS>
They
says
to
one
another
,
`
`
Here
comes
the
man
as
ai
n't
good
enough
for
his
own
son
!
"
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
---
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
she
stopped
him
with
a
cry
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
her
he
saw
her
,
with
a
face
quite
strange
to
him
,
shrinking
back
against
the
wall
,
with
her
hands
before
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
do
n't
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
to
see
you
striking
with
it
.
<EOS>
Put
it
down
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
knife
;
but
in
his
astonishment
still
held
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
it
's
too
horrible
.
<EOS>
O
put
it
down
,
put
it
down
!
"
  
<EOS>
Confounded
by
her
appearance
and
exclamation
,
he
tossed
it
away
,
and
stood
up
with
his
open
hands
held
out
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
come
to
you
,
Liz
?
<EOS>
Can
you
think
I
would
strike
at
you
with
a
knife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
father
,
no
;
you
would
never
hurt
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
should
I
hurt
?
"
  
"
Nothing
,
dear
father
.
<EOS>
On
my
knees
,
I
am
certain
,
in
my
heart
and
soul
<EOS>
I
am
certain
,
nothing
!
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
dreadful
to
bear
;
for
it
looked
---
<EOS>
"
her
hands
covering
her
face
again
,
"
O
it
looked
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
it
look
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
recollection
of
his
murderous
figure
,
combining
with
her
trial
of
last
night
,
and
her
trial
of
the
morning
,
caused
her
to
drop
at
his
feet
,
without
having
answered
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
never
seen
her
so
before
.
<EOS>
He
raised
her
with
the
utmost
tenderness
,
calling
her
the
best
of
daughters
,
and
"
my
poor
pretty
creetur
,
"
and
laid
her
head
upon
his
knee
,
and
tried
to
restore
her
.
<EOS>
But
failing
,
he
laid
her
head
gently
down
again
,
got
a
pillow
and
placed
it
under
her
dark
hair
,
and
sought
on
the
table
for
a
spoonful
of
brandy
.
<EOS>
There
being
none
left
,
he
hurriedly
caught
up
the
empty
bottle
,
and
ran
out
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
He
returned
as
hurriedly
as
he
had
gone
,
with
the
bottle
still
empty
.
<EOS>
He
kneeled
down
by
her
,
took
her
head
on
his
arm
,
and
moistened
her
lips
with
a
little
water
into
which
he
dipped
his
fingers
:
saying
,
fiercely
,
as
he
looked
around
,
now
over
this
shoulder
,
now
over
that
:
  
"
<EOS>
Have
we
got
a
pest
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
Is
there
summ'at
deadly
sticking
to
my
clothes
?
<EOS>
What
's
let
loose
upon
us
?
<EOS>
Who
loosed
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
MR
.
<EOS>
WEGG
LOOKS
<EOS>
AFTER
HIMSELF
.
 
<EOS>
Silas
Wegg
,
being
on
his
road
to
the
Roman
Empire
,
approaches
it
by
way
of
Clerkenwell
.
<EOS>
The
time
is
early
in
the
evening
;
the
weather
moist
and
raw
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
finds
leisure
to
make
a
little
circuit
,
by
reason
that
he
folds
his
screen
early
,
now
that
he
combines
another
source
of
income
with
it
,
and
also
that
he
feels
it
due
to
himself
to
be
anxiously
expected
at
the
Bower
.
<EOS>
"
Boffin
will
get
all
the
eagerer
for
waiting
a
bit
,
"
says
Silas
,
screwing
up
,
as
he
stumps
along
,
first
his
right
eye
,
and
then
his
left
.
<EOS>
Which
is
something
superfluous
in
him
,
for
Nature
has
already
screwed
both
pretty
tight
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
get
on
with
him
as
I
expect
to
get
on
,
"
Silas
pursues
,
stumping
and
meditating
,
"
it
would
n't
become
me
to
leave
it
here
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
respectable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Animated
by
this
reflection
,
he
stumps
faster
,
and
looks
a
long
way
before
him
,
as
a
man
with
an
ambitious
project
in
abeyance
often
will
do
.
  
<EOS>
Aware
of
a
working
-
jeweller
population
taking
sanctuary
about
the
church
in
Clerkenwell
,
Mr.
Wegg
is
conscious
of
an
interest
in
,
and
a
respect
for
,
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
But
,
his
sensations
in
this
regard
halt
as
to
their
strict
morality
,
as
he
halts
in
his
gait
;
for
,
they
suggest
the
delights
of
a
coat
of
invisibility
in
which
to
walk
off
safely
with
the
precious
stones
and
watch
-
cases
,
but
stop
short
of
any
compunction
for
the
people
who
would
lose
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
Not
,
however
,
towards
the
"
shops
"
where
cunning
artificers
work
in
pearls
and
diamonds
and
gold
and
silver
,
making
their
hands
so
rich
,
that
the
enriched
water
in
which
they
wash
them
is
bought
for
the
refiners
;
---
not
towards
these
does
Mr.
Wegg
stump
,
but
towards
the
poorer
shops
of
small
retail
traders
in
commodities
to
eat
and
drink
and
keep
folks
warm
,
and
of
Italian
frame
-
makers
,
and
of
barbers
,
and
of
brokers
,
and
of
dealers
in
dogs
and
singing
-
birds
.
<EOS>
From
these
,
in
a
narrow
and
a
dirty
street
devoted
to
such
callings
,
Mr.
Wegg
selects
one
dark
shop
-
window
with
a
tallow
candle
dimly
burning
in
it
,
surrounded
by
a
muddle
of
objects
vaguely
resembling
pieces
of
leather
and
dry
stick
,
but
among
which
nothing
is
resolvable
into
anything
distinct
,
save
the
candle
itself
in
its
old
tin
candlestick
,
and
two
preserved
frogs
fighting
a
small
-
sword
duel
.
<EOS>
Stumping
with
fresh
vigour
,
he
goes
in
at
the
dark
greasy
entry
,
pushes
a
little
greasy
dark
reluctant
side
-
door
,
and
follows
the
door
into
the
little
dark
greasy
shop
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
dark
that
nothing
can
be
made
out
in
it
,
over
a
little
counter
,
but
another
tallow
candle
in
another
old
tin
candlestick
,
close
to
the
face
of
a
man
stooping
low
in
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
nods
to
the
face
,
"
Good
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
face
looking
up
is
a
sallow
face
with
weak
eyes
,
surmounted
by
a
tangle
of
reddish
-
dusty
hair
.
<EOS>
The
owner
of
the
face
has
no
cravat
on
,
and
has
opened
his
tumbled
shirt
-
collar
to
work
with
the
more
ease
.
<EOS>
For
the
same
reason
he
has
no
coat
on
:
only
a
loose
waistcoat
over
his
yellow
linen
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
are
like
the
over
-
tried
eyes
of
an
engraver
,
but
he
is
not
that
;
his
expression
and
stoop
are
like
those
of
a
shoemaker
,
but
he
is
not
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
evening
,
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
?
"
  
<EOS>
With
slowly
dawning
remembrance
,
Mr.
Venus
rises
,
and
holds
his
candle
over
the
little
counter
,
and
holds
it
down
towards
the
legs
,
natural
and
artificial
,
of
Mr.
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
he
says
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wegg
,
you
know
,
"
that
gentleman
explains
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
says
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Hospital
amputation
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Just
so
,
"
says
Mr.
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
quoth
Venus
.
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
Sit
down
by
the
fire
,
and
warm
your
---
your
other
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
counter
being
so
short
a
counter
that
it
leaves
the
fireplace
,
which
would
have
been
behind
it
if
it
had
been
longer
,
accessible
,
Mr.
Wegg
sits
down
on
a
box
in
front
of
the
fire
,
and
inhales
a
warm
and
comfortable
smell
which
is
not
the
smell
of
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
For
that
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
inwardly
decides
,
as
he
takes
a
corrective
sniff
or
two
,
"
is
musty
,
leathery
,
feathery
,
cellary
,
gluey
,
gummy
,
and
,
"
with
another
sniff
,
"
as
it
might
be
,
strong
of
old
pairs
of
bellows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
tea
is
drawing
,
and
my
muffin
is
on
the
hob
,
Mr.
Wegg
;
 
will
you
partake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
being
one
of
Mr.
Wegg
's
guiding
rules
in
life
always
to
partake
,
he
says
he
will
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
little
shop
is
so
excessively
dark
,
is
stuck
so
full
of
black
shelves
and
brackets
and
nooks
and
corners
,
that
he
sees
Mr.
Venus
's
cup
and
saucer
only
because
it
is
close
under
the
candle
,
and
does
not
see
from
what
mysterious
recess
Mr.
Venus
produces
another
for
himself
,
until
it
is
under
his
nose
.
<EOS>
Concurrently
,
Wegg
perceives
a
pretty
little
dead
bird
lying
on
the
counter
,
with
its
head
drooping
on
one
side
against
the
rim
of
Mr.
Venus
's
saucer
,
and
a
long
stiff
wire
piercing
its
breast
.
<EOS>
As
if
it
were
Cock
Robin
,
the
hero
of
the
ballad
,
and
Mr.
Venus
were
the
sparrow
with
his
bow
and
arrow
,
and
Mr.
Wegg
were
the
fly
with
his
little
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
dives
,
and
produces
another
muffin
,
yet
untoasted
;
 
taking
the
arrow
out
of
the
breast
of
Cock
Robin
,
he
proceeds
to
toast
it
on
the
end
of
that
cruel
instrument
.
<EOS>
When
it
is
brown
,
he
dives
again
and
produces
butter
,
with
which
he
completes
his
work
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
as
an
artful
man
who
is
sure
of
his
supper
by
-
and
-
bye
,
presses
muffin
on
his
host
to
soothe
him
into
a
compliant
state
of
mind
,
or
,
as
one
might
say
,
to
grease
his
works
.
<EOS>
As
the
muffins
disappear
,
little
by
little
,
the
black
shelves
and
nooks
and
corners
begin
to
appear
,
and
Mr.
Wegg
gradually
acquires
an
imperfect
notion
that
over
against
him
on
the
chimney
-
piece
is
a
Hindoo
baby
in
a
bottle
,
curved
up
with
his
big
head
tucked
under
him
,
as
though
he
would
instantly
throw
a
summersault
if
the
bottle
were
large
enough
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
deems
Mr.
Venus
's
wheels
sufficiently
lubricated
,
Mr.
Wegg
approaches
his
object
by
asking
,
as
he
lightly
taps
his
hands
together
,
to
express
an
undesigning
frame
of
mind
:
  
"
<EOS>
And
how
have
I
been
going
on
,
this
long
time
,
Mr.
Venus
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
bad
,
"
says
Mr.
Venus
,
uncompromisingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
<EOS>
Am
I
still
at
home
?
"
<EOS>
asks
Wegg
,
with
an
air
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Always
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
would
seem
to
be
secretly
agreeable
to
Wegg
,
but
he
veils
his
feelings
,
and
observes
,
"
Strange
.
<EOS>
To
what
do
you
attribute
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replies
Venus
,
who
is
a
haggard
melancholy
man
,
speaking
in
a
weak
voice
of
querulous
complaint
,
"
to
what
to
attribute
it
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
work
you
into
a
miscellaneous
one
,
nohow
.
<EOS>
Do
what
I
will
,
you
ca
n't
be
got
to
fit
.
<EOS>
Anybody
with
a
passable
knowledge
would
pick
you
out
at
a
look
,
and
say
,
---
`
`
No
go
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
match
!
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
,
but
hang
it
,
Mr.
Venus
,
"
Wegg
expostulates
with
some
little
irritation
,
"
that
ca
n't
be
personal
and
peculiar
in
me
.
<EOS>
It
must
often
happen
with
miscellaneous
ones
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
ribs
(
I
grant
you
)
always
.
<EOS>
But
not
else
.
<EOS>
When
I
prepare
a
miscellaneous
one
,
I
know
beforehand
that
I
ca
n't
keep
to
nature
,
and
be
miscellaneous
with
ribs
,
because
every
man
has
his
own
ribs
,
and
no
other
man
's
will
go
with
them
;
but
elseways
I
can
be
miscellaneous
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
sent
home
a
Beauty
---
a
perfect
Beauty
---
to
a
school
of
art
.
<EOS>
One
leg
Belgian
,
one
leg
English
,
and
the
pickings
of
eight
other
people
in
it
.
<EOS>
Talk
of
not
being
qualified
to
be
miscellaneous
!
<EOS>
By
rights
you
ought
to
be
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
looks
as
hard
at
his
one
leg
as
he
can
in
the
dim
light
,
and
after
a
pause
sulkily
opines
"
that
it
must
be
the
fault
of
the
other
people
.
<EOS>
Or
how
do
you
mean
to
say
it
comes
about
?
<EOS>
"
he
demands
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
it
comes
about
.
<EOS>
Stand
up
a
minute
.
<EOS>
Hold
the
light
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
takes
from
a
corner
by
his
chair
,
the
bones
of
a
leg
and
foot
,
beautifully
pure
,
and
put
together
with
exquisite
neatness
.
<EOS>
These
he
compares
with
Mr.
Wegg
's
leg
;
that
gentleman
looking
on
,
as
if
he
were
being
measured
for
a
riding
-
boot
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
but
so
it
is
.
<EOS>
You
have
got
a
twist
in
that
bone
,
to
the
best
of
my
belief
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
the
likes
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
having
looked
distrustfully
at
his
own
limb
,
and
suspiciously
at
the
pattern
with
which
it
has
been
compared
,
makes
the
point
:
  
"
I
'll
bet
a
pound
that
ai
n't
an
English
one
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
easy
wager
,
when
we
run
so
much
into
foreign
!
<EOS>
No
,
it
belongs
to
that
French
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
nods
towards
a
point
of
darkness
behind
Mr.
Wegg
,
the
latter
,
with
a
slight
start
,
looks
round
for
"
that
French
gentleman
,
"
 
whom
he
at
length
descries
to
be
represented
(
in
a
very
workmanlike
manner
)
by
his
ribs
only
,
standing
on
a
shelf
in
another
corner
,
like
a
piece
of
armour
or
a
pair
of
stays
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
says
Mr.
Wegg
,
with
a
sort
of
sense
of
being
introduced
;
 
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
were
all
right
enough
in
your
own
country
,
but
I
hope
no
objections
will
be
taken
to
my
saying
that
the
Frenchman
was
never
yet
born
as
I
should
wish
to
match
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
the
greasy
door
is
violently
pushed
inward
,
and
a
boy
follows
it
,
who
says
,
after
having
let
it
slam
:
  
<EOS>
"
Come
for
the
stuffed
canary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
three
and
ninepence
,
"
returns
Venus
;
"
have
you
got
the
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
produces
four
shillings
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
always
in
exceedingly
low
spirits
and
making
whimpering
sounds
,
peers
about
for
the
stuffed
canary
.
<EOS>
On
his
taking
the
candle
to
assist
his
search
,
Mr.
Wegg
observes
that
he
has
a
convenient
little
shelf
near
his
knees
,
exclusively
appropriated
to
skeleton
hands
,
which
have
very
much
the
appearance
of
wanting
to
lay
hold
of
him
.
<EOS>
From
these
Mr.
Venus
rescues
the
canary
in
a
glass
case
,
and
shows
it
to
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
he
whimpers
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
animation
!
<EOS>
On
a
twig
,
making
up
his
mind
to
hop
!
<EOS>
Take
care
of
him
;
he
's
lovely
specimen
.
<EOS>
---
  
<EOS>
And
three
is
four
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
gathers
up
his
change
and
has
pulled
the
door
open
by
a
leather
strap
nailed
to
it
for
the
purpose
,
when
Venus
cries
out
:
  
"
Stop
him
!
<EOS>
Come
back
,
you
young
villain
!
<EOS>
You
've
got
a
tooth
among
them
halfpence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
was
I
to
know
I
'd
got
it
?
<EOS>
You
giv
it
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
none
of
your
teeth
;
I
've
got
enough
of
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
So
the
boy
pipes
,
as
he
selects
it
from
his
change
,
and
throws
it
on
the
counter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
sauce
me
,
in
the
wicious
pride
of
your
youth
,
"
Mr.
Venus
retorts
pathetically
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
hit
me
because
you
see
I
'm
down
.
<EOS>
I
'm
low
enough
without
that
.
<EOS>
It
dropped
into
the
till
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
They
drop
into
everything
.
<EOS>
There
was
two
in
the
coffee
-
pot
at
breakfast
time
.
<EOS>
Molars
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
then
,
"
argues
the
boy
,
"
what
do
you
call
names
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
which
Mr.
Venus
only
replies
,
shaking
his
shock
of
dusty
hair
,
and
winking
his
weak
eyes
,
"
Do
n't
sauce
me
,
in
the
wicious
pride
of
your
youth
;
do
n't
hit
me
,
because
you
see
I
'm
down
.
<EOS>
You
've
no
idea
how
small
you
'd
come
out
,
if
I
had
the
articulating
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
consideration
seems
to
have
its
effect
on
the
boy
,
for
he
goes
out
grumbling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
me
,
dear
me
!
"
sighs
Mr.
Venus
,
heavily
,
snuffing
the
candle
,
"
the
world
that
appeared
so
flowery
has
ceased
to
blow
!
<EOS>
You
're
casting
your
eye
round
the
shop
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
Let
me
show
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
so
held
and
waved
the
candle
as
that
all
these
heterogeneous
objects
seemed
to
come
forward
obediently
when
they
were
named
,
and
then
retire
again
,
Mr.
Venus
despondently
repeats
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
dear
me
,
dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
resumes
his
seat
,
and
with
drooping
despondency
upon
him
,
falls
to
pouring
himself
out
more
tea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
am
I
?
"
asks
Mr.
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
somewhere
in
the
back
shop
across
the
yard

sir

speaking
quite
candidly

I
wish
I

never
bought
you

Hospital
Porter

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
look
here
,
what
did
you
give
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
replies
Venus
,
blowing
his
tea
:
his
head
and
face
peering
out
of
the
darkness
,
over
the
smoke
of
it
,
as
if
he
were
modernizing
the
old
original
rise
in
his
family
:
"
you
were
one
of
a
warious
lot
,
and
I
do
n't
know

"
  
<EOS>
Silas
puts
his
point
in
the
improved
form
of
"
What
will
you
take
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

"
replies
Venus
,
still
blowing
his
tea
,
"
I
'm

<EOS>
here
Mr.
Venus
takes
a
gulp
of
tea
,
so
hot
that
it
makes
him
choke
,
and
sets
his
weak
eyes
watering
;

as
a
Monstrosity

if
you
'll
excuse
me

<EOS>
Repressing
an
indignant
look
,
indicative
of
anything
but
a
disposition
to
excuse
him
,
Silas
pursues
his
point
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
know
me
,
Mr.
Venus
,
and
I
think
you
know
I
never
bargain

<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
takes
gulps
of
hot
tea
,
shutting
his
eyes
at
every
gulp
,
and
opening
them
again
in
a
spasmodic
manner
;
but
does
not
commit
himself
to
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
prospect
of
getting
on
in
life
and
elevating
myself
by
my

independent
exertions

says
Wegg
,
feelingly
,

<EOS>
and
I
should

like

I
tell
you
openly
I
should
not
like

under
such
circumstances

to
be
what
I
may
call
dispersed
,
a
part
of
me
here
,
and
a
part
of
me
there
,
but
should
wish
to
collect
myself
like

genteel
person

<EOS>
"
It
's
a
prospect
at
present
,
is
it
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
<EOS>
Then
you
have
n't
got
the
money
for
a
deal
about
you
?
<EOS>
Then
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
with
you

I
'll
hold
you
over

I
am
a

be
afraid

my
disposing

'll
hold
you
over

's
a

dear
me

dear
me

<EOS>
Fain
to
accept
his
promise
,
and
wishing
to
propitiate
him
,
Mr.
Wegg
looks
on
as
he
sighs
and
pours
himself
out
more
tea
,
and
then
says
,
trying
to
get
a
sympathetic
tone
into
his
voice
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
very
low
,
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
Is
business
bad
?

<EOS>

Never
was
so
good

<EOS>

Is
your

out

all

<EOS>

Never
was
so
well
in

<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
I
'm
not
only
first
in
the
trade
,
but
I
'm
the
trade

<EOS>
You
may
go
and
buy
a
skeleton
at
the
West
End
if
you
like
,
and
pay
the
West
End
price
,
but
it
'll
be
my
putting
together

<EOS>
I
've
as
much
to
do
as
I
can
possibly
do
,
with
the
assistance
of
my
young
man
,
and
I
take
a
pride
and
a
pleasure
in
it

<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
thus
delivers
himself
,
his
right
hand
extended
,
his
smoking
saucer
in
his
left
hand
,
protesting
as
though
he
were
going
to
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
ai
n't
a

low

Mr.

Mr.

,
not

myself

've
gone

<EOS>
Mr.

,
if
you

brought
here
loose
in

I
'd
name
your

blindfold
equally

out

though
not
quite

readily
as

,

that

Mr.

I

Mr.

But
it
's
the

Be
so
good

take

card
out
loud

<EOS>
Silas
receives
one
from
his
hand
,
which
Venus
takes
from
a
wonderful
litter
in
a
drawer
,
and
putting
on
his
spectacles
,
reads
:

That

with

That

it

<EOS>
Mr.

,
I
'm
thirty

,
and
a

<EOS>
Mr.

,
I
love
her

<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
she
is
worthy
of
being
loved
by

<EOS>
Here
Silas
is
rather
alarmed
by
Mr.
Venus
's
springing
to
his
feet
in
the
hurry
of
his
spirits
,
and
haggardly
confronting
him
with
his
hand
on
his
coat
collar
;
but
Mr.
Venus
,
begging
pardon
,
sits
down
again
,
saying
,
with
the
calmness
of
despair
,
"
She
objects
to
the
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
she
know
the
profits
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
knows
the
profits
of
it
,
but
she
do
n't
appreciate
the
art

it

and
she
objects
to
it

<EOS>
`
`
I
do
not
wish
,

"
she
writes
in
her
own
hand
writing
,
`
`
to
regard
myself
,
nor
yet
to
be
regarded
,
in
that
boney
light
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
Mr.
Venus
pours
himself
out
more
tea
,
with
a
look
and
in
an
attitude
of
the
deepest
desolation
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
a
man
climbs
to
the
top
of
the
tree
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
only
to
see
that
there
's
no
look
-
out
when
he
's
up
there
!
<EOS>
I
sit
here
of
a
night
surrounded
by
the
lovely
trophies
of
my
art
,
and
what
have
they
done
for
me
?
<EOS>
Ruined
me
.
<EOS>
Brought
me
to
the
pass
of
being
informed
that
`

she
does
not
wish
to
regard
herself
,
nor
yet
to
be
regarded

in

boney
light

<EOS>

"
Having
repeated
the
fatal
expressions
,
Mr.
Venus
drinks
more
tea
by
gulps
,
and
offers
an
explanation
of
his
doing
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
lowers
me
.
<EOS>
When
I
'm
equally
lowered
all
over
,
lethargy
sets
in
.
<EOS>
By
sticking
to
it
till
one
or
two
in
the
morning
,
I
get
oblivion
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
detain
you
,
Mr.

<EOS>
I
'm
not
company
for
any
one

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
on
that
account
,
"
says
Silas
,
rising
,
"
but
because
I
've
got
an
appointment

<EOS>
It
's
time
I
was
at
Harmon

Eh

said
Mr.

Harmon

up

Bridge
way

<EOS>
Mr.

admits
that
he
is
bound
for
that
port
.

You
ought
to
be
in
a
good

worked

There
's
lots
of

going

there

<EOS>

To
think

says
Silas
,
"
that
you
should
catch
it
up
so
quick

know
about
it

Wonderful
!
<EOS>

<EOS>

Not
at
all
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
wanted
to
know
the
nature
and
worth
of
everything
that
was
found
in
the
dust
;
and
many
's
the
bone
,
and
feather

and
what
not

that
he

brought

<EOS>
Yes

(
Oh

<EOS>
And
he
's
buried
quite
in
this
neighbourhood
,
you
know

<EOS>
Over
yonder

<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
does
not
know
,
but
he
makes
as
if
he
did
,
by
responsively
nodding
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
also
follows
with
his
eyes
,
the
toss
of
Venus
's
head
:
as
if
to
seek
a
direction
to
over
yonder
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
an
interest
in
that
discovery
in
the
river

says
Venus
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
(
She
had
n't
written
her
cutting
refusal
at
that
time

)
<EOS>
I
've
got
up
there

never
mind

<EOS>
He
had
raised
the
candle
at
arm
's
length
towards
one
of
the
dark
shelves
,
and
Mr.
Wegg
had
turned
to
look
,
when
he
broke
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
old
gentleman
was
well
known
all
round
here
.
<EOS>
There
used
to
be
stories
about
his
having
hidden
all
kinds
of
property
in
those
dust
mounds
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
there
was
nothing
in
'em
.
<EOS>
Probably
you
know
,
Mr.
Wegg
?

Nothing
in

says
Wegg
,
who
has
never
heard
a
word
of
this
before

Do
n't
let
me
detain
you

Good
night

<EOS>
The
unfortunate
Mr.
Venus
gives
him
a
shake
of
the
hand
with
a
shake
of
his
own
head
,
and
drooping
down
in
his
chair
,
proceeds
to
pour
himself
out
more
tea
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
pulls
the
door
open
by
the
strap
,
notices
that
the
movement
so
shakes
the
crazy
shop
,
and
so
shakes
a
momentary
flare
out
of
the
candle
,
as
that

babies

Hindoo

African

British

all
the
rest
of

show
for
an
instant
as

paralytically
animated
;
while
even
poor
little
Cock
Robin
at
Mr.

elbow
turns
over
on
his
innocent
side

Whosoever

gone
out
of
Fleet
Street
into
the
Temples
at
the
date
of
this
history
,
and
had
wandered
disconsolate
about
the
Temple
until
he
stumbled
on
a
dismal
churchyard
,
and
had
looked
up
at
the
dismal
windows
commanding
that
churchyard
until
at
the
most
dismal
window
of
them
all
he
saw
a
dismal
boy

would
in
him
have
beheld

Mr.

been
several
times
in
communication
with
this
clerkly
essence
,
both
on
its
own
ground
and
at
the
Bower
,
had
no
difficulty
in
identifying
it
when
he
saw
it
up
in
its
dusty
eyrie

<EOS>
To
the
second
floor
on
which
the
window
was
situated
,
he
ascended
,
much
pre

occupied
in
mind
by
the
uncertainties
besetting
the
Roman
Empire
,
and
much
regretting
the
death
of
the
amiable
Pertinax

who
only
last
night
had
left
the
imperial
affairs
in
a
state
of
great
confusion

by
falling
a
victim
to
the
fury
of
the
pretorian
guards

said
Mr.

with
a
wave
of
his

the
office

was
opened

dismal

was

Young

made
a
great
show

fetching
from

long
thin

running

that
he
could
carve
,
he
had
fallen
on
the
device
of
ringing
alphabetical
changes
into
the
two
volumes
in
question
,
or
of
entering
vast
numbers
of
persons
out
of
the
Directory
as
transacting
business
with
Mr.
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
more
necessary
for
his
spirits
,
because
,
being
of
a
sensitive
temperament
,
he
was
apt
to
consider
it
personally
disgraceful
to
himself
that
his
master
had
no
clients
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
have
you
been
in
the
law
,
now
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
pounce
,
in
his
usual
inquisitive
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
in
the
law
,
now
,
sir
,
about
three
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Must
have
been
as
good
as
born
in
it
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
it
much
,
"
returned
Young
Blight
,
heaving
a
sigh
,
as
if
its
bitterness
were
past
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
wages
do
you
get
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Half
what
I
could
wish
,
"
replied
young
Blight
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
whole
that
you
could
wish
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fifteen
shillings
a
week
,
"
said
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
About
how
long
might
it
take
you
now
,
at
a
average
rate
of
going
,
to
be
a
Judge
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
after
surveying
his
small
stature
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
The
boy
answered
that
he
had
not
yet
quite
worked
out
that
little
calculation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
there
's
nothing
to
prevent
your
going
in
for
it
?
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
The
boy
virtually
replied
that
as
he
had
the
honour
to
be
a
Briton
who
never
never
never
,
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
his
going
in
for
it
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
seemed
inclined
to
suspect
that
there
might
be
something
to
prevent
his
coming
out
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
a
couple
of
pound
help
you
up
at
all
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
head
,
young
Blight
had
no
doubt
<EOS>
whatever
,
so
Mr.
Boffin
made
him
a
present
of
that
sum
of
money
,
and
thanked
him
for
his
attention
to
his
(
Mr.
Boffin
's
)
affairs
;
which
,
he
added
,
were
now
,
he
believed
,
as
good
as
settled
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
his
stick
at
his
ear
,
like
a
Familiar
Spirit
explaining
the
office
to
him
,
sat
staring
at
a
little
bookcase
of
Law
Practice
and
Law
Reports
,
and
at
a
window
,
and
at
an
empty
blue
bag
,
and
at
a
stick
of
sealing
-
wax
,
and
a
pen
,
and
a
box
of
wafers
,
and
an
apple
,
and
a
writing
-
pad
---
all
very
dusty
---
and
at
a
number
of
inky
smears
and
blots
,
and
at
an
imperfectly
-
disguised
gun
-
case
pretending
to
be
something
legal
,
and
at
an
iron
box
labelled
Harmon
Estate
,
until
Mr.
Lightwood
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
explained
that
he
came
from
the
proctor
's
,
with
whom
he
had
been
engaged
in
transacting
Mr.
Boffin
's
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
they
seem
to
have
taken
a
deal
out
of
you
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
commiseration
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
,
without
explaining
that
his
weariness
was
chronic
,
proceeded
with
his
exposition
that
,
all
forms
of
law
having
been
at
length
complied
with
,
will
of
Harmon
deceased
having
been
proved
,
death
of

next
inheriting

been
proved
,
&
c.
,
and
so
forth
,
Court
of
Chancery
having
been
moved
,
&
c.
and
so
forth
,
he
,
Mr.
Lightwood
,
had
now
the
great
gratification
,
honor
,
and
happiness
,
again
&
c.
and
so
forth
,
of
congratulating
Mr.
Boffin
on
coming
into
possession
,
as
residuary
legatee
,
of
upwards
of
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
,
standing
in
the
books
of
the
Governor
and
Company
of
the
Bank
of
England
,
again
&
c.
and
so
forth
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
particularly
eligible
in
the
property
Mr.
Boffin
,
is
,
that
it
involves
no
trouble
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
estates
to
manage
,
no
rents
to
return
so
much
per
cent
.
<EOS>
upon
in
bad
times
(
which
is
an
extremely
dear
way
of
getting
your
name
into
the
newspapers
)
,
no
voters
to
become
parboiled
in
hot
water
with
,
no
agents
to
take
the
cream
off
the
milk
before
it
comes
to
table
.
<EOS>
You
could
put
the
whole
in
a
cash
-
box
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
take
it
with
you
to
---
say
,
to
the
Rocky
Mountains
.
<EOS>
Inasmuch
as
every
man
,
"
concluded
Mr.
Lightwood
,
with
an
indolent
smile
,
"
appears
to
be
under
a
fatal
spell
which
obliges
him
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
mention
the
Rocky
Mountains
in
a
tone
of
extreme
familiarity
to
some
other
man
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
'll
excuse
my
pressing
you
into
the
service
of
that
gigantic
range
of
geographical
bores
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
following
this
last
remark
very
closely
,
Mr.
Boffin
cast
his
perplexed
gaze
first
at
the
ceiling
,
and
then
at
the
carpet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
he
remarked
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
about
it
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
I
was
a'most
as
well
as
I
was
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
great
lot
to
take
care
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr.
Boffin
,
then
do
n't
take
care
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
said
that
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speaking
now
,
"
returned
Mortimer
,
"
with
the
irresponsible
imbecility
of
a
private
individual
,
and
not
with
the
profundity
of
a
professional
adviser
,
I
should
say
that
if
the
circumstance
of
its
being
too
much
,
weighs
upon
your
mind
,
you
have
the
haven
of
consolation
open
to
you
that
you
can
easily
make
it
less
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
should
be
apprehensive
of
the
trouble
of
doing
so
,
there
is
the
further
haven
of
consolation
that
any
number
of
people
will
take
the
trouble
off
your
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
quite
see
it
,
"
retorted
Mr.
Boffin
,
still
perplexed
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
satisfactory
,
you
know
,
what
you
're
a
-
saying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Anything
satisfactory
,
Mr.
Boffin
?
"
asked
Mortimer
,
raising
his
eyebrows
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
find
it
so
,
"
answered
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
wistful
look
.
<EOS>
"
While
I
was
foreman
at
the
Bower
---
afore
it
was
the
Bower
---
I
considered
the
business
very
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
was
a
awful
Tartar
(
saying
it
,
I
'm
sure
,
without
disrespect
to
his
memory
)
but
the
business
was
a
pleasant
one
to
look
after
,
from
before
day
-
light
to
past
dark
.
<EOS>
It
's
a'most
a
pity
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
rubbing
his
ear
,
"
that
he
ever
went
and
made
so
much
money
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
better
for
him
if
he
had
n't
so
given
himself
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
"
making
the
discovery
all
of
a
sudden
,
"
that
he
found
it
a
great
lot
to
take
care
of
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
coughed
,
not
convinced
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
speaking
of
satisfactory
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
why
,
Lord
save
us
!
<EOS>
when
we
come
to
take
it
to
pieces
,
bit
by
bit
<EOS>
,
where
's
the
satisfactoriness
of
the
money
as
yet
?
<EOS>
When
the
old
man
does
right
the
poor
boy
after
all
,
the
poor
boy
gets
no
good
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
gets
made
away
with
,
at
the
moment
when
he
's
lifting
(
as
one
may
say
)
<EOS>
the
cup
and
sarser
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
,
I
will
now
name
to
you
,
that
on
behalf
of
the
poor
dear
boy
,
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
have
stood
out
against
the
old
man
times
out
of
number
,
till
he
has
called
us
every
name
he
could
lay
his
tongue
to
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
,
after
Mrs.
Boffin
has
given
him
her
mind
respecting
the
claims
of
the
nat'ral
affections
,
catch
off
Mrs.
Boffin
's
bonnet
(
she
wore
,
in
general
,
a
black
straw
,
perched
as
a
matter
of
convenience
on
the
top
of
her
head
)
,
and
send
it
spinning
across
the
yard
.
<EOS>
I
have
indeed
.
<EOS>
And
once
,
when
he
did
this
in
a
manner
that
amounted
to
personal
,
I
should
have
given
him
a
rattler
for
himself
,
if
Mrs.
Boffin
had
n't
thrown
herself
betwixt
us
,
and
received
flush
on
the
temple
.
<EOS>
Which
dropped
her
,
Mr.
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
Dropped
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
murmured
"
Equal
honor
---
Mrs.
Boffin
's
head
and
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
understand
;
I
name
this
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
to
show
you
,
<EOS>
now
the
affairs
are
wound
up
,
that
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
have
ever
stood
,
as
we
were
in
Christian
honor
bound
,
the
children
's
friend
.
<EOS>
Me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
stood
the
poor
girl
's
friend
;
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
stood
the
poor
boy
's
friend
;
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
up
and
faced
the
old
man
when
we
momently
expected
to
be
turned
out
for
our
pains
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
lowering
his
voice
,
"
she
might
n't
wish
it
mentioned
<EOS>
now
she
's
Fashionable
,
but
she
went
so
far
as
to
tell
him
,
in
my
presence
<EOS>
,
he
was
a
flinty
-
hearted
rascal
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
murmured
"
Vigorous
Saxon
spirit
---
Mrs.
Boffin
's
ancestors
---
bowmen
---
Agincourt
and
Cressy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
last
time
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
saw
the
poor
boy
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
warming
(
as
fat
usually
does
)
with
a
tendency
to
melt
,
"
he
was
a
child
of
seven
year
old
.
<EOS>
For
when
he
come
back
to
make
intercession
for
his
sister
,
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
were
away
overlooking
a
country
contract
which
was
to
be
sifted
before
carted
,
and
he
was
come
and
gone
in
a
single
hour
.
<EOS>
I
say
he
was
a
child
of
seven
year
old
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
away
,
all
alone
and
forlorn
,
to
that
foreign
school
,
and
he
come
into
our
place
,
situate
up
the
yard
of
the
present
Bower
,
to
have
a
warm
at
our
fire
.
<EOS>
There
was
his
little
scanty
travelling
clothes
upon
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
his
little
scanty
box
outside
in
the
shivering
wind
,
which
I
was
going
to
carry
for
him
down
to
the
steamboat
,
as
the
old
man
would
n't
hear
of
allowing
a
sixpence
coach
-
money
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
,
then
quite
a
young
woman
and
a
pictur
of
a
full
-
blown
rose
,
stands
him
by
her
,
kneels
down
at
the
fire
,
warms
her
two
open
hands
,
and
falls
to
rubbing
his
cheeks
;
 
but
seeing
the
tears
come
into
the
child
's
eyes
,
the
tears
come
fast
into
her
own
,
and
she
holds
him
round
the
neck
,
like
as
if
she
was
protecting
him
,
and
cries
to
me
,
`
<EOS>
`
I
'd
give
the
wide
wide
world
,
I
would
,
to
run
away
with
him
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
but
<EOS>
what
it
cut
me
,
and
<EOS>
but
what
it
at
the
same
time
heightened
my
feelings
of
admiration
for
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
The
poor
child
clings
to
her
for
awhile
,
as
she
clings
to
him
,
and
<EOS>
then
,
when
the
old
man
calls
,
he
says
`
`
I
must
go
!
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
"
and
for
a
moment
rests
his
heart
against
her
bosom
,
and
looks
up
at
both
of
us
,
as
if
it
was
in
pain
---
in
agony
.
<EOS>
Such
a
look
!
<EOS>
I
went
aboard
with
him
<EOS>
(
I
gave
him
first
<EOS>
what
little
treat
<EOS>
I
thought
he
'd
like
)
,
and
I
left
him
when
he
had
fallen
asleep
in
his
berth
,
and
I
came
back
to
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
But
tell
her
what
I
would
of
how
I
had
left
him
,
it
all
went
for
nothing
,
for
,
according
to
her
thoughts
,
he
never
changed
that
look
that
he
had
looked
up
at
us
two
.
<EOS>
But
it
did
one
piece
of
good
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
and
me
had
no
child
of
our
own
,
and
had
sometimes
wished
that
how
we
had
one
.
<EOS>
But
not
now
.
<EOS>
`
`
We
might
both
of
us
die
,
"
"
says
Mrs.
Boffin
,
`
`
and
other
eyes
might
see
that
lonely
look
in
our
child
.
"
<EOS>
"
So
of
a
night
,
when
it
was
very
cold
,
or
when
the
wind
roared
,
or
the
rain
dripped
heavy
,
she
would
wake
sobbing
,
and
call
out
in
a
fluster
,
`
`
Do
n't
you
see
the
poor
child
's
face
?
<EOS>
O
shelter
the
poor
child
!
"
<EOS>
"
---
  
till
in
course
of
years
it
gently
wore
out
,
as
many
things
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr.
Boffin
,
everything
wears
to
rags
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
with
a
light
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
go
so
far
as
to
say
everything
,
"
returned
Mr.
Boffin
,
on
whom
his
manner
seemed
to
grate
,
"
because
there
's
some
things
that
I
never
found
among
the
dust
.
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
So
Mrs.
Boffin
and
me
grow
older
and
older
in
the
old
man
's
service
,
living
and
working
pretty
hard
in
it
,
till
the
old
man
is
discovered
dead
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Boffin
and
me
seal
up
his
box
,
always
standing
on
the
table
at
the
side
of
his
bed
,
and
having
frequently
heerd
tell
of
the
Temple
as
a
spot
where
lawyers
'
dust
is
contracted
for
<EOS>
,
I
come
down
here
in
search
of
a
lawyer
to
advise
,
and
I
see
your
young
man
up
at
this
present
elevation
,
chopping
at
the
flies
on
the
window
-
sill
with
his
penknife
,
and
I
give
him
a
Hoy
!
<EOS>
not
then
having
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
,
and
by
that
means
come
to
gain
the
honor
.
<EOS>
Then
you
,
and
the
gentleman
in
the
uncomfortable
neck
-
cloth
under
the
little
archway
in
Saint
Paul
's
Churchyard

Doctors

Commons
,
"
observed
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understood
it
was
another
name
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
pausing
,
"
<EOS>
but
you
know
best
.
<EOS>
Then
you
and
Doctor
Scommons
,
you
go
to
work
,
and
you
do
the
thing
that
's
proper
,
and
you
and
Doctor
S.
take
steps
for
finding
out
the
poor
boy
,
and
at
last
you
do
find
out
the
poor
boy
,
and
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
often
exchange
the
observation
,
`
<EOS>
`
We
shall
see
him
again
,
under
happy
circumstances
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
never
to
be
;
and
the
want
of
satisfactoriness
is
,
that
after
all
the
money
never
gets
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
gets
,
"
remarked
Lightwood
,
with
a
languid
inclination
of
the
head
,
"
into
excellent
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
gets
into
the
hands
of
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
only
this
very
day
and
hour
,
and
that
's
what
I
am
working
round
to
,
having
waited
for
this
day
and
hour
a
'
purpose
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
,
here
has
been
a
wicked
cruel
murder
.
<EOS>
By
that
murder
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
mysteriously
profit
.
<EOS>
For
the
apprehension
and
conviction
of
the
murderer
,
we
offer
a
reward
of
one
tithe
of
the
property
---
a
reward
of
Ten
Thousand
Pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Boffin
,
it
's
too
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Lightwood
,
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
have
fixed
the
sum
together
,
and
we
stand
to
it
.
"
  
"
But
let
me
represent
to
you
,
"
returned
Lightwood
,
"
speaking
now
with
professional
profundity
,
and
not
with
individual
imbecility
,
that
the
offer
of
such
an
immense
reward
is
a
temptation
to
forced
suspicion
,
forced
construction
of
circumstances
,
strained
accusation
,
a
whole
tool
-
box
of
edged
tools
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
a
little
staggered
,
"
that
's
the
sum
we
put
o
'
one
side
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
shall
be
openly
declared
in
the
new
notices
that
must
now
be
put
about
in
our
names
---
"
  
"
In
your
name
,
Mr.
Boffin
;
in
your
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
;
in
my
name
,
which
is
the
same
as
Mrs.
Boffin
's
,
and
means
both
of
us
,
is
to
be
considered
in
drawing
'em
up
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
the
first
instruction
that
I
,
as
the
owner
of
the
property
,
give
to
my
lawyer
on
coming
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
lawyer
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
returned
Lightwood
,
making
a
very
short
note
of
it
with
a
very
rusty
pen
,
"
has
the
gratification
of
taking
the
instruction
.
<EOS>
There
is
another
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
just
one
other
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
Make
me
as
compact
a
little
will
as
can
be
reconciled
with
tightness
,
leaving
the
whole
of
the
property
to
`
`
my
beloved
wife
,
Henerietty
Boffin
,
sole
executrix
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
Make
it
as
short
as
you
can
,
using
those
words
;
but
make
it
tight
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
some
loss
to
fathom
Mr.
Boffin
's
notions
of
a
tight
will
,
Lightwood
felt
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
but
professional
profundity
must
be
exact
.
<EOS>
When
you
say
tight
---
"
  
"
I
mean
tight
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
explained
.
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
so
.
<EOS>
And
nothing
can
be
more
laudable
.
<EOS>
But
is
the
tightness
to
bind
Mrs.
Boffin
to
any
and
what
conditions
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bind
Mrs.
Boffin
?
<EOS>
"
interposed
her
husband
.
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
What
are
you
thinking
of
!
<EOS>
What
I
want
is
,
to
make
it
all
hers
so
tight
as
that
her
hold
of
it
ca
n't
be
loosed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hers
freely
,
to
do
what
she
likes
with
?
<EOS>
Hers
absolutely
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Absolutely
?
"
repeated
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
short
sturdy
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
Hah
!
<EOS>
I
should
think
so
!
<EOS>
It
would
be
handsome
in
me
to
begin
to
bind
Mrs.
Boffin
at
this
time
of
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
that
instruction
,
too
,
was
taken
by
Mr.
Lightwood
;
and
Mr.
Lightwood
,
having
taken
it
,
was
in
the
act
of
showing
Mr.
Boffin
out
,
when
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
almost
jostled
him
in
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
Consequently
Mr.
Lightwood
said
,
in
his
cool
manner
,
"
Let
me
make
you
two
known
to
one
another
,
"
and
further
signified
that
Mr.
Wrayburn
was
counsel
learned
in
the
law
,
and
that
,
partly
in
the
way
of
business
and
partly
in
the
way
of
pleasure
,
he
had
imparted
to
Mr.
Wrayburn
some
of
the
interesting
facts
of
Mr.
Boffin
's
biography
.
  
<EOS>
"
Delighted
,
"
said
Eugene
---
though
he
did
n't
look
so
---
"
to
know
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thankee
,
sir
,
thankee
,
"
returned
that
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
And
how
do
you
like
the
law
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
---
not
particularly
,
"
returned
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
Too
dry
for
you
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Well
,
I
suppose
it
wants
some
years
of
sticking
to
,
before
you
master
it
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
nothing
like
work
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
bees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
returned
Eugene
,
with
a
reluctant
smile
,
"
but
will
you
excuse
my
mentioning
that
I
always
protest
against
being
referred
to
the
bees
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
object
on
principle
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
as
a
biped
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
a
what
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
a
two
-
footed
creature
;
---
I
object
on
principle
,
as
a
two
-
footed
creature
,
to
being
constantly
referred
to
insects
and
four
-
footed
creatures
.
<EOS>
I
object
to
being
required
to
model
my
proceedings
according
to
the
proceedings
of
the
bee
,
or
the
dog
,
or
the
spider
,
or
the
camel
.
<EOS>
I
fully
admit
that
the
camel
,
for
instance
,
is
an
excessively
temperate
person
;
but
he
has
several
stomachs
to
entertain
himself
with
,
and
I
have
only
one
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
am
not
fitted
up
with
a
convenient
cool
cellar
to
keep
my
drink
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
said
,
you
know
,
"
urged
Mr.
Boffin
,
rather
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
,
"
the
bee
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Exactly
.
<EOS>
And
may
I
represent
to
you
that
it
's
injudicious
to
say
the
bee
?
<EOS>
For
the
whole
case
is
assumed
.
<EOS>
Conceding
for
a
moment
that
there
is
any
analogy
between
a
bee
,
and
a
man
in
a
shirt
and
pantaloons
(
which
I
deny
)
,
and
that
it
is
settled
that
the
man
is
to
learn
from
the
bee
(
which
I
also
deny
)
,
the
question
still
remains
,
what
is
he
to
learn
?
<EOS>
To
imitate
?
<EOS>
Or
to
avoid
?
<EOS>
When
your
friends
the
bees
worry
themselves
to
that
highly
fluttered
extent
about
their
sovereign
,
and
become
perfectly
distracted
touching
the
slightest
monarchical
movement
,
are
we
men
to
learn
the
greatness
of
Tufthunting
,
or
the
littleness
of
the
Court
Circular
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
clear
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
but
that
the
hive
may
be
satirical
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
they
work
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ye
-
es
,
"
returned
Eugene
,
disparagingly
,
"
they
work
;
but
do
n't
you
think
they
overdo
it
?
<EOS>
They
work
so
much
more
than
they
need
---
they
make
so
much
more
than
they
can
eat
---
they
are
so
incessantly
boring
and
buzzing
at
their
one
idea
till
Death
comes
upon
them
---
<EOS>
that
do
n't
you
think
they
overdo
it
?
<EOS>
And
are
human
labourers
to
have
no
holidays
,
because
of
the
bees
?
<EOS>
And
am
I
never
to
have
change
of
air
,
because
the
bees
do
n't
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
I
think
honey
excellent
at
breakfast
;
but
,
regarded
in
the
light
of
my
conventional
schoolmaster
and
moralist
,
I
protest
against
the
tyrannical
humbug
of
your
friend
the
bee
.
<EOS>
With
the
highest
respect
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Morning
,
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
worthy
Mr.
Boffin
jogged
away
with
a
comfortless
impression
he
could
have
dispensed
with
,
that
there
was
a
deal
of
unsatisfactoriness
in
the
world
,
besides
what
he
had
recalled
as
appertaining
to
the
Harmon
property
.
<EOS>
And
he
was
still
jogging
along
Fleet
Street
in
this
condition
of
mind
,
when
he
became
aware
that
he
was
closely
tracked
and
observed
by
a
man
of
genteel
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
then
?
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
stopping
short
,
with
his
meditations
brought
to
an
abrupt
check
,
"
what
's
the
next
article
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
too
,
eh
?
<EOS>
How
did
you
come
by
it
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
you
do
n't
know
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
looked
full
at
the
man
,
and
the
man
looked
full
at
him
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
after
a
glance
at
the
pavement
,
as
if
it
were
made
of
faces
and
he
were
trying
to
match
the
man
's
,
"
I
do
n't
know
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
nobody
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
"
and
not
likely
to
be
known
;
 
but
Mr.
Boffin
's
wealth
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
that
's
got
about
already
,
has
it
?
"
muttered
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
And
his
romantic
manner
of
acquiring
it
,
make
him
conspicuous
.
<EOS>
You
were
pointed
out
to
me
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
I
should
say
I
was
a
disappintment
to
you
when
I
was
pinted
out
,
if
your
politeness
would
allow
you
to
confess
it
,
for
I
am
well
aware
I
am
not
much
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
What
might
you
want
with
me
?
<EOS>
Not
in
the
law
,
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir

"
  
<EOS>
"
No
information
to
give
,
for
a
reward
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir

"
  
<EOS>
There
may
have
been
a
momentary
mantling
in
the
face
of
the
man
as
he
made
the
last
answer
,
but
it
passed
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
n't
mistake
,
you
have
followed
me
from
my
lawyer
's
and
tried
to
fix
my
attention

<EOS>
Say
out
!
<EOS>
Have
you
?
<EOS>
Or
have
n't
you
?
"
 
<EOS>
demanded
Mr.
Boffin
,
rather
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
allow
me
to
walk
beside
you
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
I
will
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Would
you
object
to
turn
aside
into
this
place
<EOS>
---
I
think
it
is
called
Clifford
's
Inn
---
where
we
can
hear
one
another
better
than
in
the
roaring
street
?
<EOS>
"
  
(
"
Now
,
"
thought
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
if
he
proposes
a
game
at
skittles
,
or
meets
<EOS>
a
country
gentleman
just
come
into
property
,
or
produces
any
article
of
jewellery
he
has
found
,
I
'll
knock
him
down
!
"
<EOS>
With
this
discreet
reflection
,
and
carrying
his
stick
in
his
arms
much
as
Punch
carries
his
,
Mr.
Boffin
turned
into
Clifford
's
Inn
aforesaid
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Boffin
,
I
happened
to
be
in
Chancery
Lane
this
morning
,
when
I
saw
you
going
along
before
me
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
liberty
of
following
you
,
trying
to
make
up
my
mind
to
speak
to
you
,
till
you
went
into
your
lawyer
's
.
<EOS>
Then
I
waited
outside
till
you
came
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
(
"
Do
n't
quite
sound
like
skittles
,
nor
yet
country
gentleman
,
nor
yet
jewellery

thought
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
but
there
's
no
knowing
.

<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
my
object
is
a
bold
one
,
I
am
afraid
it
has
little
of
the
usual
practical
world
about
it
,
but
I
venture
it
.
<EOS>
If
you
ask
me
,
or
if
you
ask
yourself

which
is
more
likely

what
emboldens
me

I
answer

I
have
been
strongly
assured

that
you

rectitude

plain
dealing

the
soundest

sound

<EOS>
"
Your
information
is
true

anyhow

"
was
Mr.
Boffin
's
answer
,
as
he
surveyed
his
new
friend
again
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
repressed
in
the
strange
man
's
manner
,
and
he
walked
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
---
though
conscious
,
for
all
that
,
of
Mr.
Boffin
's
observation

and
he
spoke
in
a
subdued
voice
.
<EOS>
But
his
words
came
easily
,
and
his
voice
was
agreeable
in
tone
,
albeit
constrained
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
add
,
I
can
discern
for
myself
what
the
general
tongue
says
of
you
---
that
you
are
quite
unspoiled
by
Fortune
,
and
not
uplifted
 
<EOS>
---
I
trust
you
will
not
,
as
a
man
of
an
open
nature
,
suspect
that
I
mean
to
flatter
you
,
but
will
believe
that
all
I
mean
is
to
excuse
myself
,
these
being
my
only
excuses
for
my
present
intrusion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
How
much
?
"
thought
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
coming
to
money
.
<EOS>
How
much
?
"
)
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
probably
change
your
manner
of
living
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
your
changed
circumstances
.
<EOS>
You
will
probably
keep
a
larger
house
,
have
many
matters
to
arrange
,
and
be
beset
by
numbers
of
correspondents
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
try
me
as
your
Secretary
---
"
  
"
As
what
?
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
his
eyes
wide
open
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
under
his
breath
,
"
that
's
a
queer
thing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Or
,
"
pursued
the
stranger
,
wondering
at
Mr.
Boffin
's
wonder
,
"
if
you
would
try
me
as
your
man
of
business
under
any
name
,
I
know
you
would
find
me
faithful
and
grateful
,
and
I
hope
you
would
find
me
useful
.
<EOS>
You
may
naturally
think
that
my
immediate
object
is
money
.
<EOS>
Not
so
,
for
I
would
willingly
serve
you
a
year
---
<EOS>
two
years
 
---
any
term
you
might
appoint
---
before
that
should
begin
to
be
a
consideration
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
come
from
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
,
"
returned
the
other
,
meeting
his
eye
,
"
from
many
countries
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
's
acquaintance
with
the
names
and
situations
of
foreign
lands
being
limited
in
extent
and
somewhat
confused
in
quality
<EOS>
,
he
shaped
his
next
question
on
an
elastic
model
.
  
<EOS>
"
From
---
any
particular
place
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
in
many
places
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
been
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
Here
again
he
made
no
great
advance
,
for
the
reply
was
,
"
I
have
been
a
student
and
a
traveller
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
it
ai
n't
a
liberty
to
plump
it
out
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
what
do
you
do
for
your
living
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
mentioned
,
"
returned
the
other
,
with
another
look
at
him
,
and
a
smile
,
"
what
I
aspire
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
superseded
as
to
some
slight
intentions
I
had
,
and
I
may
say
that
I
have
now
to
begin
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
Not
very
well
knowing
how
to
get
rid
of
this
applicant
,
and
feeling
the
more
embarrassed
because
his
manner
and
appearance
claimed
a
delicacy
in
which
the
worthy
Mr.
Boffin
feared
he
himself
might
be
deficient
,
that
gentleman
glanced
into
the
mouldy
little
plantation
or
cat
-
preserve
,
of
Clifford
's
Inn
,
as
it
was
that
day
,
in
search
of
a
suggestion
.
<EOS>
Sparrows
were
there
,
cats
were
there
,
dry
-
rot
and
wet
-
rot
were
there
,
but
it
was
not
otherwise
a
suggestive
spot
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
this
time
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
producing
a
little
pocket
-
book
and
taking
out
a
card
,
"
I
have
not
mentioned
my
name
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
I
lodge
at
one
Mr.
Wilfer
's
,
at
Holloway
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
stared
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
of
Miss
Bella
Wilfer
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
landlord
has
a
daughter
named
Bella
.
<EOS>
Yes
;
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
this
name
had
been
more
or
less
in
Mr.
Boffin
's
thoughts
all
the
morning
,
and
for
days
before
;
therefore
he
said
:
  
"
That
's
singular
,
too
!
"
<EOS>
unconsciously
staring
again
,
past
all
bounds
of
good
manners
,
with
the
card
in
his
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Though
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
I
suppose
it
was
one
of
that
family
that
pinted
me
out
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
been
in
the
streets
with
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heard
me
talked
of
among
'em
,
though
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
I
occupy
my
own
rooms
,
and
have
held
scarcely
any
communication
with
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Odder
and
odder
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
nothing
,
"
returned
Mr.
Rokesmith
;
"
allow
me
to
call
on
you
in
a
few
days
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
unconscionable
as
to
think
it
likely
that
you
would
accept
me
on
trust
at
first
sight
,
and
take
me
out
of
the
very
street
.
<EOS>
Let
me
come
to
you
for
your
further
opinion
,
at
your
leisure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
fair
,
and
I
do
n't
object
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
;
"
but
it
must
be
on
condition
that
it
's
fully
understood
that
I
no
more
know
that
I
shall
ever
be
in
want
of
any
gentleman
as
Secretary
<EOS>
---
it
was
Secretary
<EOS>
you
said
;
was
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
Mr.
Boffin
's
eyes
opened
wide
,
and
he
stared
at
the
applicant
from
head
to
foot
,
repeating
"
Queer
!
<EOS>
---
You
're
sure
it
was
Secretary
?
<EOS>
Are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
---
"
As
Secretary
,
"
repeated
Mr.
Boffin
,
meditating
upon
the
word
;
 
"
I
no
more
know
that
I
may
ever
want
a
Secretary
,
or
what
not
,
than
I
do
that
I
shall
ever
be
in
want
of
the
man
in
the
moon
.
<EOS>
Me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
have
not
even
settled
that
we
shall
make
any
change
in
our
way
of
life
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
's
inclinations
certainly
do
tend
towards
Fashion
;
but
,
being
already
set
up
in
a
fashionable
way
at
the
Bower
,
she
may
not
make
further
alterations
.
<EOS>
However
,
sir
,
as
you
do
n't
press
yourself
,
I
wish
to
meet
you
so
far
as
saying
,
by
all
means
call
at
the
Bower
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
Call
in
the
course
of
a
week
or
two
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
consider
that
I
ought
to
name
,
in
addition
to
what
I
have
already
named
,
that
I
have
in
my
employment
a
literary
man
---
with
a
wooden
leg
---
as
I
have
no
thoughts
of
parting
from
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
regret
to
hear
I
am
in
some
sort
<EOS>
anticipated
,
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
answered
,
evidently
having
heard
it
with
surprise
;
"
but
perhaps
other
duties
might
arise
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
returned
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
confidential
sense
of
dignity
,
"
as
to
my
literary
man
's
duties
,
they
're
clear
.
<EOS>
Professionally
he
declines
and
he
falls
,
and
as
a
friend
he
drops
into
poetry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Without
observing
that
these
duties
seemed
by
no
means
clear
to
Mr.
Rokesmith
's
astonished
comprehension
,
Mr.
Boffin
went
on
:
  
"
And
now
,
sir
,
I
'll
wish
you
good
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
can
call
at
the
Bower
any
time
in
a
week
or
two
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
above
a
mile
or
so
from
you
,
and
your
landlord
can
direct
you
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
may
not
know
it
by
its
new
name
of
Boffin
's
Bower
,
say
,
when
you
inquire
of
him
,
its
Harmon
's
;
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Harmoon
's
,
"
repeated
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
seeming
to
have
caught
the
sound
imperfectly
,
"
Harmarn
's
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
spell
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
as
to
the
spelling
of
it
,
"
returned
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
great
presence
of
mind
,
"
<EOS>
that
's
your
look
out
.
<EOS>
Harmon
's
is
all
you
've
got
to
say
to
him
.
<EOS>
Morning
,
morning
,
morning
!
"
<EOS>
And
so
departed
,
without
looking
back
.
   
<EOS>
MR
.
<EOS>
AND
MRS
.
BOFFIN
IN
CONSULTATION
.
 
<EOS>
Betaking
himself
straight
homeward
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
without
further
let
or
hindrance
,
arrived
at
the
Bower
,
and
gave
Mrs.
Boffin
(
in
a
walking
dress
of
black
velvet
and
feathers
,
like
a
mourning
coach
-
horse
)
<EOS>
an
account
of
all
he
had
said
and
done
since
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
brings
us
round
,
my
dear
,
"
he
then
pursued
,
"
to
the
question
we
left
unfinished
:
<EOS>
namely
,
whether
there
's
to
be
any
new
go
-
in
for
Fashion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
want
,
Noddy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
smoothing
her
dress
with
an
air
of
immense
enjoyment
,
"
I
wan't
Society
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fashionable
Society
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
,
laughing
with
the
glee
of
a
child
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
It
's
no
good
my
being
kept
here
like
Wax
-
Work
;
is
it
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
People
have
to
pay
to
see
Wax
-
Work
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
her
husband
,
"
whereas
(
though
you
'd
be
cheap
at
the
same
money
)
<EOS>
the
neighbours
is
welcome
to
see
you
for
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
do
n't
answer
,
"
said
the
cheerful
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
When
we
worked
like
the
neighbours
,
we
suited
one
another
.
<EOS>
Now
we
have
left
work
off
,
we
have
left
off
suiting
one
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
do
you
think
of
beginning
work
again
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
hinted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Out
of
the
question
!
<EOS>
We
have
come
into
a
great
fortune
,
and
we
must
do
what
's
right
by
our
fortune
;
we
must
act
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
who
had
a
deep
respect
for
his
wife
's
intuitive
wisdom
,
replied
,
though
rather
pensively
:
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
we
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
never
been
acted
up
to
yet
,
and
,
consequently
,
no
good
has
come
of
it
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
to
the
present
time
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
assented
,
with
his
former
pensiveness
,
as
he
took
his
seat
upon
his
settle
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
good
may
be
coming
of
it
in
the
future
time
.
<EOS>
Towards
which
,
what
's
your
views
,
old
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
,
a
smiling
creature
,
broad
figure
and
simple
of
nature
,
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
,
and
with
buxom
creases
in
her
throat
,
proceeded
to
expound
her
views
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
a
good
house
in
a
good
neighbourhood
,
good
things
about
us
,
good
living
,
and
good
society

<EOS>
I
say
,
live
like
our
means
,
without
extravagance

and
be
happy

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
I
say
be
happy

too

assented
the
still
pensive
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
-
a

mussy

"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Boffin
,
laughing
and
clapping
her
hands
,
and
gaily
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
,
"
when
I
think
of
me
in
a
light
yellow
chariot
and
pair
,
with
silver
boxes
to
the
wheels
---
"
  
"
Oh
!
you
was
thinking
of
that
,
was
you
,
my
dear

"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes

cried
the
delighted
creature
.
"
<EOS>
And
with
a
footman
up
behind
,
with
a
bar
across
,
to
keep
his
legs
from
being
poled
!
<EOS>
And
with
a
coachman
up
in
front
,
sinking
down
into
a
seat
big
enough
for
three
of
him
,
all
covered
with
upholstery
in
green
and
white
!
<EOS>
And
with
two
bay
horses
tossing
their
heads
and
stepping
higher
than
they
trot
long

ways
!
<EOS>
And
with
you

leaning
back
inside

as
grand
as
ninepence

<EOS>
Oh

h

h
My

<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
ha
ha

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
clapped
her
hands
again
,
rocked
herself
again
,
beat
her
feet
upon
the
floor
,
and
wiped
the
tears
of
laughter
from
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
,
my
old
lady
,
"
inquired
Mr.
Boffin
,
when
he
also
had
sympathetically
laughed
:
"
what
's
your
views
on
the
subject
of
the
Bower
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shut
it
up

<EOS>
Do
n't
part
with
it

but
put
somebody
in
it

to
keep
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
other
views

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Noddy

said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
coming
from
her
fashionable
sofa
to
his
side
on
the
plain
settle
,
and
hooking
her
comfortable
arm
through
his
,
"
<EOS>
Next
I
think
---
and
I
really
have
been
thinking
early
and
late
 
---
of
the
disappointed
girl
;
her
that
was
so
cruelly
disappointed
,
you
know
,
both
of
her
husband
and
his
riches
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
we
might
do
something
for
her
?
<EOS>
Have
her
to
live
with
us
?
<EOS>
Or
something
of
that
sort
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ne
-
ver
once
thought
of
the
way
of
doing
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr.
Boffin
,
smiting
the
table
in
his
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
thinking
steamingein
this
old
lady
is
.
<EOS>
And
she
do
n't
know
how
she
does
it
.
<EOS>
Neither
does
the
ingein
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
pulled
his
nearest
ear
,
in
acknowledgment
of
this
piece
of
philosophy
,
and
then
said
,
gradually
toning
down
to
a
motherly
strain
:
"
Last
,
and
not
least
,
I
have
taken
a
fancy
.
<EOS>
You
remember
dear
little
John
Harmon
,
before
he
went
to
school
?
<EOS>
Over
yonder
across
the
yard
,
at
our
fire
?
<EOS>
Now
that
he
is
past
all
benefit
of
the
money
,
and
it
's
come
to
us
,
I
should
like
to
find
some
orphan
child
,
and
take
the
boy
and
adopt
him
and
give
him
John
's
name
,
and
provide
for
him
.
<EOS>
Somehow
,
it
would
make
me
easier
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
Say
it
's
only
a
whim
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
I
do
n't
say
so
,
"
interposed
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
but
deary
,
if
you
did
---
"
  
"
I
should
be
a
Beast
if
I
did
,
"
her
husband
interposed
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
as
much
as
to
say
you
agree
?
<EOS>
Good
and
kind
of
you
,
and
like
you
,
deary
!
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
begin
to
find
it
pleasant
now
,
"
said
Mrs
,
.
<EOS>
Boffin
,
once
more
radiant
in
her
comely
way
from
head
to
foot
,
and
once
more
smoothing
her
dress
with
immense
enjoyment
,
"
do
n't
you
begin
to
find
it
pleasant
already
,
to
think
that
a
child
will
be
made
brighter
,
and
better
,
and
happier
,
because
of
that
poor
sad
child
that
day
?
<EOS>
And
is
n't
it
pleasant
to
know
that
the
good
will
be
done
with
the
poor
sad
child
's
own
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
<EOS>
and
it
's
pleasant
to
know
that
you
are
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
said
her
husband
,
"
and
it
's
been
a
pleasant
thing
to
know
this
many
and
many
a
year
!
<EOS>
"
It
was
ruin
to
Mrs.
Boffin
's
aspirations
,
but
,
having
so
spoken
,
they
sat
side
by
side
,
a
hopelessly
Unfashionable
pair
.
  
<EOS>
These
two
ignorant
and
unpolished
people
had
guided
themselves
so
far
on
in
their
journey
of
life
,
by
a
religious
sense
of
duty
and
desire
to
do
right
.
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
weaknesses
and
absurdities
might
have
been
detected
in
the
breasts
of
both
;
<EOS>
ten
thousand
vanities
additional
,
possibly
,
in
the
breast
of
the
woman
.
<EOS>
But
the
hard
wrathful
and
sordid
nature
that
had
wrung
as
much
work
out
of
them
as
could
be
got
in
their
best
days
,
for
as
little
money
as
could
be
paid
to
hurry
on
their
worst
,
had
never
been
so
warped
but
that
it
knew
their
moral
straightness
and
respected
it
.
<EOS>
In
its
own
despite
,
in
a
constant
conflict
with
itself
and
them
,
it
had
done
so
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
the
eternal
law
.
<EOS>
For
,
Evil
often
stops
short
at
itself
and
dies
with
the
doer
of
it
;
but
Good
,
never
.
  
<EOS>
Through
his
most
inveterate
purposes
,
the
dead
Jailer
of
Harmony
Jail
had
known
these
two
faithful
servants
to
be
honest
and
true
.
<EOS>
While
he
raged
at
them
and
reviled
them
for
opposing
him
with
the
speech
of
the
honest
and
true
,
it
had
scratched
his
stony
heart
,
and
he
had
perceived
the
powerlessness
of
all
his
wealth
to
buy
them
if
he
had
addressed
himself
to
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
So
,
even
while
he
was
their
griping
taskmaster
and
never
gave
them
a
good
word
,
he
had
written
their
names
down
in
his
will
.
<EOS>
So
,
even
while
it
was
his
daily
declaration
that
he
mistrusted
all
mankind
---
and
sorely
indeed
he
did
mistrust
all
who
bore
any
resemblance
to
himself
---
  
<EOS>
he
was
as
certain
that
these
two
people
,
surviving
him
,
would
be
trustworthy
in
all
things
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
,
as
he
was
that
he
must
surely
die
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
sitting
side
by
side
,
with
Fashion
withdrawn
to
an
immeasurable
distance
,
fell
to
discussing
how
they
could
best
find
their
orphan
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
suggested
advertisement
in
the
newspapers
,
requesting
orphans
answering
annexed
description
to
apply
at
the
Bower
on
a
certain
day
;
but
Mr.
Boffin
wisely
apprehending
obstruction
of
the
neighbouring
thoroughfares
by
orphan
swarms
,
this
course
was
negatived
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
next
suggested
application
to
their
clergyman
for
a
likely
orphan
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
thinking
better
of
this
scheme
,
they
resolved
to
call
upon
the
reverend
gentleman
at
once
,
and
to
take
the
same
opportunity
of
making
acquaintance
with
Miss
Bella
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
In
order
that
these
visits
might
be
visits
of
state
,
Mrs.
Boffin
's
equipage
was
ordered
out
.
  
<EOS>
This
consisted
of
a
long
hammer
-
headed
old
horse
,
formerly
used
in
the
business
,
attached
to
a
four
-
wheeled
chaise
of
the
same
period
,
which
had
long
been
exclusively
used
by
the
Harmony
Jail
poultry
as
the
favourite
laying
-
place
of
several
discreet
hens
.
<EOS>
An
unwonted
application
of
corn
to
the
horse
,
and
of
paint
and
varnish
to
the
carriage
,
when
both
fell
in
as
a
part
of
the
Boffin
legacy
,
had
made
what
Mr.
Boffin
considered
a
neat
turn
-
out
of
the
whole
;
and
a
driver
being
added
,
in
the
person
of
a
long
hammer
-
headed
young
man
who
was
a
very
good
match
for
the
horse
,
left
nothing
to
be
desired
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
had
been
formerly
used
in
the
business
,
but
was
now
entombed
by
an
honest
jobbing
tailor
of
the
district
in
a
perfect
Sepulchre
of
coat
and
gaiters
,
sealed
with
ponderous
buttons
.
  
<EOS>
Behind
this
domestic
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
took
their
seats
in
the
back
compartment
of
the
vehicle
:
which
was
sufficiently
commodious
,
but
had
an
undignified
and
alarming
tendency
,
in
getting
over
a
rough
crossing
,
to
hiccup
itself
away
from
the
front
compartment
.
<EOS>
On
their
being
descried
emerging
from
the
gates
of
the
Bower
,
the
neighbourhood
turned
out
at
door
and
window
to
salute
the
Boffins
.
<EOS>
Among
those
who
were
ever
and
again
left
behind
,
staring
after
the
equipage
,
were
many
youthful
spirits
,
who
hailed
it
in
stentorian
tones
with
such
congratulations
as
"
Nod
-
dy
Bof
-
fin
!
"
<EOS>
"
Bof
-
fin
's
mon
-
ey
!
"
<EOS>
"
Down
with
the
dust
,
Bof
-
fin
!
"
and
other
similar
compliments
.
<EOS>
These
,
the
hammer
-
headed
young
man
took
in
such
ill
part
that
he
often
impaired
the
majesty
of
the
progress
by
pulling
up
short
,
and
making
as
though
he
would
alight
to
exterminate
the
offenders
;
a
purpose
from
which
he
only
allowed
himself
to
be
dissuaded
after
long
and
lively
arguments
with
his
employers
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
Bower
district
was
left
behind
,
and
the
peaceful
dwelling
of
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvery
was
gained
.
<EOS>
The
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
's
abode
was
a
very
modest
abode
,
because
his
income
was
a
very
modest
income
.
<EOS>
He
was
officially
accessible
to
every
blundering
old
woman
who
had
incoherence
to
bestow
upon
him
,
and
readily
received
the
Boffins
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
a
young
man
,
expensively
educated
and
wretchedly
paid
,
with
quite
a
young
wife
and
half
a
dozen
quite
young
children
.
<EOS>
He
was
under
the
necessity
of
teaching
and
translating
from
the
classics
,
to
eke
out
his
scanty
means
,
yet
was
generally
expected
to
have
more
time
to
spare
than
the
idlest
person
in
the
parish
,
and
more
money
than
the
richest
.
<EOS>
He
accepted
the
needless
inequalities
and
inconsistencies
of
his
life
,
with
a
kind
of
conventional
submission
that
was
almost
slavish
;
and
any
daring
layman
who
would
have
adjusted
such
burdens
as
his
,
more
decently
and
graciously
,
would
have
had
small
help
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
ready
patient
face
and
manner
,
and
yet
with
a
latent
smile
that
showed
a
quick
enough
observation
of
Mrs.
Boffin
's
dress
,
Mr.
Milvey
,
in
his
little
book
-
room
---
charged
with
sounds
and
cries
as
though
the
six
children
above
were
coming
down
through
the
ceiling
,
and
the
roasting
leg
of
mutton
below
were
coming
up
through
the
floor
---
listened
to
Mrs.
Boffin
's
statement
of
her
want
of
an
orphan
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Mr.
Milvey
,
"
that
you
have
never
had
a
child
of
your
own
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Never
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
like
the
Kings
and
Queens
in
the
Fairy
Tales
,
I
suppose
you
have
wished
for
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
general
way
,
yes
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Milvey
smiled
again
,
as
he
remarked
to
himself
,
"
Those
kings
and
queens
were
always
wishing
for
children
.
<EOS>
"
It
occurring
to
him
,
perhaps
,
that
if
they
had
been
Curates
,
their
wishes
might
have
tended
in
the
opposite
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
we
had
better
take
Mrs.
Milvey
into
our
Council
.
<EOS>
She
is
indispensable
to
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
please
,
I
'll
call
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
Mr.
Milvey
called
,
"
Margaretta
,
my
dear
!
"
and
Mrs.
Milvey
came
down
.
<EOS>
A
pretty
,
bright
little
woman
,
something
worn
by
anxiety
,
who
had
repressed
many
pretty
tastes
and
bright
fancies
,
and
substituted
in
their
stead
,
schools
,
soup
,
flannel
,
coals
,
and
all
the
week
-
day
cares
and
Sunday
coughs
of
a
large
population
,
young
and
old
.
<EOS>
As
gallantly
had
Mr.
Milvey
repressed
much
in
himself
that
naturally
belonged
to
his
old
studies
and
old
fellow
-
students
,
and
taken
up
among
the
poor
and
their
children
with
the
hard
crumbs
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
my
dear
,
whose
good
fortune
you
have
heard
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Milvey
,
with
the
most
unaffected
grace
in
the
world
,
congratulated
them
,
and
was
glad
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
Yet
her
engaging
face
,
being
an
open
as
well
as
a
perceptive
one
,
was
not
without
her
husband
's
latent
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Boffin
wishes
to
adopt
a
little
boy
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Milvey
,
looking
rather
alarmed
,
her
husband
added
:
  
"
<EOS>
An
orphan
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
said
Mrs.
Milvey
,
reassured
for
her
own
little
boys
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
was
thinking
,
Margaretta
,
that
perhaps
old
Mrs.
Goody
's
grandchild
might
answer
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
dear
Frank
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
that
would
do
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
smiling
Mrs.
Boffin
,
feeling
it
incumbent
on
her
to
take
part
in
the
conversation
,
and
being
charmed
with
the
emphatic
little
wife
and
her
ready
interest
,
here
offered
her
acknowledgments
and
inquired
what
there
was
against
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
,
"
said
Mrs.
Milvey
,
glancing
at
the
Reverend
Frank
"
---
<EOS>
and
I
believe
my
husband
will
agree
with
me
when
he
considers
it
again
---
that
you
could
possibly
keep
that
orphan
clean
from
snuff
.
<EOS>
Because
his
grandmother
takes
so
many
ounces
,
and
drops
it
over
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
would
not
be
living
with
his
grandmother
then
,
Margaretta
,
"
 
said
Mr.
Milvey
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Frank
,
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
keep
her
from
Mrs.
Boffin
's
house
;
and
the
more
there
was
to
eat
and
drink
there
,
the
oftener
she
would
go
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
an
inconvenient
woman
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
's
not
uncharitable
to
remember
that
last
Christmas
Eve
<EOS>
she
drank
eleven
cups
of
tea
,
and
grumbled
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
not
a
grateful
woman
,
Frank
.
<EOS>
You
recollect
her
addressing
a
crowd
outside
this
house
,
about
her
wrongs
,
when
,
one
night
after
we
had
gone
to
bed
,
she
brought
back
the
petticoat
of
new
flannel
that
had
been
given
her
,
because
it
was
too
short
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
said
Mr.
Milvey
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
that
would
do
.
<EOS>
Would
little
Harrison
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Frank
!
"
remonstrated
his
emphatic
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
no
grandmother
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
but
I
do
n't
think
Mrs.
Boffin
would
like
an
orphan
who
squints
so
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
again
,
"
said
Mr.
Milvey
,
becoming
haggard
with
perplexity
.
<EOS>
"
If
a
little
girl
would
do
---
"
  
"
But
,
my
dear
Frank
,
Mrs.
Boffin
wants
a
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
again
,
"
said
Mr.
Milvey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tom
Bocker
is
a
nice
boy
"
(
thoughtfully
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
doubt
,
Frank
,
"
Mrs.
Milvey
hinted
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
"
if
Mrs.
Boffin
wants
an
orphan
quite
nineteen
,
who
drives
a
cart
and
waters
the
roads
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Milvey
referred
the
point
to
Mrs.
Boffin
in
a
look
;
on
that
smiling
lady
's
shaking
her
black
velvet
bonnet
and
bows
,
he
remarked
,
in
lower
spirits
,
"
that
's
true
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
concerned
at
giving
so
much
trouble
,
"
that
if
I
had
known
you
would
have
taken
so
much
pains
,
sir
---
<EOS>
and
you
too
,
ma'am

I
do
n't
think
I
would
have
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
say
that
!
"
urged
Mrs.
Milvey
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
do
n't
say
that
,
"
assented
Mr.
Milvey
,
"
because
we
are
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
giving
us
the
preference
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Which
Mrs.
Milvey
confirmed
;
and
really
the
kind
,
conscientious
couple
spoke
,
as
if
they
kept
some
profitable
orphan
warehouse
and
were
personally
patronized
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
is
a
responsible
trust
,
"
added
Mr.
Milvey
,
"
and
difficult
to
discharge
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
we
are
naturally
very
unwilling
to
lose
the
chance
you
so
kindly
give
us
,
and
if
you
could
afford
us
a
day
or
two
to
look
about
us
,
---
you
know
,
Margaretta
,
we
might
carefully
examine
the
workhouse
,
and
the
Infant
School
,
and
your
District
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
emphatic
little
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
orphans
,
I
know
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Milvey
,
quite
with
the
air
as
if
he
might
have
added
,
"
in
stock
,
"
and
quite
as
anxiously
as
if
there
were
great
competition
in
the
business
and
he
were
afraid
of
losing
an
order
,
"
over
at
the
clay
-
pits
;
but
they
are
employed
by
relations
or
friends
,
and
I
am
afraid
it
would
come
at
last
to
a
transaction
in
the
way
of
barter
.
<EOS>
And
even
if
you
exchanged
blankets
for
the
child
---
or
books
and
firing
---
it
would
be
impossible
to
prevent
their
being
turned
into
liquor
.
"
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
it
was
resolved
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Milvey
should
search
for
an
orphan
likely
to
suit
,
and
as
free
as
possible
from
the
foregoing
objections
,
and
should
communicate
again
with
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Then
,
Mr.
Boffin
took
the
liberty
of
mentioning
to
Mr.
Milvey
that
if
Mr.
Milvey
would
do
him
the
kindness
to
be
perpetually
his
banker
to
the
extent
of
"
a
twenty
-
pound
note
or
so
,
"
to
be
expended
without
any
reference
to
him
,
he
would
be
heartily
obliged
.
<EOS>
At
this
.
<EOS>
both
Mr.
Milvey
and
Mrs.
Milvey
were
quite
as
much
pleased
as
if
they
had
no
wants
of
their
own
,
but
only
knew
what
poverty
was
,
in
the
persons
of
other
people
;
and
so
the
interview
terminated
with
satisfaction
and
good
opinion
on
all
sides
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
old
lady
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
as
they
resumed
their
seats
behind
the
hammer
-
headed
horse
and
man
:
"
having
made
a
very
agreeable
visit
there
,
we
'll
try
Wilfer
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
,
on
their
drawing
up
at
the
family
gate
,
that
to
try
Wilfer
's
was
a
thing
more
easily
projected
than
done
,
on
account
of
the
extreme
difficulty
of
getting
into
that
establishment
;
three
pulls
at
the
bell
producing
no
external
result
,
though
each
was
attended
by
audible
sounds
of
scampering
and
rushing
within
.
<EOS>
At
the
fourth
tug
---
vindictively
administered
by
the
hammer
-
headed
young
man
 
---
Miss
Lavinia
appeared
,
emerging
from
the
house
in
an
accidental
manner
,
with
a
bonnet
and
parasol
,
as
designing
to
take
a
contemplative
walk
.
<EOS>
The
young
lady
was
astonished
to
find
visitors
at
the
gate
,
and
expressed
her
feelings
in
appropriate
action
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
!
"
<EOS>
growled
the
hammer
-
headed
young
man
through
the
bars
of
the
gate
,
and
at
the
same
time
shaking
it
,
as
if
he
were
on
view
in
a
Menagerie
;
"
they
've
been
here
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
did
you
say
?
"
asked
Miss
Lavinia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
!
<EOS>
"
returned
the
young
man
,
rising
into
a
roar
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
tripped
up
the
steps
to
the
house
-
door
,
tripped
down
the
steps
with
the
key
,
tripped
across
the
little
garden
,
and
opened
the
gate
.
"
Please
to
walk
in
,
"
said
Miss
Lavinia
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"
Our
servant
is
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
complying
,
and
pausing
in
the
little
hall
until
Miss
Lavinia
came
up
to
show
them
where
to
go
next
,
perceived
three
pairs
of
listening
legs
upon
the
stairs
above
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
legs
,
Miss
Bella
's
legs
,
Mr.
George
Sampson
's
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
<EOS>
,
I
think
?
"
said
Lavinia
,
in
a
warning
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Strained
attention
on
the
part
of
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
legs
,
of
Miss
Bella
's
legs
,
of
Mr.
George
Sampson
's
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
<EOS>
Miss.
"
  
"
If
you
'll
step
this
way
---
down
these
stairs
---
I
'll
let
Ma
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
Excited
flight
of
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
legs
,
of
Miss
Bella
's
legs
,
of
Mr.
George
Sampson
's
legs
.
  
<EOS>
After
waiting
some
quarter
of
an
hour
alone
in
the
family
sitting
-
room
,
which
presented
traces
of
having
been
so
hastily
arranged
after
a
meal
,
that
one
might
have
doubted
whether
it
was
made
tidy
for
visitors
,
or
cleared
for
blindman
's
buff
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
became
aware
of
the
entrance
of
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
majestically
faint
,
and
with
a
condescending
stitch
in
her
side
:
which
was
her
company
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
after
the
first
salutations
,
and
as
soon
as
she
had
adjusted
the
handkerchief
under
her
chin
,
and
waved
her
gloved
hands
,
"
to
what
am
I
indebted
for
this
honour
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
make
short
of
it
,
ma'am
,
"
returned
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
perhaps
you
may
be
acquainted
with
the
names
of
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
as
having
come
into
a
certain
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
a
dignified
bend
of
her
head
,
"
of
such
being
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
dare
say
,
ma'am
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Boffin
,
while
Mrs.
Boffin
added
confirmatory
nods
and
smiles
,
"
you
are
not
very
much
inclined
to
take
kindly
to
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
"
<EOS>
'
Twere
unjust
to
visit
upon
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
a
calamity
which
was
doubtless
a
dispensation
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
These
words
were
rendered
the
more
effective
by
a
serenely
heroic
expression
of
suffering
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
fairly
meant
,
I
am
sure
,
"
remarked
the
honest
Mr.
Boffin
;
 
"
Mrs.
Boffin
and
me
,
ma'am
,
are
plain
people
,
and
we
do
n't
want
to
pretend
to
anything
,
nor
yet
to
go
round
and
round
at
anything
:
because
there
's
always
a
straight
way
to
everything
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
we
make
this
call
to
say
,
that
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
the
honor
and
pleasure
of
your
daughter
's
acquaintance
,
and
that
we
shall
be
rejiced
if
your
daughter
will
come
to
consider
our
house
in
the
light
of
her
home
equally
with
this
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
we
want
to
cheer
your
daughter
,
and
to
give
her
the
opportunity
of
sharing
such
pleasures
as
we
are
a
going
to
take
ourselves
.
<EOS>
We
want
to
brisk
her
up
,
and
brisk
her
about
,
and
give
her
a
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
!
"
said
the
open
-
hearted
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
<EOS>
Let
's
be
comfortable
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
bent
her
head
in
a
distant
manner
to
her
lady
visitor
,
and
with
majestic
monotony
replied
to
the
gentleman
:
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
several
daughters
.
<EOS>
Which
of
my
daughters
am
I
to
understand
<EOS>
is
thus
favoured
by
the
kind
intentions
of
Mr.
Boffin
and
his
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
?
<EOS>
"
the
ever
-
smiling
Mrs.
Boffin
put
in
.
"
<EOS>
Naturally
,
Miss
Bella
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
-
h
!
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
a
severely
unconvinced
look
.
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
Bella
is
accessible
and
shall
speak
for
herself
.
"
<EOS>
Then
opening
the
door
a
little
way
,
simultaneously
with
a
sound
of
scuttling
outside
it
,
the
good
lady
made
the
proclamation
,
"
Send
Miss
Bella
to
me
!
"
<EOS>
Which
proclamation
,
though
grandly
formal
,
and
one
might
almost
say
heraldic
,
to
hear
,
was
in
fact
enunciated
with
her
maternal
eyes
reproachfully
glaring
on
that
young
lady
in
the
flesh
---
and
in
so
much
of
it
that
she
was
retiring
with
difficulty
into
the
small
closet
under
the
stairs
,
apprehensive
of
the
emergence
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
avocations
of
R.
W.
,
my
husband
,
"
Mrs.
Wilfer
explained
,
on
resuming
her
seat
,
"
keep
him
fully
engaged
in
the
City
at
this
time
of
the
day
,
or
he
would
have
had
the
honor
of
participating
in
your
reception
beneath
our
humble
roof
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
pleasant
premises
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
cheerfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
correcting
him
,
"
it
is
the
abode
of
conscious
though
independent
Poverty
.
"
  
<EOS>
Finding
it
rather
difficult
to
pursue
the
conversation
down
this
road
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
sat
staring
at
mid
-
air
,
and
Mrs.
Wilfer
sat
silently
giving
them
to
understand
that
every
breath
she
drew
required
to
be
drawn
with
a
self
-
denial
rarely
paralleled
in
history
,
until
Miss
Bella
appeared
:
whom
Mrs.
Wilfer
presented
,
and
to
whom
she
explained
the
purpose
of
the
visitors
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Miss
Bella
,
coldly
shaking
her
curls
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
doubt
if
I
have
the
inclination
to
go
out
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bella
!
"
Mrs.
Wilfer
admonished
her
;
"
Bella
,
you
must
conquer
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
do
what
your
Ma
says
,
and
conquer
it
,
my
dear
,
"
urged
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
because
we
shall
be
so
glad
to
have
you
,
and
because
you
are
much
too
pretty
to
keep
yourself
shut
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
that
,
the
pleasant
creature
gave
her
a
kiss
,
and
patted
her
on
her
dimpled
shoulders
;
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
sitting
stiffly
by
,
like
a
functionary
presiding
over
an
interview
previous
to
an
execution
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
going
to
move
into
a
nice
house
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
who
was
woman
enough
to
compromise
Mr.
Boffin
on
that
point
,
when
he
could
n't
very
well
contest
it
;
"
and
we
are
going
to
set
up
a
nice
carriage
,
and
we
'll
go
everywhere
and
see
everything
.
<EOS>
And
you
must
n't
,
"
seating
Bella
beside
her
,
and
patting
her
hand
,
"
you
must
n't
feel
a
dislike
to
us
to
begin
with
,
because
we
could
n't
help
it
,
you
know
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
the
natural
tendency
of
youth
to
yield
to
candour
and
sweet
temper
,
Miss
Bella
was
so
touched
by
the
simplicity
of
this
address
that
she
frankly
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
's
kiss
.
<EOS>
Not
at
all
to
the
satisfaction
of
that
good
woman
of
the
world
,
her
mother
,
who
sought
to
hold
the
advantageous
ground
of
obliging
the
Boffins
instead
of
being
obliged
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
youngest
daughter
,
Lavinia
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
glad
to
make
a
diversion
,
as
that
young
lady
reappeared
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
George
Sampson
,
a
friend
of
the
family
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
friend
of
the
family
was
in
that
stage
of
the
tender
passion
which
bound
him
to
regard
everybody
else
as
the
foe
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
round
head
of
his
cane
in
his
mouth
,
like
a
stopper
,
when
he
sat
down
.
<EOS>
As
if
he
felt
himself
full
to
the
throat
with
affronting
sentiments
.
<EOS>
And
he
eyed
the
Boffins
with
implacable
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
like
to
bring
your
sister
with
you
when
you
come
to
stay
with
us
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
<EOS>
of
course
we
shall
be
glad

<EOS>
The

you
please
yourself

Miss
Bella

you
'll
please
us

"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
consent
is
of
no
consequence
at
all

I
suppose

"
cried
Miss
Lavinia
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lavvy
,
"
said
her
sister

in
a
low
voice
,
"

be
seen
and
not
heard

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No

I

"
replied
the
sharp
Lavinia
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
a

to

taken
notice

`

Bring
your
sister
,
"
"
indeed

"
  
<EOS>
"
Lavinia

<EOS>
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
allow
you
to
utter
in
my
presence
the
absurd
suspicion
<EOS>
that
any
strangers
---
I
care
not
what
their
names

can
patronize
my
child

<EOS>
Do
you
dare
to
suppose
,
you
ridiculous
girl
,
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
would
enter
these
doors
upon
a
patronizing
errand
;
or
,
if
they
did
,
would
remain
within
them
,
only
for
one
single
instant
,
while
your
mother
had
the
strength
yet
remaining
in
her
vital
frame
to
request
them
to
depart
?
<EOS>
You
little
know
your
mother
if
you
presume
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
fine
,
"
Lavinia
began
to
grumble
,
when
Mrs.
Wilfer
repeated
:
  
"
Hold
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
allow
this
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
know
what
is
due
to
guests

<EOS>
Do
you
not
comprehend
that
in
presuming
to
hint
that
this
lady

gentleman
could
have
any
idea

patronizing
any
member
of
your
family
<EOS>

"
Never
mind
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
smilingly
:
"
we
do
n't
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
but
<EOS>
I
do
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
laughed
a
short
laugh
as
she
muttered
,
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
require
my
audacious
child
,
"
proceeded
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
a
withering
look
at
her
youngest
,
on
whom
it
had
not
the
slightest
effect
,
"
to
please
to
be
just
to
her
sister
Bella
;
to
remember
that
her
sister
Bella
is
much
sought
after
;
and
that
when
her
sister
Bella
accepts
an
attention
,
she
considers
herself
to
be
conferring
qui
-
<EOS>
i
-
ite
as
much
honour
,
"
<EOS>
---
this
with
an
indignant
shiver
,
---
"
as
she
receives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
here
Miss
Bella
repudiated
,
and
said
quietly
,
"
I
can
speak
for
myself
,
you
know
,
ma
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
bring
me
in

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
's
all
very
well
aiming
at
others
through
convenient
me
,
"
 
<EOS>
said
the
irrepressible
Lavinia
,
spitefully
;
"
but
I
should
like
to
ask
George
Sampson
what
he
says
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Sampson
,
"
proclaimed
Mrs
,
Wilfer
,
seeing
that
young
gentleman
take
his
stopper
out
,
and
so
darkly
fixing
him
with
her
eyes
as
that
he
put
it
in
again
:
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Sampson
,
as
a
friend
of
this
family
and
a
frequenter
of
this
house
,
is
,
I
am
persuaded
,
far
too
well
-
bred
to
interpose
on
such
an
invitation
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
exaltation
of
the
young
gentleman
moved
the
conscientious
Mrs.
Boffin
to
repentance
for
having
done
him
an
injustice
in
her
mind
,
and
consequently
to
saying
that
she
and
Mr.
Boffin
would
at
any
time
be
glad
to
see
him
;
an
attention
which
he
handsomely
acknowledged
by
replying
,
with
his
stopper
unremoved
,
"
Much
obliged
to
you
,
but
I
'm
always
engaged
,
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
However
,
Bella
compensating
for
all
drawbacks
by
responding
to
the
advances
of
the
Boffins
in
an
engaging
way
,
that
easy
pair
were
on
the
whole
well
satisfied
,
and
proposed
to
the
said
Bella
that
as
soon
as
they
should
be
in
a
condition
to
receive
her
in
a
manner
suitable
to
their
desires
,
Mrs.
Boffin
should
return
with
notice
of
the
fact
.
<EOS>
This
arrangement
Mrs.
Wilfer
sanctioned
with
a
stately
inclination
of
her
head
and
wave
of
her
gloves
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
Your
demerits
shall
be
overlooked
,
and
you
shall
be
mercifully
gratified
,
poor
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
-
the
-
bye
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
turning
back
as
he
was
going
,
"
you
have
a
lodger
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
,
"
Mrs.
Wilfer
answered
,
qualifying
the
low
expression
,
"
undoubtedly
occupies
our
first
floor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
call
him
Our
Mutual
Friend
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
What
sort
of
a
fellow
is
Our
Mutual
Friend
,
now
?
<EOS>
Do
you
like
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
is
very
punctual
,
very
quiet
,
a
very
eligible
inmate
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Because
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
explained
,
"
you
must
know
that
I
'm
not
particularly
well
acquainted
with
Our
Mutual
Friend
,
for
I
have
only
seen
him
once
.
<EOS>
You
give
a
good
account
of
him
.
<EOS>
Is
he
at
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
is
at
home
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
;
"
indeed
,
"
pointing
through
the
window
<EOS>
,
"
there
he
stands
at
the
garden
gate
.
<EOS>
Waiting
for
you
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perhaps
so
,
"
replied
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Saw
me
come
in
,
maybe
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
had
closely
attended
to
this
short
dialogue
.
<EOS>
Accompanying
Mrs.
Boffin
to
the
gate
,
she
as
closely
watched
what
followed
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
,
sir
,
how
are
you
?
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
that
I
told
you
of
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
gave
him
good
day
,
and
he
bestirred
himself
and
helped
her
to
her
seat
,
and
the
like
,
with
a
ready
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
for
the
present
,
Miss
Bella
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
calling
out
a
hearty
parting
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
meet
again
soon
!
<EOS>
And
then
I
hope
I
shall
have
my
little
John
Harmon
to
show
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
who
was
at
the
wheel
adjusting
the
skirts
of
her
dress
,
suddenly
looked
behind
him
,
and
around
him
,
and
then
looked
up
at
her
,
with
a
face
<EOS>
so
pale
that
Mrs.
Boffin
cried
:
  
"
Gracious
!
"
<EOS>
And
after
a
moment
,
"
What
's
the
matter
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
show
her
the
Dead
?
"
returned
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
an
adopted
child
.
<EOS>
One
I
have
told
her
of
.
<EOS>
One
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
give
the
name
to
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
took
me
by
surprise
,
"
said
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
and
it
sounded
like
an
omen
,
that
you
should
speak
of
showing
the
Dead
to
one
so
young
and
blooming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Bella
suspected
by
this
time
that
Mr.
Rokesmith
admired
her
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
knowledge
(
for
it
was
rather
that
than
suspicion
)
caused
her
to
incline
to
him
a
little
more
,
or
a
little
less
,
than
she
had
done
at
first
;
whether
it
rendered
her
eager
to
find
out
more
about
him
,
because
she
sought
to
establish
reason
for
her
distrust
,
or
because
she
sought
to
free
him
from
it
;
was
as
yet
dark
to
her
own
heart
.
<EOS>
But
at
most
times
he
occupied
a
great
amount
of
her
attention
,
and
she
had
set
her
attention
closely
on
this
incident
.
  
<EOS>
That
he
knew
it
as
well
as
she
<EOS>
,
she
knew
as
well
as
<EOS>
he
,
when
they
were
left
together
standing
on
the
path
by
the
garden
gate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Those
are
worthy
people
,
Miss
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
them
well
?
"
asked
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
reproaching
her
,
and
she
coloured
,
reproaching
herself
 
---
both
,
with
the
knowledge
that
she
had
meant
to
entrap
him
into
an
answer
not
true
---
when
he
said
"
I
know
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
he
told
us
he
had
seen
you
but
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
I
supposed
he
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
was
nervous
now
,
and
would
have
been
glad
to
recall
her
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
thought
it
strange
that
,
feeling
much
interested
in
you
,
I
should
start
at
what
sounded
like
a
proposal
to
bring
you
into
contact
with
the
murdered
man
who
lies
in
his
grave
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
known
 
---
of
course
in
a
moment
should
have
known
---
that
it
could
not
have
that
meaning
.
<EOS>
But
my
interest
remains
.
"
  
<EOS>
Re
-
entering
the
family
-
room
in
a
meditative
state
,
Miss
Bella
was
received
by
the
irrepressible
Lavinia
with
:
  
"
There
,
Bella
!
<EOS>
At
last
I
hope
you
have
got
your
wishes
realized
 
---
by
your
Boffins
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
rich
enough
now
---
with
your
Boffins
.
<EOS>
You
can
have
as
much
flirting
as
you
like
---
at
your
Boffins
.
<EOS>
But
you
wo
n't
take
me
to
your
Boffins
,
I
can
tell
you
---
you
and
your
Boffins
too
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
,
"
quoth
Mr.
George
Sampson
,
moodily
pulling
his
stopper
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Bella
's
Mr.
Boffin
comes
any
more
of
his
nonsense
to
me
,
I
only
wish
him
to
understand
,
as
betwixt
man
and
man
,
that
he
does
it
at
his
per
---
"
and
was
going
to
say
peril
;
but
Miss
Lavinia
,
having
no
confidence
in
his
mental
powers
,
and
feeling
his
oration
to
have
no
definite
application
to
any
circumstances
,
jerked
his
stopper
in
again
,
with
a
sharpness
that
made
his
eyes
water
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
worthy
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
having
used
her
youngest
daughter
as
a
lay
-
figure
for
the
edification
of
these
Boffins
,
became
bland
to
her
,
and
proceeded
to
develop
her
last
instance
of
force
of
character
,
which
was
still
in
reserve
.
<EOS>
This
was
,
to
illuminate
the
family
with
her
remarkable
powers
as
a
physiognomist
;
powers
that
terrified
R.
W.
<EOS>
whenever
let
loose
,
as
being
always
fraught
with
gloom
and
evil
which
no
inferior
prescience
was
aware
of
.
<EOS>
And
this
Mrs.
Wilfer
now
did
,
be
it
observed
,
in
jealousy
of
these
Boffins
,
in
the
very
same
moments
when
she
was
already
reflecting
how
she
would
flourish
these
very
same
Boffins
and
the
state
they
kept
,
over
the
heads
of
her
Boffinless
friends
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
their
manners
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
I
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
Of
their
appearance
,
I
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
Of
the
disinterestedness
of
their
intentions
towards
Bella
,
I
say
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
the
craft
,
the
secresy
,
the
dark
deep
underhanded
plotting
,
written
in
Mrs.
Boffin
's
countenance
,
make
me
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
an
incontrovertible
proof
that
those
baleful
attributes
were
all
there
,
Mrs.
Wilfer
shuddered
on
the
spot
.
   
<EOS>
A

There

The

she

his

While
the
Loves
and

have
been
preparing
this
torch
for
Hymen
,
which
is
to
be
kindled
to
-
morrow
,
Mr.
Twemlow
has
suffered
much
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
It
would
seem
that
both
the
mature
young
lady
and
the
mature
young
gentleman
must
indubitably
be
Veneering
's
oldest
friends
.
<EOS>
Wards
of
his
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
Yet
that
can
scarcely
be
,
for
they
are
older
than
himself
.
<EOS>
Veneering
has
been
in
their
confidence
throughout
,
and
has
done
much
to
lure
them
to
the
altar
.
<EOS>
He
has
mentioned
to
Twemlow
how
he
said
to
Mrs.
Veneering
,
"
Anastatia
,
this
must
be
a
match
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
mentioned
to
Twemlow
how
he
regards
Sophronia
Akershem
(
the
mature
young
lady
)
in
the
light
of
a
sister
,
and
Alfred
Lammle
(
the
mature
young
gentleman
)
in
the
light
of
a
brother
.
<EOS>
Twemlow
has
asked
him
whether
he
went
to
school
as
a
junior
with
Alfred
?
<EOS>
He
has
answered
,
"
Not
exactly
.
"
 
Whether
Sophronia
was
adopted
by
his
mother
?
<EOS>
He
has
answered
,
"
Not
precisely
so
.
<EOS>
"
Twemlow
's
hand
has
gone
to
his
forehead
with
a
lost
air
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
two
or
three
weeks
ago
,
Twemlow
,
sitting
over
his
newspaper
,
and
over
his
dry
-
toast
and
weak
tea
,
and
over
the
stable

yard
in
Duke
Street
,
St.
James
's
,
received
a
highly
-
perfumed
cocked

hat
and
monogram
from
Mrs.
Veneering
,
entreating
her
dearest
Mr.
T.
,
if
not
particularly
engaged
that
day
,
to
come
like
a
charming
soul
and
make
a
fourth
at
dinner
with
dear
Mr.
Podsnap
,
for
the
discussion
of
an
interesting
family
topic
;
the
last
three
words
doubly
underlined
and
pointed
with
a
note
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
And
Twemlow
,
replying
,
"
Not
engaged
,
and
more
than
delighted
,
"
goes
,
and
this
takes
place
:
  
<EOS>
"
My

Twemlow

says
Veneering

<EOS>
your
ready
response
to
Anastatia
's
unceremonious
invitation
is
truly
kind
,
and
like
an
old
,
old
friend
.
<EOS>
You
know
our
dear
friend
Podsnap
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Twemlow
ought
to
know
the
dear
friend
Podsnap
who
covered
him
with
so
much
confusion
,
and
he
says
he
does
know
him
,
and
Podsnap
reciprocates
.
<EOS>
Apparently
,
Podsnap
has
been
so
wrought
upon
in
a
short
time
,
as
to
believe
that
he
has
been
intimate
in
the
house
many
,
many
,
many
years
.
<EOS>
In
the
friendliest
manner
he
is
making
himself
quite
at
home
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
executing
a
statuette
of
the
Colossus
at
Rhodes
.
<EOS>
Twemlow
has
before
noticed
in
his
feeble
way
how
soon
the
Veneering
guests
become
infected
with
the
Veneering
fiction
.
<EOS>
Not
,
however
,
that
he
has
the
least
notion
of
its
being
his
own
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
friends
,
Alfred
and
Sophronia
,
"
pursues
Veneering
the
veiled
prophet
:
"
our
friends
Alfred
and
Sophronia
<EOS>
,
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
,
my
dear
fellows
,
are
going
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
As
my
wife
and
I
make
it
a
family
affair
the
entire
direction
of
which
we
take
upon
ourselves
,
of
course
our
first
step
is
to
communicate
the
fact
to
our
family
friends
.
  
<EOS>
(
"
Oh
!
"
thinks
Twemlow
,
with
his
eyes
on
Podsnap
,
"
then
there
are
only
two
of
us
,
and
he
's
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
hope
,
"
Veneering
goes
on
,
"
to
have
had
Lady
Tippins
to
meet
you
;
but
she
is
always
in
request
,
and
is
unfortunately
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
Oh
!
"
thinks
Twemlow
,
with
his
eyes
wandering
,
"
then
there
are
three
of
us
,
and
she
's
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
Mortimer
Lightwood
,
"
resumes
Veneering
,
"
whom
you
both
know
,
is
out
of
town
;
but
he
writes
,
in
his
whimsical
manner
,
that
as
we
ask
him
to
be
bridegroom
's
best
man
when
the
ceremony
takes
place
,
he
will
not
refuse
,
though
he
does
n't
see
what
he
has
to
do
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
Oh
!
"
thinks
Twemlow
,
with
his
eyes
rolling
,
"
then
there
are
four
of
us
,
and
he
's
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
Boots
and
Brewer
,
"
observes
Veneering
,
"
whom
you
also
know
,
<EOS>
I
have
not
asked
to
-
day
;
but
I
reserve
them
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
Then
,
"
thinks
Twemlow
,
with
his
eyes
shut
,
"
there
are
si
---
"
 
<EOS>
But
here
collapses
and
does
not
completely
recover
until
dinner
is
over
and
the
Analytical
has
been
requested
to
withdraw
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
We
now
come
,
"
says
Veneering
,
"
to
the
point
,
the
real
point
,
of
our
little
family
consultation
.
<EOS>
Sophronia
,
having
lost
both
father
and
mother
,
has
no
one
to
give
her
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
her
away
yourself
,
"
says
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Podsnap
,
no
.
<EOS>
For
three
reasons
.
<EOS>
Firstly
,
because
I
could
n't
take
so
much
upon
myself
when
I
have
respected
family
friends
to
remember
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
because
I
am
not
so
vain
as
to
think
that
I
look
the
part
.
<EOS>
Thirdly
,
because
Anastatia
is
a
little
superstitious
on
the
subject
and
feels
averse
to
my
giving
away
anybody
until
baby
is
old
enough
to
be
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
happen
if
he
did
?
<EOS>
"
Podsnap
inquires
of
Mrs.
Veneering
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr.
Podsnap
,
it
's
very
foolish
<EOS>
I
know
,
<EOS>
but
I
have
an
instinctive
presentiment
that
if
Hamilton
gave
away
anybody
else
first
,
he
would
never
give
away
baby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thus
Mrs.
Veneering
;
with
her
open
hands
pressed
together
,
and
each
of
her
eight
aquiline
fingers
looking
so
very
like
her
one
aquiline
nose
that
the
bran
-
new
jewels
on
them
seem
necessary
for
distinction
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
Podsnap
,
"
quoth
Veneering
,
"
there
is
a
tried
friend
of
our
family
who
,
I
think
and
hope
you
will
agree
with
me
,
Podsnap
,
is
the
friend
on
whom
this
agreeable
duty
almost
naturally
devolves
.
<EOS>
That
friend
,
"
saying
the
words
as
if
the
company
were
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
in
number
,
"
is
now
among
us
.
<EOS>
That
friend
is
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
!
"
<EOS>
From
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
friend
,
"
Veneering
repeats
with
greater
firmness
,
"
is
our
dear
good
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
sufficiently
express
to
you
,
my
dear
Podsnap
,
the
pleasure
I
feel
in
having
this
opinion
of
mine
and
Anastatia
's
so
readily
confirmed
by
you
,
that
other
equally
familiar
and
tried
friend
who
stands
in
the
proud
position
---
I
mean
who
proudly
stands
in
the
position
---
<EOS>
or
I
ought
rather
to
say
,
who
places
Anastatia
and
myself
in
the
proud
position
of
himself
standing
in
the
simple
position
---
of
baby
's
godfather
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
Veneering
is
much
relieved
in
mind
to
find
that
Podsnap
betrays
no
jealousy
of
Twemlow
's
elevation
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
it
has
come
to
pass
that
the
spring
-
van
is
strewing
flowers
on
the
rosy
hours
and
on
the
staircase
,
and
that
Twemlow
is
surveying
the
ground
on
which
he
is
to
play
his
distinguished
part
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
has
already
been
to
the
church
,
and
taken
note
of
the
various
impediments
in
the
aisle
,
under
the
auspices
of
an
extremely
dreary
widow
who
opens
the
pews
,
and
whose
left
hand
appears
to
be
in
a
state
of
acute
rheumatism
,
but
is
in
fact
voluntarily
doubled
up
to
act
as
a
money
-
box
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
Veneering
shoots
out
of
the
Study
<EOS>
wherein
he
is
accustomed
,
when
contemplative
,
to
give
his
mind
to
the
carving
and
gilding
of
the
Pilgrims
going
to
Canterbury
,
in
order
to
show
Twemlow
the
little
flourish
he
has
prepared
for
the
trumpets
of
fashion
,
describing
how
that
on
the
seventeenth
instant
,
at
St.
James
's
Church
,
the
Reverend
Blank
Blank
,
assisted
by
the
Reverend
Dash
Dash
,
united
in
the
bonds
of
matrimony
,
Alfred
Lammle
Esquire
,
of
Sackville
Street
,
Piccadilly
,
to
Sophronia
,
only
daughter
of
the
late
Horatio
Akershem
,
Esquire
,
of
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
Also
how
the
fair
bride
was
married
from
the
house
of
Hamilton
Veneering
,
Esquire
,
of
Stucconia
,
and
was
given
away
by
Melvin
Twemlow
,
Esquire
,
of
Duke
Street
,
St.
James
's
,
second
cousin
to
Lord
Snigsworth
,
of
Snigsworthy
Park
.
<EOS>
While
perusing
which
composition
,
Twemlow
makes
some
opaque
approach
to
perceiving
that
if
the
Reverend
Blank
Blank
and
the
Reverend
Dash
Dash
fail
,
after
this
introduction
,
to
become
enrolled
in
the
list
of
Veneering
's
dearest
and
oldest
friends
,
they
will
have
none
but
themselves
to
thank
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
After
which
,
appears
Sophronia
(
whom
Twemlow
has
seen
twice
in
his
lifetime
)
,
to
thank
Twemlow
for
counterfeiting
the
late
Horatio
Akershem
Esquire
,
broadly
of
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
And
after
her
,
appears
Alfred
(
whom
Twemlow
has
seen
once
in
his
lifetime
)
,
to
do
the
same
and
to
make
a
pasty
sort
of
glitter
,
as
if
he
were
constructed
for
candle
-
light
only
,
and
had
been
let
out
into
daylight
by
some
grand
mistake
.
<EOS>
And
after
that
,
comes
Mrs.
Veneering
,
in
a
pervadingly
aquiline
state
of
figure
,
and
with
transparent
little
knobs
on
her
temper
,
like
the
little
transparent
knob
on
the
bridge
of
her
nose
,
"
Worn
out
by
worry
and
excitement
,
"
as
she
tells
her
dear
Mr.
Twemlow
,
and
reluctantly
revived
with
curacoa
by
the
Analytical
.
<EOS>
And
after
that
,
the
bridesmaids
begin
to
come
by
railroad
from
various
parts
of
the
country
,
and
to
come
like
adorable
recruits
enlisted
by
a
sergeant
not
present
;
for
,
on
arriving
at
the
Veneering
depÙt
,
they
are
in
a
barrack
of
strangers
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
Twemlow
goes
home
to
Duke
Street
,
St.
James
's
,
to
take
a
plate
of
mutton
broth
with
a
chop
in
it
,
and
a
look
at
the
marriage
-
service
,
in
order
that
he
may
cut
in
at
the
right
place
to
-
morrow
;
and
he
is
low
,
and
feels
it
dull
over
the
livery
stable
-
yard
,
and
is
distinctly
aware
of
a
dint
in
his
heart
,
made
by
the
most
adorable
of
the
adorable
bridesmaids
.
<EOS>
For
,
the
poor
little
harmless
gentleman
once
had
his
fancy
,
like
the
rest
of
us
,
and
she
did
n't
answer
(
as
she
often
does
not
)
,
and
he
thinks
the
adorable
bridesmaid
is
like
the
fancy
as
she
was
then
(
which
she
is
not
at
all
)
,
and
that
if
the
fancy
had
not
married
some
one
else
for
money
,
but
had
married
him
for
love
,
he
and
she
would
have
been
happy
(
which
they
would
n't
have
been
)
,
and
that
she
has
a
tenderness
for
him
still
(
whereas
her
toughness
is
a
proverb
)
.
<EOS>
Brooding
over
the
fire
,
with
his
dried
little
head
in
his
dried
little
hands
,
and
his
dried
little
elbows
on
his
dried
little
knees
,
Twemlow
is
melancholy
.
"
<EOS>
No
Adorable
to
bear
me
company
here
!
<EOS>
"
thinks
he
.
"
<EOS>
No
Adorable
at
the
club
!
<EOS>
A
waste
,
a
waste
,
a
waste
,
my
Twemlow
!
"
<EOS>
And
so
drops
asleep
,
and
has
galvanic
starts
all
over
him
.
  
<EOS>
Betimes
next
morning
,
<EOS>
that
horrible
old
Lady
Tippins
(
relict
of
the
late
Sir
Thomas
Tippins
,
knighted
in
mistake
for
somebody
else
by
His
Majesty
King
George
the
Third
,
who
,
while
performing
the
ceremony
,
was
graciously
pleased
to
observe
,
"
What
,
what
,
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
Who
,
who
,
who

<EOS>
Why
,

"
)
begins
to
be
dyed
and
varnished
for
the
interesting
occasion
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
reputation
for
giving
smart
accounts
of
things
,
and
she
must
be
at
these
people
's
early
,
my
dear
,
to
lose
nothing
of
the
fun
.
<EOS>
Whereabout
in
the
bonnet
and
drapery
announced
by
her
name
,
any
fragment
of
the
real
woman
may
be
concealed
,
is
perhaps
known
to
her
maid
;
but
you
could
easily
buy
all
you
see
of
her
,
in
Bond
Street
;
or
you
might
scalp
her
,
and
peel
her
,
and
scrape
her
,
and
make
two
Lady
Tippinses
out
of
her
,
and
yet
not
penetrate
to
the
genuine
article
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
large
gold
eye
-
glass
,
has
Lady
Tippins
,
to
survey
the
proceedings
with
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
one
in
each
eye
,
it
might
keep
that
other
drooping
lid
up
,
and
look
more
uniform
.
<EOS>
But
perennial
youth
is
in
her
artificial
flowers
,
and
her
list
of
lovers
is
full
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mortimer
,
you
wretch
,
"
says
Lady
Tippins
,
turning
the
eye
-
glass
about
and
about
,
"
where
is
your
charge
,
the
bridegroom
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
you
my
honor
,
"
returns
Mortimer
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
and
I
do
n't
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miserable
!
<EOS>
Is
that
the
way
you
do
your
duty
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Beyond
an
impression
that
he
is
to
sit
upon
my
knee
and
be
seconded
at
some
point
of
the
solemnities
,
like
a
principal
at
a
prize
-
fight
,
I
assure
you
I
have
no
notion
what
my
duty
is
,
"
returns
Mortimer
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
is
also
in
attendance
,
with
a
pervading
air
upon
him
of
having
presupposed
the
ceremony
to
be
a
funeral
,
and
of
being
disappointed
.
<EOS>
The
scene
is
the
Vestry
-
room
of
St.
James
's
Church
,
with
a
number
of
leathery
old
registers
on
shelves
,
that
might
be
bound
in
Lady
Tippinses
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
hark
!
<EOS>
A
carriage
at
the
gate
,
and
Mortimer
's
man
arrives
,
looking
rather
like
a
spurious
Mephistophiles
and
an
unacknowledged
member
of
that
gentleman
's
family
.
<EOS>
Whom
Lady
Tippins
,
surveying
through
her
eye
-
glass
,
considers
a
fine
man
,
and
quite
a
catch
;
and
of
whom
Mortimer
remarks
,
in
the
lowest
spirits
,
as
he
approaches
,
"
I
believe
this
is
my
fellow

confound
him

<EOS>
More
carriages
at

characters

<EOS>
Whom
Lady
Tippins

standing
on

surveying
through

thus

off

with
a
flower
in
his

hole
,
his
hair
curled

and
his
gloves
buttoned
on
tight
,
apparently
come
prepared
,
if
anything
had
happened
to
the
bridgroom
,
to
be
married
instantly
.
<EOS>
Here
,
too
,
the
bride
's
aunt
and
next
relation
;
a
widowed
female
of
a
Medusa
sort
,
in
a
stoney
cap
,
glaring
petrifaction
at
her
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
Here
,
too
,
the
bride
's
trustee
;
an
oilcake
-
fed
style
of
business
-
gentleman
with
mooney
spectacles
,
and
an
object
of
much
interest
.
<EOS>
Veneering
launching
himself
upon
this
trustee
as
his
oldest
friend
(
which
makes
seven
,
Twemlow
thought
)
,
and
confidentially
retiring
with
him
into
the
conservatory
,
it
is
understood
that
Veneering
is
his
co
-
trustee
,
and
that
they
are
arranging
about
the
fortune
.
<EOS>
Buffers
are
even
overheard
to
whisper
Thir
-
ty
Thou
-
sand
Pou
-
nds
!
<EOS>
with
a
smack
and
a
relish
suggestive
of
the
very
finest
oysters
.
<EOS>
Pokey
unknowns
,
amazed
to
find
how
intimately
they
know
Veneering
,
pluck
up
spirit
,
fold
their
arms
,
and
begin
to
contradict
him
before
breakfast
.
<EOS>
What
time
Mrs.
Veneering
,
carrying
baby
dressed
as
a
bridesmaid
,
flits
about
among
the
company
,
emitting
flashes
of
many
-
coloured
lightning
from
diamonds
,
emeralds
,
and
rubies
.
  
<EOS>
The
Analytical
,
in
course
of
time
achieving
what
he
feels
to
be
due
to
himself
in
bringing
to
a
dignified
conclusion
several
quarrels
he
has
on
hand
with
the
pastrycook
's
men
,
announces
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Dining
-
room
no
less
magnificent
than
drawing
-
room
;
tables
superb
;
 
<EOS>
all
the
camels
out
,
and
all
laden
.
<EOS>
Splendid
cake
,
covered
with
Cupids
,
silver
,
and
true
-
lovers
knots
.
<EOS>
Splendid
bracelet
,
produced
by
Veneering
before
going
down
,
and
clasped
upon
the
arm
of
bride
.
<EOS>
Yet
nobody
seems
to
think
much
more
of
the
Veneerings
than
if
they
were
a
tolerable
landlord
and
landlady
doing
the
thing
in
the
way
of
business
at
so
much
a
head
.
<EOS>
The
bride
and
bridegroom
talk
and
laugh
apart
,
as
has
always
been
their
manner
;
and
the
Buffers
work
their
way
through
the
dishes
with
systematic
perseverance
,
as
has
always
been
their
manner
;
and
the
pokey
unknowns
are
exceedingly
benevolent
to
one
another
in
invitations
to
take
glasses
of
champagne
;
but
<EOS>
Mrs.
Podsnap
,
arching
her
mane
and
rocking
her
grandest
,
has
a
far
more
deferential
audience
than
Mrs.
Veneering
;
 
and
Podsnap
all
but
does
the
honours
.
  
<EOS>
Another
dismal
circumstance
is
,
that
Veneering
,
having
the
captivating
Tippins
on
one
side
of
him
and
the
bride
's
aunt
on
the
other
,
finds
it
immensely
difficult
to
keep
the
peace
.
<EOS>
For
,
Medusa
,
besides
unmistakingly
glaring
petrifaction
at
the
fascinating
Tippins
,
follows
every
lively
remark
made
by
that
dear
creature
,
with
an
audible
snort
:
which
may
be
referable
to
a
chronic
cold
in
the
head
,
but
may
also
be
referable
to
indignation
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
And
this
snort
being
regular
in
its
reproduction
,
at
length
comes
to
be
expected
by
the
company
,
who
make
embarrassing
pauses
when
it
is
falling
due
,
and
by
waiting
for
it
,
render
it
more
emphatic
when
it
comes
.
<EOS>
The
stoney
aunt
has
likewise
an
injurious
way
of
rejecting
all
dishes
<EOS>
whereof
Lady
Tippins
partakes
:
saying
aloud
when
they
are
proffered
to
her
,
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
not
for
me
.
<EOS>
Take
it
away
!
"
<EOS>
As
with
a
set
purpose
of
implying
a
misgiving
that
if
nourished
upon
similar
meats
,
she
might
come
to
be
like
that
charmer
,
which
would
be
a
fatal
consummation
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
her
enemy
,
Lady
Tippins
tries
a
youthful
sally
or
two
,
and
tries
the
eye
-
glass
;
but
,
from
the
impenetrable
cap
and
snorting
armour
of
the
stoney
aunt
all
weapons
rebound
powerless
.
  
<EOS>
Another
objectionable
circumstance
is
,
that
the
pokey
unknowns
support
each
other
in
being
unimpressible
.
<EOS>
They
persist
in
not
being
frightened
by
the
gold
and
silver
camels
,
and
they
are
banded
together
to
defy
the
elaborately
chased
ice
-
pails
.
<EOS>
They
even
seem
to
unite
in
some
vague
utterance
of
the
sentiment
that
the
landlord
and
landlady
will
make
a
pretty
good
profit
out
of
this
,
and
they
almost
carry
themselves
like
customers
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
there
compensating
influence
in
the
adorable
bridesmaids
;
for
,
having
very
little
interest
in
the
bride
,
and
none
at
all
in
one
another
,
those
lovely
beings
become
,
each
one
on
her
own
account
,
depreciatingly
contemplative
of
the
millinery
present
;
while
the
bridegroom
's
man
,
exhausted
,
in
the
back
of
his
chair
,
appears
to
be
improving
the
occasion
by
penitentially
contemplating
all
the
wrong
he
has
ever
done
;
the
difference
between
him
and
his
friend
Eugene
,
being
,
that
the
latter
,
in
the
back
of
his
chair
,
appears
to
be
contemplating
all
the
wrong
he
would
like
to
do
---
  
particularly
to
the
present
company
.
  
<EOS>
In
which
state
of
affairs
,
the
usual
ceremonies
rather
droop
and
flag
,
and
the
splendid
cake
when
cut
by
the
fair
hand
of
the
bride
has
but
an
indigestible
appearance
.
<EOS>
However
,
all
the
things
indispensable
to
be
said
are
said
,
and
all
the
things
indispensable
to
be
done
are
done
(
including
Lady
Tippins
's
yawning
,
falling
asleep
,
and
waking
insensible
)
,
and
there
is
hurried
preparation
for
the
nuptial
journey
to
the
Isle
of
Wight
,
and
the
outer
air
teems
with
brass
bands
and
spectators
.
<EOS>
In
full
sight
of
whom
,
the
malignant
star
of
the
Analytical
has
pre
-
ordained
that
pain
and
ridicule
shall
befall
him
.
<EOS>
For
he
,
standing
on
the
doorsteps
to
grace
the
departure
,
is
suddenly
caught
a
most
prodigious
thump
on
the
side
of
his
head
with
a
heavy
shoe
,
which
a
Buffer
in
the
hall
,
champagne
-
flushed
and
wild
of
aim
,
has
borrowed
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
from
the
pastrycook
's
porter
,
to
cast
after
the
departing
pair
as
an
auspicious
omen
.
  
<EOS>
So
they
all
go
up
again
into
the
gorgeous
drawing
-
rooms
---
<EOS>
all
of
them
flushed
with
breakfast
,
as
having
taken
scarlatina
sociably
 
---
and
there
the
combined
unknowns
do
malignant
things
with
their
legs
to
ottomans
,
and
take
as
much
as
possible
out
of
the
splendid
furniture
.
<EOS>
And
so
,
Lady
Tippins
,
quite
undetermined
whether
to
-
day
is
the
day
before
yesterday
,
or
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
or
the
week
after
next
,
fades
away
;
and
Mortimer
Lightwood
and
Eugene
fade
away
,
and
Twemlow
fades
away
,
and
the
stoney
aunt
goes
away
<EOS>
---
she
declines
to
fade
,
proving
rock
to
the
last
---
and
even
the
unknowns
are
slowly
strained
off
,
and
it
is
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
All
over
,
that
is
to
say
,
for
the
time
being
.
<EOS>
But
,
there
is
another
time
to
come
,
and
it
comes
in
about
a
fortnight
,
and
it
comes
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
on
the
sands
at
Shanklin
,
in
the
Isle
of
Wight
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
have
walked
for
some
time
on
the
Shanklin
sands
,
and
one
may
see
by
their
footprints
that
they
have
not
walked
arm
in
arm
,
and
that
they
have
not
walked
in
a
straight
track
,
and
that
they
have
walked
in
a
moody
humour
;
for
,
the
lady
has
prodded
little
spirting
holes
in
the
damp
sand
before
her
with
her
parasol
,
and
the
gentleman
has
trailed
his
stick
after
him
.
<EOS>
As
if
he
were
of
the
Mephistopheles
family
indeed
,
and
had
walked
with
a
drooping
tail
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
to
tell
me
,
then
,
Sophronia
---
"
  
Thus
he
begins
after
a
long
silence
,
when
Sophronia
flashes
fiercely
,
and
turns
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
put
it
upon
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
,
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
falls
silent
again
,
and
they
walk
as
before
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
opens
her
nostrils
and
bites
her
under
-
lip
;
Mr.
Lammle
takes
his
gingerous
whiskers
in
his
left
hand
,
and
,
bringing
them
together
,
frowns
furtively
at
his
beloved
,
out
of
a
thick
gingerous
bush
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
mean
to
say
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
after
a
time
repeats
,
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
Putting
it
on
me
!
<EOS>
The
unmanly
disingenuousness
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
stops
,
releases
his
whiskers
,
and
looks
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
haughtily
replies
,
without
stopping
,
and
without
looking
back
.
<EOS>
"
The
meanness
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
is
at
her
side
again
in
a
pace
or
two
,
and
he
retorts
,
"
That
is
not
what
you
said
.
<EOS>
You
said
disingenuousness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
did
?
"
  
"
There
is
no
`
`
if
"
"
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
You
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
,
then
.
<EOS>
And
what
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
of
it
?
"
says
Mr.
Lammle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
the
face
to
utter
the
word
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
face
,
too
!
"
replied
Mrs.
Lammle
,
staring
at
him
with
cold
scorn
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
how
dare
you
,
sir
,
utter
the
word
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
this
happens
to
be
true
,
Mrs.
Lammle
is
thrown
on
the
feminine
resource
of
saying
,
"
I
do
n't
care
what
you
uttered
or
did
not
utter
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
little
more
walking
and
a
little
more
silence
,
Mr.
Lammle
breaks
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
proceed
in
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
You
claim
a
right
to
ask
me
do
I
mean
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Do
I
mean
to
tell
you
what
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
you
are
a
man
of
property
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
married
me
on
false
pretences
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
be
it
.
<EOS>
Next
comes
what
you
mean
to
say
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
a
woman
of
property
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
married
me
on
false
pretences
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
so
dull
a
fortune
-
hunter
that
you
deceived
yourself
,
or
if
you
were
so
greedy
and
grasping
that
you
were
over
-
willing
to
be
deceived
by
appearances
,
is
it
my
fault
,
you
adventurer
?
"
<EOS>
the
lady
demands
,
with
great
asperity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
Veneering
,
and
he
told
me
you
were
rich
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Veneering
!
"
<EOS>
with
great
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
does
Veneering
know
about
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
he
not
your
trustee
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
trustee
,
but
the
one
you
saw
on
the
day
when
you
fraudulently
married
me
.
<EOS>
And
his
trust
is
not
a
very
difficult
one
,
for
it
is
only
an
annuity
of
a
hundred
and
fifteen
pounds
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
are
some
odd
shillings
or
pence
,
if
you
are
very
particular
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
bestows
a
by
no
means
loving
look
upon
the
partner
of
his
joys
and
sorrows
,
and
he
mutters
something
;
but
checks
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Question
for
question
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
turn
again
,
Mrs.
Lammle
.
<EOS>
What
made
you
suppose
me
a
man
of
property
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
made
me
suppose
you
so
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
deny
that
you
always
presented
yourself
to
me
in
that
character
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
asked
somebody
,
too
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Mrs.
Lammle
,
admission
for
admission
.
<EOS>
You
asked
somebody
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
Veneering
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Veneering
knew
as
much
of
me
as
he
knew
of
you
,
or
as
anybody
knows
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
more
silent
walking
,
the
bride
stops
short
,
to
say
in
a
passionate
manner
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
will
forgive
the
Veneerings
for
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
will
I
,
"
returns
the
bridegroom
.
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
they
walk
again
;
she
,
making
those
angry
spirts
in
the
sand
;
he
,
dragging
that
dejected
tail
.
<EOS>
The
tide
is
low
,
and
seems
to
have
thrown
them
together
high
on
the
bare
shore
.
<EOS>
A
gull
comes
sweeping
by
their
heads
,
and
flouts
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
golden
surface
on
the
brown
cliffs
but
now
,
and
behold
they
are
only
damp
earth
.
<EOS>
A
taunting
roar
comes
from
the
sea
,
and
the
farout
rollers
mount
upon
one
another
,
to
look
at
the
entrapped
impostors
,
and
to
join
in
impish
and
exultant
gambols
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
pretend
to
believe
,
"
Mrs.
Lammle
resumes
,
sternly
,
"
when
you
talk
of
my
marrying
you
for
worldly
advantages
,
that
it
was
within
the
bounds
of
reasonable
probability
that
I
would
have
married
you
for
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Again
there
are
two
sides
to
the
question
,
Mrs.
Lammle
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
pretend
to
believe
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
first
deceive
me
and
then
insult
me
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
lady
,
with
a
heaving
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
originated
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
double
-
edged
question
was
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
mine
!
"
<EOS>
the
bride
repeats
,
and
her
parasol
breaks
in
her
angry
hand
.
  
<EOS>
His
colour
has
turned
to
a
livid
white
,
and
ominous
marks
have
come
to
light
about
his
nose
,
as
if
the
finger
of
the
very
devil
himself
had
,
within
the
last
few
moments
,
touched
it
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
repressive
power
,
and
she
has
none
.
  
<EOS>
"
Throw
it
away
,
"
he
coolly
recommends
as
to
the
parasol
;
"
you
have
made
it
useless
;
you
look
ridiculous
with
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Whereupon
she
calls
him
in
her
rage
,
"
A
deliberate
villain
,
"
and
so
casts
the
broken
thing
from
her
as
that
it
strikes
him
in
falling
.
<EOS>
The
finger
-
marks
are
something
whiter
for
the
instant
,
but
he
walks
on
at
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
She
bursts
into
tears
,
declaring
herself
the
wretchedest
,
the
most
deceived
,
the
worst
-
used
,
of
women
.
<EOS>
Then
she
says
that
if
she
had
the
courage
to
kill
herself
,
she
would
do
it
.
<EOS>
Then
she
calls
him
vile
impostor
.
<EOS>
Then
she
asks
him
,
why
,
in
the
disappointment
of
his
base
speculation
,
he
does
not
take
her
life
with
his
own
hand
,
under
the
present
favourable
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Then
she
cries
again
.
<EOS>
Then
she
is
enraged
again
,
and
makes
some
mention
of
swindlers
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
she
sits
down
crying
on
a
block
of
stone
,
and
is
in
all
the
known
and
unknown
humours
of
her
sex
at
once
.
<EOS>
Pending
her
changes
,
those
aforesaid
marks
in
his
face
have
come
and
gone
,
now
here
now
there
,
like
white
stops
of
a
pipe
on
which
the
diabolical
performer
has
played
a
tune
.
<EOS>
Also
his
livid
lips
are
parted
at
last
,
as
if
he
were
breathless
with
running
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
is
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
get
up
,
Mrs.
Lammle
,
and
let
us
speak
reasonably
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
sits
upon
her
stone
,
and
takes
no
heed
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Get
up
,
I
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Raising
her
head
,
she
looks
contemptuously
in
his
face
,
and
repeats
,
<EOS>
"
You
tell
me
!
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
forsooth
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
affects
not
to
know
that
his
eyes
are
fastened
on
her
as
she
droops
her
head
again
;
but
her
whole
figure
reveals
that
she
knows
it
uneasily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Enough
of
this
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
Get
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
Yielding
to
his
hand
,
she
rises
,
and
they
walk
again
;
but
this
time
with
their
faces
turned
towards
their
place
of
residence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Lammle

we
have
both
been
deceiving

have
both
been
deceived

We

In

You
sought

out

Tut

<EOS>
Let
us
have
done
with
that

<EOS>
We
know
very
well
how
it
was
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
and
I
talk
about
it
,
when
you
and
I
ca
n't
disguise
it
?
<EOS>
To
proceed
.
<EOS>
I
am
disappointed
and
cut
a
poor
figure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
no
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
one
---
<EOS>
and
I
was
coming
to
you
,
if
you
had
waited
a
moment
.
<EOS>
You
,
too
,
are
disappointed
and
cut
a
poor
figure

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
injured
figure
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
now
cool
enough
,
Sophronia
,
to
see
that
you
ca
n't
be
injured
without
my
being
equally
injured
;
and
that
therefore
the
mere
word
is
not
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
When
I
look
back
,
I
wonder
how
I
can
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
take
you
to
<EOS>
so
great
an
extent
upon
trust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
I
look
back
---
"
the
bride
cries
,
interrupting
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
you
look
back
,
you
wonder
how
you
can
have
been
 
---
you
'll
excuse
the
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Most
certainly
,
with
so
much
reason
.
"
  
"
---
Such
a
fool
as
to
take
me
to
<EOS>
so
great
an
extent
upon
trust
.
<EOS>
But
the
folly
is
committed
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
get
rid
of
you
;
 
you
can
not
get
rid
of
me
.
<EOS>
What
follows
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shame
and
misery
,
"
the
bride
bitterly
replies
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
A
mutual
understanding
follows
,
and
I
think
it
may
carry
us
through
.
<EOS>
Here
I
split
my
discourse
(
give
me
your
arm
,
Sophronia
)
,
into
three
heads
,
to
make
it
shorter
and
plainer
.
<EOS>
Firstly
,
it
's
enough
to
have
been
done
,
without
the
mortification
of
being
known
to
have
been
done
.
<EOS>
So
we
agree
to
keep
the
fact
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
You
agree
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
possible
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Possible
!
<EOS>
We
have
pretended
well
enough
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
we
,
united
,
pretend
to
the
world
?
<EOS>
Agreed
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
we
owe
the
Veneerings
a
grudge
,
and
we
owe
all
other
people
the
grudge
of
wishing
them
to
be
taken
in
,
as
we
ourselves
have
been
taken
in
.
<EOS>
Agreed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
Agreed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
come
smoothly
to
thirdly
.
<EOS>
You
have
called
me
an
adventurer
,
Sophronia
.
<EOS>
So
I
am
.
<EOS>
In
plain
uncomplimentary
English
,
so
I
am
.
<EOS>
So
are
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
So
are
many
people
.
<EOS>
We
agree
to
keep
our
own
secret
,
and
to
work
together
in
furtherance
of
our
own
schemes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
schemes
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Any
scheme
that
will
bring
us
money
.
<EOS>
By
our
own
schemes
,
I
mean
our
joint
interest
.
<EOS>
Agreed
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
answers
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
"
I
suppose
so
.
<EOS>
Agreed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Carried
at
once
,
you
see
!
<EOS>
Now
,
Sophronia
,
only
half
a
dozen
words
more
.
<EOS>
We
know
one
another
perfectly
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
tempted
into
twitting
me
with
the
past
knowledge
that
you
have
of
me
,
because
it
is
identical
with
the
past
knowledge
that
I
have
of
you
,
and
in
twitting
me
,
you
twit
yourself
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
you
do
it
.
<EOS>
With
this
good
understanding
established
between
us
,
it
is
better
never
done
.
<EOS>
To
wind
up
all
:
---
You
have
shown
temper
today
,
Sophronia
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
betrayed
into
doing
so
again
,
because
I
have
a
Devil
of
a
temper
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
the
happy
pair
,
with
this
hopeful
marriage
contract
thus
signed
,
sealed
,
and
delivered
,
repair
homeward
.
<EOS>
If
,
when
those
infernal
finger
-
marks
were
on
the
white
and
breathless
countenance
of
Alfred
Lammle
,
Esquire
,
they
denoted
that
he
conceived
the
purpose
of
subduing
his
dear
wife
Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle
,
by
at
once
divesting
her
of
any
lingering
reality
or
pretence
of
self
-
respect
,
the
purpose
would
seem
to
have
been
presently
executed
.
<EOS>
The
mature
young
lady
has
mighty
little
need
of
powder
,
now
,
for
her
downcast
face
,
as
he
escorts
her
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
to
their
abode
of
bliss
.
   
<EOS>
PODSNAPPERY
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Podsnap
was
well
to
do
,
and
stood
very
high
in
Mr.
Podsnap
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
Beginning
with
a
good
inheritance
,
he
had
married
a
good
inheritance
,
and
had
thriven
exceedingly
in
the
Marine
Insurance
way
,
and
was
quite
satisfied
.
<EOS>
He
never
could
make
out
why
everybody
was
not
quite
satisfied
,
and
he
felt
conscious
that
he
set
a
brilliant
social
example
in
being
particularly
well
satisfied
with
most
things
,
and
,
above
all
other
things
,
with
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
happily
acquainted
with
his
own
merit
and
importance
,
Mr.
Podsnap
settled
that
whatever
he
put
behind
him
he
put
out
of
existence
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
dignified
conclusiveness
---
not
to
add
a
grand
convenience
---
in
this
way
of
getting
rid
of
disagreeables
which
had
done
much
towards
establishing
Mr.
Podsnap
in
his
lofty
place
in
Mr.
Podsnap
's
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
know
about
it
;
I
do
n't
choose
to
discuss
it
;
I
do
n't
admit
it
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Podsnap
had
even
acquired
a
peculiar
flourish
of
his
right
arm
in
often
clearing
the
world
of
its
most
difficult
problems
,
by
sweeping
them
behind
him
(
and
consequently
sheer
away
)
with
those
words
and
a
flushed
face
.
<EOS>
For
they
affronted
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Podsnap
's
world
was
not
a
very
large
world
,
morally
;
no
,
nor
even
geographically
:
seeing
that
although
his
business
was
sustained
upon
commerce
with
other
countries
,
he
considered
other
countries
,
with
that
important
reservation
,
a
mistake
,
and
of
their
manners
and
customs
would
conclusively
observe
,
"
Not
English
!
"
<EOS>
when
,
Presto
!
<EOS>
with
a
flourish
of
the
arm
,
and
a
flush
of
the
face
,
they
were
swept
away
.
<EOS>
Elsewise
,
the
world
got
up
at
eight
,
shaved
close
at
a
quarterpast
,
breakfasted
at
nine
,
went
to
the
City

came

Mr.

<EOS>
As
a
so
eminently
respectable
man
,
Mr.
Podsnap
was
sensible
of
its
being
required
of
him
to
take
Providence
under
his
protection
.
<EOS>
Consequently
he
always
knew
exactly
what
Providence
meant
.
<EOS>
Inferior
and
less
respectable
men
might
fall
short
of
that
mark
,
but
Mr.
Podsnap
was
always
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
very
remarkable
(
and
must
have
been
very
comfortable
)
that
what
Providence
meant
,
was
invariably
what
Mr.
Podsnap
meant
.
  
<EOS>
These
may
be
said
to
have
been
the
articles
of
a
faith
and
school
which
the
present
chapter
takes
the
liberty
of
calling
,
after
its
representative
man
,
Podsnappery
.
<EOS>
They
were
confined
within
close
bounds
,
as
Mr.
Podsnap
's
own
head
was
confined
by
his
shirt
-
collar
;
 
and
they
were
enunciated
with
a
sounding
pomp
that
smacked
of
the
creaking
of
Mr.
Podsnap
's
own
boots
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
Miss
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
And
this
young
rocking
-
horse
was
being
trained
in
her
mother
's
art
of
prancing
in
a
stately
manner
without
ever
getting
on
.
<EOS>
But
the
high
parental
action
was
not
yet
imparted
to
her
,
and
in
truth
she
was
but
an
undersized
damsel
,
with
high
shoulders
,
low
spirits
,
chilled
elbows
,
and
a
rasped
surface
of
nose
,
who
seemed
to
take
occasional
frosty
peeps
out
of
childhood
into
womanhood
,
and
to
shrink
back
again
,
overcome
by
her
mother
's
head
-
dress
and
her
father
from
head
to
foot
---
crushed
by
the
mere
dead
-
weight
of
Podsnappery
.
  
<EOS>
A
certain
institution
in
Mr.
Podsnap
's
mind
which
he
called
"
the
young
person
"
may
be
considered
to
have
been
embodied
in
Miss
Podsnap
,
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
inconvenient
and
exacting
institution
,
as
requiring
everything
in
the
universe
to
be
filed
down
and
fitted
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
question
about
everything
was
,
would
it
bring
a
blush
into
the
cheek
of
the
young
person
?
<EOS>
And
the
inconvenience
of
the
young
person
was
,
that
,
according
to
Mr.
Podsnap
,
she
seemed
always
liable
to
burst
into
blushes
when
there
was
no
need
at
all
.
<EOS>
There
appeared
to
be
no
line
of
demarcation
between
the
young
person
's
excessive
innocence
,
and
another
person
's
guiltiest
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Take
Mr.
Podsnap
's
word
for
it
,
and
the
soberest
tints
of
drab
,
white
,
lilac
,
and
grey
,
were
all
flaming
red
to
this
troublesome
Bull
of
a
young
person
.
  
<EOS>
The
Podsnaps
lived
in
a
shady
angle
adjoining
Portman
Square
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
kind
of
people
certain
to
dwell
in
the
shade
,
wherever
they
dwelt
.
<EOS>
Miss
Podsnap
's
life
had
been
,
from
her
first
appearance
on
this
planet
,
altogether
of
a
shady
order
;
for
,
Mr.
Podsnap
's
young
person
was
likely
to
get
little
good
out
of
association
with
other
young
persons
,
and
had
therefore
been
restricted
to
companionship
with
not
very
congenial
older
persons
,
and
with
massive
furniture
.
<EOS>
Miss
Podsnap
's
early
views
of
life
being
principally
derived
from
the
reflections
of
it
in
her
father
's
boots
,
and
in
the
walnut
and
rosewood
tables
of
the
dim
drawing
-
rooms
,
and
in
their
swarthy
giants
of
looking
-
glasses
,
were
of
a
sombre
cast
;
and
it
was
not
wonderful
that
now
,
when
she
was
on
most
days
solemnly
tooled
through
the
Park
by
the
side
of
her
mother
in
a
great
tall
custard
-
coloured
phaeton
<EOS>
,
she
showed
above
the
apron
of
that
vehicle
like
a
dejected
young
person
sitting
up
in
bed
to
take
a
startled
look
at
things
in
general
,
and
very
strongly
desiring
to
get
her
head
under
the

<EOS>
Said
Mr.
Podsnap
to
Mrs.
Podsnap
,
"
Georgiana
is
almost
eighteen
.
"
  
<EOS>
Said
Mrs.
Podsnap
to
Mr.
Podsnap
,
assenting
,
"
<EOS>
Almost
eighteen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Said
Mr.
Podsnap
then
to
Mrs.
Podsnap
,
"
Really
I
think
we
should
have
some
people
on
Georgiana
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Said
Mrs.
Podsnap
then
to
Mr.
Podsnap
,
"
Which
will
enable
us
to
clear
off
all
those
people
who
are
due
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
it
came
to
pass
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Podsnap
requested
the
honor
of
the
company
of
seventeen
friends
of
their
souls
at
dinner
;
and
that
they
substituted
other
friends
of
their
souls
for
such
of
the
seventeen
original
friends
of
their
souls
as
deeply
regretted
that
a
prior
engagement
prevented
their
having
the
honor
of
dining
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Podsnap
,
in
pursuance
of
their
kind
invitation
;
and
that
Mrs.
Podsnap
said
of
all
these
inconsolable
personages
,
as
she
checked
them
off
with
a
pencil
in
her
list
,
"
Asked
,
at
any
rate
,
and
got
rid
of
;
"
and
that
they
successfully
disposed
of
a
good
many
friends
of
their
souls
in
this
way
,
and
felt
their
consciences
much
lightened
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
still
other
friends
of
their
souls
who
were
not
entitled
to
be
asked
to
dinner
,
but
had
a
claim
to
be
invited
to
come
and
take
a
haunch
of
mutton
vapour
-
bath
at
half
-
past
nine
.
<EOS>
For
the
clearing
off
of
these
worthies
,
Mrs.
Podsnap
added
a
small
and
early
evening
to
the
dinner
,
and
looked
in
at
the
music
-
shop
to
bespeak
a
well
-
conducted
automation
to
come
and
play
quadrilles
for
a
carpet
dance
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Veneering
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Veneering
's
bran
-
new
bride
and
bridegroom
,
were
of
the
dinner
company
;
but
the
Podsnap
establishment
had
nothing
else
in
common
with
the
Veneerings
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Podsnap
could
tolerate
taste
in
a
mushroom
man
who
stood
in
need
of
that
sort
of
thing
,
but
was
far
above
it
himself
.
<EOS>
Hideous
solidity
was
the
characteristic
of
the
Podsnap
plate
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
made
to
look
as
heavy
as
it
could
,
and
to
take
up
as
much
room
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Everything
said
boastfully
,
"
Here
you
have
as
much
of
me
in
my
ugliness
as
if
I
were
only
lead
;
but
I
am
so
many
ounces
of
precious
metal
worth
so
much
an
ounce
;
---
would
n't
you
like
to
melt
me
down
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
corpulent
straddling
epergne
,
blotched
all
over
as
if
it
had
broken
out
in
an
eruption
rather
than
been
ornamented
,
delivered
this
address
from
an
unsightly
silver
platform
in
the
centre
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
Four
silver
wine
-
coolers
,
each
furnished
with
four
staring
heads
,
each
head
obtrusively
carrying
a
big
silver
ring
in
each
of
its
ears
,
conveyed
the
sentiment
up
and
down
the
table
,
and
handed
it
on
to
the
pot
-
bellied
silver
salt
-
cellars
.
<EOS>
All
the
big
silver
spoons
and
forks
widened
the
mouths
of
the
company
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
thrusting
the
sentiment
down
their
throats
with
every
morsel
they
ate
.
  
<EOS>
The
majority
of
the
guests
were
like
the
plate
,
and
included
several
heavy
articles
weighing
ever
so
much
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
foreign
gentleman
among
them
:
whom
Mr.
Podsnap
had
invited
after
much
debate
with
himself
---
believing
the
whole
European
continent
to
be
in
mortal
alliance
against
the
young
person
---
and
there
was
a
droll
disposition
,
not
only
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Podsnap
but
of
everybody
else
,
to
treat
him
as
if
he
were
a
child
who
was
hard
of
hearing
.
  
<EOS>
As
a
delicate
concession
to
this
unfortunately
-
born
foreigner
,
Mr.
Podsnap
,
in
receiving
him
,
had
presented
his
wife
as
"
Madame
Podsnap
;
"
also
his
daughter
as
"
Mademoiselle
Podsnap
,
"
with
some
inclination
to
add
"
ma
fille
,
"
in
which
bold
venture
,
however
,
he
checked
himself
.
<EOS>
The
Veneerings
being
at
that
time
the
only
other
arrivals
,
he
had
added
(
in
a
condescendingly
explanatory
manner
)
.
"
<EOS>
Monsieur
Vey

,
"
and
had
then
subsided
into
English
.
  
<EOS>
"
How

You

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Podsnap
now
inquired
from
his
station
of
host
,
as
if
he
were
administering
something
in
the
nature
of
a

potion
to
the

The

admired

"

Mr.

spaciously

<EOS>
The

found

did
not

<EOS>

Mr.

The

<EOS>
A
youngish
sallowish
gentleman
in
spectacles
,
with
a
lumpy
forehead
,
seated
in
a
supplementary
chair
at
a
corner
of
the
table
,
here
caused
a
profound
sensation
by
saying
,
in
a
raised
voice
,
"

then
stopping
dead

the

having
for

delivered
himself
of

spake

the

returned
Mr.

gravely
shaking
his

;
 
<EOS>
"

I
am
sorry

<EOS>
"
It

laughing
;

for

not

"
  
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly

assented
Mr.

;
"
<EOS>
But
So
it
is
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Charter
of
the
Land
.
<EOS>
This
Island
was
Blest
,
Sir
,
to
the
Direct
Exclusion
of
such

as
there
may
happen
to
be

<EOS>
And
if
we
were
all
Englishmen
present
,
I
would
say
,
"
added
Mr.
Podsnap
,
looking
round
upon
his
compatriots
,
and
sounding
solemnly
with
his
theme
,
"
that
there
is
in
the
Englishman
a
combination
of
qualities
,
a
modesty
,
an
independence
,
a
responsibility
,
a
repose
,
combined
with
an
absence
of
everything
calculated
to
call
a
blush
into
the
cheek
of
a
young
person
,
which
one
would
seek
in
vain
among
the
Nations
of
the
Earth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
delivered
this
little
summary
,
Mr.
Podsnap
's
face
flushed
,
as
he
thought
of
the
remote
possibility
of
its
being
at
all
qualified
by
any
prejudiced
citizen
of
any
other
country
;
and
,
with
his
favorite
right
-
arm
flourish
,
he
put
the
rest
of
Europe
and
the
whole
of
Asia
,
Africa
,
and
America
nowhere
.
  
<EOS>
The
audience
were
much
edified
by
this
passage
of
words
;
and
Mr.
Podsnap
,
feeling
that
he
was
in
rather
remarkable
force
to
-
day
,
became
smiling
and
conversational
.
  
<EOS>
"
Has
anything
more
been
heard
,
Veneering
,
"
he
inquired
,
"
of
the
lucky
legatee
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
more
,
"
returned
Veneering
,
"
than
that
he
has
come
into
possession
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
people
now
call
him
The
Golden
Dustman
.
<EOS>
I
mentioned
to
you
some
time
ago
,
I
think
,
that
the
young
lady
whose
intended
husband
was
murdered
is
daughter
to
a
clerk
of
mine
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
told
me
that
,
"
said
Podsnap
;
"
and
by
-
the
-
bye
,
I
wish
you
would
tell
it
again
here
,
for
it
's
a
curious
coincidence
---
curious
that
the
first
news
of
the
discovery
should
have
been
brought
straight
to
your
table
(
when
I
was
there
)
,
and
curious
that
one
of
your
people
should
have
been
so
nearly
interested
in
it
.
<EOS>
Just
relate
that
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
was
more
than
ready
to
do
it
,
for
he
had
prospered
exceedingly
upon
the
Harmon
Murder
,
and
had
turned
the
social
distinction
it
conferred
upon
him
to
the
account
of
making
several
dozen
of
bran
-
new
bosom
-
friends
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
such
another
lucky
hit
would
almost
have
set
him
up
in
that
way
to
his
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
So
,
addressing
himself
to
the
most
desirable
of
his
neighbours
,
while
Mrs.
Veneering
secured
the
next
most
desirable
,
he
plunged
into
the
case
,
and
emerged
from
it
twenty
minutes
afterwards
with
a
Bank
Director
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
Mrs.
Veneering
had
dived
into
the
same
waters
for
a
wealthy
Ship
-
Broker
,
and
had
brought
him
up
,
safe
and
sound
,
by
the
hair
.
<EOS>
Then
Mrs.
Veneering
had
to
relate
,
to
a
larger
circle
,
how
she
had
been
to
see
the
girl
,
and
how
she
was
really
pretty
,
and
(
considering
her
station
)
presentable
.
<EOS>
And
this
she
did
with
such
a
successful
display
of
her
eight
aquiline
fingers
and
their
encircling
jewels
,
that
she
happily
laid
hold
of
a
drifting
General
Officer
,
his
wife
and
daughter
,
and
not
only
restored
their
animation
which
had
become
suspended
,
but
made
them
lively
friends
within
an
hour
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Mr.
Podsnap
would
in
a
general
way
have
highly
disapproved
of
Bodies
in
rivers
as
ineligible
topics
with
reference
to
the
cheek
of
the
young
person
,
he
had
,
as
one
may
say
,
a
share
in
this
affair
which
made
him
a
part
proprietor
.
<EOS>
As
its
returns
were
immediate
,
too
,
in
the
way
of
restraining
the
company
from
speechless
contemplation
of
the
wine
-
coolers
,
it
paid
,
and
he
was
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
haunch
of
mutton
vapour
-
bath
having
received
a
gamey
infusion
,
and
a
few
last
touches
of
sweets
and
coffee
,
was
quite
ready
,
and
the
bathers
came
;
but
not
before
the
discreet
automaton
had
got
behind
the
bars
of
the
piano
music
-
desk
,
and
there
presented
the
appearance
of
a
captive
languishing
in
a
rosewood
jail
.
<EOS>
And
who
now
so
pleasant
or
so
well
assorted
as
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle
,
he
all
sparkle
,
she
all
gracious
contentment
,
both
at
occasional
intervals
exchanging
looks
like
partners
at
cards
who
played
a
game
against
All
England
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
much
youth
among
the
bathers
,
but
there
was
no
youth
(
the
young
person
always
excepted
)
in
the
articles
of
Podsnappery
.
<EOS>
Bald
bathers
folded
their
arms
and
talked
to
Mr.
Podsnap
on
the
hearthrug
;
sleek
-
whiskered
bathers
,
with
hats
in
their
hands
,
lunged
at
Mrs.
Podsnap
and
retreated
;
prowling
bathers
,
went
about
looking
into
ornamental
boxes
and
bowls
as
if
they
had
suspicions
of
larceny
on
the
part
of
the
Podsnaps
,
and
expected
to
find
something
they
had
lost
at
the
bottom
;
bathers
of
the
gentler
sex
sat
silently
comparing
ivory
shoulders
.
<EOS>
All
this
time
and
always
,
poor
little
Miss
Podsnap
,
whose
tiny
efforts
(
if
she
had
made
any
)
were
swallowed
up
in
the
magnificence
of
her
mother
's
rocking
,
kept
herself
as
much
out
of
sight
and
mind
as
she
could
,
and
appeared
to
be
counting
on
many
dismal
returns
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
It
was
somehow
understood
,
as
a
secret
article
in
the
state
proprieties
of
Podsnappery
that
nothing
must
be
said
about
the
day
.
<EOS>
Consequently
this
young
damsel
's
nativity
was
hushed
up
and
looked
over
,
as
if
it
were
agreed
on
all
hands
that
it
would
have
been
better
that
she
had
never
been
born
.
  
<EOS>
The
Lammles
were
so
fond
of
the
dear
Veneerings
that
they
could
not
for
some
time
detach
themselves
from
those
excellent
friends
;
but
at
length
,
either
a
very
open
smile
on
Mr.
Lammle
's
part
,
or
a
very
secret
elevation
of
one
of
his
gingerous
eyebrows
---
 
certainly
the
one
or
the
other
---
seemed
to
say
to
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
Why
do
n't
you
play
?
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
looking
about
her
,
she
saw
Miss
Podsnap
,
and
seeming
to
say
responsively
,
"
That
card
?
"
<EOS>
and
to
be
answered
,
"
Yes
,
"
went
and
sat
beside
Miss
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
was
overjoyed
to
escape
into
a
corner
for
a
little
quiet
talk
.
  
<EOS>
It
promised
to
be
a
very
quiet
talk
,
for
Miss
Podsnap
replied
in
a
flutter
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
's
very
kind
of
you
,
but
I
am
afraid
I
do
n't
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
make
a
beginning
,
"
said
the
insinuating
Mrs.
Lammle
,
with
her
best
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
you
'll
find
me
very
dull
.
<EOS>
But
Ma
talks
!
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
plainly
to
be
seen
,
for
Ma
was
talking
then
at
her
usual
canter
,
with
arched
head
and
mane
,
opened
eyes
and
nostrils
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fond
of
reading
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
At
least
I
---
do
n't
mind
that
so
much
,
"
returned
Miss
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
M
---
m
---
m
---
m
---
music
.
"
<EOS>
So
insinuating
was
Mrs.
Lammle
that
she
got
half
a
dozen
ms
into
the
word
before
she
got
it
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
nerve
to
play
even
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
Ma
plays
.
<EOS>
"
  
(
At
exactly
the
same
canter
,
and
with
a
certain
flourishing
appearance
of
doing
something
,
Ma
did
,
in
fact
,
occasionally
take
a
rock
upon
the
instrument
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
like
dancing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Miss
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
?
<EOS>
With
your
youth
and
attractions
?
<EOS>
Truly
,
my
dear
,
you
surprise
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
"
observed
Miss
Podsnap
,
after
hesitating
considerably
,
and
stealing
several
timid
looks
at
Mrs.
Lammle
's
carefully
arranged
face
,
"
how
I
might
have
liked
it
if
I
had
been
a

<EOS>
you
wo
n't
mention
it
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
<EOS>
Never
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
sure
you
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
then
how
I
should
have
liked
it
,
if
I
had
been
a
chimney
-
sweep
on
May
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gracious
!
"
was
the
exclamation
which
amazement
elicited
from
Mrs.
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
<EOS>
I
knew
you
'd
wonder
.
<EOS>
But
you
wo
n't
mention
it
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
you
make
me
ten
times
more
desirous
,
now
I
talk
to
you
,
to
know
you
well
than
I
was
when
I
sat
over
yonder
looking
at
you
.
<EOS>
How
I
wish
we
could
be
real
friends
!
<EOS>
Try
me
as
a
real
friend
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
fancy
me
a
frumpy
old
married
woman
,
my
dear
;
I
was
married
but
the
other
day
,
you
know
;
I
am
dressed
as
a
bride
now
<EOS>
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
About
the
chimney
-
sweeps
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
Ma'll
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
ca
n't
hear
from
where
she
sits
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
be
too
sure
of
that
,
"
said
Miss
Podsnap
,
in
a
lower
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
what
I
mean
is
,
that
they
seem
to
enjoy
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
that
perhaps
you
would
have
enjoyed
it
,
if
you
had
been
one
of
them
?
"
  
Miss
Podsnap
nodded
significantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
do
n't
enjoy
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
possible
?
"
said
Miss
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
it
is
such
a
dreadful
thing
!
<EOS>
If
I
was
wicked
enough
---
and
strong
enough
---
to
kill
anybody
,
it
should
be
my
partner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
such
an
entirely
new
view
of
the
Terpsichorean
art
as
socially
practised
,
that
Mrs.
Lammle
looked
at
her
young
friend
in
some
astonishment
.
<EOS>
Her
young
friend
sat
nervously
twiddling
her
fingers
in
a
pinioned
attitude
,
as
if
she
were
trying
to
hide
her
elbows
.
<EOS>
But
this
latter
Utopian
object
(
in
short
sleeves
)
always
appeared
to
be
the
great
inoffensive
aim
of
her
existence
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
sounds
horrid
,
do
n't
it
?
"
said
Miss
Podsnap
,
with
a
penitential
face
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
,
not
very
well
knowing
what
to
answer
,
resolved
herself
into
a
look
of
smiling
encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
,
and
it
always
has
been
,
"
pursued
Miss
Podsnap
,
"
such
a
trial
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
so
dread
being
awful
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
so
awful
!
<EOS>
No
one
knows
what
I
suffered
at
Madame
Sauteuse
's
,
where
I
learnt
to
dance
and
make
presentation
-
curtseys
,
and
other
dreadful
things
---
  
or
at
least
where
they
tried
to
teach
me
.
<EOS>
Ma
can
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
my
love
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
soothingly
,
"
that
's
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
over
,
"
returned
Miss
Podsnap
,
"
but
there
's
nothing
gained
by
that
.
<EOS>
It
's
worse
here
,
than
at
Madame
Sauteuse
's
.
<EOS>
Ma
was
there
,
and
Ma
's
here
;
but
Pa
was
n't
there
,
and
company
was
n't
there
,
and
there
were
not
real
partners
there
.
<EOS>
Oh
there
's
Ma
speaking
to
the
man
at
the
piano
!
<EOS>
Oh
there
's
Ma
going
up
to
somebody
!
<EOS>
Oh
I
know
she
's
going
to
bring
him
to
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
please
do
n't
,
please
do
n't
,
please
do
n't
!
<EOS>
Oh
keep
away
,
keep
away
,
keep
away
!
"
<EOS>
These
pious
ejaculations
Miss
Podsnap
uttered
with
her
eyes
closed
,
and
her
head
leaning
back
against
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
Ogre
advanced
under
the
pilotage
of
Ma
,
and
Ma
said
,
"
Georgiana
,
Mr.
Grompus
,
"
and
the
Ogre
clutched
his
victim
and
bore
her
off
to
his
castle
in
the
top
couple
.
<EOS>
Then
the
discreet
automaton
who
had
surveyed
his
ground
,
played
a
blossomless
tuneless
"
set
,
"
 
and
sixteen
disciples
of
Podsnappery
went
through
the
figures
of
---
  
1
,
Getting
up
at
eight
and
shaving
close
at
a
quarter
past
---
2
,
Breakfasting
at
nine
---
3
,
Going
to
the
City
at
ten
---
4
,
Coming
home
at
half
-
past
five
---
5
,
Dining
at
seven
,
and
the
grand
chain
.
  
<EOS>
While
these
solemnities
were
in
progress
,
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
(
most
loving
of
husbands
)
approached
the
chair
of
Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle
(
most
loving
of
wives
)
,
and
bending
over
the
back
of
it
,
trifled
for
some
few
seconds
with
Mrs.
Lammle
's
bracelet
.
<EOS>
Slightly
in
contrast
with
this
brief
airy
toying
,
one
might
have
noticed
a
certain
dark
attention
in
Mrs.
Lammle
's
face
as
she
said
some
words
with
her
eyes
on
Mr.
Lammle
's
waistcoat
,
and
seemed
in
return
to
receive
some
lesson
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
all
done
as
a
breath
passes
from
a
mirror
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
the
grand
chain
riveted
to
the
last
link
,
the
discreet
automaton
ceased
,
and
the
sixteen
,
two
and
two
,
took
a
walk
among
the
furniture
.
<EOS>
And
herein
the
unconsciousness
of
the
Ogre
Grompus
was
pleasantly
conspicuous
;
for
,
that
complacent
monster
,
believing
that
he
was
giving
Miss
Podsnap
a
treat
,
prolonged
to
the
utmost
stretch
of
possibility
a
peripatetic
account
of
an
archery
meeting
;
 
while
his
victim
,
heading
the
procession
of
sixteen
as
it
slowly
circled
about
,
like
a
revolving
funeral
,
never
raised
her
eyes
except
once
to
steal
a
glance
at
Mrs.
Lammle
,
expressive
of
intense
despair
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
procession
was
dissolved
by
the
violent
arrival
of
a
nutmeg
,
before
which
the
drawing
-
room
door
bounced
open
as
if
it
were
a
cannon
-
ball
;
and
while
that
fragrant
article
,
dispersed
through
several
glasses
of
coloured
warm
water
,
was
going
the
round
of
society
,
Miss
Podsnap
returned
to
her
seat
by
her
new
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
goodness
,
"
said
Miss
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
over
!
<EOS>
I
hope
you
did
n't
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
I
know
all
about
myself
,
"
said
Miss
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
something
I
know
about
you
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Lammle
in
her
winning
way
,
"
and
that
is
,
you
are
most
unnecessarily
shy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ma
ai
n't
,
"
said
Miss
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
"
---
I
detest
you
!
<EOS>
Go
along
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
shot
was
levelled
under
her
breath
at
the
gallant
Grompus
for
bestowing
an
insinuating
smile
upon
her
in
passing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
if
I
scarcely
see
,
my
dear
Miss
Podsnap
,
"
Mrs.
Lammle
was
beginning
when
the
young
lady
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
are
going
to
be
real
friends
(
and
I
suppose
we
are
,
for
you
are
the
only
person
who
ever
proposed
it
)
<EOS>
do
n't
let
us
be
awful
.
<EOS>
It
's
awful
enough
to
be
Miss
Podsnap
,
without
being
called
so
.
<EOS>
Call
me
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Georgiana
,
"
Mrs.
Lammle
began
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Miss
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Georgiana
,
pardon
me
if
I
scarcely
see
,
my
love
,
why
your
mamma
's
not
being
shy
,
is
a
reason
why
you
should
be
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
really
see
that
?
"
asked
Miss
Podsnap
,
plucking
at
her
fingers
in
a
troubled
manner
,
and
furtively
casting
her
eyes
now
on
Mrs.
Lammle
,
now
on
the
ground
.
"
<EOS>
Then
perhaps
it
is
n't
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
Georgiana
,
you
defer
much
too
readily
to
my
poor
opinion
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
is
not
even
an
opinion
,
darling
,
for
it
is
only
a
confession
of
my
dulness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
you
are
not
dull
,
"
returned
Miss
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
dull
,
but
you
could
n't
have
made
me
talk
if
you
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
Some
little
touch
of
conscience
answering
this
perception
of
her
having
gained
a
purpose
,
called
bloom
enough
into
Mrs.
Lammle
's
face
to
make
it
look
brighter
as
she
sat
smiling
her
best
smile
on
her
dear
Georgiana
,
and
shaking
her
head
with
an
affectionate
playfulness
.
<EOS>
Not
that
it
meant
anything
,
but
that
Georgiana
seemed
to
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
mean
is
,
"
pursued
Georgiana
,
"
that
Ma
being
so
endowed
with
awfulness
,
and
Pa
being
so
endowed
with
awfulness
,
and
there
being
so
much
awfulness
everywhere
---
<EOS>
I
mean
,
at
least
,
everywhere
where
I
am
---
perhaps
it
makes
me
who
am
so
deficient
in
awfulness
,
and
frightened
at
it
<EOS>
---
I
say
it
very
badly
---
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
can
understand
what
I
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Perfectly
,
dearest
Georgiana
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
was
proceeding
with
every
reassuring
wile
,
when
the
head
of
that
young
lady
suddenly
went
back
against
the
wall
again
and
her
eyes
closed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
there
's
Ma
being
awful
with
somebody
with
a
glass
in
his
eye
!
<EOS>
Oh
I
know
she
's
going
to
bring
him
here
!
<EOS>
Oh
do
n't
bring
him
,
do
n't
bring
him
!
<EOS>
Oh
he
'll
be
my
partner
with
his
glass
in
his
eye
!
<EOS>
Oh
what
shall
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
This
time
Georgiana
accompanied
her
ejaculations
with
taps
of
her
feet
upon
the
floor
,
and
was
altogether
in
quite
a
desperate
condition
.
<EOS>
But
,
there
was
no
escape
from
the
majestic
Mrs.
Podsnap
's
production
of
an
ambling
stranger
,
with
one
eye
screwed
up
into
extinction
and
the
other
framed
and
glazed
,
who
,
having
looked
down
out
of
that
organ
,
as
if
he
descried
Miss
Podsnap
at
the
bottom
of
some
perpendicular
shaft
,
brought
her
to
the
surface
,
and
ambled
off
with
her

<EOS>
And
then
the
captive
at
the
piano
played
another
"
set
,
"
expressive
of
his
mournful
aspirations
after
freedom
,
and
other
sixteen
went
through
the
former
melancholy
motions
,
and
the
ambler
took
Miss
Podsnap
for
a
furniture
walk
,
as
if
he
had
struck
out
an
entirely
original
conception
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
a
stray
personage
of
a
meek
demeanour
,
who
had
wandered
to
the
hearthrug
and
got
among
the
heads
of
tribes
assembled
there
in
conference
with
Mr.
Podsnap
,
eliminated
Mr.
Podsnap
's
flush
and
flourish
by
a
highly
unpolite
remark
;
no
less
than
a
reference
to
the
circumstance
that
some
half
-
dozen
people
had
lately
died
in
the
streets
,
of
starvation
.
<EOS>
It
was
clearly
ill
-
timed
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
adapted
to
the
cheek
of
the
young
person
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
in
good
taste
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Podsnap
,
putting
it
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
meek
man
was
afraid
we
must
take
it
as
proved
,
because
there
were
the
Inquests
and
the
Registrar
's
returns
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
was
their
own
fault
,
"
said
Mr.
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
Veneering
and
other
elders
of
tribes
commended
this
way
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
At
once
a
short
cut
and
a
broad
road
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
of
meek
demeanour
intimated
that
truly
it
would
seem
from
the
facts
,
as
if
starvation
had
been
forced
upon
the
culprits
in
question
---
as
if
,
in
their
wretched
manner
,
they
had
made
their
weak
protests
against
it
---
as
if
they
would
have
taken
the
liberty
of
staving
it
off
if
they
could
---
as
if
they
would
rather
not
have
been
starved
upon
the
whole
,
if
perfectly
agreeable
to
all
parties
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Podsnap
,
flushing
angrily
,
"
there
is
not
a
country
in
the
world
,
sir
,
where
so
noble
a
provision
is
made
for
the
poor
as
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
meek
man
was
quite
willing
to
concede
that
,
but
perhaps
it
rendered
the
matter
even
worse
,
as
showing
that
there
must
be
something
appallingly
wrong
somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
said
Mr.
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
The
meek
man
hinted
Would
n't
it
be
well
to
try
,
very
seriously
,
to
find
out
where
?
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr.
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
"
Easy
to
say
somewhere
;
not
so
easy
to
say
where
!
<EOS>
But
I
see
what
you
are
driving
at
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
Centralization
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Never
with
my
consent
.
<EOS>
Not
English
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
An
approving
murmur
arose
from
the
heads
of
tribes
;
as
saying
,
"
There
you
have
him
!
<EOS>
Hold
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
aware
(
the
meek
man
submitted
of
himself
)
that
he
was
driving
at
any
ization
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
favourite
ization
that
he
knew
of
.
<EOS>
But
he
certainly
was
more
staggered
by
these
terrible
occurrences
than
he
was
by
names
,
of
howsoever
<EOS>
so
many
syllables
.
<EOS>
Might
he
ask
,
was
dying
of
destitution
and
neglect
necessarily
English
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
the
population
of
London
is
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr.
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
The
meek
man
supposed
he
did
,
but
supposed
that
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
if
its
laws
were
well
administered
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
know
;
at
least
I
hope
you
know
;
"
said
Mr.
Podsnap
,
with
severity
,
"
that
Providence
has
declared
that
you
shall
have
the
poor
always
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
meek
man
also
hoped
he
knew
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Podsnap
with
a
portentous
air
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
It
will
render
you
cautious
how
you
fly
in
the
face
of
Providence
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
reference
to
that
absurd
and
irreverent
conventional
phrase
,
the
meek
man
said
,
for
which
Mr.
Podsnap
was
not
responsible
,
he
the
meek
man
had
no
fear
of
doing
anything
so
impossible
;
but
---
   
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Podsnap
felt
that
the
time
had
come
for
flushing
and
flourishing
this
meek
man
down
for
good
.
<EOS>
So
he
said
:
  
"
I
must
decline
to
pursue
this
painful
discussion
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
pleasant
to
my
feelings
;
it
is
repugnant
to
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
I
do
not
admit
these
things
.
<EOS>
I
have
also
said
that
if
they
do
occur
(
not
that
I
admit
it
)
,
the
fault
lies
with
the
sufferers
themselves
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
me
"
---
Mr.
Podsnap
pointed
"
me
"
forcibly
,
as
adding
by
implication
though
it
may
be
all
very
well
for
you
---
"
it
is
not
for
me
to
impugn
the
workings
of
Providence
.
<EOS>
I
know
better
than
that
,
I
trust
,
and
I
have
mentioned
what
the
intentions
of
Providence
are
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
said
Mr.
Podsnap
,
flushing
high
up
among
his
hair
-
brushes
,
with
a
strong
consciousness
of
personal
affront
,
"
the
subject
is
a
very
disagreeable
one
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
is
an
odious
one
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
one
to
be
introduced
among
our
wives
and
young
persons
,
and
I
---
<EOS>
"
He
finished
with
that
flourish
of
his
arm
which
added
more
expressively
than
any
words
,
And
I
remove
it
from
the
face
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
Simultaneously
with
this
quenching
of
the
meek
man
's
ineffectual
fire
,
Georgiana
having
left
the
ambler
up
a
lane
of
sofa
,
in
a
No
Thoroughfare
of
back
drawing
-
room
,
to
find
his
own
way
out
,
came
back
to
Mrs.
Lammle
.
<EOS>
And
who
should
be
with
Mrs.
Lammle
,
but
Mr.
Lammle
.
<EOS>
So
fond
of
her
!
  
<EOS>
"
Alfred
,
my
love
,
here
is
my
friend
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
,
dearest
girl
,
you
must
like
my
husband
next
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
was
proud
to
be
so
soon
distinguished
by
this
special
commendation
to
Miss
Podsnap
's
favour
.
<EOS>
But
if
Mr.
Lammle
were
prone
to
be
jealous
of
his
dear
Sophronia
's
friendships
,
he
would
be
jealous
of
her
feeling
towards
Miss
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
Georgiana
,
darling
,
"
interposed
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Towards
---
shall
I
?
---
Georgiana
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
uttered
the
name
,
with
a
delicate
curve
of
his
right
hand
,
from
his
lips
outward
.
"
<EOS>
For
never
have
I
known
Sophronia
(
who
is
not
apt
to
take
sudden
likings
)
<EOS>
so
attracted
and
so
captivated
as
she
is
by
---
<EOS>
shall
I
once
more
?
<EOS>
---
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
object
of
this
homage
sat
uneasily
enough
in
receipt
of
it
,
and
then
said
,
turning
to
Mrs.
Lammle
,
much
embarrassed
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
what
you
like
me
for
!
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
ca
n't
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Georgiana
,
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
For
your
difference
from
all
around
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
<EOS>
That
may
be
.
<EOS>
For
I
think
I
like
you
for
your
difference
from
all
around
me
.
"
said
Georgiana
with
a
smile
of
relief
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
be
going
with
the
rest
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Lammle
,
rising
with
a
show
of
unwillingness
,
amidst
a
general
dispersal
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
real
friends
,
Georgiana
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Real
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
night
,
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
established
an
attraction
over
the
shrinking
nature
upon
which
her
smiling
eyes
were
fixed
,
for
Georgiana
held
her
hand
while
she
answered
in
a
secret
and
half
-
frightened
tone
:
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
forget
me
when
you
are
gone
away
.
<EOS>
And
come
again
soon
.
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Charming
to
see
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
taking
leave
so
gracefully
,
and
going
down
the
stairs
so
lovingly
and
sweetly
.
<EOS>
Not
quite
so
charming
to
see
their
smiling
faces
fall
and
brood
as
they
dropped
moodily
into
separate
corners
of
their
little
carriage
.
<EOS>
But
to
be
sure
that
was
a
sight
behind
the
scenes
,
which
nobody
saw
,
and
which
nobody
was
meant
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
Certain
big
,
heavy
vehicles
,
built
on
the
model
of
the
Podsnap
plate
,
took
away
the
heavy
articles
of
guests
weighing
ever
so
much
;
and
the
less
valuable
articles
got
away
after
their
various
manners
;
and
the
Podsnap
plate
was
put
to
bed
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Podsnap
stood
with
his
back
to
the
drawing
-
room
fire
,
pulling
up
his
shirt
-
collar
,
like
a
veritable
cock
of
the
walk
literally
pluming
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
possessions
,
nothing
would
have
astonished
him
more
than
an
intimation
that
Miss
Podsnap
,
or
any
other
young
person
properly
born
and
bred
,
could
not
be
exactly
put
away
like
the
plate
,
brought
out
like
the
plate
,
polished
like
the
plate
,
counted
,
weighed
,
and
valued
like
the
plate
.
<EOS>
That
such
a
young
person
could
possibly
have
a
morbid
vacancy
in
the
heart
for
anything
younger
than
the
plate
,
or
less
monotonous
than
the
plate
;
or
that
such
a
young
person
's
thoughts
could
try
to
scale
the
region
bounded
on
the
north
,
south
,
east
,
and
west
,
by
the
plate
;
was
a
monstrous
imagination
which
he
would
on
the
spot
have
flourished
into
space
.
<EOS>
This
perhaps
in
some
sort
arose
from
Mr.
Podsnap
's
blushing
young
person
being
,
so
to
speak
,
all
cheek
:
whereas
there
is
a
possibility
that
there
may
be
young
persons
of
a
rather
more
complex
organization
.
  
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Podsnap
,
pulling
up
his
shirt
-
collar
,
could
only
have
heard
himself
called
"
that
fellow
"
in
a
certain
short
dialogue
,
which
passed
between
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
in
their
opposite
corners
of
their
little
carriage
,
rolling
home
!
  
<EOS>
"
Sophronia
,
are
you
awake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
likely
to
be
asleep

Very
likely

after

Attend

(
in

raised
voice

to
what
I
am
going

say

Keep
close

that
idiot
girl

<EOS>
Keep
her
under
your
thumb

<EOS>
You
have
her
fast

and
you
are
not
to
let
her
go

<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
foresee
there
is
money
to
be
made
out
of
this
,
besides
taking
that
fellow
down
a
peg

<EOS>
We
owe
cach
other
money
,
you
know

"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
wineed
a
little
at
the
reminder
,
but
only
enough
to
shake
her
scents
and
essences
anew
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
little
carriage
,
as
she
settled
herself
afresh
in
her
own
dark

THE
SWEAT
OF
AN
HONEST
MAN
'S
BROW
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
and
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
took
a
coffee
-
house
dinner
together
in
Mr.
Lightwood
's
office
.
<EOS>
They
had
newly
agreed
to
set
up
a
joint
establishment
together
.
<EOS>
They
had
taken
a
bachelor
cottage
near
Hampton
,
on
the
brink
of
the
Thames
,
with
a
lawn
,
and
a
boat
-
house
,
and
all
things
fitting
,
and
were
to
float
with
the
stream
through
the
summer
and
the
Long
Vacation
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
summer
yet
,
but
spring
;
and
it
was
not
gentle
spring
ethereally
mild
,
as
in
Thomson
's
Scasons
,
but
nipping
spring
with
an
easterly
wind
,
as
in
Johnson
's

Jackson
's
,
Dickson
's

Smith
's
,
and
Jones
's
Seasons
.
<EOS>
The
grating
wind
sawed
rather
than
blew
;
and
as
it
sawed
,
the
sawdust
whirled
about
the
sawpit
.
<EOS>
Every
street
was
a
sawpit
,
and
there
were
no
top
-
sawyers
;
every
passenger
was
an
under
-
sawyer
,
with
the
sawdust
blinding
him
and
choking
him
.
  
<EOS>
That
mysterious
paper
currency
which
circulates
in
London
when
the
wind
blows
,
gyrated
here
and
there
and
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Whence
can
it
come
,
whither
can
it
go
?
<EOS>
It
hangs
on
every
bush
,
<EOS>
flutters
in
every
tree
,
is
caught
flying
by
the
electric
wires
,
haunts
every
enclosure
,
drinks
at
every
pump
,
cowers
at
every
grating
,
shudders
upon
every
plot
of
grass
,
seeks
rest
in
vain
behind
the
legions
of
iron
rails
.
<EOS>
In
Paris
,
where
nothing
is
wasted
,
costly
and
luxurious
city
though
it
be
,
but
where
wonderful
human
ants
creep
out
of
holes
and
pick
up
every
scrap
,
there
is
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
There
,
it
blows
nothing
but
dust
.
<EOS>
There
,
sharp
eyes
and
sharp
stomachs
reap
even
the
east
wind
,
and
get
something
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
wind
sawed
,
and
the
sawdust
whirled
.
<EOS>
The
shrubs
wrung
their
many
hands
,
bemoaning
that
they
had
been
over
-
persuaded
by
the
sun
to
bud
;
the
young
leaves
pined
;
the
sparrows
repented
of
their
early
marriages
,
like
men
and
women
;
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
were
discernible
,
not
in
floral
spring
,
but
in
the
faces
of
the
people
whom
it
nibbled
and
pinched
.
<EOS>
And
ever
the
wind
sawed
,
and
the
sawdust
whirled
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
spring
evenings
are
too
long
and
light
to
shut
out
,
and
such
weather
is
rife
,
the
city
which
Mr.
Podsnap
so
explanatorily
called
London
,
Londres

London
,
is
at
its
worst
.
<EOS>
Such
a
black
shrill
city

combining
the
qualities
of
a
smoky
house
and
a
scolding
wife
;
such
a
gritty
city
;
such
a
hopeless
city
,
with
no
rent
in
the
leaden
canopy
of
its
sky
;
such
a
beleaguered
city
,
invested
by
the
great
Marsh
Forces
of
Essex
and
Kent
.
<EOS>
So
the
two
old
schoolfellows
felt
it
to
be
,
as
,
their
dinner
done
,
they
turned
towards
the
fire
to
smoke
.
<EOS>
Young
Blight
was
gone
,
the
coffee
-
house
waiter
was
gone
,
the
plates
and
dishes
were
gone
,
the
wine
was
going
---
but
not
in
the
same
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
wind
sounds
up
here
,
"
quoth
Eugene
,
stirring
the
fire
,
"
as
if
we
were
keeping
a
lighthouse
.
<EOS>
I
wish
we
were
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
it
would
bore
us
?
"
<EOS>
Lightwood
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
more
than
any
other
place
.
<EOS>
And
there
would
be
no
Circuit
to
go
.
<EOS>
But
that
's
a
selfish
consideration
,
personal
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
no
clients
to
come
,
"
added
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
Not
that
that
's
a
selfish
consideration
at
all
personal
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
were
on
an
isolated
rock
in
a
stormy
sea
,
"
said
Eugene
,
smoking
with
his
eyes
on
the
fire
,
"
Lady
Tippins
could
n't
put
off
to
visit
us
,
or
,
better
still
,
might
put
off
and
get
swamped
.
<EOS>
People
could
n't
ask
one
to
wedding
breakfasts
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
no
Precedents
to
hammer
at
,
except
the
plain
-
sailing
Precedent
of
keeping
the
light
up
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
exciting
to
look
out
for
wrecks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
otherwise
,
"
suggested
Lightwood
,
"
there
might
be
a
degree
of
sameness
in
the
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
of
that
also
,
"
said
Eugene
,
as
if
he
really
had
been
considering
the
subject
in
its
various
bearings
with
an
eye
to
the
business
;
"
but
it
would
be
a
defined
and
limited
monotony
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
extend
beyond
two
people
.
<EOS>
Now
,
it
's
a
question
with
me
,
Mortimer
,
whether
a
monotony
defined
with
that
precision
and
limited
to
that
extent
,
might
not
be
more
endurable
than
the
unlimited
monotony
of
one
's
fellow
-
creatures
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Lightwood
laughed
and
passed
the
wine
,
he
remarked
,
"
We
shall
have
an
opportunity
,
in
our
boating
summer
,
of
trying
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
imperfect
one
,
"
Eugene
acquiesced
,
with
a
sigh
,
"
<EOS>
but
so
we
shall
.
<EOS>
I
hope
we
may
not
prove
too
much
for
one
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Now
,
regarding
your
respected
father
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
bringing
him
to
a
subject
they
had
expressly
appointed
to
discuss
:
always
the
most
slippery
eel
of
eels
of
subjects
to
lay
hold
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
regarding
my
respected
father
,
"
assented
Eugene
,
settling
himself
in
his
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
have
approached
my
respected
father
by
candlelight
,
as
a
theme
requiring
a
little
artificial
brilliancy
;
but
we
will
take
him
by
twilight
,
enlivened
with
a
glow
of
Wallsend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
stirred
the
fire
again
as
he
spoke
,
and
having
made
it
blaze
,
resumed
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
respected
father
has
found
,
down
in
the
parental
neighbourhood
,
a
wife
for
his
not
-
generally
-
respected
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
some
money

of

"
  
<EOS>
"
With
some
money
,
of
course
,
or
he
would
not
have
found
her
.
<EOS>
My
respected
father
---
let
me
shorten
the
dutiful
tautology
by
substituting
in
future
M.
R.
F.
,
which
sounds
military
,
and
rather
like
the
Duke
of
Wellington
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
an
absurd
fellow
you
are
,
Eugene

<EOS>

Not
at
all
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
M.
R.
F.
having
always
in
the
clearest
manner
provided
(
as
he
calls
it
)
for
his
children
by
pre
-
arranging
from
the
hour
of
the
birth
of
cach
,
and
sometimes
from
an
earlier
period
,
what
the
devoted
little
victim
's
calling
and
course
in
life
should
be
,
M.
R.
F.
pre
-
arranged
for
myself
that
I
was
to
be
the
barrister
I
am
(
with
the
slight
addition
of
an
enormous
practice
,
which
has
not
accrued
)
,
and
also
the
married
man
I
am
not

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
you

often
told

"
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
I
have
often
told
you
.
<EOS>
Considering
myself
sufficiently
incongruous
on
my
legal
eminence
,
I
have
until
now
suppressed
my
domestic
destiny
.
<EOS>
You
know
M.
R.
F.
,
but
not
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
If
you
knew
him
as
well
as
I
do
,
he
would
amuse
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Filially
spoken
,
Eugene
!
"
  
"
Perfectly
so
,
believe
me
;
and
with
every
sentiment
of
affectionate
deference
towards
<EOS>
M.
R.
F.
But
if
he
amuses
me
,
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
When
my
eldest
brother
was
born
,
of
course
the
rest
of
us
knew
(
I
mean
the
rest
of
us
would
have
known
,
if
we
had
been
in
existence
)
that
he
was
heir
to
the
Family
Embarrassments
<EOS>
---
we
call
it
before
company
the
Family
Estate
.
<EOS>
But
when
my
second
brother
was
going
to
be
born
by
-
and
-
by
,
`
`
this
,
"
"
says
M.
R.
F.
,
`

is
a
little
pillar
of
the
church
.
"
<EOS>
"
Was
born
,
and
became
a
pillar
of
the
church
;
a
very
shaky
one
.
<EOS>
My
third
brother
appeared
,
considerably
in
advance
of
his
engagement
to
my
mother
;
but
M.
R.
F.
,
not
at
all
put
out
by
surprise
,
instantly
declared
him
a
Circumnavigator
.
<EOS>
Was
pitchforked
into
the
Navy
,
but
has
not
circumnavigated
.
<EOS>
I
announced
myself
,
and
was
disposed
of
with
the
highly
satisfactory
results
embodied
before
you
.
<EOS>
When
my
younger
brother
was
half
an
hour
old
,
it
was
settled
by
M.
R.
F.
that
he
should
have
a
mechanical
genius
.
<EOS>
And
so
on
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
say
that
M.
R.
F.
amuses
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Touching
the
lady
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
M.
R.
F.
ceases
to
be
amusing
,
because
my
intentions
are
opposed
to
touching
the
lady

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
her

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Not

Had
n't
you
better
see
her

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mortimer
,
you
have
studied
my
character

Could
I
possibly
go
down
there
,
labelled
`
`
Eligible

<EOS>
On
view

"
and
meet
the
lady
,
similarly
labelled
?
<EOS>
Anything
to
carry
out
M.
R.
F.
's
arrangements
,
I
am
sure
,
with
the
greatest
pleasure

except
matrimony
.
<EOS>
Could
I
possibly
support
it
?
<EOS>
I
,
so
soon
bored
,
so
constantly
,
<EOS>
so
fatally
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
a
consistent
fellow
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
susceptibility
to
boredom
,
"
returned
that
worthy
,
"
I
assure
you
I
am
the
most
consistent
of
mankind
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
was
but
now
that
you
were
dwelling
on
the
advantages
of
a
monotony
of
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
In
a
lighthouse
.
<EOS>
Do
me
the
justice
to
remember
the
condition
.
<EOS>
In
a
lighthouse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
laughed
again
,
and
Eugene
,
having
laughed
too
for
the
first
time
,
as
if
he
found
himself
on
reflection
rather
entertaining
,
relapsed
into
his
usual
gloom
,
and
drowsily
said
,
as
he
enjoyed
his
cigar
,
"
No
,
there
is
no
help
for
it
;
one
of
the
prophetic
deliveries
of
M.
R.
F.
must
for
ever
remain
unfulfilled
.
<EOS>
With
every
disposition
to
oblige
him
,
he
must
submit
to
a
failure
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
had
grown
darker
as
they
talked
,
and
the
wind
was
sawing
and
the
sawdust
was
whirling
outside
paler
windows
.
<EOS>
The
underlying
churchyard
was
already
settling
into
deep
dim
shade
,
and
the
shade
was
creeping
up
to
the
housetops
among
which
they
sat
.
<EOS>
"
As
if
,
"
 
said
Eugene
,
"
as
if
the
churchyard
ghosts
were
rising
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
walked
to
the
window
with
his
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
to
exalt
its
flavour
by
comparing
the
fireside
with
the
outside
,
when
he
stopped
midway
on
his
return
to
his
arm
-
chair
,
and
said
:
  
"
Apparently
one
of
the
ghosts
has
lost
its
way
,
and
dropped
in
to
be
directed
.
<EOS>
Look
at
this
phantom
!
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
,
whose
back
was
towards
the
door
,
turned
his
head
,
and
there
,
in
the
darkness
of
the
entry
,
stood
a
something
in
the
likeness
of
a
man
:
to
whom
he
addressed
the
not
irrelevant
inquiry
,
"
Who
the
devil
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardons
,
Governors
,
"
replied
the
ghost
,
in
a
hoarse
double
-
barrelled
whisper
,
"
but
might
either
on
you
be
Lawyer
Lightwood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
not
knocking
at
the
door
?
"
demanded
Mortimer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardons
,
Governors
,
"
replied
the
ghost
,
as
before
,
"
but
probable
you
was
not
aware
your
door
stood
open
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hereunto
<EOS>
the
ghost
again
hoarsely
replied
,
in
its
double
-
barrelled
manner
,
"
I
ask
your
pardons
,
Governors
,
but
might
one
on
you
be
Lawyer
Lightwood
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
us
is
,
"
said
the
owner
of
that
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
Governors
Both
,
"
returned
the
ghost
,
carefully
closing
the
room
door
;
"
'
tickler
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
lighted
the
candles
.
<EOS>
They
showed
the
visitor
to
be
an
ill
-
looking
visitor
with
a
squinting
leer
,
<EOS>
who
,
as
he
spoke
,
fumbled
at
an
old
sodden
fur
cap
,
formless
and
mangey
,
that
looked
like
a
furry
animal
,
dog
or
cat
,
puppy
or
kitten
,
drowned
and
decaying
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
"
what
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Governors
Both
,
"
returned
the
man
,
in
what
he
meant
to
be
a
wheedling
tone
,
"
which
on
you
might
be
Lawyer
Lightwood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
"
ducking
at
him
with
a
servile
air
,
"
I
am
a
man
as
gets
my
living
,
and
as
seeks
to
get
my
living
,
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
.
<EOS>
Not
to
risk
being
done
out
of
the
sweat
of
my
brow
,
by
any
chances
,
I
should
wish
afore
going
further
to
be
swore
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
a
swearer
in
of
people
,
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
visitor
,
clearly
anything
but
reliant
on
this
assurance
,
doggedly
muttered
"
Alfred
David
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
your
name
?
"
asked
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
?
"
returned
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
I
want
to
take
a
Alfred
David
.
"
  
<EOS>
(
Which
Eugene
,
smoking
and
contemplating
him
,
interpreted
as
meaning
Affidavit
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
with
his
indolent
laugh
,
"
that
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
swearing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
can
swear
at
you
,
"
Eugene
explained
;
"
and
so
can
I.
<EOS>
But
we
ca
n't
do
more
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Much
discomfited
by
this
information
,
the
visitor
turned
the
drowned
dog
or
cat
,
puppy
or
kitten
,
about
and
about
,
and
looked
from
one
of
the
Governors
Both
to
the
other
of
the
Governors
Both
,
while
he
deeply
considered
within
himself
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
decided
:
  
"
Then
I
must
be
took
down
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
asked
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
pen
and
ink
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
First
,
let
us
know
what
your
business
is
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
about
,
"
said
the
man
,
taking
a
step
forward
,
dropping
his
hoarse
voice
,
and
shading
it
with
his
hand
,
"
it
's
about
from
five
to
ten
thousand
pound
reward
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
it
's
about

<EOS>
It
's
about
Murder

<EOS>
That
's
what
it
's
about

"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
nearer
the
table
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
Will
you
have
a
glass
of
wine
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
will

"
said
the
man
;
"
and
I
do
n't
deceive
you
,
Governors

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
given
him
.
<EOS>
Making
a
stiff
arm
to
the
elbow
,
he
poured
the
wine
into
his
mouth
,
tilted
it
into
his
right
cheek
,
as
saying
,
"
What
do
you
think
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
tilted
it
into
his
left
cheek
,
as
saying
,
"
What
do
you
think
of
it

<EOS>
jerked
it
into
his
stomach
,
as
saying
,
"
What
do
you
think
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
To
conclude
,
smacked
his
lips
,
as
if
all
three
replied
,
"
<EOS>
We
think
well
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
have
another
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Yes

I
will

he
repeated
,
"
and
I
do
n't
deceive
you

Governors

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
also
repeated
the
other
proceedings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now

"
began
Lightwood
,
"
what
's
your
name
?

"
Why
,
there
you
're
rather
fast
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
"
he
replied
,
in
a
remonstrant
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
?
<EOS>
There
you
're
a
little
bit
fast
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
earn
from
five
to
ten
thousand
pound
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
;
and
as
a
poor
man
doing
justice
to
the
sweat
of
my
brow
,
is
it
likely
I
can
afford
to
part
with
so
much
as
my
name
without
its
being
took
down
?
"
  
<EOS>
Deferring
to
the
man
's
sense
of
the
binding
powers
of
pen
and
ink
and
paper
,
Lightwood
nodded
acceptance
of
Eugene
's
nodded
proposal
to
take
those
spells
in
hand
.
<EOS>
Eugene
,
bringing
them
to
the
table
,
sat
down
as
clerk
or
notary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
"
what
's
your
name
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
further
precaution
was
still
due
to
the
sweat
of
this
honest
fellow
's
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
wish
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
"
he
stipulated
,
"
to
have
that
T'other
Governor
as
my
witness
that
what
I
said
.
<EOS>
Consequent
,
will
the
T'other
Governor
be
so
good
as
chuck
me
his
name
and
where
he
lives
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eugene
,
cigar
in
mouth
and
pen
in
hand
,
tossed
him
his
card
.
<EOS>
After
spelling
it
out
slowly
,
the
man
made
it
into
a
little
roll
,
and
tied
it
up
in
an
end
of
his
neckerchief
still
more
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
for
the
third
time
,
"
if
you
have
quite
completed
your
various
preparations
,
my
friend
,
and
have
fully
ascertained
that
your
spirits
are
cool

not
in

hurried
,

's
your

<EOS>
"
Roger

"
  
<EOS>
Not
quite
so
glib
with
this
answer
as
with
the
previous
two
,
Mr.
Riderhood
gave
in
the
definition
,
"
Waterside
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
against
you
?
"
<EOS>
Eugene
quietly
put
in
,
as
he
wrote
.
  
<EOS>
Rather
baulked
,
Mr.
Riderhood
evasively
remarked
,
with
an
innocent
air
,
that
he
believed
the
T'other
Governor
had
asked
him
summa't
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ever
in
trouble

"
said
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
Once
.
"
(
Might
happen
to
any
man

Mr.
Riderhood
added
incidentally
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
On
suspicion
of
---
?
"
  
"
Of
seaman
's
pocket
,
"
said
Mr.
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whereby
I
was
in
reality
the
man
's
best
friend
,
and
tried
to
take
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
the
sweat
of
your
brow
?
"
asked
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
Till
it
poured
down
like
rain
,
"
said
Roger
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
and
smoked
with
his
eyes
negligently
turned
on
the
informer
,
and
his
pen
ready
to
reduce
him
to
more
writing
.
<EOS>
Lightwood
also
smoked
,
with
his
eyes
negligently
turned
on
the
informer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
let
me
be
took
down
again
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
when
he
had
turned
the
drowned
cap
over
and
under
,
and
had
brushed
it
the
wrong
way
(
if
it
had
a
right
way
)
with
his
sleeve
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
information
that
the
man
that
done
the
Harmon
Murder
is
Gaffer
Hexam
,
the
man
that
found
the
body
.
<EOS>
The
hand
of
Jesse
Hexam
,
commonly
called
Gaffer
on
the
river
and
along
shore
,
is
the
hand
that
done
that
deed
.
<EOS>
His
had
and
no

.
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
friends
glanced
at
one
another
with
more
serious
faces
than
they
had
shown
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
us
on
what
grounds
<EOS>
you
make
this
accusation
,
"
said
Mortimer
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
grounds
,
"
answered
Riderhood
,
wiping
his
face
with
his
sleeve
,
"
that
I
was
Gaffer
's
pardner
,
and
suspected
of
him
many
a
long
day
and
many
a
dark
night
.
<EOS>
On
the
grounds
that
I
knowed
his
ways
.
<EOS>
On
the
grounds
that
I
broke
the
pardnership
because
I
see
the
danger
;
which
I
warn
you
his
daughter
may
tell
you
another
story
about
that
,
for
anythink
I
can
say
,
but
you
know
what
it
'll
be
worth
,
for
she
'd
tell
you
lies
,
the
world
round
and
the
heavens
broad
,
to
save
her
father
.
<EOS>
On
the
grounds
that
it
's
well
understood
along
the
cause'ays
and
the
stairs
that
he
done
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
grounds
that
he
's
fell
off
from
,
because
he
done
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
grounds
that
I
will
swear
he
done
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
grounds
that
you
may
take
me
where
you
will
,
and
get
me
sworn
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
back
out
of
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
I
have
made
up
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Take
me
anywheres
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
this
is
nothing
,
"
said
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Riderhood
,
indignantly
and
amazedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Merely
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
goes
to
no
more
than
that
you
suspect
this
man
of
the
crime
.
<EOS>
You
may
do
so
with
some
reason
,
or
you
may
do
so
with
no

he
can
not
be
convicted

your
suspicion

<EOS>
"

n't
I
said

I
appeal
to
the
T'other
Governor

first
minute

my
mouth

here
world

without

end

chair

<EOS>
(
he
evidently
used
that
form
of
words
as
next
in
force
to
an
affidavit
)
,
"
that
I
was
willing
to
swear

said

so

<EOS>
You
wo
n't
deny
it

Lawyer
Lightwood

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
not
;
but
you
only
offer
to
swear
to
your
suspicion
,

I
tell
you
it
is
not
enough
to
swear
to
your
suspicion

"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
enough

ai
n't
it
,
Lawyer
Lightwood

he
cautiously
demanded

<EOS>
"
Positively
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
did
I
say
it
was
enough

<EOS>
Now
,
I
appeal
to
the
T'other
Governor

<EOS>
Now
,
fair
!
<EOS>
Did
I
say
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
certainly
has
not
said
that
he
had
no
more
to
tell
,
"
Eugene
observed
in
a
low
voice
without
looking
at
him
,
"
whatever
he
seemed
to
imply
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hah
!
"
cried
the
informer
,
triumphantly
perceiving
that
the
remark
was
generally
in
his
favor
,
though
apparently
not
closely
understanding
it
.
"
<EOS>
Fort'nate
for
me
<EOS>
I
had
a
witness

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
on

said
Lightwood

<EOS>
"

out

<EOS>
No

thought

<EOS>

down

the

eagerly

anxiously
.

"
<EOS>
Let

be
took
down

for
by
George

the
Draggin

n't

the
fruits

the
sweat

his
brow

<EOS>
I
give
information

then
,
that

told
me
that

done
it

Is
that
enough

"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care

returned
Mortimer

<EOS>
"

up

<EOS>
Then
,
slowly
and
emphatically
beating
it
all
out
with
his
open
right
hand
on
the
palm
of
his
left
;
"
I
,
Roger
Riderhood

tell
you

Lawyer
Lightwood

that
the
man
Jesse
Hexam

commonly
called
upon
the
river

along

shore
Gaffer
,
told
me
that
he
done
the
deed

<EOS>
What
's
more
,
he
told
me
with
his
own
lips
that
he
done
the
deed
.
<EOS>
What
's
more
,
he
said
that
he
done
the
deed

<EOS>
And
I
'll
swear
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
he
tell
you
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Outside
,
"
replied
Riderhood
,
always
beating
it
out
,
with
his
head
determinedly
set
askew
,
and
his
eyes
watchfully
dividing
their
attention
between
his
two
auditors
,
"
outside
the
door
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowships
,
towards
a
quarter
arter
twelve
o'clock
at
midnight
---
but
I
will
not
in
my
conscience
undertake
to
swear
to
so
fine
a
matter
as
five
minutes

on
the
night
when
he
picked
up

body

turns
out

Jolly
Fellowships

night
at
midnight

I
'm

<EOS>

What
did

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

I
'll

it

<EOS>
"
Go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
found
him
a
waiting
to
speak
to

says
to
me

Rogue
Riderhood

"

called
by

not
for
any
meaning

meaning
it
has
none

because
of
its
being
similar

<EOS>
"
Never
mind
that

"
'
Scuse

`

Rogue

"
 
he
says
,
`

words
passed
betwixt
us
on
the
river
to
-
night

<EOS>
"
Which
they
had

his
daughter

he
says
,
`

to
chop
you
over

fingers

my
boat
's
stretcher
,

take
a
aim
at
your
brains
with
my
boathook

<EOS>
I
did
so
on
accounts
of
your
looking
too
hard
at
what
I
had
in
tow
,
as
if
you
was
suspicious
,

on
accounts
of
your
holding
on
to

gunwale
of
my
boat

<EOS>

I
says
to
him
,
`

I

it

says

me

dozen

I
think
he
said
in

score

of
that

not
positive

take
the

figure

for

the

he
says

`
`
when
your

men
is
up
,
be
it
their
lives

be
it
their
watches

is
ever
the

you
suspicions

I
says

`

I
had
;

what
's
more
,
I
have

"
He
falls
a
shaking
,

`

Of

<EOS>
"
I
says

`

play

He
falls
a

worse

`

There
was
foul
play
then

I
done
it
for

Do

Those
were
the
words

ever

used

"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
silence
,
broken
only
by
the
fall
of
the
ashes
in
the
grate
.
<EOS>
An
opportunity
which
the
informer
improved
by
smearing
himself
all
over
the
head
and
neck
and
face
with
his
drowned
cap
,
and
not
at
all
improving
his
own
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
more
?

asked
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
Of
him

d'ye
mean

"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'm
blest
if
I
understand
you

Governors
Both

said
the
informer
,
in
a
creeping
manner
:
propitiating
both
,
though
only
one
had
spoken
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
Ai
n't
that
enough
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ask
him
how
he
did
it
,
where
he
did
it
,
when
he
did
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Far
be
it
from
me
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
!
<EOS>
I
was
so
troubled
in
my
mind
,
that
I
would
n't
have
knowed
more
,
no
,
not
for
the
sum
as
I
expect
to
earn
from
you
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
,
twice
told
!
<EOS>
I
had
put
an
end
to
the
pardnership
.
<EOS>
I
had
cut
the
connexion
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
undo
what
was
done
;
and
when
he
begs
and
prays
,
`
`
Old
pardner
,
on
my
knees
,
do
n't
split
upon
me
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
only
makes
answer
`

Never
speak
another
word
to
Roger
Riderhood

nor
look
him
in
the
face
!

<EOS>
"
and
I
shuns
that
man

"
  
<EOS>
Having
given
these
words
a
swing
to
make
them
mount
the
higher
and
go
the
further
,
Rogue
Riderhood
poured
himself
out
another
glass
of
wine
unbidden
,
and
seemed
to
chew
it
,
as
,
with
the
half
-
emptied
glass
in
his
hand
,
he
stared
at
the
candles
.
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
glanced
at
Eugene
,
but
Eugene
sat
glowering
at
his
paper
,
and
would
give
him
no
responsive
glance
.
<EOS>
Mortimer
again
turned
to
the
informer
,
to
whom
he
said
:
  
"
You
have
been
troubled
in
your
mind
a
long
time
,
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
Giving
his
wine
a
final
chew
,
and
swallowing
it
,
the
informer
answered
in
a
single
word
:
  
"
Hages
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
all
that
stir
was
made
,
when
the
Government
reward
was
offered
,
when
the
police
were
on
the
alert
,
when
the
whole
country
rang
with
the
crime
!
"
said
Mortimer
,
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Riderhood
very
slowly
and
hoarsely
chimed
in
,
with
several
retrospective
nods
of
his
head
.
"
<EOS>
Warn't
<EOS>
I
troubled
in
my
mind
then
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
conjecture
ran
wild
,
when
the
most
extravagant
suspicions
were
afloat
,
when
half
a
dozen
innocent
people
might
have
been
laid
by
the
heels
any
hour
in
the
day
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mortimer
,
almost
warming
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Riderhood
chimed
in
,
as
before
.
"
<EOS>
Warn't
<EOS>
I
troubled
in
my
mind
through
it
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
had
n't
,
"
said
Eugene
,
drawing
a
lady
's
head
upon
his
writing
-
paper
,
and
touching
it
at
intervals
,
"
the
opportunity
then
of
earning
so
much
money
<EOS>
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
T'other
Governor
hits
the
nail
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
!
<EOS>
It
was
that
as
turned
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
many
times
and
again
struggled
to
relieve
myself
of
the
trouble
on
my
mind
,
but
I
could
n't
get
it
off
.
<EOS>
I
had
once
very
nigh
got
it
off
to
Miss
Abbey
Potterson
which
keeps
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowships
<EOS>
---
there
is
the
'
ouse
,
it
wo
n't
run
away
,
 
---
there
lives
the
lady
,
she
ai
n't
likely
to
be
struck
dead
afore
<EOS>
you
get
there
---
ask
her
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
I
could
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
out
comes
the
new
bill
with
your
own
lawful
name
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
printed
to
it
,
and
then
I
asks
the
question
of
my
own
intellects
,
<EOS>
Am
I
to
have
this
trouble
on
my
mind
for
ever
?
<EOS>
Am
I
never
to
throw
it
off
?
<EOS>
Am
I
always
to
think
more
of
Gaffer
than
of
my
own
self
?
<EOS>
If
he
's
got
a
daughter
,
ai
n't
I
got
a
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
echo
answered
---
?
"
Eugene
suggested
.
  
<EOS>
"
`
`
You
have
,
"
"
"
said
Mr.
Riderhood
,
in
a
firm
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Incidentally
mentioning
,
at
the
same
time
,
her
age
?
"
inquired
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
governor
.
<EOS>
Two
-
and
-
twenty
last
October
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
put
it
to
myself
,
`
`
<EOS>
Regarding
the
money
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
pot
of
money
.
"
<EOS>
"
For
it
is
a
pot
,
"
said
Mr.
Riderhood
,
with
candour
,
"
and
why
deny
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
!
"
<EOS>
from
Eugene
as
he
touched
his
drawing
.
  
<EOS>
"
`
`
It
is
a
pot
of
money
;
but
is
it
a
sin
for
a
labouring
man
that
moistens
every
crust
of
bread
he
earns
,
with
his
tears
---
or
if
not
with
them
,
with
the
colds
he
catches
in
his
head
---
is
it
a
sin
for
that
man
to
earn
it
?
<EOS>
Say
there
is
anything
again
carning
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
This
I
put
to
myself
strong
,
as
in
duty
bound
;
`
`
how
can
it
be
said
without
blaming
Lawyer
Lightwood
for
offering
it
to
be
earned
?
"
<EOS>
"
And
was
it
for
me
to
blame
Lawyer
Lightwood
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
not
,
Governor
,
"
Mr.
Riderhood
acquiesced
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
made
up
my
mind
to
get
my
trouble
off
my
mind
,
and
to
earn
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
what
was
held
out
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
what
's
more
,
"
 
he
added
,
suddenly
turning
bloodthirsty
,
"
I
mean
to
have
it
!
<EOS>
And
now
I
tell
you
,
once
and
away
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
that
Jesse
Hexam
,
commonly
called
Gaffer
,
his
hand
and
no
other
,
done
the
deed
,
on
his
own
confession
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
give
him
up
to
you
,
and
I
want
him
took
.
<EOS>
This
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
another
silence
,
broken
only
by
the
fall
of
the
ashes
in
the
grate
,
which
attracted
the
informer
's
attention
as
if
it
were
the
chinking
of
money
,
Mortimer
Lightwood
leaned
over
his
friend
,
and
said
in
a
whisper
:
  
"
I
suppose
I
must
go
with
this
fellow
to
our
imperturbable
friend
at
the
police
-
station
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
there
is
no
help
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
believe
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
him
to
be
a
thorough
rascal
.
<EOS>
But
he
may
tell
the
truth
,
for
his
own
purpose
,
and
for
this
occasion
only
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
does
n't
look
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
n't
,
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
But
neither
is
his
late
partner
,
whom
he
denounces
,
a
prepossessing
person
.
<EOS>
The
firm
are
cut
-
throat
Shepherds
both
,
in
appearance
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
ask
him
one
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
subject
of
this
conference
sat
leering
at
the
ashes
,
trying
with
all
his
might
to
overhear
what
was
said
,
but
feigning
abstraction
as
the
"
Governors
Both
"
glanced
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
mentioned
(
twice
,
I
think
)
<EOS>
a
daughter
of
this
Hexam
's
<EOS>
,
"
 
said
Eugene
,
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
imply
that
she
had
any
guilty
knowledge
of
the
crime
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
honest
man
,
after
considering
---
perhaps
considering
how
his
answer
might
affect
the
fruits
of
the
sweat
of
his
brow
---
replied
,
unreservedly
,
"
No
,
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
implicate
no
other
person
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
what
I
implicate
,
it
's
what
Gaffer
implicated
,
"
was
the
dogged
and
determined
answer
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
more
than
that
his
words
to
me
was
,
`
`
I
done
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
Those
was
his
words
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
this
out
,
Mortimer
,
"
whispered
Eugene
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
How
shall
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
walk
,
"
whispered
Lightwood
,
"
and
give
this
fellow
time
to
think
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
exchanged
the
question
and
answer
,
they
prepared
themselves
for
going
out
,
and
Mr.
Riderhood
rose
.
<EOS>
While
extinguishing
the
candles
,
Lightwood
,
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
took
up
the
glass
from
which
that
honest
gentleman
had
drunk
,
and
coolly
tossed
it
under
the
grate
,
where
it
fell
shivering
into
fragments
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
if
you
will
take
the
lead
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
"
Mr.
Wrayburn
and
I
will
follow
.
<EOS>
You
know
where
to
go
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
do
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Take
the
lead
,
then
.
"
  
The
waterside
character
pulled
his
drowned
cap
over
his
ears
with
both
hands
,
and
making
himself
more
round
-
shouldered
than
nature
had
made
him
,
by
the
sullen
and
persistent
slouch
with
which
he
went
,
went
down
the
stairs
,
round
by
the
Temple
Church
,
across
the
Temple
into
Whitefriars
,
and
so
on
by
the
waterside
streets
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
his
hang
-
dog
air
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
following
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
strikes
me
rather
as
a
hang
-
man
air
,
"
returned
Eugene
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
undeniable
intentions
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
said
little
else
as
they
followed
.
<EOS>
He
went
on
before
them
as
an
ugly
Fate
might
have
done
,
and
they
kept
him
in
view
,
and
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
lose
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
on
he
went
before
them
,
always
at
the
same
distance
,
and
the
same
rate
.
<EOS>
Aslant
against
the
hard
implacable
weather
and
the
rough
wind
,
he
was
no
more
to
be
driven
back
than
hurried
forward
,
but
held
on
like
an
advancing
Destiny
.
<EOS>
There
came
,
when
they
were
about
midway
on
their
journey
,
a
heavy
rush
of
hail
,
which
in
a
few
minutes
pelted
the
streets
clear
,
and
whitened
them
.
<EOS>
It
made
no
difference
to
him
.
<EOS>
A
man
's
life
being
to
be
taken
and
the
price
of
it
got
,
<EOS>
the
hailstones
to
arrest
the
purpose
must
lie
larger
and
deeper
than
those
.
<EOS>
He
crushed
through
them
,
leaving
marks
in
the
fastmelting
slush
that
were
mere
shapeless
holes
;
one
might
have
fancied
,
following
,
that
the
very
fashion
of
humanity
had
departed
from
his
feet
.
  
<EOS>
The
blast
went
by
,
and
the
moon
contended
with
the
fast
-
flying
clouds
,
and
the
wild
disorder
reigning
up
there
made
the
pitiful
little
tumults
in
the
streets
of
no
account
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
the
wind
swept
all
the
brawlers
into
places
of
shelter
,
as
it
had
swept
the
hail
still
lingering
in
heaps
wherever
there
was
refuge
for
it
;
but
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
streets
were
absorbed
by
the
sky
,
and
the
night
were
all
in
the
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
has
had
time
to
think
of
it
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
he
has
not
had
time
to
think
better
of
it
---
or
differently
of
it
,
if
that
's
better
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
sign
of
drawing
back
in
him
;
and
as
I
recollect
this
place
,
we
must
be
close
upon
the
corner
where
we
alighted
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
a
few
abrupt
turns
brought
them
to
the
river
side
,
where
they
had
slipped
about
among
the
stones
,
and
where
they
now
slipped
more
;
the
wind
coming
against
them
in
slants
and
flaws
,
across
the
tide
and
the
windings
of
the
river
,
in
a
furious
way
.
<EOS>
With
that
habit
of
getting
under
the
lee
of
any
shelter
which
waterside
characters
acquire
,
the
waterside
character
at
present
in
question
led
the
way
to
the
leeside
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
Porters
before
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
round
here
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
at
them
red
curtains
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
Fellowships
,
the
'
ouse
as
I
told
you
would
n't
run
away
.
<EOS>
And
has
it
run
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
showing
himself
much
impressed
by
this
remarkable
confirmation
of
the
informer
's
evidence
,
Lightwood
inquired
what
other
business
they
had
there
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
wished
you
to
see
the
Fellowships
for
yourself
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
that
you
might
judge
whether
I
'm
a
liar
;
and
now
I
'll
see
Gaffer
's
window
for
myself
,
that
we
may
know
whether
he
's
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
crept
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
come
back
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
murmured
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
and
go
through
with
it
,
"
murmured
Eugene
.
<EOS>
He
came
back
after
a
very
short
interval
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gaffer
's
out
,
and
his
boat
's
out
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
's
at
home
,
sitting
a
-
looking
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
some
supper
getting
ready
,
<EOS>
so
Gaffer
's
expected
.
<EOS>
I
can
find
what
move
<EOS>
he
's
upon
,
easy
enough
,
presently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
beckoned
and
led
the
way
again
,
and
they
came
to
the
police
-
station
,
still
as
clean
and
cool
and
steady
as
before
,
saving
that
the
flame
of
its
lamp
---
being
but
a
lamp
-
flame
,
and
only
attached
to
the
Force
as
an
outsider
---
flickered
in
the
wind
.
  
<EOS>
Also
,
within
doors
,
Mr.
Inspector
was
at
his
studies
as
of
yore
.
<EOS>
He
recognized
the
friends
the
instant
they
reappeared
,
but
their
reappearnce
had
no
effect
on
his
composure
.
<EOS>
Not
even
the
circumstance
that
Riderhood
was
their
conductor
moved
him
,
otherwise
than
that
as
he
took
a
dip
of
ink
he
seemed
,
by
a
settlement
of
his
chin
in
his
stock
,
to
propound
to
that
personage
,
without
looking
at
him
,
the
question
,
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
been
up
to
,
last
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
Lightwood
asked
him
,
would
he
be
so
good
as
look
at
those
notes
?
<EOS>
Handing
him
Eugene
's
.
  
<EOS>
Having
read
the
first
few
lines
,
Mr.
Inspector
mounted
to
that
(
for
him
)
extraordinary
pitch
of
emotion
that
he
said
,
"
Does
either
of
you
two
gentlemen
happen
to
have
a
pinch
of
snuff
about
him
?
"
<EOS>
Finding
that
neither
had
,
he
did
quite
as
well
without
it
,
and
read
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
these
read
?
"
<EOS>
he
then
demanded
of
the
honest
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
had
better
hear
them
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
read
them
aloud
,
in
an
official
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
these
notes
correct
,
now
,
as
to
the
information
you
bring
here
and
the
evidence
you
mean
to
give
?
"
he
asked
,
when
he
had
finished
reading
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
.
<EOS>
They
are
as
correct
,
"
returned
Mr.

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
this
man
myself
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
to
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
Then
to
Riderhood
,
"
Is
he
at
home
?
<EOS>
Where
is
he
?
<EOS>
What
's
he
doing
?
<EOS>
You
have
made
it
your
business
to
know
all
about
him
,
no
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
said
what
he
did
know
,
and
promised
to
find
out
in
a
few
minutes
what
he
did
n't
know
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
;
"
not
till
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
We
must
n't
look
like
business
.
<EOS>
Would
you
two
gentlemen
object
to
making
a
pretence
of
taking
a
glass
of
something
in
my
company
at
the
Fellowships
?
<EOS>
Well
-
conducted
house
,
and
highly
respectable
landlady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
replied
that
they
would
be
happy
to
substitute
a
reality
for
the
pretence
,
which
,
in
the
main
,
appeared
to
be
as
one
with
Mr.
Inspector
's
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
he
,
taking
his
hat
from
its
peg
,
and
putting
a
pair
of
handcuffs
in
his
pocket
as
if
they
were
his
gloves
.
<EOS>
"
Reserve
!
"
<EOS>
Reserve
saluted
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
where
to
find
me
?
"
<EOS>
Reserve
again
saluted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Riderhood
,
when
you
have
found
out
concerning
his
coming
home
,
come
round
to
the
window
of
Cosy
,
tap
twice
at
it
,
and
wait
for
me
.
<EOS>
Now
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
three
went
out
together
,
and
Riderhood
slouched
off
from
under
the
trembling
lamp
his
separate
way
,
Lightwood
asked
the
officer
what
he
thought
of
this
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
replied
,
with
due
generality
and
reticence
,
that
it
was
always
more
likely
that
a
man
had
done
a
bad
thing
than
that
he
had
n't
.
<EOS>
That
he
himself
had
several
times
"
reckoned
up
"
Gaffer
,
but
had
never
been
able
to
bring
him
to
a
satisfactory
criminal
total
.
<EOS>
That
if
this
story
was
true
,
it
was
only
in
part
true
.
<EOS>
That
the
two
men
,
very
shy
characters
,
would
have
been
jointly
and
pretty
equally
"
in
it
;
"
but
that
this
man
had
"
spotted
"
the
other
,
to
save
himself
and
get
the
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
think
,
"
added
Mr.
Inspector
,
in
conclusion
,
"
that
if
all
goes
well
with
him
,
he
's
in
a
tolerable
way
of
getting
it
.
<EOS>
But
as
this
is
the
Fellowships
,
gentlemen
,
where
the
lights
are
,
I
recommend
dropping
the
subject
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
do
better
than
be
interested
in
some
lime
works
anywhere
down
about
Northfleet
,
and
doubtful
whether
some
of
your
lime
do
n't
get
into
bad
company
as
it
comes
up
in
barges
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
hear
Eugene
?
"
said
Lightwood
,
over
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
deeply
interested
in
lime
.
"
  
"
Without
lime
,
"
returned
that
unmoved
barrister
-
at
-
law
,
"
my
existence
would
be
unilluminated
by
a
ray
of
hope
.

<EOS>
TRACKING
THE
BIRD
OF
PREY
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
lime
merchants
,
with
their
escort
,
entered
the
dominions
of
Miss
Abbey
Potterson
,
to
whom
their
escort
(
presenting
them
and
their
pretended
business
over
the
half
-
door
of
the
bar
,
in
a
confidential
way
)
preferred
his
figurative
request
that
"
a
mouthful
of
fire
"
might
be
lighted
in
Cosy
.
<EOS>
Always
well
disposed
to
assist
the
constituted
authorities
,
Miss
Abbey
bade
Bob
Gliddery
attend
the
gentlemen
to
that
retreat
,
and
promptly
enliven
it
with
fire
and
gaslight
.
<EOS>
Of
this
commission
the
bare
-
armed
Bob
,
leading
the
way
with
a
flaming
wisp
of
paper
,
so
speedily
acquitted
himself
,
that
Cosy
seemed
to
leap
out
of
a
dark
sleep
and
embrace
them
warmly
,
the
moment
they
passed
the
lintels
of
its
hospitable
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
burn
sherry
very
well
here
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
as
a
piece
of
local
intelligence
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
gentlemen
might
like
a
bottle
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
answer
being
By
all
means
<EOS>
,
Bob
Gliddery
received
his
instructions
from
Mr.
Inspector
,
and
departed
in
a
becoming
state
of
alacrity
engendered
by
reverence
for
the
majesty
of
the
law
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
certain
fact
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
"
that
this
man
we
have
received
our
information
from
,
"
indicating
Riderhood
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
,
"
has
for
some
time
past
given
the
other
man
a
bad
name
arising
out
of
your
lime
barges
,
and
that
the
other
man
has
been
avoided
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
what
it
means
or
proves
,
but
it
's
a
certain
fact
.
<EOS>
I
had
it
first
from
one
of
the
opposite
sex
of
my
acquaintance
,
"
vaguely
indicating
Miss
Abbey
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
,
"
down
away
at
a
distance
,
over
yonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
probably
Mr.
Inspector
was
not
quite
unprepared
for
their
visit
that
evening
?
<EOS>
Lightwood
hinted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
you
see
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
"
it
was
a
question
of
making
a
move
.
<EOS>
It
's
of
no
use
moving
if
you
do
n't
know
what
your
move
is
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
by
far
keep
still
.
<EOS>
In
the
matter
of
this
lime
,
I
certainly
had
an
idea
that
it
might
lie
betwixt
the
two
men
;
I
always
had
that
idea
.
<EOS>
Still
I
was
forced
to
wait
for
a
start
,
and
I
was
n't
so
lucky
as
to
get
a
start
.
<EOS>
This
man
that
we
have
received
our
information
from
,
has
got
a
start
,
and
if
he
do
n't
meet
with
a
check
he
may
make
the
running
and
come
in
first
.
<EOS>
There
may
turn
out
to
be
something
considerable
for
him
that
comes
in
second
,
and
I
do
n't
mention
who
may
or
who
may
not
try
for
that
place
.
<EOS>
There
's
duty
to
do
,
and
I
shall
do
it
,
under
any
circumstances
,
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
and
ability
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Speaking
as
a
shipper
of
lime
---
"
began
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
no
man
has
a
better
right
to
do
than
yourself
,
you
know
,
"
 
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
"
said
Eugene
;
"
my
father
having
been
a
shipper
of
lime
before
me
,
and
my
grandfather
before
him
---
in
fact
we
having
been
a
family
immersed
to
the
crowns
of
our
heads
in
lime
during
several
generations
<EOS>
---
I
beg
to
observe
that
if
this
missing
lime
could
be
got
hold
of
without
any
young
female
relative
of
any
distinguished
gentleman
engaged
in
the
lime
trade
(
which
I
cherish
next
to
my
life
)
being
present
,
I
think
it
might
be
a
more
agreeable
proceeding
to
the
assisting
bystanders
,
that
is
to
say
,
lime
-
burners
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
also
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
pushing
his
friend
aside
with
a
laugh
,
"
should
much
prefer
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
done
,
gentlemen
,
if
it
can
be
done
conveniently
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
with
coolness
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
wish
on
my
part
to
cause
any
distress
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
am
sorry
for
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
boy
in
that
quarter
,
"
remarked
Eugene
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
still
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
quitted
those
works
.
<EOS>
He
is
otherwise
disposed
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
she
be
left
alone
then
?
"
asked
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
will
be
left
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
"
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bob
's
reappearance
with
a
steaming
jug
broke
off
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
But
although
the
jug
steamed
forth
a
delicious
perfume
,
its
contents
had
not
received
that
last
happy
touch
which
the
surpassing
finish
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
Porters
imparted
on
such
momentous
occasions
.
<EOS>
Bob
carried
in
his
left
hand
one
of
those
iron
models
of
sugar
-
loaf
hats
,
before
mentioned
,
into
which
he
emptied
the
jug
,
and
the
pointed
end
of
which
he
thrust
deep
down
into
the
fire
,
so
leaving
it
for
a
few
moments
while
he
disappeared
and
reappeared
with
three
bright
drinking
-
glasses
.
<EOS>
Placing
these
on
the
table
and
bending
over
the
fire
,
meritoriously
sensible
of
the
trying
nature
of
his
duty
,
he
watched
the
wreaths
of
steam
,
until
at
the
special
instant
of
projection
he
caught
up
the
iron
vessel
and
gave
it
one
delicate
twirl
,
causing
it
to
send
forth
one
gentle
hiss
.
<EOS>
Then
he
restored
the
contents
to
the
jug
;
held
over
the
steam
of
the
jug
,
each
of
the
three
bright
glasses
in
succession
;
finally
filled
them
all
,
and
with
a
clear
conscience
awaited
the
applause
of
his
fellow
-
creatures
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
bestowed
(
Mr.
Inspector
having
proposed
as
an
appropriate
sentiment
"
The
lime
trade
!
"
)
and
Bob
withdrew
to
report
the
commendations
of
the
guests
to
Miss
Abbey
in
the
bar
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
here
in
confidence
<EOS>
admitted
that
,
the
room
being
close
shut
in
his
absence
,
there
had
not
appeared
to
be
the
slightest
reason
for
the
elaborate
maintenance
of
this
same
lime
fiction
.
<EOS>
Only
it
had
been
regarded
by
Mr.
Inspector
as
so
uncommonly
satisfactory
,
and
so
fraught
with
mysterious
virtues
,
that
neither
of
his
clients
had
presumed
to
question
it
.
  
<EOS>
Two
taps
were
now
heard
on
the
outside
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
,
hastily
fortifying
himself
with
another
glass
,
strolled
out
with
a
noiseless
foot
and
an
unoccupied
countenance
.
<EOS>
As
one
might
go
to
survey
the
weather
and
the
general
aspect
of
the
heavenly
bodies
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
becoming
grim
,
Mortimer
,
"
said
Eugene
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
,
"
said
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Being
here
,
let
us
stay
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
see
it
out
,
and
I
wo
n't
leave
you
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
that
lonely
girl
with
the
dark
hair
runs
in
my
head
.
<EOS>
It
was
little
more
than
a
glimpse
we
had
of
her
that
last
time
,
and
yet
I
almost
see
her
waiting
by
the
fire
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Do
you
feel
like
a
dark
combination
of
traitor
and
pickpocket
when
you
think
of
that
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rather
,
"
returned
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
much
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Their
escort
strolled
back
again
,
and
reported
.
<EOS>
Divested
of
its
various
lime
-
lights
and
shadows
,
his
report
went
to
the
effect
that
Gaffer
was
away
in
his
boat
,
supposed
to
be
on
his
old
look
-
out
;
that
he
had
been
expected
last
high
-
water
;
that
having
missed
it
for
some
reason
or
other
,
he
was
not
,
according
to
his
usual
habits
at
night
,
to
be
counted
on
before
next
high
-
water
,
or
it
might
be
an
hour
or
so
later
;
that
his
daughter
,
surveyed
through
the
window
,
would
seem
to
be
so
expecting
him
,
for
the
supper
was
not
cooking
,
but
set
out
ready
to
be
cooked
;
that
it
would
be
highwater
at
about
one
,
and
that
it
was
now
barely
ten
;
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
watch
and
wait
;
that
the
informer
was
keeping
watch
at
the
instant
of
that
present
reporting
,
but
that
two
heads
were
better
than
one
<EOS>
(
especially
when
the
second
was
Mr.
Inspector
's
)
;
and
that
the
reporter
meant
to
share
the
watch
.
<EOS>
And
forasmuch
as
crouching
under
the
lee
of
a
hauled
-
up
boat
on
a
night
when
it
blew
cold
and
strong
,
and
when
the
weather
was
varied
with
blasts
of
hail
at
times
,
might
be
wearisome
to
amateurs
,
the
reporter
closed
with
the
recommendation
that
the
two
gentlemen
should
remain
,
for
a
while
at
any
rate
,
in
their
present
quarters
,
which
were
weather
-
tight
and
warm
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
inclined
to
dispute
this
recommendation
,
but
they
wanted
to
know
where
they
could
join
the
watchers
when
so
disposed
.
<EOS>
Rather
than
trust
to
a
verbal
description
of
the
place
,
which
might
mislead
,
Eugene
(
with
a
less
weighty
sense
of
personal
trouble
on
him
than
he
usually
had
)
would
go
out
with
Mr.
Inspector
,
note
the
spot
,
and
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
shelving
bank
of
the
river
,
among
the
slimy
stones
of
a
causeway
---
not
the
special
causeway
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowships
,
which
had
a
landing
-
place
of
its
own
,
but
another
,
a
little
removed
,
and
very
near
to
the
old
windmill
which
was
the
denounced
man
's
dwelling
-
place
---
were
a
few
boats
;
some
,
moored
and
already
beginning
to
float
;
others
,
hauled
up
above
the
reach
of
the
tide
.
<EOS>
Under
one
of
these
latter
,
Eugene
's
companion
disappeared
.
<EOS>
And
when
Eugene
had
observed
its
position
with
reference
to
the
other
boats
,
and
had
made
sure
that
he
could
not
miss
it
,
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
building
where
,
as
he
had
been
told
,
the
lonely
girl
with
the
dark
hair
sat
by
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
see
the
light
of
the
fire
shining
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
drew
him
on
to
look
in
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
come
out
with
the
express
intention
.
<EOS>
That
part
of
the
bank
having
rank
grass
growing
on
it
,
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
close
,
without
any
noise
of
footsteps
:
it
was
but
to
scramble
up
a
ragged
face
of
pretty
hard
mud
some
three
or
four
feet
high
and
come
upon
the
grass
and
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
the
window
by
that
means
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
no
other
light
than
the
light
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
The
unkindled
lamp
stood
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
She
sat
on
the
ground
,
looking
at
the
brazier
,
with
her
face
leaning
on
her
hand
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
kind
of
film
or
flicker
on
her
face
,
which
at
first
he
took
to
be
the
fitful
firelight
;
 
but
,
on
a
second
look
,
he
saw
that
she
was
weeping
.
<EOS>
A
sad
and
solitary
spectacle
,
as
shown
him
by
the
rising
and
the
falling
of
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
window
of
but
four
pieces
of
glass
,
and
was
not
curtained
;
he
chose
it
because
the
larger
window
near
it
was
.
<EOS>
It
showed
him
the
room
,
and
the
bills
upon
the
wall
respecting
the
drowned
people
starting
out
and
receding
by
turns
.
<EOS>
But
he
glanced
slightly
at
them
,
though
he
looked
long
and
steadily
at
her
.
<EOS>
A
deep
rich
piece
of
color
,
with
the
brown
flush
of
her
cheek
and
the
shining
lustre
of
her
hair
,
though
sad
and
solitary
,
weeping
by
the
rising
and
the
falling
of
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
She
started
up
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
so
very
still
,
that
he
felt
sure
it
was
not
he
who
had
disturbed
her
,
so
merely
withdrew
from
the
window
and
stood
near
it
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
She
opened
the
door
,
and
said
in
an
alarmed
tone
,
"
Father
,
was
that
you
calling
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
And
again
,
"
Father
!
"
<EOS>
And
once
again
,
after
listening
,
"
Father
!
<EOS>
I
thought
I
heard
you
call
me
twice
before
!
"
  
<EOS>
No
response
.
<EOS>
As
she
re
-
entered
at
the
door
,
he
dropped
over
the
bank
and
made
his
way
back
,
among
the
ooze
and
near
the
hidingplace
,
to
Mortimer
Lightwood
:
to
whom
he
told
what
he
had
seen
of
the
girl
,
and
how
this
was
becoming
very
grim
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
the
real
man
feels
as
guilty
as
I
do
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
he
is
remarkably
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Influence
of
secresy
,
"
suggested
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
obliged
to
it
for
making
me
Guy
Fawkes
in
the
vault
and
a
Sneak
in
the
area
both
at
once
,
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
Give
me
some
more
of
that
stuff
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
helped
him
to
some
more
of
that
stuff
,
but
it
had
been
cooling
,
and
did
n't
answer
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pooh
,
"
said
Eugene
,
spitting
it
out
among
the
ashes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tastes
like
the
wash
of
the
river
.
"
  
"
Are
you
so
familiar
with
the
flavor
of
the
wash
of
the
river
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
seem
to
be
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
had
been
half
drowned
,
and
swallowing
a
gallon
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Influence
of
locality
,
"
suggested
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
mighty
learned
to
-
night
,
you
and
your
influences
,
"
 
returned
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
How
long
shall
we
stay
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
choose
,
I
should
say
a
minute
,
"
replied
Eugene
,
"
for
the
Jolly
Fellowship
Porters
are
not
the
jolliest
dogs
I
have
known
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
we
are
best
here
until
they
turn
us
out
with
the
other
suspicious
characters
,
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Thereupon
he
stirred
the
fire
,
and
sat
down
on
one
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
struck
eleven
,
and
he
made
believe
to
compose
himself
patiently
.
<EOS>
But
gradually
he
took
the
fidgets
in
one
leg
,
and
then
in
the
other
leg
,
and
then
in
one
arm
,
and
then
in
the
other
arm
,
and
then
in
his
chin
,
and
then
in
his
back
,
and
then
in
his
forehead
,
and
then
in
his
hair
,
and
then
in
his
nose
;
and
then
he
stretched
himself
recumbent
on
two
chairs
,
and
groaned
;
and
then
he
started
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Invisible
insects
of
diabolical
activity
swarm
in
this
place
.
<EOS>
I
am
tickled
and
twitched
all
over
.
<EOS>
Mentally
,
I
have
now
committed
a
burglary
under
the
meanest
circumstances
,
and
the
myrmidons
of
justice
are
at
my
heels
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
as
bad
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
sitting
up
facing
him
,
with
a
tumbled
head
,
after
going
through
some
wonderful
evolutions
,
in
which
his
head
had
been
the
lowest
part
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
This
restlessness
began
,
with
me
,
long
ago
.
<EOS>
All
the
time
you
were
out
,
I
felt
like
Gulliver
with
the
Lilliputians
firing
upon
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
do
,
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
We
must
get
into
the
air
;
we
must
join
our
dear
friend
and
brother
,
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
And
let
us
tranquillize
ourselves
by
making
a
compact
.
<EOS>
Next
time
(
with
a
view
to
our
peace
of
mind
)
we
'll
commit
the
crime
,
instead
of
taking
the
criminal
.
<EOS>
You
swear
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sworn
!
<EOS>
Let
Tippins
look
to
it
.
<EOS>
Her
life
's
in
danger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
rang
the
bell
to
pay
the
score
,
and
Bob
appeared
to
transact
that
business
with
him
:
whom
Eugene
,
in
his
careless
extravagance
,
asked
if
he
would
like
a
situation
in
the
lime
-
trade
?
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
sir
,
no
sir
,
"
said
Bob
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
a
good
sitiwation
here
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
change
your
mind
at
any
time
,
"
returned
Eugene
,
"
come
to
me
at
my
works
,
and
you
'll
always
find
an
opening
in
the
lime
,
kiln
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
sir
,
"
said
Bob
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
partner
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
who
keeps
the
books
and
attends
to
the
wages
.
<EOS>
A
fair
day
's
wages
for
a
fair
day
's
work
is
ever
my
partner
's
motto
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
a
very
good
'
un
it
is
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Bob
,
receiving
his
fee
,
and
drawing
a
bow
out
of
his
head
with
his
right
hand
,
very
much
as
he
would
have
drawn
a
pint
of
beer
out
of
the
beer
engine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eugene
,
"
Mortimer
apostrophized
him
,
laughing
quite
heartily
when
they
were
alone
again
,
"
how
can
you
be
so
ridiculous
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
a
ridiculous
humour
,
"
quoth
Eugene
;
"
I
am
a
ridiculous
fellow
.
<EOS>
Everything
is
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
Come
along
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
passed
into
Mortimer
Lightwood
's
mind
that
a
change
of
some
sort
,
best
expressed
perhaps
as
an
intensification
of
all
that
was
wildest
and
most
negligent
and
reckless
in
his
friend
,
had
come
upon
him
in
the
last
half
-
hour
or
so
.
<EOS>
Thoroughly
used
to
him
as
he
was
,
he
found
something
new
and
strained
in
him
that
was
for
the
moment
perplexing
.
<EOS>
This
passed
into
his
mind
,
and
passed
out
again
;
but
he
remembered
it
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
where
she
sits
,
you
see
,
"
said
Eugene
,
when
they
were
standing
under
the
bank
,
roared
and
riven
at
by
the
wind
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
light
of
her
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
a
peep
through
the
window
,
"
said
Mortimer
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
Eugene
caught
him
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Best
not
make
a
show
of
her
.
<EOS>
Come
to
our
honest
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
led
him
to
the
post
of
watch
,
and
they
both
dropped
down
and
crept
under
the
lee
of
the
boat
;
a
better
shelter
than
it
had
seemed
before
,
being
directly
contrasted
with
the
blowing
wind
and
the
bare
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Inspector
at
home
?
"
whispered
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
,
sir
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
our
friend
of
the
perspiring
brow
is
at
the
far
corner
there
?
<EOS>
Good
.
<EOS>
Anything
happened
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
daughter
has
been
out
,
thinking
she
heard
him
calling
,
unless
it
was
a
sign
to
him
to
keep
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
might
have
been
Rule
Britannia
,
"
muttered
Eugene
,
"
but
it
was
n't
.
<EOS>
Mortimer
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Here
!
"
<EOS>
(
On
the
other
side
of
Mr.
Inspector
.
)
  
"
Two
burglaries
now
,
and
a
forgery
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
indication
of
his
depressed
state
of
mind
,
Eugene
fell
silent
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
all
silent
for
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
As
it
got
to
be
flood
-
tide
,
and
the
water
came
nearer
to
them
,
noises
on
the
river
became
more
frequent
,
and
they
listened
more
.
<EOS>
To
the
turning
of
steam
-
paddles
to
the
clinking
of
iron
chain
,
to
the
creaking
of
blocks
,
to
the
measured
working
of
oars
,
to
the
occasional
violent
barking
of
some
passing
dog
on
shipboard
,
who
seemed
to
scent
them
lying
in
their
hidingplace
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
not
so
dark
but
that
,
besides
the
lights
at
bows
and
mastheads
gliding
to
and
fro
,
they
could
discern
some
shadowy
bulk
attached
;
and
now
and
then
a
ghostly
lighter
with
a
large
dark
sail
,
like
a
warning
arm
,
would
start
up
very
near
them
,
pass
on
,
and
vanish
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
of
their
watch
,
the
water
close
to
them
would
be
often
agitated
by
some
impulsion
given
it
from
a
distance
.
<EOS>
Often
they
believed
this
beat
and
plash
to
be
the
boat
they
lay
in
wait
for
,
running
in
ashore
;
and
again
and
again
they
would
have
started
up
,
but
for
the
immobility
with
which
the
informer
,
well
used
to
the
river
,
kept
quiet
in
his
place
.
  
<EOS>
The
wind
carried
away
the
striking
of
the
great
multitude
of
city
church
clocks
,
for
those
lay
to
leeward
of
them
;
but
there
were
bells
to
windward
that
told
them
of
its
being
One
---
Two
<EOS>
---
Three
.
<EOS>
Without
that
aid
they
would
have
known
how
the
night
wore
,
by
the
falling
of
the
tide
,
recorded
in
the
appearance
of
an
ever
-
widening
black
wet
strip
of
shore
,
and
the
emergence
of
the
paved
causeway
from
the
river
,
foot
by
foot
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
time
so
passed
,
this
slinking
business
became
a
more
and
more
precarious
one
.
<EOS>
It
would
seem
as
if
the
man
had
had
some
intimation
of
what
was
in
hand
against
him
,
or
had
taken
fright
?
<EOS>
His
movements
might
have
been
planned
to
gain
for
him
,
in
getting
beyond
their
reach
,
twelve
hours
'
advantage
?
<EOS>
The
honest
man
who
had
expended
the
sweat
of
his
brow
became
uneasy
,
and
began
to
complain
with
bitterness
of
the
proneness
of
mankind
to
cheat
him
 
---
him
invested
with
the
dignity
of
Labour
!
  
<EOS>
Their
retreat
was
so
chosen
that
while
they
could
watch
the
river
,
they
could
watch
the
house
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
passed
in
or
out
,
since
the
daughter
thought
she
heard
the
father
calling
.
<EOS>
No
one
could
pass
in
or
out
without
being
seen
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
will
be
light
at
five
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
"
and
then
we
shall
be
seen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
"
what
do
you
say
to
this
?
<EOS>
He
may
have
been
lurking
in
and
out
,
and
just
holding
his
own
betwixt
two
or
three
bridges
,
for
hours
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
make
of
that
?
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
Stoical
,
but
contradictory
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
may
be
doing
so
at
this
present
time
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
make
of
that
?
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
boat
's
among
them
boats
here
at
the
cause'ay
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
make
of
your
boat
?
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
put
off
in
her
and
take
a
look
round
?
<EOS>
I
know
his
ways
,
and
the
likely
nooks
he
favours
.
<EOS>
I
know
where
he
'd
be
at
such
a
time
of
the
tide
,
and
where
he
'd
be
at
such
another
time
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
I
been
his
pardner
?
<EOS>
None
of
you
need
show
.
<EOS>
None
of
you
need
stir
.
<EOS>
I
can
shove
her
off
without
help
;
and
as
to
me
being
seen
,
I
'm
about
at
all
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
given
a
worse
opinion
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
after
brief
consideration
.
<EOS>
"
Try
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
bit
.
<EOS>
Let
's
work
it
out
.
<EOS>
If
I
want
you
,
I
'll
drop
round
under
the
Fellowships
and
tip
you
a
whistle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
might
so
far
presume
as
to
offer
a
suggestion
to
my
honorable
and
gallant
friend
,
whose
knowledge
of
naval
matters
far
be
it
from
me
to
impeach
,
"
Eugene
struck
in
with
great
deliberation
,
"
it
would
be
,
that
to
tip
a
whistle
is
to
advertise
mystery
and
invite
speculation
.
<EOS>
My
honorable
and
gallant
friend
will
,
I
trust
,
excuse
me
,
as
an
independent
member
,
for
throwing
out
a
remark
which
I
feel
to
be
due
to
this
house
and
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
that
the
T'other
Governor
,
or
Lawyer
Lightwood
?
"
asked
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
For
,
they
spoke
as
they
crouched
or
lay
,
without
seeing
one
another
's
faces
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
reply
to
the
question
put
by
my
honorable
and
gallant
friend
,
"
 
said
Eugene
,
who
was
lying
on
his
back
with
his
hat
on
his
face
,
as
an
attitude
highly
expressive
of
watchfulness
,
"
I
can
have
no
hesitation
in
replying
<EOS>
(
it
not
being
inconsistent
with
the
public
service
)
<EOS>
that
those
accents
were
the
accents
of
the
T'other
Governor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
tolerable
good
eyes
,
ai
n't
you
,
Governor
?
<EOS>
You
've
all
tolerable
good
eyes
,
ai
n't
you
?
"
demanded
the
informer
.
  
<EOS>
All
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
if
I
row
up
under
the
Fellowships
and
lay
there
,
no
need
to
whistle
.
<EOS>
You
'll
make
out
that
there
's
a
speck
of
something
or
another
there
,
and
you
'll
know
it
's
me
,
and
you
'll
come
down
that
cause'ay
to
me
.
<EOS>
Understood
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
Understood
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
Off
she
goes
then
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
moment
,
with
the
wind
cutting
keenly
at
him
sideways
,
he
was
staggering
down
to
his
boat
;
in
a
few
moments
he
was
clear
,
and
creeping
up
the
river
under
their
own
shore
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
had
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
to
look
into
the
darkness
after
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
the
boat
of
my
honorable
and
gallant
friend
,
"
he
murmured
,
lying
down
again
and
speaking
into
his
hat
,
"
may
be
endowed
with
philanthropy
enough
to
turn
bottom
-
upward
and
extinguish
him
!

Mortimer

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
honorable
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Three
burglaries
,
two
forgeries
,
and
a
midnight
assassination
.
"
  
<EOS>
Yet
in
spite
of
having
those
weights
on
his
conscience
,
Eugene
was
somewhat
enlivened
by
the
late
slight
change
in
the
circumstances
of
affairs
.
<EOS>
So
were
his
two
companions
.
<EOS>
Its
being
a
change
was
everything
.
<EOS>
The
suspense
seemed
to
have
taken
a
new
lease
,
and
to
have
begun
afresh
from
a
recent
date
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
additional
to
look
for
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
three
more
sharply
on
the
alert
,
and
less
deadened
by
the
miserable
influences
of
the
place
and
time
.
  
<EOS>
More
than
an
hour
had
passed
,
and
they
were
even
dozing
,
when
one
of
the
three
---
each
said
it
was
he
,
and
he
had
not
dozed
---
made
out
Riderhood
in
his
boat
at
the
spot
agreed
on
.
<EOS>
They
sprang
up
,
came
out
from
their
shelter
,
and
went
down
to
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
saw
them
coming
,
he
dropped
alongside
the
causeway
;
so
that
they
,
standing
on
the
causeway
,
could
speak
with
him
in
whispers
,
under
the
shadowy
mass
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
Porters
fast
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
Blest
if
I
can
make
it
out
!
"
said
he
,
staring
at
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Make
what
out
?
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
seen
?
"
asked
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
For
,
he
was
staring
at
them
in
the
strangest
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
seen
his
boat
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
empty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
empty
.
<EOS>
And
what
's
more
,
---
adrift
.
<EOS>
And
what
's
more
,
---
  
with
one
scull
gone
.
<EOS>
And
what
's
more
,
---
with
t'other
scull
jammed
in
the
thowels
and
broke
short
off
.
<EOS>
And
what
's
more
,
---
the
boat
's
drove
tight
by
the
tide
'
<EOS>
atwixt
two
tiers
of
barges
.
<EOS>
And
what
's
more
,
---
he
's
in
luck
again
,
by
George
if
he

"
   
<EOS>
THE
BIRD
OF
PREY
BROUGHT
DOWN
.
 
<EOS>
Cold
on
the
shore
,
in
the
raw
cold
of
that
leaden
crisis
in
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
when
the
vital
force
of
all
the
noblest
and
prettiest
things
that
live
is
at
its
lowest
,
the
three
watchers
looked
each
at
the
blank
faces
of
the
other
two
,
and
all
at
the
blank
face
of
Riderhood
in
his
boat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gaffer
's
boat
,
Gaffer
in
luck
again
,
and
yet
no
Gaffer
!
"
<EOS>
So
spake
Riderhood
,
staring
disconsolate
.
  
<EOS>
As
if
with
one
accord
,
they
all
turned
their
eyes
towards
the
light
of
the
fire
shining
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
was
fainter
and
duller
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
fire
,
like
the
higher
animal
and
vegetable
life
it
helps
to
sustain
,
has
its
greatest
tendency
towards
death
,
when
the
night
is
dying
and
the
day
is
not
yet
born
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
me
that
had
the
law
of
this
here
job
in
hand
,
"
growled
Riderhood
with
a
threatening
shake
of
his
head
,
"
blest
if
I
would
n't
lay
hold
of
her
,
at
any
rate
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
it
is
not
you
,
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
With
something
so
suddenly
denly
fierce
in
him
tht
the
informer
returned
submissively
;
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
well
,
'
tother
governor
,
I
did
n't
say
it
was
.
<EOS>
A
man
may
speak
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
vermin
may
be
silent
,
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
water
-
rat
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Astonished
by
his
friend
's
unusual
heat
,
Lightwood
stared
too
,
and
then
said
:
"
What
can
have
become
of
this
man
?
"
  
"
Ca
n't
imagine
.
<EOS>
Unless
he
dived
overboard
.
<EOS>
"
The
informer
wiped
his
brow
ruefully
as
he
said
it
,
sitting
in
his
boat
and
always
staring
disconsolate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
make
his
boat
fast
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
fast
enough
till
the
tide
runs
back
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
make
her
faster
than
she
is
.
<EOS>
Come
aboard
of
mine
,
and
see
for
your
ownselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
backwardness
in
complying
,
for
the
freight
looked
too
much
for
the
boat
;
but
on
Riderhood
's
protesting
"
that
he
had
had
half
a
dozen
,
dead
and
alive
,
in
her
afore
now
,
and
she
was
nothing
deep
in
the
water
nor
down
in
the
stern
even
then
,
to
speak
of
,
"
they
carefully
took
their
places
,
and
trimmed
the
crazy
thing
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
doing
so
,
Riderhood
still
sat
staring
disconsolate
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
.
<EOS>
Give
way
!
"
said
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
way
,
by
George
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Riderhood
,
before
shoving
off
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
's
gone
and
made
off
any
how
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
it
's
enough
to
make
me
give
way
in
a
different
manner
.
<EOS>
But
he
always
was
a
cheat
,
con
-
found
him
!
<EOS>
He
always
was
a
infernal
cheat
,
was
Gaffer
.
<EOS>
Nothing
straightfor'ard
,
nothing
on
the
square
.
<EOS>
So
mean
,
so
underhanded
.
<EOS>
Never
going
through
with
a
thing
,
nor
carrying
it
out
like
a
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hallo
!
<EOS>
Steady
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Eugene
(
he
had
recovered
immediately
on
embarking
)
,
as
they
bumped
heavily
against
a
pile
;
and
then
in
a
lower
voice
reversed
his
late
apostrophe
by
remarking
(
"
I
wish
the
boat
of
my
honorable
and
gallant
friend
may
be
endowed
with
philanthropy
enough
not
to
turn
bottom
-
upward
and
extinguish
us
!
)
<EOS>
Steady
,
steady
!
<EOS>
Sit
close
,
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
Here
's
the
hail
again
.
<EOS>
See
how
it
flies
,
like
a
troop
of
wild
cats
,
at
Mr.
Riderhood
's
eyes
!
"
  
<EOS>
Indeed
he
had
the
full
benefit
of
it
,
and
it
so
mauled
him
,
though
he
bent
his
head
low
and
tried
to
present
nothing
but
the
mangy
cap
to
it
,
that
he
dropped
under
the
lee
of
a
tier
of
shipping
,
and
they
lay
there
until
it
was
over
.
<EOS>
The
squall
had
come
up
,
like
a
spiteful
messenger
before
the
morning
;
there
followed
in
its
wake
a
ragged
tear
of
light
which
ripped
the
dark
clouds
until
they
showed
a
great
grey
hole
of
day
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
all
shivering
,
and
everything
about
them
seemed
to
be
shivering
;
the
river
itself
,
craft
,
rigging
,
sails
,
such
early
smoke
as
there
yet
was
on
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Black
with
wet
,
and
altered
to
the
eye
by
white
patches
of
hail
and
sleet
,
the
huddled
buildings
looked
lower
than
usual
,
as
if
they
were
cowering
,
and
had
shrunk
with
the
cold
.
<EOS>
Very
little
life
was
to
be
seen
on
either
bank
,
windows
and
doors
were
shut
,
and
the
staring
black
and
white
letters
upon
wharves
and
warehouses
"
looked
,
"
said
Eugene
to
Mortimer
,
"
like
inscriptions
over
the
graves
of
dead
businesses
.
<EOS>
"
  
As
they
glided
slowly
on
,
keeping
under
the
shore
and
sneaking
in
and
out
among
the
shipping
by
back
-
alleys
of
water
,
in
a
pilfering
way
that
seemed
to
be
their
boatman
's
normal
manner
of
progression
,
all
the
objects
among
which
they
crept
were
so
huge
in
contrast
with
their
wretched
boat
,
as
to
threaten
to
crush
it
.
<EOS>
Not
a
ship
's
hull
,
with
its
rusty
iron
links
of
calble
run
out
of
hawse
-
holes
long
discolored
with
the
iron
's
rusty
tears
,
but
seemed
to
be
there
with
a
fell
intention
.
<EOS>
Not
a
figure
-
head
but
had
the
menacing
look
of
bursting
forward
to
run
them
down
.
<EOS>
Not
a
sluice
gate
,
or
a
painted
scale
upon
a
post
or
wall
,
showing
the
depth
of
water
,
but
seemed
to
hint
,
like
the
dreadfully
facetious
Wolf
in
bed
in
Grandmamma
's
cottage
,
"
That
's
to
drown
you
in
,
my
dears
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
a
lumbering
black
barge
,
with
its
cracked
and
blistered
side
impending
over
them
,
but
seemed
to
suck
at
the
river
with
a
thirst
for
sucking
them
under
.
<EOS>
And
everything
so
vaunted
the
spoiling
influences
of
water
---
discolored
copper
,
rotten
wood
,
honey
-
combed
stone
,
green
dank
deposit
---
that
the
after
-
consequences
of
being
crushed
,
sucked
under
,
and
drawn
down
,
looked
as
ugly
to
the
imagination
as
the
main
event
.
  
<EOS>
Some
half
-
hour
of
this
work
,
and
Riderhood
unshipped
his
sculls
,
stood
holding
on
to
a
barge
,
and
hand
over
hand
long
-
wise
along
the
barge
's
side
gradually
worked
his
boat
under
her
head
into
a
secret
little
nook
of
scummy
water
.
<EOS>
And
driven
into
the
nook
,
and
wedged
as
he
had
described
,
was
Gaffer
's
boat
;
that
boat
with
the
stain
still
in
it
,
bearing
some
resemblance
to
a
muffled
human
form
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
tell
me
I
'm
a
liar
!
"
said
the
honest
man
.
  
<EOS>
(
"
With
a
morbid
expectation
,
"
murmured
Eugene
to
Lightwood
,
"
that
somebody
is
always
going
to
tell
him
the
truth
.
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
Hexam
's
boat
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
her
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
the
broken
scull
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
t'other
scull
gone
.
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
I
am
a
liar
!
"
said
the
honest
man
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
stepped
into
the
boat
.
<EOS>
Eugene
and
Mortimer
looked
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
see
now
!
"
<EOS>
added
Riderhood
,
creeping
aft
,
and
showing
a
stretched
rope
made
fast
there
and
towing
overboard
.
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
tell
you
he
was
in
luck
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Haul
in
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
  
<EOS>
"
Easy
to
say
haul
in
,
"
answered
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Not
so
easy
done
.
<EOS>
His
luck
's
got
fouled
under
the
keels
of
the
barges
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
haul
in
last
time
,
but
I
could
n't
.
<EOS>
See
how
taut
the
line
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
it
up
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
take
this
boat
ashore
,
and
his
luck
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
Try
easy
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
tried
easy
now
;
but
the
luck
resisted
;
would
n't
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
have
it
,
and
the
boat
too
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
playing
the
line
.
  
<EOS>
But
still
the
luck
resisted
;
would
n't
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
care
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
disfigure
.
<EOS>
Or
pull
asunder
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
do
either
,
not
even
to
your
Grandmother
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
;
"
but
I
mean
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
Come
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
at
once
persuasively
and
with
authority
to
the
hidden
object
in
the
water
,
as
he
played
the
line
again
;
"
it
's
no
good
<EOS>
this
sort
of
game
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
must
come
up
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
have
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
so
much
virtue
in
this
distinctly
and
decidedly
meaning
to
have
it
,
that
it
yielded
a
little
,
even
while
the
line
was
played
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
so
,
"
quoth
Mr.
Inspector
,
pulling
off
his
outer
coat
,
and
leaning
well
over
the
stern
with
a
will
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
an
awful
sort
of
fishing
,
but
<EOS>
it
no
more
disconcerted
Mr.
Inspector
than
if
he
had
been
fishing
in
a
punt
on
a
summer
evening
by
some
soothing
weir
<EOS>
high
up
the
peaceful
river
.
<EOS>
After
certain
minutes
,
and
a
few
directions
to
the
rest
to
"
ease
her
a
little
for'ard
,
"
 
and
"
now
ease
her
a
trifle
aft
,
"
and
the
like
,
he
said
composedly
,
"
All
clear
!
"
and
the
line
and
the
boat
came
free
together
.
  
<EOS>
Accepting

's
proffered
hand
to
help
him
up
,
he
then
put
on
his
coat
,
and
said
to
Riderhood
,
"
Hand
me
over
those
spare
sculls
of
yours
,
and
I
'll
pull
this
in
to
the
nearest
stairs
.
<EOS>
Go
ahead
you
,
and
keep
out
in
pretty
open
water
,
that
I
may
n't
get
fouled
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
directions
were
obeyed
,
and
they
pulled
ashore
directly
;
two
in
one
boat
,
two
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
again
to
Riderhood
,
when
they
were
all
on
the
slushy
stones
;
"
you
have
had
more
practice
in
this
than
I
have
had
,
and
ought
to
be
a
better
workman
at
it
.
<EOS>
Undo
the
towrope
,
and
we
'll
help
you
haul
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
got
into
the
boat
accordingly
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
as
if
he
had
scarcely
had
a
moment
's
time
to
touch
the
rope
or
look
over
the
stern
,
when
he
came
scrambling
back
,
as
pale
as
the
morning
,
and
gasped
out
:
  
"
By
the
Lord
,
he
's
done
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
they
all
demanded
.
  
<EOS>
He
pointed
behind
him
at
the
boat
,
and
gasped
to
that
degree
that
he
dropped
upon
the
stones
to
get
his
breath
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gaffer
's
done
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
Gaffer
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
ran
to
the
rope
,
leaving
him
gasping
there
.
<EOS>
Soon
,
the
form
of
the
bird
of
prey
,
dead
some
hours
,
lay
stretched
upon
the
shore
,
with
a
new
blast
storming
at
it
and
clotting
the
wet
hair
with
hailstones
.
  
<EOS>
Father
,
was
that
you
calling
me
?
<EOS>
Father
!
<EOS>
I
thought
I
heard
you
call
me
twice
before
!
<EOS>
Words
never
to
be
answered
,
those
,
upon
the
earth
-
side
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
The
wind
sweeps
jeeringly
over
Father
,
whips
him
with
the
frayed
ends
of
his
dress
and
his
jagged
hair
,
tries
to
turn
him
where
he
lies
stark
on
his
back
,
and
force
his
face
towards
the
rising
sun
,
that
he
may
be
shamed
the
more
.
<EOS>
A
lull
,
and
the
wind
is
secret
and
prying
with
him
;
lifts
and
lets
fass
a
rag
;
hides
palpitating
under
another
rag
;
runs
nimbly
through
his
hair
and
beard
.
<EOS>
Then
,
in
a
rush
,
it
cruelly
taunts
him
.
<EOS>
Father
,
was
that
you
calling
me
?
<EOS>
Was
it
you
,
the
voiceless
and
the
dead
?
<EOS>
Was
it
you
,
thus
buffeted
as
you
lie
here
in
a
heap
?
<EOS>
Was
it
you
,
thus
baptized
unto
Death
,
with
these
flying
impurities
now
flung
upon
your
face
?
<EOS>
Why
not
speak
,
Father
?
<EOS>
Soaking
into
this
filthy
ground
as
you
lie
here
,
is
your
own
shape
.
<EOS>
Did
you
never
see
such
a
shape
soaked
into
your
boat
?
<EOS>
Speak
,
Father
.
<EOS>
Speak
to
us
,
the
winds
,
the
only
listeners
left
you
!
  
<EOS>
"
Now
see
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
after
mature
deliberation
:
kneeling
on
one
knee
beside
the
body
,
when
they
had
stood
looking
down
on
the
drowned
man
,
as
he
had
many
a
time
looked
down
on
many
another
man
:
"
the
way
of
it
was
this
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
gentlemen
hardly
failed
to
observe
that
he
was
towing
by
the
neck
and
arms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
helped
to
release
the
rope
,
and
of
course
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
have
observed
before
,
and
you
will
observe
now
,
that
this
know
,
which
was
drawn
<EOS>
chock
-
tight
round
his
neck
by
the
strain
of
his
own
arms
,
is
a
slip
-
knot
:
"
holding
it
up
for
demonstration
.
  
<EOS>
Plain
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
Likewise
you
will
have
observed
how
he
had
run
the
other
end
of
this
rope
to
his
boat
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
had
the
curves
and
indentations
in
it
still
,
where
it
had
been
twined
and
bound
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
see
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
"
see
how
it
works
round
upon
him
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
wild
tempestuous
evening
when
this
man
that
was
,
"
 
stooping
to
wipe
some
hailstones
out
of
his
hair
with
an
end
of
his
own
drowned
jacket
,
"
---
there
!
<EOS>
Now
he
's
more
like
himself
,
though
he
's
badly
bruised
,
---
when
this
man
that
was
,
rows
out
upon
the
river
on
his
usual
lay
.
<EOS>
He
carries
with
him
this
coil
of
rope
.
<EOS>
He
always
carries
with
him
this
coil
of
rope
.
<EOS>
It
's
as
well
known
to
me
as
he
was
himself
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
it
lay
in
the
bottom
of
his
boat
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
hung
it
loose
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
light
-
dresser
was
this
man
;
---
you
see
?
"
<EOS>
lifting
the
loose
neckerchief
over
his
breast
,
and
taking
the
opportunity
of
wiping
the
dead
lips
with
it
---
  
<EOS>
and
when
it
was
wet
,
or
freezing
,
or
blew
cold
,
he
would
hang
this
coil
of
line
<EOS>
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
Last
evening
he
does
this
.
<EOS>
Worse
for
him
!
<EOS>
He
dodges
about
in
his
boat
,
does
this
man
,
till
he
gets
chilled
.
<EOS>
His
hands
,
"
taking
up
one
of
them
,
which
dropped
like
a
leaden
weight
,
"
get
numbed
.
<EOS>
He
sees
some
object
that
's
in
his
way
of
business
,
floating
.
<EOS>
He
makes
ready
to
secure
that
object
.
<EOS>
He
unwinds
the
end
of
his
coil
that
he
wants
to
take
some
turns
on
in
his
boat
,
and
he
takes
turns
enough
on
it
to
secure
that
it
sha
n't
run
out
.
<EOS>
He
makes
it
too
secure
,
as
it
happens
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
little
longer
about
this
than
usual
,
his
hands
being
numbed
.
<EOS>
His
object
drifts
up
,
before
he
is
quite
ready
for
it
.
<EOS>
He
catches
at
it
,
thinks
he
'll
make
sure
of
the
contents
of
the
pockets
anyhow
,
in
case
he
should
be
parted
from
it
,
bends
right
over
the
stern
,
and
in
one
of
these
heavy
squalls
,
or
in
the
cross
-
swell
of
two
steamers
,
or
in
not
being
quite
prepared
,
or
through
all
or
most
or
some
,
gets
a
lurch
,
overbalances
and
goes
head
-
foremost
overboard
.
<EOS>
Now
see
!
<EOS>
He
can
swim
,
can
this
man
,
and
instantly
he
strikes
out
.
<EOS>
But
in
such
striking
-
out
he
tangles
his
arms
,
pulls
strong
on
the
slip
-
knot
,
and
it
runs
home
.
<EOS>
The
object
he
had
expected
to
take
in
tow
,
floats
by
,
and
his
own
boat
tows
him
dead
,
to
where
we
found
him
,
all
entangled
in
his
own
line
.
<EOS>
You
'll
ask
me
how
I
make
out
about
the
pockets
?
<EOS>
First
,
I
'll
tell
you
more
;
there
was
silver
in
'em
.
<EOS>
How
do
I
make
that
out
?
<EOS>
Simple
and
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
Because
he
's
got
it
here
.
<EOS>
"
The
lecturer
held
up
the
tightly
clenched
right
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done
with
the
remains
?
"
asked
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
n't
object
to
standing
by
him
half
a
minute
,
sir
,
"
 
was
the
reply
,
"
I
'll
find
the
nearest
of
our
men
to
come
and
take
charge
of
him
;
---
I
still
call
it
him
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
looking
back
as
he
went
,
with
a
philosophical
smile
upon
the
force
of
habit
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eugene
,
"
said
Lightwood
---
and
was
about
to
add
<EOS>
"
we
may
wait
at
a
little
distance
,
"
when
turning
his
head
he
found
that
no
Eugene
was
there
.
  
<EOS>
He
raised
his
voice
and
called
"
Eugene
!
<EOS>
Holloa
!
"
<EOS>
But
no
Eugene
replied
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
broad
daylight
now
,
and
he
looked
about
.
<EOS>
But
no
Eugene
was
in
all
the
view
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
speedily
returning
down
the
wooden
stairs
,
with
a
police
constable
,
Lightwood
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
his
friend
leave
them
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
could
not
exactly
say
that
he
had
seen
him
go
,
but
had
noticed
that
he
was
restless
.
  
<EOS>
"
Singular
and
entertaining
combination
,
sir
,
your
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
it
had
not
been
a
part
of
his
singular
and
entertaining
combination
to
give
me
the
slip
under
these
dreary
circumstances
at
this
time
of
the
morning
,
"
said
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
Can
we
get
anything
hot
to
drink
?
"
  
<EOS>
We
could
,
and
we
did
.
<EOS>
In
a
public
-
house
kitchen
with
a
large
fire
.
<EOS>
We
got
hot
brandy
and
water
,
and
it
revived
us
wonderfully
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
having
to
Mr.
Riderhood
,
announced
his
official
intention
of
"
keeping
his
eye
upon
him
,
"
stood
him
in
a
corner
of
the
fireplace
,
like
a
wet
umbrella
,
and
took
no
further
outward
and
visible
notice
of
that
honest
man
,
except
ordering
a
separate
service
of
brandy
and
water
for
him
:
apparently
out
of
the
public
funds
.
  
<EOS>
As
Mortimer
Lightwod
sat
before
the
blazing
fire
,
conscious
of
drinking
brandy
and
water
then
and
there
in
his
sleep
,
and
yet
at
one
and
the
same
time
drinking
burnt
sherry
at
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowships
,
and
lying
under
the
boat
on
the
river
shore
,
and
sitting
in
the
boat
that
Riderhood
rowed
,
and
listening
to
the
lecture
recently
concluded
,
and
having
to
dine
in
the
Temple
with
an
unknown
man
,
who
described
himself
as
M.
R.
F.
Eugene
Gaffer
Harmon
,
and
said
he
lived
at
Hailstorm
,
---
as
he
passed
through
these
curious
vicissitudes
of
fatigue
and
slumber
,
arranged
upon
the
scale
of
a
dozen
hours
to
the
second
,
he
became
aware
of
answering
aloud
a
communication
of
pressing
importance
that
had
never
been
made
to
him
,
and
then
turned
it
into
a
cough
on
beholding
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
For
,
he
felt
,
with
some
natural
indignation
,
that
that
functionary
might
otherwise
suspect
him
of
having
closed
his
eyes
,
or
wandered
in
his
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
just
before
us
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
with
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
had
hot
brandy
and
water
too
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
"
and
then
cut
off
at
a
great
rate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
said
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
friend
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
"
he
replied
,
again
with
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
After
hearing
,
in
a
mist
through
which
Mr.
Inspector
loomed
vague
and
large
,
that
the
officer
took
upon
himself
to
prepare
the
dead
man
's
daughter
for
what
had
befallen
in
the
night
,
and
generally
that
he
took
everything
upon
himself
,
Mortimer
Lightwood
stumbled
in
his
sleep
to
a
cab
-
stand
,
called
a
cab
,
and
had
entered
the
army
and
committed
a
capital
military
offence
and
been
tried
by
court
martial
and
found
guilty
and
had
arranged
his
affairs
and
been
marched
out
to
be
shot
,
before
the
door
banged
.
  
<EOS>
Hard
work
rowing
the
cab
through
the
City
to
the
Temple
,
for
a
cup
of
from
five
to
ten
thousand
pounds
value
,
given
by
Mr.
Boffin
;
 
and
hard
work
holding
forth
at
that
immeasurable
length
to
Eugene
<EOS>
(
when
he
had
been
rescued
with
a
rope
from
the
running
pavement
)
for
making
off
in
that
extraordinary
manner
!
<EOS>
But
he
offered
such
ample
apologies
,
and
was
so
very
penitent
,
that
when
Lightwood
got
out
of
the
cab
,
he
gave
the
driver
a
particular
charge
to
be
careful
of
him
.
<EOS>
Which
the
driver
(
knowing
there
was
no
other
fare
left
inside
)
stared
at
prodigiously
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
night
's
work
had
so
exhausted
and
worn
out
this
actor
in
it
,
that
he
had
become
a
mere
somnambulist
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
tired
to
rest
in
his
sleep
,
until
he
was
even
tired
out
of
being
too
tired
,
and
dropped
into
oblivion
.
<EOS>
Late
in
the
afternoon
he
awoke
,
and
in
some
anxiety
sent
round
to
Eugene
's
lodging
hard
by
,
to
inquire
if
he
were
up
yet
?
  
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
he
was
up
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
had
not
been
to
bed
.
<EOS>
He
had
just
come
home
.
<EOS>
And
here
he
was
,
close
following
on
the
heels
of
the
message
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
what
bloodshot
,
draggled
,
dishevelled
spectacle
is
this
!
"
 
<EOS>
cried
Mortimer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
my
feathers
so
very
much
rumpled
?
"
said
Eugene
,
coolly
going
up
to
the
looking
-
glass
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
rather
out
of
sorts
.
<EOS>
But
consider
.
<EOS>
Such
a
night
for
plumage
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
night
?
"
repeated
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
"
What
became
of
you
in
the
morning
?
"
  
"
My
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Eugene
,
sitting
on
his
bed
,
"
I
felt
that
we
had
bored
one
another
so
long
,
that
an
unbroken
continuance
of
those
relations
must
inevitably
terminate
in
our
flying
to
opposite
points
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
I
also
felt
that
I
had
committed
every
crime
in
the
Newgate
Calendar
.
<EOS>
So
,
for
mingled
considerations
of
friendship
and
felony
,
I
took
a
walk
.
"
   
<EOS>
TWO
NEW
SERVANTS
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
sat
after
breakfast
,
in
the
Bower
,
a
prey
to
prosperity
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
's
face
denoted
Care
and
Complication
.
<EOS>
Many
disordered
papers
were
before
him
,
and
he
looked
at
them
about
as
hopefully
as
an
innocent
civilian
might
look
at
a
crowd
of
troops
whom
he
was
required
at
five
minutes
'
notice
to
manoeuvre
and
review
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
engaged
in
some
attempts
to
make
notes
of
these
papers
;
but
being
troubled
(
as
men
of
his
stamp
often
are
)
with
an
exceedingly
distrustful
and
corrective
thumb
,
that
busy
member
had
so
often
interposed
to
smear
his
notes
,
that
they
were
little
more
legible
than
the
various
impressions
of
itself
,
which
blurred
his
nose
and
forehead
.
<EOS>
It
is
curious
to
consider
,
in
such
a
case
as
Mr.
Boffin
's
,
what
a
cheap
article
ink
is
,
and
how
far
it
may
be
made
to
go
.
<EOS>
As
a
grain
of
musk
will
scent
a
drawer
for
many
years
,
and
still
lose
nothing
appreciable
of
its
original
weight
,
so
a
halfpenny
-
worth
of
ink
would
blot
Mr.
Boffin
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
the
calves
of
his
legs
,
without
inscribing
a
line
on
the
paper
before
him
,
or
appearing
to
diminish
in
the
inkstand
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
was
in
such
severe
literary
difficulties
that
his
eyes
were
prominent
and
fixed
,
and
his
breathing
was
stertorous
,
when
,
to
the
great
relief
of
Mrs.
Boffin
,
who
observed
these
symptoms
with
alarm
,
the
yard
bell
rang
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
that
,
I
wonder
!
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
drew
a
long
breath
,
laid
down
his
pen
,
looked
at
his
notes
as
doubting
whether
he
had
the
pleasure
of
their
acquaintance
,
and
appeared
,
on
a
second
perusal
of
their
countenances
,
to
be
confirmed
in
his
impression
that
he
had
not
,
when
there
was
announced
by
the
hammer
-
headed
young
man
:
  
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
indeed
!
<EOS>
Our
and
the
Wilfers
'
Mutual
Friend
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Ask
him
to
come
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
shaking
hands
with
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
you
're
already
acquainted
with
.
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
I
am
rather
unprepared
to
see
you
,
for
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
've
been
so
busy
with
one
thing
and
another
,
that
I
've
not
had
time
to
turn
your
offer
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
apology
for
both
of
us
:
for
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
<EOS>
for
me
as
well
,
"
 
said
the
smiling
Mrs.
Boffin
.
"
<EOS>
But
Lor
!
<EOS>
we
can
talk
it
over
now
;
 
ca
n't
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
bowed
,
thanked
her
,
and
said
he
hoped
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
then
,
"
resumed
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
his
hand
to
his
chin
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
Secretary
that
you
named
;
was
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
Secretary
,
"
assented
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
rather
puzzled
me
at
the
time
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
and
it
rather
puzzled
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
when
we
spoke
of
it
afterwards
,
because
(
not
to
make
a
mystery
of
our
belief
)
<EOS>
we
have
always
believed
a
Secretary
to
be
a
piece
of
furniture
,
mostly
of
mahogany
,
lined
with
green
baize
or
leather
,
with
a
lot
of
little
drawers
in
it
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
wo
n't
think
I
take
a
liberty
when
I
mention
that
you
certainly
ai
n't
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Certainly
not
,
said
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
used
the
word
in
the
sense
of
Steward
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
as
to
Steward
,
you
see
,
"
returned
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
his
hand
still
to
his
chin
,
"
the
odds
are
that
Mrs.
Boffin
and
me
may
never
go
upon
the
water
.
<EOS>
Being
both
bad
sailors
,
we
should
want
a
Steward
if
we
did
;
but
there
's
generally
one
provided
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
again
explained
;
defining
the
duties
he
sought
to
undertake
,
as
those
of
general
superintendent
,
or
manager
,
or
overlooker
,
or
man
of
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
for
instance
---
come
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
his
pouncing
way
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
entered
my
employment
,
what
would
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
keep
exact
accounts
of
all
the
expenditure
you
sanctioned
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
I
would
write
your
letters
,
under
your
direction
.
<EOS>
I
would
transact
your
business
with
people
in
your
pay
or
employment
.
<EOS>
I
would
,
"
with
a
glance
and
a
half
-
smile
at
the
table
,
"
arrange
your
papers
---
<EOS>
"
  
Mr.
Boffin
rubbed
his
inky
ear
,
and
looked
at
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
And
so
arrange
them
as
to
have
them
always
in
order
for
immediate
reference
,
with
a
note
of
the
contents
of
each
outside
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
slowly
crumpling
his
own
blotted
note
in
his
hand
;
"
if
you
'll
turn
to
at
these
present
papers
,
and
see
what
you
can
make
of
'em
,
I
shall
know
better
what
I
can
make
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
No
sooner
said
than
done
.
<EOS>
Relinquishing
his
hat
and
gloves
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
sat
down
quietly
at
the
table
,
arranged
the
open
papers
into
an
orderly
heap
,
cast
his
eyes
over
each
in
succession
,
folded
it
,
docketed
it
on
the
outside
,
laid
it
in
a
second
heap
,
and
,
when
that
second
heap
was
complete
and
the
first
gone
,
took
from
his
pocket
a
piece
of
string
and
tied
it
together
with
a
remarkably
dexterous
hand
at
a
running
curve
and
a
loop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
good
!
<EOS>
Now
let
us
hear
what
they
're
all
about
;
will
you
be
so
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
John
Rokesmith
read
his
abstracts
aloud
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
about
the
new
house
.
<EOS>
Decorator
's

,
so
much
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

<EOS>
Then
came
correspondence
.
<EOS>
Acceptance

<EOS>

<EOS>
Concerning

's
scheme
of

.
<EOS>
All
compact
and
methodical
.
  
<EOS>
"
Apple

pie
order

"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
after
checking
off
each
inscription
with
his
hand
,
like
a
man
beating
time
.
<EOS>
"
And
whatever
you
do
with
your
ink
,
I
ca
n't
think
,
for
you
're
as
clean
as
a
whistle
after
it
.
<EOS>
Now
,
as
to
a
letter
.
<EOS>
Let
's
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
rubbing
his
hands
in
his
pleasantly
childish
admiration
,
"
let
's
try
a
letter
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
whom
shall
it
be
addressed
,
Mr.
Boffin
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Anyone
.
<EOS>
Yourself
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
quickly
wrote
,
and
then
read
aloud
:
  
"
<EOS>
"
Mr
.
Boffin
presents
his
compliments
to
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
,
and
begs
to
say
that
he
has
decided
on
giving
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
a
trial
in
the
capacity
he
desires
to
fill
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
takes
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
at
his
word
,
in
postponing
to
some
indefinite
period
,
the
consideration
of
salary
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
understood
that
Mr.
Boffin
is
in
no
way
committed
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
has
merely
to
add
,
that
he
relies
on
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
's
assurance
that
he
will
be
faithful
and
serviceable
.
<EOS>
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
will
please
enter
on
his
duties
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Now
,
Noddy
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
,
clapping
her
hands
,
"
That
is
a
good
one
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
was
no
less
delighted
;
indeed
,
in
his
own
bosom
,
he
regarded
both
the
composition
itself
and
the
device
that
had
given
birth
to
it
,
as
a
very
remarkable
monument
of
human
ingenuity
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
tell
you
,
my
deary
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
that
if
you
do
n't
close
with
Mr.
Rokesmith
now
at
once
,
and
if
you
ever
go
a
muddling
yourself
again
with
things
never
meant
nor
made
for
you
,
you
'll
have
an
apoplexy
---
besides
iron
-
moulding
your
linen
---
and
you
'll
break
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
embraced
his
spouse
for
these
words
of
wisdom
,
and
then
,
congratulating
John
Rokesmith
on
the
brilliancy
of
his
achievements
,
gave
him
his
hand
in
pledge
of
their
new
relations
.
<EOS>
So
did
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
who
,
in
his
frankness
,
felt
that
it
did
not
become
him
to
have
a
gentleman
in
his
employment
five
minutes
,
without
reposing
some
confidence
in
him
,
"
you
must
be
let
a
little
more
into
our
affairs
,
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
I
mentioned
to
you
,
when
I
made
your
acquaintance
,
or
I
might
better
say
when
you
made
mine
,
that
Mrs.
Boffin
's
inclinations
was
setting
in
the
way
of
Fashion
,
but
that
I
did
n't
know
how
fashionable
we
might
or
might
not
grow
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
has
carried
the
day
,
and
we
're
going
in
neck
and
crop
for
Fashion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
inferred
that
,
sir
,
"
replied
John
Rokesmith
,
"
from
the
scale
on
which
your
new
establishment
is
to
be
maintained
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
it
's
to
be
a
Spanker
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
my
literary
man
named
to
me
that
a
house
with
which
he
is
,
as
I
may
say
,
connected
---
in
which
he
has
an
interest
---
"
  
"
As
property
?
"
inquired
John
Rokesmith
.
"
<EOS>
Why
no
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
not
exactly
that
;
a
sort
of
a
family
tie
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Association
?
<EOS>
"
the
Secretary
suggested
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
.
<EOS>
Anyhow
,
he
named
to
me
that
the
house
had
a
board
up
,
`
`
This
Eminently
Aristocratic
Mansion
to
be
let
or
sold
.
"
<EOS>
"
Me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
went
to
look
at
it
,
and
finding
it
beyond
a
doubt
Eminently
Aristocratic
<EOS>
(
though
a
trifle
high
and
dull
,
which
after
all
may
be
part
of
the
same
thing
)
took
it
.
<EOS>
My
literary
man
was
so
friendly
as
to
drop
into
a
charming
piece
of
poetry
on
that
occasion
,
in
which
he
complimented
Mrs.
Boffin
on
coming
into
possession
of
---
how
did
it
go
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
replied
:
   
"
`
`
The
gay
,
the
gay
and
festive
scene
,
  
The
halls
,
the
halls
of
dazzling
light
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
"
That
's
it
!
<EOS>
And
it
was
made
neater
by
there
really
being
two
halls
in
the
house
,
a
front
'
<EOS>
un
and
a
back
'
un
,
besides
the
servants
'
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
dropped
into
a
very
pretty
piece
of
poetry
to
be
sure
,
respecting
the
extent
to
which
he
would
be
willing
to
put
himself
out
of
the
way
to
bring
Mrs.
Boffin
round
,
in
case
she
should
ever
get
low
in
her
spirits
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
has
a
wonderful
memory
.
<EOS>
Will
you
repeat
it
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
complied
,
by
reciting
the
verses
in
which
this
obliging
offer
had
been
made
,
exactly
as
she
had
received
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
`
`
I
'll
tell
thee
how
the
maiden
wept
,
Mrs.
Boffin
,
  
<EOS>
When
her
true
love
was
slain
ma'am
,
  
<EOS>
And
how
her
broken
spirit
slept
,
Mrs.
Boffin
,
  
And
never
woke
again
ma'am
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
thee
(
if
agreeable
to
Mr.
Boffin
)
<EOS>
how
the
steed
drew
nigh
,
  
And
left
his
lord
afar
;
  
<EOS>
And
if
my
tale
(
which
I
hope
Mr.
Boffin
might
excuse
)
should
make
you
sigh
,
  
I
'll
strike
the
light
guitar
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
"
Correct
to
the
letter
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
consider
that
the
poetry
brings
us
both
in
,
in
a
beautiful
manner
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
effect
of
the
poem
on
the
Secretary
being
evidently
to
astonish
him
,
Mr.
Boffin
was
confirmed
in
his
high
opinion
of
it
,
and
was
greatly
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
see
,
Rokesmith
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
a
literary
man
---
with
a
wooden
leg
---
is
liable
to
jealousy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
cast
about
for
comfortable
ways
and
means
of
not
calling
up
Wegg
's
jealousy
,
but
of
keeping
you
in
your
department
,
and
keeping
him
in
his
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
say
is
,
the
world
's
wide
enough
for
all
of
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
is
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
when
not
literary
.
<EOS>
But
when
so
,
not
so
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
bound
to
bear
in
mind
that
I
took
Wegg
on
,
at
a
time
when
I
had
no
thought
of
being
fashionable
or
of
leaving
the
Bower
.
<EOS>
To
let
him
feel
himself
anyways
slighted
now
,
would
be
to
be
guilty
of
a
meanness
,
and
to
act
like
having
one
's
head
turned
by
the
halls
of
dazzling

<EOS>
Which
Lord
forbid
!
<EOS>
Rokesmith
,
what
shall
we
say
about
your
living
in
the
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
house
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
got
other
plans
for
this
house
.
<EOS>
In
the
new
house
?
"
  
"
That
will
be
as
you
please
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
I
hold
myself
quite
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
You
know
where
I
live
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
after
considering
the
point
;
"
suppose
you
keep
as
you
are
for
the
present
,
and
we
'll
decide
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
You
'll
begin
to
take
charge
at
once
,
of
all
that
's
going
on
in
the
new
house
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
willingly
.
<EOS>
I
will
begin
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
me
the
address
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
repeated
it
,
and
the
Secretary
wrote
it
down
in
his
pocketbook
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
took
the
opportunity
of
his
being
so
engaged
,
to
get
a
better
observation
of
his
face
than
she
had
yet
taken
.
<EOS>
It
impressed
her
in
his
favour
,
for
she
nodded
aside
to
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
I
like
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
see
directly
that
everything
is
in
train
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Thank'ee
.
<EOS>
Being
here
,
would
you
care
at
all
to
look
round
the
Bower
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
greatly
like
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
so
much
of
its
story
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
And
he
and
Mrs.
Boffin
led
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
A
gloomy
house
the
Bower
,
with
sordid
signs
on
it
of
having
been
,
through
its
long
existence
as
Harmony
Jail
,
in
miserly
holding
.
<EOS>
Bare
of
paint
,
bare
of
paper
on
the
walls
,
bare
of
furniture
,
bare
of
experience
of
human
life
.
<EOS>
Whatever
is
built
by
man
for
man
's
occupation
<EOS>
,
must
,
like
natural
creations
,
fulfil
the
intention
of
its
existence
,
or
soon
perish
.
<EOS>
This
old
house
had
wasted
more
from
desuetude
than
it
would
have
wasted
from
use
,
twenty
years
for
one
.
  
<EOS>
A
certain
leanness
falls
upon
houses
not
sufficiently
imbued
with
life
(
as
if
they
were
nourished
upon
it
)
,
which
was
very
noticeable
here
.
<EOS>
The
staircase
,
balustrades
,
and
rails
,
had
a
spare
look
---
an
air
of
being
denuded
to
the
bone
---
which
the
panels
of
the
walls
and
the
jambs
of
the
doors
and
windows
also
bore
.
<EOS>
The
scanty
moveables
partook
of
it
<EOS>
;
save
for
the
cleanliness
of
the
place
,
the
dust
into
which
they
were
all
resolving
would
have
lain
thick
on
the
floors
;
 
and
those
,
both
in
colour
and
in
grain
,
were
worn
like
old
faces
that
had
kept
much
alone
.
  
<EOS>
The
bedroom
where
the
clutching
old
man
had
lost
his
grip
on
life
,
was
left
as
he
had
left
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
old
grisly
four
-
post
bed
-
stead
,
without
hangings
,
and
with
a
jail
-
like
upper
rim
of
iron
and
spikes
;
and
there
was
the
old
patch
-
work
counterpane
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
tight
-
clenched
old
bureau
,
receding
atop
like
a
bad
and
secret
forehead
;
there
was
the
cumbersome
old
table
with
twisted
legs
,
at
the
bed
-
side
;
and
there
was
the
box
upon
it
,
in
which
the
will
had
lain
.
<EOS>
A
few
old
chairs
with
patch
-
work
covers
,
under
which
the
more
precious
stuff
to
be
preserved
had
slowly
lost
its
quality
of
colour
without
imparting
pleasure
to
any
eye
,
stood
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
A
hard
family
likeness
was
on
all
these
things
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
room
was
kept
like
this
,
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
against
the
son
's
return
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
everything
in
the
house
was
kept
exactly
as
it
came
to
us
,
for
him
to
see
and
approve
.
<EOS>
Even
now
,
nothing
is
changed
but
our
own
room
below
-
stairs
that
you
have
just
left
.
<EOS>
When
the
son
came
home
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
,
and
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
saw
his
father
,
it
was
most
likely
in
this
room
that
they
met
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
Secretary
looked
all
round
it
,
his
eyes
rested
on
a
side
door
in
a
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Another
staircase
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
unlocking
the
door
,
"
leading
down
into
the
yard
.
<EOS>
We
'll
go
down
this
way
,
as
you
may
like
to
see
the
yard
,
and
it
's
all
in
the
road
.
<EOS>
When
the
son
was
a
little
child
,
it
was
up
and
down
these
stairs
that
he
mostly
came
and
went
to
his
father
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
timid
of
his
father
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
him
sit
on
these
stairs
,
in
his
shy
way
,
poor
child
,
many
a
time
.
<EOS>
Me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
have
comforted
him
,
sitting
with
his
little
book
on
these
stairs
,
often
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
And
his
poor
sister
too
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
here
's
the
sunny
place
on
the
white
wall
where
they
one
day
measured
one
another
.
<EOS>
Their
own
little
hands
wrote
up
their
names
here
,
only
with
a
pencil
;
but
the
names
are
here
still
,
and
the
poor
dears
gone
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
take
care
of
the
names
,
old
lady
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
take
care
of
the
names
.
<EOS>
They
sha
n't
be
rubbed
out
in
our
time
,
nor
yet
,
if
we
can
help
it
,
in
the
time
after
us
.
<EOS>
Poor
little
children
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
poor
little
children
!
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
opened
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
giving
on
the
yard
,
and
they
stood
in
the
sunlight
,
looking
at
the
scrawl
of
the
two
unsteady
childish
hands
two
or
three
steps
up
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
this
simple
memento
of
a
blighted
childhood
,
and
in
the
tenderness
of
Mrs.
Boffin
,
that
touched
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
then
showed
his
new
man
of
business
the
Mounds
,
and
his
own
particular
Mound
which
had
been
left
him
as
his
legacy
under
the
will
before
he
acquired
the
whole
estate
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
enough
for
us
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
in
case
it
had
pleased
God
to
spare
the
last
of
those
two
young
lives
and
sorrowful
deaths
.
<EOS>
We
did
n't
want
the
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
treasures
of
the
yard
,
and
at
the
outside
of
the
house
,
and
at
the
detached
building
which
Mr.
Boffin
pointed
out
as
the
residence
of
himself
and
his
wife
during
the
many
years
of
their
service
,
the
Secretary
looked
with
interest
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
Mr.
Boffin
had
shown
him
every
wonder
of
the
Bower
twice
over
,
that
he
remembered
his
having
duties
to
discharge
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
instructions
to
give
me
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
reference
to
this
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
any
,
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Might
I
ask
,
without
seeming
impertinent
,
whether
you
have
any
intention
of
selling
it
?
"
  
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
In
remembrance
of
our
old
master
,
our
old
master
's
children
,
and
our
old
service
,
me
and
Mrs.
Boffin
mean
to
keep
it
up
as
it
stands
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
's
eyes
glanced
with
so
much
meaning
in
them
at
the
Mounds
,
that
Mr.
Boffin
said
,
as
if
in
answer
to
a
remark
:
  
"
Ay
,
ay
,
that
's
another
thing
.
<EOS>
I
may
sell
them
,
though
I
should
be
sorry
to
see
the
neighbourhood
deprived
of
'em
too
.
<EOS>
It
'll
look
but
a
poor
dead
flat
without
the
Mounds
.
<EOS>
Still
I
do
n't
say
that
I
'm
going
to
keep
'em
always
there
,
for
the
sake
of
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
hurry
about
it
;
that
's
all
I
say
at
present
.
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
a
scholar
in
much
,
Rokesmith
,
but
I
'm
a
pretty
fair
scholar
in
dust
.
<EOS>
I
can
price
the
Mounds
to
a
fraction
,
and
I
Know
how
they
can
be
best
disposed
of
,
and
likewise
that
they
take
no
harm
by
standing
where
they
do
.
<EOS>
You
'll
look
in
to
-
morrow
,
will
you
be
so
kind
?
"
  
"
Every
day
.
<EOS>
And
the
sooner
I
can
get
you
into
your
new
house
,
complete
,
the
better
you
will
be
pleased
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
ai
n't
that
I
'm
in
a
mortal
hurry
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
;
 
"
only
when
you
do
pay
people
for
looking
alive
<EOS>
,
it
's
as
well
to
know
that
they
are
looking
alive
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
that
your
opinion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
!
"
replied
the
Secretary
;
and
so
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
to
himself
,
subsiding
into
his
regular
series
of
turns
in
the
yard
,
"
if
I
can
make
it
comfortable
with
Wegg
,
my
affairs
will
be
going
smooth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
of
low
cunning
had
,
of
course
,
acquired
a
mastery
over
the
man
of
high
simplicity
.
<EOS>
The
mean
man
had
,
of
course
,
got
the
better
of
the
generous
man
.
<EOS>
How
long
such
conquests
last
,
is
another
matter
;
that
they
are
achieved
,
is
every
-
day
experience
,
not
even
to
be
flourished
away
by
Podsnappery
itself
.
<EOS>
The
undesigning
Boffin
had
become
so
far
immeshed
by
the
wily
Wegg
that
his
mind
misgave
him
<EOS>
he
was
a
very
designing
man
indeed
in
purposing
to
do
more
for
Wegg
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
(
so
skilful
was
Wegg
)
that
he
was
plotting
darkly
,
when
he
was
contriving
to
do
the
very
thing
that
Wegg
was
plotting
to
get
him
to
do
.
<EOS>
And
thus
,
while
he
was
mentally
turning
the
kindest
of
kind
faces
on
Wegg
this
morning
,
he
was
not
absolutely
sure
but
that
he
might
somehow
deserve
the
charge
of
turning
his
back
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
For
these
reasons
Mr.
Boffin
passed
but
anxious
hours
until
evening
came
,
and
with
it
Mr.
Wegg
,
stumping
leisurely
to
the
Roman
Empire
.
<EOS>
At
about
this
period
Mr.
Boffin
had
become
profoundly
interested
in
the
fortunes
of
a
great
military
leader
known
to
him
as
Bully
Sawyers
,
but
perhaps
better
known
to
fame
and
easier
of
identification
by
the
classical
student
,
under
the
less
Britannic
name
of
Belisarius
.
<EOS>
Even
this
general
's
career
paled
in
interest
for
Mr.
Boffin
before
the
clearing
of
his
conscience
with
Wegg
;
and
hence
,
when
that
literary
gentleman
had
according
to
custom
eaten
and
drunk
until
he
was
all
a
-
golw
,
and
when
he
took
up
his
book
with
the
usual
chirping
introduction
,
"
And
now
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
sir
,
we
'll
decline
and
we
'll
fall
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
stopped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
,
Wegg
,
when
I
first
told
you
that
I
wanted
to
make
a
sort
of
offer
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
get
on
my
considering
cap
,
sir
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
,
turning
the
open
book
face
downward
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
first
told
me
that
you
wanted
to
make
a
sort
of
offer
to
me
?
<EOS>
Now
let
me
think
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
as
if
there
were
the
least
necessity
)
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
to
be
sure
I
do
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
my
corner
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
it
was
!
<EOS>
You
had
first
asked
me
whether
I
liked
your
name
,
and
Candour
had
compelled
a
reply
in
the
negative
case
.
<EOS>
I
little
thought
then
,
sir
,
how
familiar
that
name
would
come
to
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
will
be
more
familiar
still
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
,
Mr.
Boffin
?
<EOS>
Much
obliged
to
you
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
Is
it
your
pleasure
,
sir
,
that
we
decline
and
we
fall
?
<EOS>
"
with
a
feint
of
taking
up
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
just
yet
awhile
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
have
got
another
offer
to
make
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
(
who
had
had
nothing
else
in
his
mind
for
several
nights
)
took
off
his
spectacles
with
an
air
of
bland
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
hope
you
'll
like
it
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
that
reticent
individual
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
may
prove
so
.
<EOS>
On
all
accounts
,
I
am
sure
.
"
<EOS>
(
This
,
as
a
philanthropic
aspiration
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
of
not
keeping
a
stall
,
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
sir
,
"
replied
Wegg
,
"
that
I
should
like
to
be
shown
the
gentleman
prepared
to
make
it
worth
my
while
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
was
going
to
say
,
My
Benefactor
,
and
had
said
My
Bene
,
when
a
grandiloquent
change
came
over
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
not
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Anybody
but
you
.
<EOS>
Do
not
fear
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
that
I
shall
contaminate
the
premises
which
your
gold
has
bought
,
with
my
lowly
pursuits

<EOS>
I
am
aware
,
sir
,
that
it
would
not
become
me
to
carry
on
my
little
traffic
under
the
windows
of
your
mansion
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
thought
of
that
,
and
taken
my
measures
.
<EOS>
No
need
to
be
bought
out
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Would
Stepney
Fields
be
considered
intrusive
?
<EOS>
If
not
remote
enough
,
I
can
go
remoter
.
<EOS>
In
the
words
of
the
poet
's
song
,
which
I
do
not
quite
remember
:
   
Thrown
on
the
wide
world
,
doom'd
to
wander
and
roam
,
  
Bereft
of
my
parents
,
bereft
of
a
home
,
  
A
stranger
to
something
<EOS>
and
what
's
his
name
joy
,
  
<EOS>
Behold
little
Edmund
the
poor
Peasant
boy
.
 
<EOS>
---
And
equally
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
repairing
the
want
of
direct
application
in
the
last
line
,
"
behold
myself
on
a
similar
footing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Wegg
,
Wegg
,
Wegg
,
"
remonstrated
the
excellent
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
sensitive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
I
am
,
sir
,
"
returned
Wegg
,
with
obstinate
magnanimity
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
acquainted
with
my
faults
.
<EOS>
I
always
was
,
from
a
child
,
too
sensitive
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
listen
,
"
pursued
the
Golden
Dustman
;
"
hear
me
out
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
You
have
taken
it
into
your
head
that
I
mean
to
pension
you
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
sir
,
"
returned
Wegg
,
still
with
an
obstinate
magnanimity
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
acquainted
with
my
faults
.
<EOS>
Far
be
it
from
me
to
deny
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
it
into
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
mean
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
assurance
seemed
hardly
as
comforting
to
Mr.
Wegg
,
as
Mr.
Boffin
intended
it
to
be
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
an
appreciable
elongation
of
his
visage
might
have
been
observed
as
he
replied
:
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
,
indeed
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Boffin
;
"
because
that
would
express
,
as
I
understand
it
,
that
you
were
not
going
to
do
anything
to
deserve
your
money
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
;
you
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr.
Wegg
,
cheering
up
bravely
,
"
is
quite
another
pair
of
shoes
.
<EOS>
Now
,
my
independence
as
a
man
is
again
elevated
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
no
longer
   
Weep
for
the
hour
,
  
<EOS>
When
to
Boffinses
bower
,
  
<EOS>
The
Lord
of
the
valley
with
offers
came
;
  
<EOS>
Neither
does
the
moon
hide
her
light
  
<EOS>
From
the
heavens
to
-
night
,
  
And
weep
behind
her
clouds
o'er
any
individual
in
the
present
Company
's
shame
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
---
Please
to
proceed
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Wegg
,
both
for
your
confidence
in
me
and
for
your
frequent
dropping
into
poetry
;
both
of
which
is
friendly
.
<EOS>
Well
,
then
;
my
idea
is
,
that
you
should
give
up
your
stall
,
and
that
I
should
put
you
into
the
Bower
here
,
to
keep
it
for
us
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pleasant
spot
;
and
a
man
with
coals
and
candles
and
a
pound
a
week
might
be
in
clover
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
Would
that
man
,
sir
<EOS>
---
we
will
say
that
man
,
for
the
purposes
of
argueyment
;
"
Mr.
Wegg
made
a
smiling
demonstration
of
great
perspicuity
here
;
"
would
that
man
,
sir
,
be
expected
to
throw
any
other
capacity
in
,
or
would
any
other
capacity
be
considered
extra
?
<EOS>
Now
let
us
(
for
the
purposes
of
argueyment
)
suppose
that
man
to
be
engaged
as
a
reader
:
say
(
for
the
purposes
of
argueyment
)
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Would
that
man
's
pay
as
a
reader
in
the
evening
,
be
added
to
the
other
amount
,
which
,
adopting
your
language
,
we
will
call
clover
;
or
would
it
merge
into
that
amount
,
or
clover
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
I
suppose
it
would
be
added
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
would
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
are
right
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Exactly
my
own
views
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Here
Wegg
rose
,
and
balancing
himself
on
his
wooden
leg
,
fluttered
over
his
prey
with
extended
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
consider
it
done
.
<EOS>
Say
no
more
,
sir
,
not
a
word
more
.
<EOS>
My
stall
and
I
are
for
ever
parted
.
<EOS>
The
collection
of
ballads
will
in
future
be
reserved
for
private
study
,
with
the
object
of
making
poetry
tributary
"
  
<EOS>
---
Wegg
was
so
proud
of
having
found
this
word
,
that
he
said
it
again
,
with
a
capital
letter
---
"
Tributary
,
to
friendship
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
do
n't
allow
yourself
to
be
made
uncomfortable
by
the
pang
it
gives
me
to
part
from
my
stock
and
stall
.
<EOS>
Similar
emotion
was
undergone
by
my
own
father
when
promoted
for
his
merits
from
his
occupation
as
a
waterman
to
a
situation
under
Government
.
<EOS>
His
Christian
name
was
Thomas
.
<EOS>
His
words
at
the
time
(
I
was
then
an
infant
,
but
so
deep
was
their
impression
on
me
,
that
I
committed
them
to
memory
)
<EOS>
were
:
   
<EOS>
Then
farewell
my
trim
-
built
wherry
,
  
Oars
and
coat
and
badge
farewell
!
  
<EOS>
Never
more
at
Chelsea
Ferry
,
  
<EOS>
Shall
your
Thomas
take
a
spell
!
 
<EOS>
---
My
father
got
over
it
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
so
shall
I.
"
  
<EOS>
While
delivering
these
valedictory
observations
,
Wegg
continually
disappointed
Mr.
Boffin
of
his
hand
by
flourishing
it
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
He
now
darted
it
at
his
patron
,
who
took
it
,
and
felt
his
mind
relieved
of
a
great
weight
:
observing
that
as
they
had
arranged
their
joint
affairs
so
satisfactorily
,
he
would
now
be
glad
to
look
into
those
of
Bully
Sawyers
.
<EOS>
Which
,
indeed
,
had
been
left
over
-
night
in
a
very
unpromising
posture
,
and
for
whose
impending
expedition
against
the
Persians
the
weather
had
been
by
no
means
favourable
all
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
resumed
his
spectacles
therefore
.
<EOS>
But
Sawyers
was
not
to
be
of
the
party
that
night
;
for
,
before
Wegg
had
found
his
place
,
Mrs.
Boffin
's
tread
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
,
so
unusually
heavy
and
hurried
,
that
Mr.
Boffin
would
have
started
up
at
the
sound
,
anticipating
some
occurrence
much
out
of
the
common
course
,
even
though
she
had
not
also
called
to
him
in
an
agitated
tone
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
hurried
out
,
and
found
her
on
the
dark
staircase
,
panting
,
with
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
;
I
do
n't
know
;
but
I
wish
you
'd
come
up
-
stairs
.
"
  
<EOS>
Much
surprised
,
Mr.
Boffin
went
up
stairs
and
accompanied
Mrs.
Boffin
into
their
own
room
:
a
second
large
room
on
the
same
floor
as
the
room
in
which
the
late
proprietor
had
died
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
looked
all
round
him
,
and
saw
nothing
more
unusual
than
various
articles
of
folded
linen
on
a
large
chest
,
which
Mrs.
Boffin
had
been
sorting
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
Why
,
you
're
frightened
!
<EOS>
You
frightened
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
one
of
that
sort
certainly
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
as
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
to
recover
herself
,
and
took
her
husband
's
arm
;
"
but
it
's
very
strange
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Noddy
,
the
faces
of
the
old
man
and
the
two
children
are
all
over
the
house
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
?
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
But
not
without
a
certain
uncomfortable
sensation
gliding
down
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
must
sound
foolish
,
and
yet
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
think
you
saw
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
think
I
saw
them
anywhere
.
<EOS>
I
felt
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Touched
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
Felt
them
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
I
was
sorting
those
things
on
the
chest
,
and
not
thinking
of
the
old
man
or
the
children
,
but
singing
to
myself
,
when
all
in
a
moment
I
felt
there
was
a
face
growing
out
of
the
dark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
face
?
"
asked
her
husband
,
looking
about
him
:
  
"
For
a
moment
it
was
the
old
man
's
,
and
then
it
got
younger
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
it
was
both
the
children
's
,
and
then
it
got
older
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
it
was
a
strange
face
,
and
then
it
was
all
the
faces
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
it
was
gone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
then
it
was
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
were
you
then
,
old
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
at
the
chest
.
<EOS>
Well
;
I
got
the
better
of
it
,
and
went
on
sorting
,
and
went
on
singing
to
myself
.
<EOS>
`
`
Lor
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
says
,
`
I
'll
think
of
something
else
---
something
comfortable
---
and
put
it
out
of
my
head
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
I
thought
of
the
new
house
and
Miss
Bella
Wilfer
,
and
was
thinking
at
a
great
rate
with
that
sheet
there
in
my
hand
,
when
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
the
faces
seemed
to
be
hidden
in
among
the
folds
of
it
<EOS>
and
I
let
it
drop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
it
still
lay
on
the
floor
where
it
had
fallen
,
Mr.
Boffin
picked
it
up
and
laid
it
on
the
chest
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
you
ran
down
stairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
'd
try
another
room
,
and
shake
it
off
.
<EOS>
I
says
to
myself
,
`
`
I
'll
go
and
walk
slowly
up
and
down
the
old
man
's
room
three
times
,
from
end
to
end
,
and
then
I
shall
have
conquered
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
I
went
in
with
the
candle
in
my
hand
<EOS>
but
the
moment
I
came
near
the
bed
,
the
air
got
thick
with
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
With
the
faces
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
I
even
felt
that
they
were
in
the
dark
behind
the
sidedoor
,
and
on
the
little
staircase
,
floating
away
into
the
yard
.
<EOS>
Then
,
I
called
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
lost
in
amazement
,
looked
at
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
,
lost
in
her
own
fluttered
inability
to
make
this
out
,
looked
at
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Golden
Dustman
,
"
I
'll
at
once
get
rid
of
Wegg
for
the
night
,
because
he
's
coming
to
inhabit
the
Bower
,
and
it
might
be
put
into
his
head
or
somebody
else
's
,
if
he
heard
this
<EOS>
and
it
got
about
,
that
the
house
is
haunted
.
<EOS>
Whereas
we
know
better
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
had
the
feeling
in
the
house
before
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
;
 
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
been
about
it
alone
at
all
hours
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
the
house
when
Death
was
in
it
,
and
I
have
been
in
the
house
when
Murder
was
a
new
part
of
its
adventures
,
and
I
never
had
a
fright
in
it
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
wo
n't
again
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
,
it
comes
of
thinking
and
dwelling
on
that
dark
spot
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
why
did
n't
it
come
before
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
This
draft
on
Mr.
Boffin
's
philosophy
could
only
be
met
by
that
gentleman
with
the
remark
that
everything
that
is
at
all
,
must
begin
at
some
time
.
<EOS>
Then
,
tucking
his
wife
's
arm
under
his
own
,
that
she
might
not
be
left
by
herself
to
be
troubled
again
,
he
descended
to
release
Wegg
.
<EOS>
Who
,
being
something
drowsy
after
his
plentiful
repast
,
and
constitutionally
of
a
shirking
temperament
,
was
well
enough
pleased
to
stump
away
,
without
doing
what
he
had
come
to
do
,
and
was
paid
for
doing
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
then
put
on
his
hat
,
and
Mrs.
Boffin
her
shawl
;
and
the
pair
,
further
provided
with
a
bunch
of
keys
and
a
lighted
lantern
,
went
all
over
the
dismal
house
---
dismal
everywhere
,
but
in
their
own
two
rooms
---
from
cellar
to
cock
-
loft
.
<EOS>
Not
resting
satisfied
with
giving
that
much
chace
to
Mrs.
Boffin
's
fancies
,
they
pursued
them
into
the
yard
and
outbuildings
,
and
under
the
Mounds
.
<EOS>
And
setting
the
lantern
,
when
all
was
done
,
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
Mounds
,
they
comfortably
trotted
to
and
fro
for
an
evening
walk
,
to
the
end
that
the
murky
cobwebs
in
Mrs.
Boffin
's
brain
might
be
blown
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
my
dear
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
when
they
came
in
to
supper
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
treatment
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
Completely
worked
round
,
have
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
deary
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
laying
aside
her
shawl
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
nervous
any

<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
bit
troubled
now
.
<EOS>
I
'd
go
anywhere
about
the
house
the
same
as
ever
.
<EOS>
But
---
"
  
"
Eh
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
've
only
to
shut
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
speaking
with
her
eyes
closed
,
and
her
left
hand
thoughtfully
touching
her
brow
,
<EOS>
"
then
,
there
they
are
!
<EOS>
The
old
man
's
face
,
and
it
gets
younger
.
<EOS>
The
two
children
's
faces
,
and
they
get
older
.
<EOS>
A
face
that
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
And
then
all
the
faces
!
"
  
<EOS>
Opening
her
eyes
again
,
and
sceing
her
husband
's
face
across
the
table
,
she
leaned
forward
to
give
it
a
pat
on
the
cheek
,
and
sat
down
to
supper
,
declaring
it
to
be
the
best
face
in
the
world
.

MINDERS
AND
RE
-
MINDERS
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
lost
no
time
in
getting
to
work
,
and
his
vigilance
and
method
soon
set
their
mark
on
the
Golden
Dustman
's
affairs
.
<EOS>
His
carnestness
in
determining
to
understand
the
length
and
breadth
and
depth
of
every
piece
of
work
submitted
to
him
by
his
employer
,
was
as
special
as
his
despatch
in
transacting
it
.
<EOS>
He
accepted
no
information
or
explanation
at
second
hand
,
but
made
himself
the
master
of
everything
confided
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
One
part
of
the
Secretary
's
conduct
,
underlying
all
the
rest
,
might
have
been
mistrusted
by
a
man
with
a
better
knowledge
of
men
than
the
Golden
Dustman
had
.
<EOS>
The
Secretary
was
as
far
from
being
inquisitive
or
intrusive
as
Secretary
could
be
,
but
nothing
less
than
a
complete
understanding
of
the
whole
of
the
affairs
would
content
him
.
<EOS>
It
soon
became
apparent
(
from
the
knowledge
with
which
he
set
out
)
that
he
must
have
been
to
the
office
where
the
Harmon
will
was
registered
,
and
must
have
read
the
will
.
<EOS>
He
anticipated
Mr.
Boffin
's
consideration
whether
he
should
be
advised
with
on
this
or
that
topic
,
by
showing
that
he
already
knew
of
it
and
understood
it
.
<EOS>
He
did
this
with
no
attempt
at
concealment
,
seeming
to
be
satisfied
that
it
was
part
of
his
duty
to
have
prepared
himself
at
all
attainable
points
for
its
utmost
discharge
.
  
<EOS>
This
might
---
let
it
be
repeated
---
have
awakened
some
little
vague
mistrust
in
a
man
more
worldly
-
wise
than
the
Golden
Dustman
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
Secretary
was
discerning
,
discreet
,
and
silent
,
though
as
zealous
as
if
the
affairs
had
been
his
own
.
<EOS>
He
showed
no
love
of
patronage
or
the
command
of
money
,
but
distinctly
preferred
resigning
both
to
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
If
,
in
his
limited
sphere
,
he
sought
power
,
it
was
the
power
of
knowledge
;
the
power
derivable
from
a
perfect
comprehension
of
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
As
on
the
Secretary
's
face
there
was
a
nameless
cloud
,
so
on
his
manner
there
was
a
shadow
equally
indefinable
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
he
was
embarrassed
,
as
on
that
first
night
with
the
Wilfer
family
;
 
he
was
habitually
unembarrassed
now
,
and
yet
the
something
remained
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
his
manner
was
bad
,
as
on
that
occasion
;
 
it
was
now
very
good
,
as
being
modest
,
gracious
,
and
ready
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
something
never
left
it
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
written
of
men
who
have
undergone
a
cruel
captivity
,
or
who
have
passed
through
a
terrible
strait
,
or
who
in
self
-
preservation
have
killed
a
defenceless
fellow
-
creature
,
that
the
record
thereof
has
never
faded
from
their
countenances
until
they
died
.
<EOS>
Was
there
any
such
record
here
?
  
<EOS>
He
established
a
temporary
office
for
himself
in
the
new
house
,
and
all
went
well
under
his
hand
,
with
one
singular
exception
.
<EOS>
He
manifestly
objected
to
communicate
with
Mr.
Boffin
's
solicitor
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
times
,
when
there
was
some
slight
occasion
for
his
doing
so
,
he
transferred
the
task
to
Mr.
Boffin
;
and
his
evasion
of
it
soon
became
so
curiously
apparent
,
that
Mr.
Boffin
spoke
to
him
on
the
subject
of
his
reluctance
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
,
"
the
Secretary
admitted
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Had
he
any
personal
objection
to
Mr.
Lightwood
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Had
he
suffered
from
law
-
suits
?
  
<EOS>
"
Not
more
than
other
men
,
"
was
his
short
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Was
he
prejudiced
against
the
race
of
lawyers
?
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
But
while
I
am
in
your
employment
,
sir
,
I
would
rather
be
excused
from
going
between
the
lawyer
and
the
client
.
<EOS>
Of
course
if
you
press
it
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
I
am
ready
to
comply
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
take
it
as
a
great
favour
if
you
would
not
press
it
without
urgent
occasion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
it
could
not
be
said
that
there
was
urgent
occasion
,
for
Lightwood
retained
no
other
affairs
in
his
hands
than
such
as
still
lingered
and
languished
about
the
undiscovered
criminal
,
and
such
as
arose
out
of
the
purchase
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Many
other
matters
that
might
have
travelled
to
him
,
now
stopped
short
at
the
Secretary
,
under
whose
administration
they
were
far
more
expeditiously
and
satisfactorily
disposed
of
than
they
would
have
been
if
they
had
got
into
Young
Blight
's
domain
.
<EOS>
This
the
Golden
Dustman
quite
understood
.
<EOS>
Even
the
matter
immediately
in
hand
was
of
very
little
moment
as
requiring
personal
appearance
on
the
Secretary
's
part
,
for
it
amounted
to
no
more
than
this
:
---
<EOS>
The
death
of
Hexam
rendering
the
sweat
of
the
honest
man
's
brow
unprofitable
,
the
honest
man
had
shufflingly
declined
to
moisten
his
brow
for
nothing
,
with
that
severe
exertion
which
is
known
in
legal
circles
as
swearing
your
way
through
a
stone
wall
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
that
new
light
had
gone
sputtering
out
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
airing
of
the
old
facts
had
led
some
one
concerned
to
suggest
that
it
would
be
well
before
they
were
reconsigned
to
their
gloomy
shelf
---
now
probably
for
ever
---
to
induce
or
compel
that
Mr.
Julius
Handford
to
reappear
and
be
questioned
.
<EOS>
And
all
traces
of
Mr.
Julius
Handford
being
lost
,
Lightwood
now
referred
to
his
client
for
authority
to
seek
him
through
public
advertisement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
your
objection
go
to
writing
to
Lightwood
,
Rokesmith
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
the
least
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
perhaps
you
'll
write
him
a
line
,
and
say
he
is
free
to
do
what
he
likes
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
it
promises
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
promises
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
,
he
may
do
what
he
likes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
write
immediately
.
<EOS>
Let
me
thank
you
for
so
considerately
yielding
to
my
disinclination
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
less
unreasonable
,
if
I
avow
to
you
that
although
I
do
n't
know
Mr.
Lightwood
,
I
have
a
disagreeable
association
connected
with
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
his
fault
;
he
is
not
at
all
to
blame
for
it
,
and
does
not
even
know
my
name
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
dismissed
the
matter
with
a
nod
or
two
.
<EOS>
The
letter
was
written
,
and
next
day
Mr.
Julius
Handford
was
advertised
for
.
<EOS>
He
was
requested
to
place
himself
in
communication
with
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
,
as
a
possible
means
of
furthering
the
ends
of
justice
,
and
a
reward
was
offered
to
any
one
acquainted
with
his
whereabout
who
would
communicate
the
same
to
the
said
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
at
his
office
in
the
Temple
.
<EOS>
Every
day
for
six
weeks
this
advertisement
appeared
at
the
head
of
all
the
newspapers
,
and
every
day
for
six
weeks
the
Secretary
,
when
he
saw
it
,
said
to
himself
,
in
the
tone
in
which
he
had
said
to
his
employer
,
---
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
promises
!
"
  
<EOS>
Among
his
first
occupations
the
pursuit
of
that
orphan
wanted
by
Mrs.
Boffin
held
a
conspicuous
place
.
<EOS>
From
the
earliest
moment
of
his
engagement
he
showed
a
particular
desire
to
please
her
,
and
,
knowing
her
to
have
this
object
at
heart
,
he
followed
it
up
with
unwearying
alacrity
and
interest
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Milvey
had
found
their
search
a
diffcult
one
.
<EOS>
Either
an
eligible
orphan
was
of
the
wrong
sex
(
which
almost
always
happened
)
or
was
too
old
,
or
too
young
,
or
too
sickly
,
or
too
dirty
,
or
too
much
accustomed
to
the
streets
,
or
too
likely
to
run
away
;
or
,
it
was
found
impossible
to
complete
the
philanthropic
transaction
without
buying
the
orphan
.
<EOS>
For
,
the
instant
it
became
known
that
anybody
wanted
the
orphan
,
up
started
some
affectionate
relative
of
the
orphan
who
put
a
price
upon
the
orphan
's
head
.
<EOS>
The
suddenness
of
an
orphan
's
rise
in
the
market
was
not
to
be
paralleled
by
the
maddest
records
of
the
Stock
Exchange
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
at
five
thousand
per
cent
.
<EOS>
discount
out
at
nurse
making
a
mud
pie
at
nine
in
the
morning
,
and
(
being
inquired
for
)
would
go
up
to
five
thousand
per
cent
.
<EOS>
premium
before
noon
.
<EOS>
The
market
was
"
rigged
"
in
various
artful
ways
.
<EOS>
Counterfeit
stock
got
into
circulation
.
<EOS>
Parents
boldly
represented
themselves
as
dead
,
and
brought
their
orphans
with
them
.
<EOS>
Genuine
orphan
-
stock
was
surreptitiously
withdrawn
from
the
market
.
<EOS>
It
being
announced
,
by
emissaries
posted
for
the
purpose
,
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Milvey
were
coming
down
the
court
,
orphan
scrip
would
be
instantly
concealed
,
and
production
refused
,
save
on
a
condition
usually
stated
by
the
brokers
as
a
"
a
gallon
of
beer
.
"
<EOS>
Likewise
,
fluctuations
of
a
wild
and
South
-
Sea
nature
were
occasioned
,
by
orphan
-
holders
keeping
back
,
and
then
rushing
into
the
market
a
dozen
together
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
uniform
principle
at
the
root
of
all
these
various
operations
was
bargain
and
sale
;
and
that
principle
could
not
be
recognized
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Milvey
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
tidings
were
received
by
the
Reverend
Frank
of
a
charming
orphan
to
be
found
at
Brentford
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
deceased
parents
(
late
his
parishioners
)
had
a
poor
widowed
grandmother
in
that
agreeable
town
,
and
she
,
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
,
had
carried
off
the
orphan
with
maternal
care
,
but
could
not
afford
to
keep
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
proposed
to
Mrs.
Boffin
,
either
to
go
down
himself
and
take
a
preliminary
survey
of
this
orphan
,
or
to
drive
her
down
,
that
she
might
at
once
form
her
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
preferring
the
latter
course
,
they
set
off
one
morning
in
a
hired
phaeton
,
conveying
the
hammer
-
headed
young
man
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
abode
of
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
was
not
easy
to
find
,
lying
in
such
complicated
back
settlements
of
muddy
Brentford
that
they
left
their
equipage
at
the
sign
of
the
Three
Magpies
,
and
went
in
search
of
it
on
foot
.
<EOS>
After
many
inquiries
and
defeats
,
there
was
pointed
out
to
them
in
a
lane
,
a
very
small
cottage
residence
,
with
a
board
across
the
open
doorway
,
hooked
on
to
which
board
by
the
armpits
was
a
young
gentleman
of
tender
years
,
angling
for
mud
with
a
headless
wooden
horse
and
line
.
<EOS>
In
this
young
sportsman
,
distinguished
by
a
crisply
curling
auburn
head
and
a
bluff
countenance
,
the
Secretary
descried
the
orphan
.
  
<EOS>
It
unfortunately
happened
as
they
quickened
their
pace
,
that
the
orphan
,
lost
to
considerations
of
personal
safety
in
the
ardour
of
the
moment
,
overbalanced
himself
and
toppled
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
Being
an
orphan
of
a
chubby
conformation
,
he
then
took
to
rolling
,
and
had
rolled
into
the
gutter
before
they
could
come
up
.
<EOS>
From
the
gutter
he
was
rescued
by
John
Rokesmith
,
and
thus
the
first
meeting
with
Mrs.
Higden
was
inaugurated
by
the
awkward
circumstance
of
their
being
in
possession
---
one
would
say
at
first
sight
unlawful
possession
---
of
the
orphan
,
upside
down
and
purple
in
the
countenance
.
<EOS>
The
board
across
the
doorway
too
,
acting
as
a
trap
equally
for
the
feet
of
Mrs.
Higden
coming
out
,
and
the
feet
of
Mrs.
Boffin
and
John
Rokesmith
going
in
,
greatly
increased
the
difficulty
of
the
situation
:
to
which
the
cries
of
the
orphan
imparted
a
lugubrious
and
inhuman
character
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
,
it
was
impossible
to
explain
,
on
account
of
the
orphan
's
"
holding
his
breath
:
"
a
most
terrific
proceeding
,
superinducing
in
the
orphan
,
lead
-
colour
rigidity
and
a
deadly
silence
,
compared
with
which
his
cries
were
music
yielding
the
height
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
gradually
recovered
,
Mrs.
Boffin
gradually
introduced
herself
,
and
smiling
peace
was
gradually
wooed
back
to
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
's
home
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
then
perceived
to
be
a
small
home
with
a
large
mangle
in
it
,
at
the
handle
of
which
machine
stood
a
very
long
boy
,
with
a
very
little
head
,
and
an
open
mouth
of
disproportionate
capacity
that
seemed
to
assist
his
eyes
in
staring
at
the
visitors
.
<EOS>
In
a
corner
below
the
mangle
,
on
a
couple
of
stools
,
sat
two
very
little
children
:
a
boy
and
a
girl
;
and
when
the
very
long
boy
,
in
an
interval
of
staring
,
took
a
turn
at
the
mangle
,
it
was
alarming
to
see
how
it
lunged
itself
at
those
two
innocents
,
like
a
catapult
designed
for
their
destruction
,
harmlessly
retiring
when
within
an
inch
of
their
heads
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
clean
and
neat
.
<EOS>
It
had
a
brick
floor
,
and
a
window
of
diamond
panes
,
and
a
flounce
hanging
below
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
strings
nailed
from
bottom
to
top
outside
the
window
on
which
scarletbeans
were
to
grow
in
the
coming
season
if
the
Fates
were
propitious
.
<EOS>
However
propitious
they
might
have
been
in
the
seasons
that
were
gone
,
to
Betty
Higden
in
the
matter
of
beans
,
they
had
not
been
very
favourable
in
the
matter
of
coins
;
for
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
poor
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
those
old
women
,
was
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
,
who
by
dint
of
an
indomitable
purpose
and
a
strong
constitution
fight
out
many
years
,
though
each
year
has
come
with
its
new
knock
-
down
blows
fresh
to
the
fight
against
her
,
wearied
by
it
;
an
active
old
woman
,
with
a
bright
dark
eye
and
a
resolute
face
,
yet
quite
a
tender
creature
too
;
not
a
logically
-
reasoning
woman
,
but
God
is
good
,
and
hearts
may
count
in
Heaven
as
high
as
heads
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
sure
!
<EOS>
"
said
she
,
when
the
business
was
opened
,
"
Mrs.
Milvey
had
the
kindness
to
write
to
me
,
ma'am
,
and
I
got
Sloppy
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
letter
.
<EOS>
But
she
's
an
affable
lady
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
visitors
glanced
at
the
long
boy
,
who
seemed
to
indicate
by
a
broader
stare
of
his
mouth
and
eyes
that
in
him
Sloppy
stood
confessed
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
I
ai
nt
,
you
must
know
,
"
said
Betty
,
"
much
of
a
hand
at
reading
writing
-
hand
,
though
I
can
read
my
Bible
and
most
print
.
<EOS>
And
I
do
love
a
newspaper
.
<EOS>
You
might
n't
think
it
,
but
Sloppy
is
a
beautiful
reader
of
a
newspaper
.
<EOS>
He
do
the
Police
in
different
voices
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
visitors
again
considered
it
a
point
of
politeness
to
look
at
Sloppy
,
who
,
looking
at
them
,
suddenly
threw
back
his
head
,
extended
his
mouth
to
its
utmost
width
,
and
laughed
loud
and
long
.
<EOS>
At
this
the
two
innocents
,
with
their
brains
in
that
apparent
danger
,
laughed
,
and
Mrs.
Higden
laughed
,
and
the
orphan
laughed
,
and
then
the
visitors
laughed
.
<EOS>
Which
was
more
cheerful
than
intelligible
.
  
<EOS>
Then
Sloppy
seeming
to
be
seized
with
an
industrious
mania
or
fury
,
turned
to
at
the
mangle
,
and
impelled
it
at
the
heads
of
the
innocents
with
such
a
creaking
and
rumbling
,
that
Mrs.
Higden
stopped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
gentlefolks
ca
n't
hear
themselves
speak
,
Sloppy
.
<EOS>
Bide
a
bit
,
bide
a
bit
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
dear
child
in
your
lap
?
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
this
is
Johnny
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Johnny
,
too

"
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
,
turning
to
the
Secretary
;
"
already
Johnny
!
<EOS>
Only
one
of
the
two
names
left
to
give
him
!
<EOS>
He
's
a
pretty
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
his
chin
tucked
down
in
his
shy
childish
manner
,
he
was
looking
furtively
at
Mrs.
Boffin
out
of
his
blue
eyes
,
and
reaching
his
fat
dimpled
hand
up
to
the
lips
of
the
old
woman
,
who
was
kissing
it
by
times
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
ma'am
,
he
's
a
pretty
boy
,
he
's
a
dear
darling
boy

,
he
's
the
child
of
my
own
last
left
daughter

daughter

<EOS>
But
she
's
gone
the
way
of
all
the
rest

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Those
are
not
his
brother
and
sister
?
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
dear
no

ma'am
.
<EOS>
Those
are
Minders

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Minders
?
"
<EOS>
the
Secretary
repeated
,
  
"
<EOS>
Left
to
be
Minded

sir

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Come
here
,
Toddles
and
Poddles
.
"
  
<EOS>
Toddles
was
the
pet
-
name
of
the
boy
;
Poddles
of
the
girl
.
<EOS>
At
their
little
unsteady
pace
,
they
came
across
the
floor
,
hand
-
in
-
hand
,
as
if
they
were
traversing
an
extremely
difficult
road
intersected
by
brooks
,
and
,
when
they
had
had
their
heads
patted
by
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
,
made
lunges
at
the
orphan
,
dramatically
representing
an
attempt
to
bear
him
,
crowing
,
into
captivity
and
slavery
.
<EOS>
All
the
three
children
enjoyed
this
to
a
delightful
extent
,
and
the
sympathetic
Sloppy
again
laughed
long
and
loud
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
discreet
to
stop
the
play
,
Betty
Higden
said
"
Go
to
your
seats
Toddles
and
Poddles
,
"
and
they
returned
hand
-
in
-
hand
across
country
,
seeming
to
find
the
brooks
rather
swollen
by
late
rains
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Master
---
or
Mister
---
Sloppy
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
Secretary
,
in
doubt
whether
he
was
man
,
boy
,
or
what
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
love
-
child
,
"
returned
Betty
Higden
,
dropping
her
voice
;
 
"
parents
never
known

found

street

<EOS>
He

<EOS>

The

said
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Higden
set
that
resolute
old
face
of
hers
,
and
darkly
nodded
yes
.
<EOS>
"
You
dislike
the
mention
of
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
Dislike
the
mention

answered
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Kill

Throw
this

the
house
into
a

"
  
<EOS>
A
surprising
spirit
in
this
lonely
woman
after
so
many
years
of
hard
working
,
and
hard
living
,
my
Lords
and
Gentlemen
and
Honorable
Boards
!
<EOS>
What
is
it
that
we
call
it
in
our
grandiose
speeches
?
<EOS>
British
independence
,
rather
perverted
?
<EOS>
Is
that
,
or
something
like
it
,
the
ring
of
the
ca
nt
?
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
never
read
in
the
newspapers
,
"
said
the
dame
,
fondling
the
child
---
"
<EOS>
God
help
me

the
like

<EOS>

how
the

out
people

get
driven

a

them
out

<EOS>
Do
I
never

put

how

grudged

grudged

the

the
doctor

or
the
drop

physic

or
the
bit

bread

<EOS>
Do
I
never
read
how
they
grow
heartsick
of
it
and
give
it
up
,
after
having
let
themselves
drop
so
low
,
and
how
they
after
all
die
out
for
want
of
help
?
<EOS>
Then
I
say
,
I
hope
I
can
die
as
well
as
another
,
and
I
'll
die
without
that
disgrace

"
  
<EOS>
Absolutely
impossible
my
Lords
and
Gentlemen
and
Honorable
Boards
,
by
any
stretch
of
legislative
wisdom
to
set
these
perverse
people
right
in
their
logic
?
  
<EOS>
"
Johnny
,
my
pretty
,
"
continued
old
Betty
,
caressing
the
child
,
and
rather
mourning
over
it
than
speaking
to
it
,
"
your
old
Granny
Betty
is
nigher
fourscore
year
than
threescore
and
ten
.
<EOS>
She
never
begged
nor
had
a
penny
of
the
Union
money
in
all
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
paid
scot
<EOS>
and
she
paid
lot
when
she
had
money
to
pay
;
she
worked
when
she
could
,
and
she
starved
when
she
must
.
<EOS>
You
pray
that
your
Granny
may
have
strength
enough
left
her
at
the
last
(
she
's
strong
for
an
old
one
,
Johnny
)
,
to
get
up
from
her
bed
and
run
and
hide
herself
,
and
swown
to
death
in
a
hole
,
sooner
than
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
Cruel
Jacks
we
read
of

that
dodge
and
drive
,
and
worry
and
weary
,
and
scorn
and
shame
,
the
decent
poor

"
  
<EOS>
A
brilliant
success
,
my
Lords
and
Gentlemen
and
Honorable
Boards
to
have
brought
it
to
this
in
the
minds
of
the
best
of
the
poor
!
<EOS>
Under
submission
,
might
it
be
worth
thinking
of
,
at
any
odd
time
?
  
<EOS>
The
fright
and
abhorrence
that
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
smoothed
out
of
her
strong
face
as
she
ended
this
diversion
,
showed
how
seriously
she
had
meant
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
does
he
work
for
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
Secretary
,
gently
bringing
the
discourse
back
to
Master
or
Mister
Sloppy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Betty
with
a
good
-
humoured
smile
and
nod
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
well
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Does
he
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
lives
more
here

anywhere

<EOS>
He
was
thought
to
be
no
better
than
a
Natural

and
first
come
to
me
as
a
Minder

<EOS>
I
made
interest
with
Mr.
Blogg
the
Beadle
to
have
him
as
a
Minder
,
seeing
him
by
chance
up
at
church
,
and
thinking
I
might
do
something
with
him
.
<EOS>
For
he
was
a
weak
ricketty
creetur
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
he
called
by
his
right
name
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
see
,
speaking
quite
correctly
,
he
has
no
right
name
.
<EOS>
I
always
understood
he
took
his
name
from
being
found
on
a
Sloppy
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
seems
an
amiable
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
sir
,
there
's
not
a
bit
of
him
,
"
returned
Betty
,
"
that
's
not
amiable
.
<EOS>
So
you
may
judge
how
amiable
he
is
,
by
running
your
eye
along
his
heighth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Of
an
ungainly
make
was
Sloppy
.
<EOS>
Too
much
of
him
longwise
,
too
little
of
him
broadwise
,
and
too
many
sharp
angles
of
him
angle
-
wise
.
<EOS>
One
of
those
shambling
male
human
creatures
,
born
to
be
indiscreetly
candid
in
the
revelation
of
buttons
;
every
button
he
had
about
him
glaring
at
the
public
to
a
quite
preternatural
extent
.
<EOS>
A
considerable
capital
of
knee
and
elbow
and
wrist
and
ankle
,
had
Sloppy
,
and
he
did
n't
know
how
to
dispose
of
it
to
the
best
advantage
,
but
was
always
investing
it
in
wrong
securities
,
and
so
getting
himself
into
embarrassed
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Full
-
Private
Number
One
in
the
Awkward
Squad
of
the
rank

file
of

was
Sloppy

had
his
glimmering
notions
of
standing
true
to
the
Colours

<EOS>
And
now
,

said
Mrs.
Boffin

"
concerning
Johnny

<EOS>
As
Johnny
,
with
his
chin
tucked
in
and
his
lips
pouting
,
reclined
in
Betty
's
lap
,
concentrating
his
blue
eyes
on
the
visitors
and
shading
them
from
observation
with
a
dimpled
arm
<EOS>
,
old
Betty
took
one
of
his
fresh
fat
hands
in
her
withered
right
,
and
fell
to
gently
beating
it
on
her
withered
left
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes

<EOS>
Concerning
Johnny

<EOS>
"
If
you
trust

said
Mrs.

with
a
face
inviting
trust

Please

I

thankful

<EOS>
Still
lightly
beating
the
little
hand
upon
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
stand
in
the

light

not

I
had
all
my

me
instead
of
a
very
little
of
it

<EOS>
But
I
hope
you
wo
n't
take
it
ill
that
I
cleave
to
the
child
closer

home
here

<EOS>
"
I
have
seen

said
Betty
,
still
with
that
light
beat
upon
her
hard
rough
hand
,
"
<EOS>
so
many
of
them
on
my
lap

<EOS>
And
they
are
all
gone

<EOS>
this
one
!
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
to
seem
so
selfish
,
but
I
do
n't
really
mean
it

<EOS>
It
'll
be
the
making
of
his
fortune

and
he
'll
be
a
gentleman
when
I
am
dead

<EOS>
I

I

do
n't
know
what
comes
over
me

<EOS>
I

try
against
it

<EOS>
Do
n't
notice
me

"
<EOS>
The
light
beat
stopped
,
the
resolute
mouth
gave
way
,
and
the
fine
strong
old
face
broke
up
into
weakness
and
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
greatly
to
the
relief
of
the
visitors
,
the
emotional
Sloppy
no
sooner
beheld
his
patroness
in
this
condition
,
than
,
throwing
back
his
head
and
throwing
open
his
mouth
,
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
bellowed
.
<EOS>
This
alarming
note
of
something
wrong
instantly
terrified
Toddles
and
Poddles
,
who
were
no
sooner
heard
to
roar
surprisingly
,
than
Johnny
,
curving
himself
the
wrong
way
and
striking
out
at
Mrs.
Boffin
with
a
pair
of
indifferent
shoes
,
became
a
prey
to
despair
.
<EOS>
The
absurdity
of
the
situation
put
its
pathos
to
the
rout
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
was
herself
in
a
moment
,
and
brought
them
all
to
order
with
that
speed
,
that
Sloppy
,
stopping
short
in
a
polysyllabic
bellow
,
transferred
his
energy
to
the
mangle
,
and
had
taken
several
penitential
turns
before
he
could
be
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
there
!
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
almost
regarding
her
kind
self
as
the
most
ruthless
of
women
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
is
going
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Nobody
need
be
frightened
.
<EOS>
We
're
all
comfortable
;
ai
n't
we
,
Mrs.
Higden
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sure
and
certain
we
are
,
"
returned
Betty
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
really
is
no
hurry
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
in
a
lower
voice
.
<EOS>
"
Take
time
to
think
of
it
,
my
good
creature
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
fear
me
no
more
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Betty
;
<EOS>
"
I
thought
of
it
for
good
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
come
over
me
just
now
,
but
it
'll
never
come
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
Johnny
shall
have
more
time
to
think
of
it
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
;
"
the
pretty
child
shall
have
time
to
get
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
you
'll
get
him
more
used
to
it
,
if
you
think
well
of
it
;
wo
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
Betty
undertook
that
,
cheerfully
and
readily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
,
looking
radiantly
about
her
,
"
we
want
to
make
everybody
happy
,
not
dismal
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
And
perhaps
you
would
n't
mind
letting
me
know
<EOS>
how
used
to
it
you
begin
to
get
,
and
how
it
all
goes
on
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
send
Sloppy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Higden
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
gentleman
who
has
come
with
me
will
pay
him
for
his
trouble
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Sloppy
,
whenever
you
come
to
my
house
,
be
sure
you
never
go
away
without
having
had
a
good
dinner
of
meat
,
beer
,
vegetables
,
and
pudding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
still
further
brightened
the
face
of
affairs
;
for
,
the
highly
sympathetic
Sloppy
,
first
broadly
staring
and
grinning
,
and
then
roaring
with
laughter
,
Toddles
and
Poddles
followed
suit
,
and
Johnny
trumped
the
trick
.
<EOS>
T
and
P
considering
these
favorable
circumstances
for
the
resumption
of
that
dramatic
descent
upon
Johnny
,
again
came
across
-
country
hand
-
in
-
hand
upon
a
buccaneering
expedition
;
and
this
having
been
fought
out
in
the
chimney
corner
behind
Mrs.
Higden
's
chair
,
with
great
valour
on
both
sides
,
those
desperate
pirates
returned
hand
-
in
-
hand
to
their
stools
,
across
the
dry
bed
of
a
mountain
torrent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
tell
me
what
I
can
do
for
you
,
Betty
my
friend
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
confidentially
,
"
if
not
to
-
day
,
next
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
all
the
same
,
ma'am
,
but
I
want
nothing
for
myself
.
<EOS>
I
can
work
.
<EOS>
I
'm
strong
.
<EOS>
I
can
walk
twenty
mile
if
I
'm
put
to
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Old
Betty
was
proud
,
and
said
it
with
a
sparkle
in
her
bright
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
there
are
some
little
comforts
that
you
would
n't
be
the
worse
for
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bless
ye
,
I
was
n't
born
a
lady
any
more
than
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
,
"
said
Betty
,
smiling
,
"
that
you
were
born
a
lady
,
and
a
true
one
,
or
there
never
was
a
lady
born
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
n't
take
anything
from
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
never
did
take
anything
from
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
that
I
'm
not
grateful
,
but
I
love
to
earn
it
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
!
"
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
spoke
of
little
things
,
or
I
would
n't
have
taken
the
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Betty
put
her
visitor
's
hand
to
her
lips
,
in
acknowledgment
of
the
delicate
answer
.
<EOS>
Wonderfully
upright
her
figure
was
,
and
wonderfully
self
-
reliant
<EOS>
her
look
,
as
,
standing
facing
her
visitor
<EOS>
,
she
explained
herself
further
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
have
kept
the
dear
child
,
without
the
dread
that
's
always
upon
me
of
his
coming
to
that
fate
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
of
<EOS>
,
I
could
never
have
parted
with
him
,
even
to
you
.
<EOS>
For
I
love
him
,
I
love
him
,
I
love
him
!
<EOS>
I
love
my
husband
long
dead
and
gone
,
in
him
;
 
I
love
my
children
dead
and
gone
,
in
him
;
I
love
my
young
and
hopeful
days
dead
and
gone
,
in
him
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
sell
that
love
,
and
look
you
in
your
bright
kind
face
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
free
gift
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
want
of
nothing
.
<EOS>
When
my
strength
fails
me
,
if
I
can
but
die
out
quick
and
quiet
,
I
shall
be
quite
content
.
<EOS>
I
have
stood
between
my
dead
and
that
shame
I
have
spoken
of
,
and
it
has
been
kept
off
from
every
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Sewed
into
my
gown
,
"
with
her
hand
upon
her
breast
,
"
is
just
enough
to
lay
me
in
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Only
see
that
it
's
rightly
spent
,
so
as
I
may
rest
free
to
the
last
from
that
cruelty
and
disgrace
,
and
you
'll
have
done
much
more
than
a
little
thing
for
me
,
and
all
that
in
this
present
world
my
heart
is
set
upon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
's
visitor
pressed
her
hand
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
more
breaking
up
of
the
strong
old
face
into
weakness
.
<EOS>
My
Lords
and
Gentlemen
and
Honorable
Boards
,
it
really
was
as
composed
as
our
own
faces
,
and
almost
as
dignified
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
Johnny
was
to
be
inveigled
into
occupying
a
temporary
position
on
Mrs.
Boffin
's
lap
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
he
had
been
piqued
into
competition
with
the
two
diminutive
Minders
,
by
seeing
them
successively
raised
to
that
post
and
retire
from
it
without
injury
,
that
he
could
be
by
any
means
induced
to
leave
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
's
skirts
;
towards
which
he
exhibited
,
even
when
in
Mrs.
Boffin
's
embrace
,
strong
yearnings
,
spiritual
and
bodily
;
the
former
expressed
in
a
very
gloomy
visage
,
the
latter
in
extended
arms
.
<EOS>
However
,
a
general
description
of
the
toy
-
wonders
lurking
in
Mrs.
Boffin
's
house
,
so
far
conciliated
this
worldly
-
minded
orphan
as
to
induce
him
to
stare
at
her
frowningly
,
with
a
fist
in
his
mouth
,
and
even
at
length
to
chuckle
when
a
richly
-
caparisoned
horse
on
wheels
,
with
a
miraculous
gift
of
cantering
to
cake
-
shops
,
was
mentioned
.
<EOS>
This
sound
being
taken
up
by
the
Minders
,
swelled
into
a
rapturous
trio
which
gave
general
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
the
interview
was
considered
very
successful
,
and
Mrs.
Boffin
was
pleased
,
and
all
were
satisfied
.
<EOS>
Not
least
of
all
,
Sloppy
,
who
undertook
to
conduct
the
visitors
back
by
the
best
way
to
the
Three
Magpies
,
and
whom
the
hammer
-
headed
young
man
much
despised
.
  
<EOS>
This
piece
of
business
thus
put
in
train
,
the
Secretary
drove
Mrs.
Boffin
back
to
the
Bower
,
and
found
employment
for
himself
at
the
new
house
until
evening
.
<EOS>
Whether
,
when
evening
came
,
he
took
a
way
to
his
lodgings
that
led
through
fields
,
with
any
design
of
finding
Miss
Bella
Wilfer
in
those
fields
,
is
not
so
certain
as
that
she
regularly
walked
there
at
that
hour
.
  
<EOS>
And
,
moreover
,
it
is
certain
that
there
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
No
longer
in
mourning
,
Miss
Bella
was
dressed
in
as
pretty
colours
as
she
could
muster
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
denying
that
she
was
as
pretty
as
they
,
and
that
she
and
the
colours
went
very
prettily
together
.
<EOS>
She
was
reading
as
she
walked
,
and
of
course
it
is
to
be
inferred
,
from
her
showing
no
knowledge
of
Mr.
Rokesmith
's
approach
,
that
she
did
not
know
he
was
approaching
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
said
Miss
Bella
,
raising
her
eyes
from
her
book
,
when
he
stopped
before
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
It
's
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
I.
A
fine
evening
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
said
Bella
,
looking
coldly
round
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
is
,
now
you
mention
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
thinking
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
intent
upon
your
book
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ye
-
e
-
es
,
"
replied
Bella
,
with
a
drawl
of
indifference
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
love
story
,
Miss
Wilfer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
;
or
I
should
n't
be
reading
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
more
about
money
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
does
it
say
that
money
is
better
than
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
returned
Bella
,
"
I
forget
what
it
says
,
but
you
can
find
out
for
yourself
,
if
you
like
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
it
any
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
took
the
book
---
she
had
fluttered
the
leaves
as
if
it
were
a
fan
---
and
walked
beside
her
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
charged
with
a
message
for
you
,
Miss
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Impossible
,
I
think
!
<EOS>
"
said
Bella
,
with
another
drawl
.
  
<EOS>
"
From
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
She
desired
me
to
assure
you
of
the
pleasure
she
has
in
finding
that
she
will
be
ready
to
receive
you
in
another
week
or
two
at
furthest
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
turned
her
head
towards
him
,
with
her
prettily
-
insolent
eyebrows
raised
,
and
her
eyelids
drooping
.
<EOS>
As
much
as
to
say
,
"
How
did
you
come
by
the
message
,
pray
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
waiting
for
an
opportunity
of
telling
you
that
I
am
Mr.
Boffin
's
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
wise
as
ever
,
"
said
Miss
Bella
,
loftily
,
"
for
I
do
n't
know
what
a
Secretary
is
.
<EOS>
Not
that
it
signifies
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
covert
glance
at
her
face
,
as
he
walked
beside
her
,
showed
him
that
she
had
not
expected
his
ready
assent
to
that
proposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
are
you
going
to
be
always
there
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
,
as
if
that
would
be
a
drawback
.
  
<EOS>
"
Always
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Very
much
there
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
drawled
Bella
,
in
a
tone
of
mortification
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
my
position
there
as
Secretary
,
will
be
very
different
from
yours
as
guest
.
<EOS>
You
will
know
little
or
nothing
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
transact
the
business
:
you
will
transact
the
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
my
salary
to
earn
;
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
enjoy
and
attract
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Attract
,
sir
?
"
said
Bella
,
again
with
her
eyebrows
raised
,
and
her
eyelids
drooping
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
replying
on
this
point
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
Excuse
me
;
when
I
first
saw
you
in
your
black
dress
---
"
  
(
"
There
!
"
was
Miss
Bella
's
mental
exclamation
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
I
say
to
them
at
home
?
<EOS>
Everybody
noticed
that
ridiculous
mourning
.
"
)
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
first
saw
you
in
your
black
dress
,
I
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
that
distinction
between
yourself
and
your
family
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
was
not
impertinent
to
speculate
upon
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Miss
Bella
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
ought
to
know
best
how
you
speculated
upon
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
inclined
his
head
in
a
deprecatory
manner
,
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Since
I
have
been
entrusted
with
Mr.
Boffin
's
affairs
,
I
have
necessarily
come
to
understand
the
little
mystery
.
<EOS>
I
venture
to
remark
<EOS>
that
I
feel
persuaded
that
much
of
your
loss
may
be
repaired
.
<EOS>
I
speak
,
of
course
,
merely
of
wealth
,
Miss
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
The
loss
of
a
perfect
stranger
,
whose
worth
,
or
worthlessness
,
I
can
not
estimate
---
  
nor
you
either
---
is
beside
the
question
.
<EOS>
But
this
excellent
gentleman
and
lady
are
so
full
of
simplicity
,
so
full
of
generosity
,
so
inclined
towards
you
,
and
so
desirous
to
---
how
shall
I
express
it
?
---
to
make
amends
for
their
good
fortune
,
that
you
have
only
to
respond
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
watched
her
with
another
covert
look
,
he
saw
a
certain
ambitious
triumph
in
her
face
which
no
assumed
coldness
could
conceal
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
we
have
been
brought
under
one
roof
by
an
accidental
combination
of
circumstances
,
which
oddly
extends
itself
to
the
new
relations
before
us
,
I
have
taken
the
liberty
of
saying
these
few
words
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
consider
them
intrusive
<EOS>
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
Secretary
with
deference
.
  
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
I
ca
n't
say
what
I
consider
them
,
"
returned
the
young
lady
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
perfectly
new
to
me
,
and
may
be
founded
altogether
on
your
own
imagination
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
.
"
  
<EOS>
These
same
fields
were
opposite
the
Wilfer
premises
.
<EOS>
The
discreet
Mrs.
Wilfer
now
looking
out
of
window
and
beholding
her
daughter
in
conference
with
her
lodger

instantly
tied
up
her
head
and
came
out
for
a
casual
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
telling
Miss
Wilfer
,
"
said
John
Rokesmith
,
as
the
majestic
lady
came
stalking
up
,
"
that
I
have
become
,
by
a
curious
chance
,
Mr.
Boffin
's
Secretary
or
man
of
business
.

<EOS>
"
I
have
not

returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
waving
her
gloves
in
her
chronic
state
of
dignity
,
and
vague
ill
-
usage
,
"
the
honor
of
any
intimate
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Boffin

and
it
is
not
for
me
to
congratulate
that
gentleman
on
the
acquisition
he
has
made

<EOS>
"
A
poor
one
enough

said
Rokesmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
the
merits
of
Mr.
Boffin
may
be
highly
distinguished
---
<EOS>
may
be
more
distinguished
than
the
countenance
of
Mrs.
Boffin
would
imply
---
but
it
were
the
insanity
of
humility
to
deem
him
worthy
of
a
better
assistant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
.
<EOS>
I
have
also
been
telling
Miss
Wilfer
that
she
is
expected
very
shortly
at
the
new
residence
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Having
tacitly
consented
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
a
grand
shrug
of
her
shoulders
,
and
another
wave
of
her
gloves
,
"
to
my
child
's
acceptance
of
the
proffered
attentions
of
Mrs.
Boffin
<EOS>
,
I
interpose
no
objection

"
  
<EOS>
Here
Miss
Bella
offered
the
remonstrance
:
"
Do
n't
talk
nonsense
,
ma

please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Peace

"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
  
<EOS>
"
No

ma

I
am
not
going
to
be
made
so
absurd

<EOS>
Interposing
objections

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
repeated
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
a
vast
access
of
grandeur
,
"
that
I
am
not
going
to
interpose
objections
.
<EOS>
If
Mrs.
Boffin
(
to
whose
countenance
no
disciple
of
Lavater
could
possibly
for
a
single
moment
subscribe

,
"
with
a
shiver
,
"
seeks
to
illuminate
her
new
residence
in
town
with
the
attractions
of
a
child
of
mine
,
I
am
content
that
she
should
be
favoured
by
the
company
of
a
child
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
use
the
word
,
ma'am
,
<EOS>
I
have
myself
used
,
"
said
Rokesmith
,
with
a
glance
at
Bella
,
"
when
you
speak
of
Miss
Wilfer
's
attractions
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me

returned
Mrs.

,
with
dreadful
solemnity

I
had
not
finished

<EOS>
"
Pray
excuse
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
say
,
"
pursued
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
who
clearly
had
not
had
the
faintest
idea
of
saying
anything
more
:
"
that
when
I
use
the
term
attractions
,
I
do
so
with
the
qualification
that
I
do
not
mean
it
in
any
way
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
excellent
lady
delivered
this
luminous
elucidation
of
her
views
with
an
air
of
greatly
obliging
her
hearers
,
and
greatly
distinguishing
herself
.
<EOS>
Whereat
Miss
Bella
laughed
a
scornful
little
laugh
and
said
:
  
"
Quite
enough
about
this

I
am
sure
,
on
all
sides

<EOS>
Have
the
goodness
,
Mr.

,
to
give
my
love
to
Mrs.

"
Pardon
me

<EOS>
cried
Mrs.

"
Compliments

<EOS>
"
Love

<EOS>
repeated
Bella
,
with
a
little
stamp
of
her
foot

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
monotonously
.
"
<EOS>
Compliments

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
Say
Miss
Wilfer
's
love
,
and
Mrs.

's
compliments
,

the
Secretary
proposed
,
as
a
compromise
.

<EOS>
"
And
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
come
when

is
ready

<EOS>
The

the
better

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
last
word
,
Bella
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
before
descending
to
the
family
apartment
.
<EOS>
I
trust
that
as
a
child
of
mine
you
will
ever
be
sensible
that
it
will
be
graceful
in
you
,
when
associating
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
upon
equal
terms
,
to
remember
that
the
Secretary
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
as
your
father
's
lodger
,
has
a
claim
on
your
good
word
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
condescension
with
which
Mrs.
Wilfer
delivered
this
proclamation
of
patronage
,
was
as
wonderful
as
the
swiftness
with
which
the
lodger
had
lost
caste
in
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
as
the
mother
retired
down
stairs
;
but
his
face
fell
,
as
the
daughter
followed
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
insolent

so
trivial

so
capricious

so
mercenary

so
careless

so
hard

touch

so
hard

<EOS>
he
said
,
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
And
added
as
he
went
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
so
pretty

so
pretty

"
  
<EOS>
And
added
presently
,
as
he
walked
to
and
fro
in
his
room
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
she
knew
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
knew
that
he
was
shaking
the
house
by
his
walking
to
and
fro
;
and
she
declared
it
another
of
the
miseries
of
being
poor

that
you
could
n't
get
rid
of
a
haunting

Foremost

My
Dear
Sir
,
---
Having
consented
to
preside
at
the
forthcoming
Annual
Dinner
of
the
Family
Party
Fund
,
and
feeling
deeply
impressed
with
the
immense
usefulness
of
that
noble
Institution
and
the
great
importance
of
its
being
supported
by
a
List
of
Stewards
that
shall
prove
to
the
public
the
interest
taken
in
it
by
popular
and
distinguished
men
,
I
have
undertaken
to
ask
you
to
become
a
Steward
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
Soliciting
your
favorable
reply
before
the
14th
instant
,
I
am
,
My
Dear
Sir
,
Your
faithful
Servant
,
Linseed
.
<EOS>
P.S.
<EOS>
The
Steward
's
fee
is
limited
to
three
Guineas
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Friendly
this
,
on
the
part
of
the
Duke
of
Linseed
(
and
thoughtful
in
the
postscript
)
,
only
lithographed
by
the
hundred
and
presenting
but
a
pale
individuality
of
address
to
Nicodemus
Boffin
,
Esquire
,
in
quite
another
hand
.
<EOS>
It
takes
two
noble
Earls
and
a
Viscount
,
combined
,
to
inform
Nicodemus
Boffin
,
Esquire
,
in
an
equally
flattering
manner
,
that
an
estimable
lady
in
the
West
of
England
has
offered
to
present
a
purse
containing
twenty
pounds
,
to
the
Society
for
Granting
Annuities
to
Unassuming
Members
of
the
Middle
Classes
,
if
twenty
individuals
will
previously
present
purses
of
one
hundred
pounds
each
.
<EOS>
And
those
benevolent
noblemen
very
kindly
point
out
that
if
Nicodemus
Boffin
,
Esquire
,
should
wish
to
present
two
or
more
purses
,
it
will
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
design
of
the
estimable
lady
in
the
West
of
England
,
provided
each
purse
be
coupled
with
the
name
of
some
member
of
his
honored
and
respected
family
.
  
<EOS>
These
are
the
corporate
beggars
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
,
besides
,
the
individual
beggars
;
and
how
does
the
heart
of
the
Secretary
fail
him
when
he
has
to
cope
with
them
!
<EOS>
And
they
must
be
coped
with
to
some
extent
,
because
they
all
enclose
documents
(
they
call
their
scraps
documents
;
but
they
are
,
as
to
papers
deserving
the
name
,
what
minced
veal
is
to
a
calf
)
,
the
non
-
return
of
which
would
be
their
ruin
.
<EOS>
That
is
say
,
they
are
utterly
ruined
now
,
but
they
would
be
more
utterly
ruined
then
.
<EOS>
Among
these
correspondents
are
several
daughters
of
general
officers
,
long
accustomed
to
every
luxury
of
life
(
except
spelling
)
,
who
little
thought
,
when
their
gallant
fathers
waged
war
in
the
Peninsula
,
that
they
would
ever
have
to
appeal
to
those
whom
Providence
,
in
its
inscrutable
wisdom
,
has
blessed
with
untold
gold
,
and
from
among
whom
they
select
the
name
of
Nicodemus
Boffin
,
Esquire
,
for
a
maiden
effort
in
this
wise
,
understanding
that
he
has
such
a
heart
as
never
was
.
<EOS>
The
Secretary
learns
,
too
,
that
confidence
between
man
and
wife
would
seem
to
obtain
but
rarely
when
virtue
is
in
distress
,
so
numerous
are
the
wives
who
take
up
their
pens
to
ask
Mr.
Boffin
for
money
without
the
knowledge
of
their
devoted
husbands
,
who
would
never
permit
it
;
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
so
numerous
are
the
husbands
who
take
up
their
pens
to
ask
Mr.
Boffin
for
money
without
the
knowledge
of
their
devoted
wives
,
who
would
instantly
go
out
of
their
senses
if
they
had
the
least
suspicion
of
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
There
are
the
inspired
beggars
,
too
.
<EOS>
These
were
sitting
,
only
yesterday
evening
,
musing
over
a
fragment
of
candle
which
must
soon
go
out
and
leave
them
in
the
dark
for
the
rest
of
their
nights
,
when
surely
some
Angel
whispered
the
name
of
Nicodemus
Boffin
,
Esquire
,
to
their
souls
,
imparting
rays
of
hope
,
nay
confidence
,
to
which
they
had
long
been
strangers
!
<EOS>
Akin
to
these
are
the
suggestively

befriended
beggars

They
were
partaking
of

flickering

gloomy
light

There

These

ever
regarded
gold
as
dross

have
not

got
over

they

No

Mr.

<EOS>

the

may
term
it

paltry

the

count
on
being
despised
by
these

<EOS>
There
are
the
beggars
of
punctual
business

<EOS>
These

There
are
the
beggars
on
horseback
too

in
another
sense
from

These
are

The

the

their

the

some
special

a

they

Birds

<EOS>
OF
AN
EDUCATIONAL
CHARACTER
.
 
<EOS>
The
school
at
which
young
Charley
Hexam
had
first
learned
from
a
book
---
the
streets
being
,
for
pupils
of
his
degree
,
the
great
Preparatory
Establishment
in
which
very
much
that
is
never
unlearned
is
learned
without
and
before
book
---
was
a
miserable
loft
in
an
unsavoury
yard
.
<EOS>
Its
atmosphere
was
oppressive
and
disagreeable
;
 
it
was
crowded
,
noisy
,
and
confusing
;
half
the
pupils
dropped
asleep
,
or
fell
into
a
state
of
waking
stupefaction
;
the
other
half
kept
them
in
either
condition
by
maintaining
a
monotonous
droning
noise
,
as
if
they
were
performing
,
out
of
time
and
tune
,
on
a
ruder
sort
of
bagpipe
.
<EOS>
The
teachers
,
animated
solely
by
good
intentions
,
had
no
idea
of
execution
,
and
a
lamentable
jumble
was
the
upshot
of
their
kind
endeavours
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
school
for
all
ages
,
and
for
both
sexes
.
<EOS>
The
latter
were
kept
apart
,
and
the
former
were
partitioned
off
into
square
assortments
.
<EOS>
But
,
all
the
place
was
pervaded
by
a
grimly
ludicrous
pretence
that
every
pupil
was
childish
and
innocent
.
<EOS>
This
pretence
,
much
favoured
by
the
lady
-
visitors
,
led
to
the
ghastliest
absurdities
.
<EOS>
Young
women
old
in
the
vices
of
the
commonest
and
worst
life
,
were
expected
to
profess
themselves
enthralled
by
the
good
child
's
book
,
the
Adventures
of
Little
Margery
,
who
resided
in
the
village
cottage
by
the
mill
;
severely
reproved
and
morally
squashed
the
miller
,
when
she
was
five
and
he
was
fifty
;
divided
her
porridge
with
singing
birds
;
denied
herself
a
new
nankeen
bonnet
,
on
the
ground
that
the
turnips
did
not
wear
nankeen
bonnets
,
neither
did
the
sheep
who
ate
them
;
who
plaited
straw
and
delivered
the
dreariest
orations
to
all
comers
,
at
all
sorts
of
unseasonable
times
.
<EOS>
So
,
unwieldy
young
dredgers
and
hulking
mudlarks
were
referred
to
the
experiences
of
Thomas
Twopence
,
who
,
having
resolved
not
to
rob
(
under
circumstances
of
uncommon
atrocity
)
his
particular
friend
and
benefactor
,
of
eighteenpence
,
presently
came
into
supernatural
possession
of
three
and
sixpence
,
and
lived
a
shining
light
ever
afterwards
.
<EOS>
(
Note
,
that
the
benefactor
came
to
no
good
.
)
<EOS>
Several
swaggering
sinners
had
written
their
own
biographies
in
the
same
strain
;
it
always
appearing
from
the
lessons
of
those
very
boastful
persons
,
that
you
were
to
do
good
,
not
because
it
was
good
,
but
because
you
were
to
make
a
good
thing
of
it
.
<EOS>
Contrariwise
,
the
adult
pupils
were
taught
to
read
(
if
they
could
learn
)
out
of
the
New
Testament
;
and
by
dint
of
stumbling
over
the
syllables
and
keeping
their
bewildered
eyes
on
the
particular
syllables
coming
round
to
their
turn
,
were
as
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
sublime
history
,
as
if
they
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
An
exceedingly
and
confoundingly
perplexing
jumble
of
a
school
,
in
fact
,
where
black
spirits
and
grey
,
red
spirits
and
white
,
jumbled
jumbled
jumbled
jumbled
,
jumbled
every
night
.
<EOS>
And
particularly
every
Sunday
night
.
<EOS>
For
then
,
an
inclined
plane
of
unfortunate
infants
would
be
handed
over
to
the
prosiest
and
worst
of
all
the
teachers
with
good
intentions
,
whom
nobody
older
would
endure
.
<EOS>
Who
,
taking
his
stand
on
the
floor
before
them
as
chief
executioner
,
would
be
attended
by
a
conventional
volunteer
boy
as
executioner
's
assistant
.
<EOS>
When
and
where
it
first
became
the
conventional
system
that
a
weary
or
inattentive
infant
in
a
class
must
have
its
face
smoothed
downward
with
a
hot
hand
,
or
when
and
where
the
conventional
volunteer
boy
first
beheld
such
system
in
operation
,
and
became
inflamed
with
a
sacred
zeal
to
administer
it
,
matters
not
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
function
of
the
chief
executioner
to
hold
forth
,
and
it
was
the
function
of
the
acolyte
to
dart
at
sleeping
infants
,
yawning
infants
,
restless
infants
,
whimpering
infants
,
and
smooth
their
wretched
faces
;
sometimes
with
one
hand
,
as
if
he
were
anointing
them
for
a
whisker
;
sometimes
with
both
hands
,
applied
after
the
fashion
of
blinkers
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
jumble
would
be
in
action
in
this
department
for
a
mortal
hour
;
the
exponent
drawling
on
to
My
Dearerr
Childerrenerr
,
let
us
say
,
for
example
,
about
the
beautiful
coming
to
the
Sepulchre
;
and
repeating
the
word
Sepulchre
(
commonly
used
among
infants
)
five
hundred
times
,
and
never
once
hinting
what
it
meant
;
the
conventional
boy
smoothing
away
right
and
left
,
as
an
infallible
commentary
;
the
whole
hot
-
bed
of
flushed
and
exhausted
infants
exchanging
measles
,
rashes
,
whooping
-
cough
,
fever
,
and
stomach
disorders
,
as
if
they
were
assembled
in
High
Market
for
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
Even
in
this
temple
of
good
intentions
,
an
exceptionally
sharp
boy
exceptionally
determined
to
learn
,
could
learn
something
,
and
,
having
learned
it
,
could
impart
it
much
better
than
the
teachers
;
 
as
being
more
knowing
than
they
,
and
not
at
the
disadvantage
in
which
they
stood
towards
the
shrewder
pupils
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
it
had
come
about
that
Charley
Hexam
had
risen
in
the
jumble
,
taught
in
the
jumble
,
and
been
received
from
the
jumble
into
a
better
school
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
want
to
go
and
see
your
sister
,
Hexam
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
Mr.
Headstone

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
half
a
mind
to
go
with

.
<EOS>
Where
does
your

live
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
is
not
settled
yet
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
I
'd
<EOS>
rather
you
did
n't
see
her
till
she
is
settled
,
if
it
was
all
the
same

you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Hexam
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Bradley
Headstone
,
highly
certificated
stipendiary
schoolmaster
,
drew
his
right
forefinger
through
one
of
the
buttonholes
of
the
boy
's
coat
,
and
looked
at
it
attentively
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
your
sister
may
be
good
company
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
doubt
it
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
say
I
doubted
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
;
you
did
n't
say
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
Bradley
Headstone
looked
at
his
finger
again
,
took
it
out
of
the
buttonhole
and
looked
at
it
closer
,
bit
the
side
of
it
and
looked
at
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Hexam
,
you
will
be
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
In
good
time
you
are
sure
to
pass
a
creditable
examination
and
become
one
of
us
.
<EOS>
Then
the
question
is
---
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
waited
so
long
for
the
question
,
while
the
schoolmaster
looked
at
a
new
side
of
his
finger
,
and
bit
it
,
and
looked
at
it
again
,
that
at
length
the
boy
repeated
:
  
"
The
question
is
,
sir
---
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Whether
you
had
not
better
leave
well
alone
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Is
it
well
to
leave
my
sister
alone
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
say
so
,
because
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
put
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
to
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
consider
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
well
you
are
doing
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
she
got
me
here
,
"
said
the
boy
,
with
a
struggle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perceiving
the
necessity
of
it
,
"
acquiesced
the
schoolmaster
,
"
and
making
up
her
mind
fully
to
the
separation
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
,
with
a
return
of
that
former
reluctance
or
struggle
or
whatever
it
was
,
seemed
to
debate
with
himself
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
said
,
raising
his
eyes
to
the
master
's
face
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
'd
come
with
me
and
see
her
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
though
she
is
not
settled
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
'd
come
with
me
,
and
take
her
in
the
rough
,
and
judge
her
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
you
would
not
like
,
"
asked
the
schoolmaster
,
"
to
prepare
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
Lizzie
,
"
said
the
boy
,
proudly
,
"
wants
no
preparing
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
What
she
is
,
she
is
,
and
shows
herself
to
be
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
pretending
about
my
sister
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
confidence
in
her
,
sat
more
easily
upon
him
than
the
indecision
with
which
he
had
twice
contended
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
better
nature
to
be
true
to
her
,
if
it
were
his
worse
nature
to
be
wholly
selfish
.
<EOS>
And
as
yet
the
better
nature
had
the
stronger
hold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
can
spare
the
evening
,
"
said
the
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
to
walk
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
ready
to
go

"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
,
in
his
decent
black
coat
and
waistcoat
,
and
decent
white
shirt
,
and
decent
formal
black
tie
,
and
decent
pantaloons
of
pepper
and
salt
,
with
his
decent
silver
watch
in
his
pocket
and
its
decent
hair
-
guard
round
his
neck
,
looked
a
thoroughly
decent
young
man
of
six
-
and
-
twenty
.
<EOS>
He
was
never
seen
in
any
other
dress
,
and
yet
there
was
a
certain
stiffness
in
his
manner
of
wearing
this
,
as
if
there
were
a
want
of
adaptation
between
him
and
it
,
recalling
some
mechanics
in
their
holiday
clothes
.
<EOS>
He
had
acquired
mechanically
a
great
store
of
teacher
's
knowledge
.
<EOS>
He
could
do
mental
arithmetic
mechanically
,
sing
at
sight
mechanically
,
blow
various
wind
instruments
mechanically
,
even
play
the
great
church
organ
mechanically
.
<EOS>
From
his
early
childhood
up
,
his
mind
had
been
a
place
of
mechanical
stowage
.
<EOS>
The
arrangement
of
his
wholesale
warehouse
,
so
that
it
might
be
always
ready
to
meet
the
demands
of
retail
dealers
---
history
here
,
geography
there
,
astronomy
to
the
right
,
political
economy
to
the
left
---
natural
history
,
the
physical
sciences
,
figures
,
music
,
the
lower
mathematics
,
and
what
not
,
all
in
their
several
places
---
this
care
had
imparted
to
his
countenance
a
look
of
care
;
while
the
habit
of
questioning
and
being
questioned
had
given
him
a
suspicious
manner
,
or
a
manner
that
would
be
better
described
as
one
of
lying
in
wait
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
kind
of
settled
trouble
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
face
belonging
to
a
naturally
slow
or
inattentive
intellect
that
had
toiled
hard
to
get
what
it
had
won
,
and
that
had
to
hold
it
now
that
it
was
gotten
.
<EOS>
He
always
seemed
to
be
uneasy
lest
anything
should
be
missing
from
his
mental
warehouse
,
and
taking
stock
to
assure
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Suppression
of
so
much
to
make
room
for
so
much
,
had
given
him
a
constrained
manner
,
over
and
above
.
<EOS>
Yet
there
was
enough
of
what
was
animal
,
and
of
what
was
fiery
(
though
smouldering
)
,
still
visible
in
him
,
to
suggest
that
if
young
Bradley
Headstone
,
when
a
pauper
lad
,
had
chanced
to
be
told
off
for
the
sea
,
he
would
not
have
been
the
last
man
in
a
ship
's
crew
.
<EOS>
Regarding
that
origin
of
his
,
he
was
proud
,
moody
,
and
sullen
,
desiring
it
to
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
And
few
people
knew
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
In
some
visits
to
the
Jumble
his
attention
had
been
attracted
to
this
boy
Hexam
.
<EOS>
An
undeniable
boy
for
a
pupil
-
teacher
;
an
undeniable
boy
to
do
credit
to
the
master
who
should
bring
him
on
.
<EOS>
Combined
with
this
consideration
,
there
may
have
been
some
thought
of
the
pauper
lad
now
never
to
be
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Be
that
how
it
might
,
he
had
with
pains
gradually
worked
the
boy
into
his
own
school
,
and
procured
him
some
offices
to
discharge
there
,
which
were
repaid
with
food
and
lodging
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
circumstances
that
had
brought
together
,
Bradley
Headstone
and
young
Charley
Hexam
that
autumn
evening
.
<EOS>
Autumn
,
because
full
half
a
year
had
come
and
gone
since
the
bird
of
prey
lay
dead
upon
the
river
-
shore
.
  
<EOS>
The
schools
---
for
they
were
twofold
,
as
the
sexes
---
were
down
in
that
district
of
the
flat
country
tending
to
the
Thames
,
where
Kent
and
Surrey
meet
,
and
where
the
railways
still
bestride
the
market
-
gardens
that
will
soon
die
under
them
.
<EOS>
The
schools
were
newly
built
,
and
there
were
so
many
like
them
all
over
the
country
,
that
one
might
have
thought
the
whole
were
but
one
restless
edifice
with
the
locomotive
gift
of
Aladdin
's
palace
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
a
neighbourhood
which
looked
like
a
toy
neighbourhood
taken
in
blocks
out
of
a
box
by
a
child
of
particularly
incoherent
mind
,
and
set
up
anyhow
;
here
,
one
side
of
a
new
street
;
there
,
a
large
solitary
public
-
house
facing
nowhere
;
here
,
another
unfinished
street
already
in
ruins
;
there
,
a
church
;
here
,
an
immense
new
warehouse
;
there
,
a
dilapidated
old
country
villa
;
then
,
a
medley
of
black
ditch
,
sparkling
cucumber
-
frame
,
rank
field
,
richly
cultivated
kitchen
-
garden
,
brick
viaduct
,
arch
-
spanned
canal
,
and
disorder
of
frowziness
and
fog
.
<EOS>
As
if
the
child
had
given
the
table
a
kick
,
and
gone
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
even
among
school
-
buildings
,
school
-
teachers
,
and
school
-
pupils
,
all
according
to
pattern
and
all
engendered
in
the
light
of
the
latest
Gospel
according
to
Monotony
,
the
older
pattern
into
which
so
many
fortunes
have
been
shaped
for
good
and
evil
,
comes
out
.
<EOS>
It
came
out
in
Miss
Peecher
the
schoolmistress
,
watering
her
flowers
,
as
Mr.
Bradley
Headstone
walked
forth
.
<EOS>
It
came
out
in
Miss
Peecher
the
schoolmistress
,
watering
the
flowers
in
the
little
dusty
bit
of
garden
attached
to
her
small
official
residence
,
with
little
windows
like
the
eyes
in
needles
,
and
little
doors
like
the
covers
of
school
books
.
  
<EOS>
Small
,
shining
,
neat
,
methodical
,
and
buxom
was
Miss
Peecher
cherry
-
cheeked
and
tuneful
of
voice
.
<EOS>
A
little
pincushion
,
a
little
housewife
,
a
little
book
,
a
little
workbox
,
a
little
set
of
tables
and
weights
and
measures
,
and
a
little
woman
,
all
in
one
.
<EOS>
She
could
write
a
little
essay
on
any
subject
,
exactly
a
slate
long
,
beginning
at
the
left
-
hand
top
of
one
side
and
ending
at
the
right
-
hand
bottom
of
the
other
,
and
the
essay
should
be
strictly
according
to
rule
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Bradley
Headstone
had
addressed
a
written
proposal
of
marriage
to
her
,
she
would
probably
have
replied
in
a
complete
little
essay
on
the
theme
exactly
a
slate
long
,
but
would
certainly
have
replied
Yes
.
<EOS>
For
she
loved
him
.
<EOS>
The
decent
hair
-
guard
that
went
round
his
neck
and
took
care
of
his
decent
silver
watch
was
an
object
of
envy
to
her
.
<EOS>
So
would
Miss
Peecher
have
gone
round
his
neck
and
taken
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
Of
him
,
insensible
.
<EOS>
Because
he
did
not
love
Miss
Peecher
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Peecher
's
favourite
pupil
,
who
assisted
her
in
her
little
household
,
was
in
attendance
with
a
can
of
water
to
replenish
her
little
watering
-
pot
,
and
sufficiently
divined
the
state
of
Miss
Peecher
's
affections
to
feel
it
necessary
that
she
herself
should
love
young
Charley
Hexam
.
<EOS>
So
,
there
was
a
double
palpitation
among
the
double
stocks
and
double
wall
-
flowers
,
when
the
master
and
the
boy
looked
over
the
little
gate
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
fine
evening
,
Miss
Peecher
,
"
said
the
Master
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
fine
evening
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
"
said
Miss
Peecher
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
taking
a
walk
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hexam
and
I
are
going
to
take
a
long
walk
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Charming
weather
,
"
remarked
Miss
Peecher
,
"
for
a
long
walk
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Ours
is
rather
on
business
than
mere
pleasure
,
"
said
the
Master
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Peecher
inverting
her
watering
-
pot
,
and
very
carefully
shaking
out
the
few
last
drops
over
a
flower
,
as
if
there
were
some
special
virtue
in
them
which
would
make
it
a
Jack
's
beanstalk
before
morning
,
called
for
replenishment
to
her
pupil
,
who
had
been
speaking
to
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
Miss
Peecher
,
"
said
the
Master
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
"
said
the
Mistress
.
  
<EOS>
The
pupil
had
been
,
in
her
state
of
pupilage
,
so
imbued
with
the
class
-
custom
of
stretching
out
an
arm
,
as
if
to
hail
a
cab
or
omnibus
,
whenever
she
found
she
had
an
observation
on
hand
to
offer
to
Miss
Peecher
,
that
she
often
did
it
in
their
domestic
relations
;
and
she
did
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mary
Anne
?
"
said
Miss
Peecher
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
ma'am
,
Hexam
said
they
were
going
to
see
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
that
ca
n't
be
,
I
think
,
"
returned
Miss
Peecher
:
"
because
Mr.
Headstone
can
have
no
business
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
Anne
again
hailed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mary
Anne
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
ma'am
,
perhaps
it
's
Hexam
's
business
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
may
be
,
"
said
Miss
Peecher
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
Not
that
it
matters
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
Anne
again
hailed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mary
Anne
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
she
's
very
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mary
Anne
,
Mary
Anne
!
"
returned
Miss
Peecher
,
slightly
colouring
and
shaking
her
head
,
a
little
out
of
humour
;
"
how
often
have
I
told
you
not
to
use
that
vague
expression
,
not
to
speak
in
that
general
way
?
<EOS>
When
you
say
they
say
,
what
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
Part
of
speech
They
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
Anne
hooked
her
right
arm
behind
her
in
her
left
hand
,
as
being
under
examination
,
and
replied
:
  
"
Personal
pronoun
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Person
,
They
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Third
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Number
,
They
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Plural
number
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
how
many
do
you
mean
,
Mary
Anne
?
<EOS>
Two
?
<EOS>
Or
more
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Mary
Anne
,
disconcerted
now
<EOS>
she
came
to
think
of
it
;
"
but
I
do
n't
know
that
I
mean
more
than
her
brother
himself
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
said
it
,
she
unhooked
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
felt
convinced
of
it
,
"
returned
Miss
Peecher
,
smiling
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
pray
,
Mary
Anne
,
be
careful
another
time
.
<EOS>
He
says
is
very
different
from
they
say
,
remember
.
<EOS>
Difference
between
<EOS>
he
says
and
they
say
?
<EOS>
Give
it
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
Anne
immediately
hooked
her
right
arm
behind
her
in
her
left
hand
---
an
attitude
absolutely
necessary
to
the
situation
---
and
replied
:
"
One
is
indicative
mood
,
present
tense
,
third
person
singular
,
verb
active
to
say
.
<EOS>
Other
is
indicative
mood
,
present
tense
,
third
person
plural
,
verb
active
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
verb
active
,
Mary
Anne
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
it
takes
a
pronoun
after
it
in
the
objective
case
,
Miss
Peecher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
indeed
,
"
remarked
Miss
Peecher
,
with
encouragement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
fact
,
could
not
be
better
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
forget
to
apply
it
,
another
time
,
Mary
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
said
,
Miss
Peecher
finished
the
watering
of
her
flowers
,
and
went
into
her
little
official
residence
,
and
took
a
refresher
of
the
principal
rivers
and
mountains
of
the
world
,
their
breadths
,
depths
,
and
heights
,
before
settling
the
measurements
of
the
body
of
a
dress
for
her
own
personal
occupation
.
  
<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
and
Charley
Hexam
duly
got
to
the
Surrey
side
of
Westminster
Bridge
,
and
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
made
along
the
Middlesex
shore
towards
Millbank
.
<EOS>
In
this
region
are
a
certain
little
street
called
Church
Street
,
and
a
certain
little
blind
square
,
called
Smith
Square
,
in
the
centre
of
which
last
retreat
is
a
very
hideous
church
with
four
towers
at
the
four
corners
,
generally
resembling
some
petrified
monster
,
frightful
and
gigantic
,
on
its
back
with
its
legs
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
They
found
a
tree
near
by
in
a
corner
,
and
a
blacksmith
's
forge
,
and
a
timber
yard
,
and
a
dealer
's
in
old
iron
.
<EOS>
What
a
rusty
portion
of
a
boiler
and
a
great
iron
wheel
or
so
meant
by
lying
half
-
buried
in
the
dealer
's
fore
-
court
,
nobody
seemed
to
know
or
to
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
Like
the
Miller
of
questionable
jollity
in
the
song
,
They
cared
for
Nobody
,
no
not
they
,
and
Nobody
cared
for
them
.
<EOS>
After
making
the
round
of
this
place
,
and
noting
that
there
was
a
deadly
kind
of
repose
on
it
,
more
as
though
it
had
taken
laudanum
than
fallen
into
a
natural
rest
,
they
stopped
at
the
point
where
the
street
and
the
square
joined
,
and
where
there
were
some
little
quiet
houses
in
a
row
.
<EOS>
To
these
Charley
Hexam
finally
led
the
way
,
and
at
one
-
of
these
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
must
be
where
my
sister
lives
,
sir
.
<EOS>
This
is
where
she
came
for
a
temporary
lodging
,
soon
after
father
's
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
often
have
you
seen
her
since
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
only
twice
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
boy
,
with
his
former
reluctance
;
"
but
that
's
as
much
her
doing
as
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
does
she
support
herself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
always
a
fair
needlewoman
,
and
she
keeps
the
stockroom
of
a
seaman
's
outfitter
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Does
she
ever
work
at
her
own
lodging
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sometimes
;
but
her
regular
hours
and
regular
occupation
are
at
their
place
of
business
,
I
believe
,
sir
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
number
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
knocked
at
a
door
,
and
the
door
promptly
opened
with
a
spring
and
a
click
.
<EOS>
A
parlour
door
within
a
small
entry
stood
open
,
and
disclosed
a
child
---
a
dwarf
---
a
something
---
sitting
on
a
little
low
old
-
fashioned
arm
-
chair
,
which
had
a
kind
of
little
working
bench
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
get
up
,
"
said
the
child
,
"
because
my
back
's
bad
,
and
my
legs
are
queer
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
the
person
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
else
is
at
home
?
"
asked
Charley
Hexam
,
staring
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
's
at
home
at
present
,
"
returned
the
child
,
with
a
glib
assertion
of
her
dignity
,
"
except
the
person
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
What
did
you
want
,
young
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
to
see
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Many
young
men
have
sisters
,
"
returned
the
child
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
your
name
,
young
man
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
queer
little
figure
,
and
the
queer
but
not
ugly
little
face
,
with
its
bright
grey
eyes
,
were
so
sharp
,
that
the
sharpness
of
the
manner
seemed
unavoidable
.
<EOS>
As
if
,
being
turned
out
of
that
mould
,
it
must
be
sharp
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hexam
is
my
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
indeed
?
"
said
the
person
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
might
be
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
will
be
in

in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour

<EOS>
I
am
very
fond

your
sister
.
<EOS>
She
's
my
particular
friend
.
<EOS>
Take
a
seat
.
<EOS>
And
this
gentleman
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Headstone
,
my
schoolmaster
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
a
seat
.
<EOS>
And
would
you
please
to
shut
the
street
door
first
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
very
well
do
it
myself
,
because
my
back
's
so
bad
,
and
my
legs
are
so
queer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
complied
in
silence
,
and
the
little
figure
went
on
with
its
work
of
gumming
or
gluing
together
with
a
camel's
-
hair
brush
certain
pieces
of
cardboard
and
thin
wood
,
previously
cut
into
various
shapes
.
<EOS>
The
scissors
and
knives
upon
the
bench
showed
that
the
child
herself
had
cut
them
;
and
the
bright
scraps
of
velvet
and
silk
and
ribbon
also
strewn
upon
the
bench
<EOS>
showed
that
when
duly
stuffed
(
and
stuffing
too
was
there
)
<EOS>
,
she
was
to
cover
them
smartly
.
<EOS>
The
dexterity
of
her
nimble
fingers
was
remarkable
,
and
,
as
she
brought
two
thin
edges
accurately
together
by
giving
them
a
little
bite
,
she
would
glance
at
the
visitors
out
of
the
corners
of
her
grey
eyes
with
a
look
that
out
-
sharpened
all
her
other
sharpness
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
tell
me
the
name
of
my
trade
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
"
she
said
,
after
taking
several
of
these
observations
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
make
pincushions
,
"
said
Charley
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
else
do
I
make
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pen
-
wipers
,
"
said
Bradley
Headstone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
ha
!
<EOS>
What
else
do
I
make
?
<EOS>
You
're
a
schoolmaster
,
but
you
ca
n't
tell
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
something
,
"
he
returned
,
pointing
to
a
corner
of
the
little
bench
,
"
with
straw
;
but
I
do
n't
know
what
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
done
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
person
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
make
pincushions
and
pen
-
wipers
,
to
use
up
my
waste
.
<EOS>
But
my
straw
really
does
belong
to
my
business
.
<EOS>
Try
again
.
<EOS>
What
do
I
make
with
my
straw
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dinner
-
mats
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
schoolmaster
,
and
says
dinner
-
mats
!
<EOS>
I
'll
give
you
a
clue
to
my
trade
,
in
a
game
of
forfeits
.
<EOS>
I
love
my
love
with
a
B
because
she
's
Beautiful
;
I
hate
my
love
with
a
B
because
she
is
Brazen
;
I
took
her
to
the
sign
of
the
Blue
Boar
,
and
I
treated
her
with
Bonnets
;
 
her
name
's
Bouncer
,
and
she
lives
in
Bedlam
.
<EOS>
---
Now
,
what
do
I
make
with
my
straw
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ladies
'
bonnets
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fine
ladies
'
,
"
said
the
person
of
the
house
,
nodding
assent
.
<EOS>
"
Dolls
'
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
Doll
's
Dressmaker
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
's
a
good
business
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
person
of
the
house
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
shook
her
head
.
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Poorly
paid
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
often
so
pressed
for
time
!
<EOS>
I
had
a
doll
married
,
last
week
,
and
was
obliged
to
work
all
night
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
not
good
for
me
,
on
account
of
my
back
being
so
bad
and
<EOS>
my
legs
so
queer
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
looked
at
the
little
creature
with
a
wonder
that
did
not
diminish
,
and
the
schoolmaster
said
:
"
I
am
sorry
<EOS>
your
fine
ladies
are
so
inconsiderate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
way
with
them
,
"
said
the
person
of
the
house
,
shrugging
her
shoulders
again
.
<EOS>
"
And
they
take
no
care
of
their
clothes
,
and
they
never
keep
to
the
same
fashions
a
month
.
<EOS>
I
work
for
a
doll
with
three
daughters
.
<EOS>
Bless
you
,
she
's
enough
to
ruin
her
husband
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
person
of
the
house
gave
a
weird
little
laugh
here
,
and
gave
them
another
look
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
had
an
elfin
chin
that
was
capable
of
great
expression
;
and
whenever
she
gave
this
look
,
she
hitched
this
chin
up
.
<EOS>
As
if
her
eyes
and
her
chin
worked
together
on
the
same
wires
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
always
as
busy
as
you
are
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Busier
.
<EOS>
I
'm
slack
just
now
.
<EOS>
I
finished
a
large
mourning
order
the
day
before
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Doll
I
work
for
,
lost
a
canary
-
bird
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
person
of
the
house
gave
another
little
laugh
,
and
then
nodded
her
head
several
times
,
as
who
should
moralize
,
"
Oh
this
world
,
this
world
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
alone
all
day
?
"
asked
Bradley
Headstone
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
any
of
the
neighbouring
children
---
?
"
  
"
Ah
,
lud
!
"
cried
the
person
of
the
house
,
with
a
little
scream
,
as
if
the
word
had
pricked
her
.
"
Do
n't
talk
of
children
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
children
.
<EOS>
I
know
their
tricks
and
their
manners
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
said
this
with
an
angry
little
shake
of
her
right
fist
close
before
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
scarcely
required
the
teacher
-
habit
,
to
perceive
that
the
doll
's
dressmaker
was
inclined
to
be
bitter
on
the
difference
between
herself
and
other
children
.
<EOS>
But
both
master
and
pupil
understood
it
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Always
running
about
and
screeching
,
always
playing
and
fighting
,
always
skip
-
skip
-
skipping
on
the
pavement
and
chalking
it
for
their
games
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
know
their
tricks
and
their
manners
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shaking
the
little
fist
as
before
.
"
<EOS>
And
that
's
not
all
.
<EOS>
Ever
so
often
calling
names
in
through
a
person
's
keyhole
,
and
imitating
a
person
's
back
and
legs
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
know
their
tricks
and
their
manners
.
<EOS>
And
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'd
do
,
to
punish
'em
.
<EOS>
There
's
doors
under
the
church
in
the
Square
---
black
doors
,
leading
into
black
vaults
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
'd
open
one
of
those
doors
,
and
I
'd
cram
'em
all
in
,
<EOS>
and
then
I
'd
lock
the
door
and
through
the
keyhole
I
'd
blow
in
pepper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
be
the
good
of
blowing
in
pepper
?
"
asked
Charley
Hexam
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
set
'em
sneezing
,
"
said
the
person
of
the
house
,
"
and
make
their
eyes
water
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
were
all
sneezing
and
inflamed
,
I
'd
mock
'em
through
the
keyhole
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
,
with
their
tricks
and
their
manners
,
mock
a
person
through
a
person
's
keyhole
!
"
  
<EOS>
An
uncommonly
emphatic
shake
of
her
little
fist
close
before
her
eyes
,
seemed
to
ease
the
mind
of
the
person
of
the
house
;
for
she
added
with
recovered
composure
,
"
No
,
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
No
children
for
me
.
<EOS>
Give
me
grown
-
ups
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
difficult
to
guess
the
age
of
this
strange
creature
,
for
her
poor
figure
furnished
no
clue
to
it
,
and
her
face
was
at
once
so
young
and
so
old
.
<EOS>
Twelve
,
or
at
the
most
thirteen
,
might
be
near
the
mark
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
did
like
grown
-
ups
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
and
always
kept
company
with
them
.
<EOS>
So
sensible
.
<EOS>
Sit
so
quiet
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
prancing
and
capering
about
!
<EOS>
And
I
mean
always
to
keep
among
none
but
grown
-
ups
till
I
marry
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
must
make
up
my
mind
to
marry
,
one
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
listened
to
a
step
outside
that
caught
her
ear
,
and
there
was
a
soft
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Pulling
at
a
handle
within
her
reach
,
she
said
,
with
a
pleased
laugh
:
"
Now
here
,
for
instance
,
is
a
grown
-
up
that
's
my
particular
friend
!
"
<EOS>
and
Lizzie
Hexam
in
a
black
dress
entered
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
!
<EOS>
You
!
"
  
<EOS>
Taking
him
to
her
arms
in
the
old
way
---
of
which
he
seemed
a
little
ashamed
---
she
saw
no
one
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
there
,
Liz
,
all
right
my
dear
.
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
Here
's
Mr.
Headstone
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
eyes
met
those
of
the
schoolmaster
,
who
had
evidently
expected
to
see
a
very
different
sort
of
person
,
and
a
murmured
word
or
two
of
salutation
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
little
flurried
by
the
unexpected
visit
,
and
the
schoolmaster
was
not
at
his
ease
.
<EOS>
But
he
never
was
,
quite
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
Mr.
Headstone
you
were
not
settled
,
Liz
,
but
he
was
so
kind
as
to
take
an
interest
in
coming
,
and
so
I
brought
him
.
<EOS>
How
well
you
look
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
seemed
to
think
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
she
,
do
n't
she
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
person
of
the
house
,
resuming
her
occupation
,
though
the
twilight
was
falling
fast
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
she
does
!
<EOS>
But
go
on
with
your
chat
,
one
and
all
:
  
`
`
<EOS>
You
one
two
three
,
  
My
com
-
pa
-
nie
,
  
<EOS>
And
do
n't
mind
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
   
---
pointing
this
impromptu
rhyme
with
three
points
of
her
thin
forefinger
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
expect
a
visit
from
you
,
Charley
,
"
said
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
I
supposed
that
if
you
wanted
to
see
me
you
would
have
sent
to
me
,
appointing
me
to
come
somewhere
near
the
school
,
as
I
did
last
time
.
<EOS>
I
saw
my
brother
near
the
school
,
sir
,
"
to
Bradley
Headstone
,
"
because
it
's
easier
for
me
to
go
there
,
than
for
him
to
come
here
.
<EOS>
I
work
about
midway
between
the
two
places
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
see
much
of
one
another
,
"
said
Bradley
,
not
improving
in
respect
of
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
<EOS>
With
a
rather
sad
shake
of
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Charley
always
does
well
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
"
  
"
He
could
not
do
better
.
<EOS>
I
regard
his
course
as
quite
plain
before
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hoped
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
thankful
.
<EOS>
So
well
done
of
you
,
Charley
dear
!
<EOS>
It
is
better
for
me
not
to
come
(
except
when
he
wants
me
)
between
him
and
his
prospects
.
<EOS>
You
think
so
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
"
  
<EOS>
Conscious
that
his
pupil
-
teacher
was
looking
for
his
answer
,
and
that
he
himself
had
suggested
the
boy
's
keeping
aloof
from
this
sister
,
now
seen
for
the
first
time
<EOS>
face
to
face
<EOS>
,
Bradley
Headstone
stammered
:
  
"
<EOS>
Your
brother
is
very
much
occupied
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
He
has
to
work
hard
.
<EOS>
One
can
not
but
say
that
the
less
his
attention
is
diverted
from
his
work
,
the
better
for
his
future
.
<EOS>
When
he
shall
have
established
himself
,
why
then
---
it
will
be
another
thing
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
shook
her
head
again
,
and
returned
,
with
a
quiet
smile
:
"
I
always
advised
him
as
you
advise
him
.
<EOS>
Did
I
not
,
Charley
?
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
never
mind
that
now
,
"
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
getting
on
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
I
want
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
your
own
room
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
.
<EOS>
Upstairs
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
quiet
,
and
pleasant
,
and
airy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
always
has
the
use
of
this
room
for
visitors
,
"
said
the
person
of
the
house
,
screwing
up
one
of
her
little
bony
fists
,
like
an
opera
-
glass
,
and
looking
through
it
,
with
her
eyes
and
her
chin
in
that
quaint
accordance
.
<EOS>
"
Always
this
room
for
visitors
;
have
n't
you
,
Lizzie
dear
?
"
  
It
happened
that
Bradley
Headstone
noticed
a
very
slight
action
of
Lizzie
Hexam
's
hand
,
as
though
it
checked
the
doll
's
dressmaker
.
<EOS>
And
it
happened
that
the
latter
noticed
him
in
the
same
instant
;
 
for
she
made
a
double
eyeglass
of
her
two
hands
,
looked
at
him
through
it
,
and
cried
,
with
a
waggish
shake
of
her
head
:
"
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
Caught
you
spying
,
did
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
might
have
fallen
out
so
,
any
way
;
but
Bradley
Headstone
also
noticed
that
immediately
after
this
,
Lizzie
,
who
had
not
taken
off
her
bonnet
,
rather
hurriedly
proposed
that
as
the
room
was
getting
dark
they
should
go
out
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
They
went
out
;
the
visitors
saying
good
-
night
to
the
doll
's
dressmaker
,
whom
they
left
,
leaning
back
in
her
chair
with
her
arms
crossed
,
singing
to
herself
in
a
sweet
thoughtful
little
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
saunter
on
by
the
river
,
"
said
Bradley
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
glad
to
talk
together
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
his
uneasy
figure
went
on
before
them
among
the
evening
shadows
,
the
boy
said
to
his
sister
,
petulantly
:
  
"
When
are
you
going
to
settle
yourself
in
some
Christian
sort
of
place
,
Liz
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
going
to
do
it
before
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
well
where
I
am
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
where
you
are
!
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
to
have
brought
Mr.
Headstone
with
me
.
<EOS>
How
came
you
to
get
into
such
company
as
that
little
witch
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
chance
at
first
,
as
it
seemed
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
it
must
have
been
by
something
more
than
chance
,
for
that
child
<EOS>
---
You
remember
the
bills
upon
the
walls
at
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Confound
the
bills
upon
the
walls
at
home
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
forget
the
bills
upon
the
walls
at
home
,
and
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
do
the
same
,
"
grumbled
the
boy
.
"
<EOS>
Well
;
what
of
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
child
is
the
grandchild
of
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
What
old
man
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
terrible
drunken
old
man
,
in
the
list
slippers
and
the
nightcap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
asked
,
rubbing
his
nose
in
a
manner
that
half
expressed
vexation
at
hearing
so
much
,
and
half
curiosity
to
hear
more
:
"
How
came
you
to
make
that
out
?
<EOS>
What
a
girl
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
child
's
father
is
employed
by
the
house
that
employs
me
;
that
's
how
I
came
to
know
it
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
The
father
is
like
his
own
father
,
a
weak
wretched
trembling
creature
,
falling
to
pieces
,
never
sober
.
<EOS>
But
a
good
workman
too
,
at
the
work
he
does
.
<EOS>
The
mother
is
dead
.
<EOS>
This
poor
ailing
little
creature
has
come
to
be
what
she
is
,
surrounded
by
drunken
people
from
her
cradle
---
if
she
ever
had
one
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
what
you
have
to
do
with
her
,
for
all
that
,
"
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
,
Charley
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
looked
doggedly
at
the
river
.
<EOS>
They
were
at
Millbank
,
and
the
river
rolled
on
their
left
.
<EOS>
His
sister
gently
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
pointed
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Any
compensation
---
restitution
---
never
mind
the
word
,
you
know
my
meaning
.
<EOS>
Father
's
grave
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
respond
with
any
tenderness
.
<EOS>
After
a
moody
silence
he
broke
out
in
an
ill
-
used
tone
:
  
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
a
very
hard
thing
,
Liz
,
if
,
when
I
am
trying
my
best
to
get
up
in
the
world
,
you
pull
me
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
,
Charley
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
,
Liz
.
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
you
let
bygones
be
bygones
?
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
you
,
as
Mr.
Headstone
said
to
me
this
very
evening
about
another
matter
,
leave
well
alone
?
<EOS>
What
we
have
got
to
do
,
is
,
to
turn
our
faces
full
in
our
new
direction
,
and
keep
straight
on
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
never
look
back
?
<EOS>
Not
even
to
try
to
make
some
amends
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
such
a
dreamer
,
"
said
the
boy
,
with
his
former
petulance
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
all
very
well
when
we
sat
before
the
fire
---
when
we
looked
into
the
hollow
down
by
the
flare
---
but
we
are
looking
into
the
real
world
,
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
we
were
looking
into
the
real
world
then
,
Charley
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
what
you
mean
by
that
,
but
you
are
not
justified
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
,
as
I
raise
myself
,
to
shake
you
off
,
Liz
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
carry
you
up
with
me
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
want
to
do
,
and
mean
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
owe
you
.
<EOS>
I
said
to
Mr.
Headstone
this
very
evening
,
`
`
After
all
,
my
sister
got
me
here
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
.
Do
n't
pull
me
back
,
and
hold
me
down
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
I
ask
,
and
surely
that
's
not
unconscionable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
kept
a
steadfast
look
upon
him
,
and
she
answered
with
composure
:
  
"
I
am
not
here
selfishly
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
To
please
myself
,
I
could
not
be
too
far
from
that
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
could
you
be
too
far
from
it
to
please
me
.
<EOS>
Let
us
get
quit
of
it
equally
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
linger
about
it
any
more
than
I
?
<EOS>
I
give
it
a
wide
berth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
get
away
from
it
,
I
think
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
passing
her
hand
across
her
forehead
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
purpose
of
mine
that
I
live
by
it
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
go
,
Liz
!
<EOS>
Dreaming
again
!
<EOS>
You
lodge
yourself
of
your
own
accord
in
a
house
with
a
drunken
---
tailor
,
I
suppose
---
or
something
of
the
sort
,
and
a
little
crooked
antic
of
a
child
,
or
old
person
,
or
whatever
it
is
,
and
then
you
talk
as
if
you
were
drawn
or
driven
there
.
<EOS>
Now
,
do
be
more
practical
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
practical
enough
with
him
,
in
suffering
and
striving
for
him
;
but
she
only
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
---
not
reproachfully
 
---
and
tapped
it
twice
or
thrice
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
used
to
do
so
,
to
soothe
him
when
she
carried
him
about
,
a
child
as
heavy
as
herself
.
<EOS>
Tears
started
to
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Liz
,
"
drawing
the
back
of
his
hand
across
them
,
"
I
mean
to
be
a
good
brother
to
you
,
and
to
prove
that
I
know
what
I
owe
you
.
<EOS>
All
I
say
is
,
that
I
hope
you
'll
control
your
fancies
a
little
,
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
I
'll
get
a
school
,
and
then
you
must
come
and
live
with
me
,
and
you
'll
have
to
control
your
fancies
then
,
<EOS>
so
why
not
now
?
<EOS>
Now
,
say
I
have
n't
vexed
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
,
Charley
,
you
have
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
say
I
have
n't
hurt
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
n't
,
Charley
.
"
<EOS>
But
this
answer
was
less
ready
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
you
are
sure
I
did
n't
mean
to
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
There
's
Mr.
Headstone
stopping
,
and
looking
over
the
wall
at
the
tide
,
to
hint
that
it
's
time
to
go
.
<EOS>
Kiss
me
,
and
tell
me
that
you
know
I
did
n't
mean
to
hurt
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
told
him
so
,
and
they
embraced
,
and
walked
on
and
came
up
with
the
schoolmaster
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
go
your
sister
's
way
,
"
he
remarked
,
when
the
boy
told
him
he
was
ready
.
<EOS>
And
with
his
cumbrous
and
uneasy
action
he
stiffly
offered
her
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Her
hand
was
just
within
it
,
when
she
drew
it
back
.
<EOS>
He
looked
round
with
a
start
,
as
if
he
thought
she
had
detected
something
that
repelled
her
,
in
the
momentary
touch
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
go
in
just
yet
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
a
distance
before
you
,
and
will
walk
faster
without
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Being
by
this
time
close
to
Vauxhall
Bridge
,
they
resolved
,
in
consequence
,
to
take
that
way
over
the
Thames
,
and
they
left
her
:
<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
giving
her
his
hand
at
parting
,
and
she
thanking
him
for
his
care
of
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
The
master
and
the
pupil
walked
on
,
rapidly
and
silently
.
<EOS>
They
had
nearly
crossed
the
bridge
,
when
a
gentleman
came
coolly
sauntering
towards
them
,
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
,
his
coat
thrown
back
,
and
his
hands
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Something
in
the
careless
manner
of
this
person
,
and
in
a
certain
lazily
arrogant
air
with
which
he
approached
,
holding
possession
of
twice
as
much
pavement
as
another
would
have
claimed
,
instantly
caught
the
boy
's
attention
.
<EOS>
As
the
gentleman
passed
,
the
boy
looked
at
him
narrowly
,
and
then
stood
still
,
looking
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
it
that
you
stare
after
?
"
asked
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
boy
,
with
a
confused
and
pondering
frown
upon
his
face
,
"
It
is
that
Wrayburn
one
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
scrutinized
the
boy
as
closely
as
the
boy
had
scrutinized
the
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
but
I
could
n't
help
wondering
what
in
the
world
brought
him
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
Though
he
said
it
as
if
his
wonder
were
past
---
at
the
same
time
resuming
the
walk
---
it
was
not
lost
upon
the
master
that
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
after
speaking
,
and
that
the
same
perplexed
and
pondering
frown
was
heavy
on
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
appear
to
like
your
friend
,
Hexam
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
   
<EOS>
DON'T
like
him
,
"
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
took
hold
of
me
by
the
chin
in
a
precious
impertinent
way
,
the
first
time
I
ever
saw
him
,
"
said
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Again
,
why
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
nothing
.
<EOS>
Or
---
it
's
much
the
same
---
because
something
I
happened
to
say
about
my
sister
did
n't
happen
to
please
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
knows
your
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
at
that
time
,
"
said
the
boy
,
still
moodily
pondering
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
had
so
lost
himself
that
he
looked
at
Mr.
Bradley
Headstone
as
they
walked
on
side
by
side
,
without
attempting
to
reply
until
the
question
had
been
repeated
;
then
he
nodded
and
answered
,
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Going
to
see
her
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
ca
n't
be
!
"
said
the
boy
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
does
n't
know
her
well
enough
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
catch
him
at
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
had
walked
on
for
a
time
,
more
rapidly
than
before
,
the
master
said
,
clasping
the
pupil
's
arm
between
the
elbow
and
the
shoulder
with
his
hand
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
going
to
tell
me
something
about
that
person
.
<EOS>
What
did
you
say
his
name
was
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
He
is
what
they
call
a
barrister
,
with
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
The
first
time
he
came
to
our
old
place
was
when
my
father
was
alive
.
<EOS>
He
came
on
business
;
not
that
it
was
his
business
---
he
never
had
any
business
---
he
was
brought
by
a
friend
of
his
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
the
other
times
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
only
one
other
time
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
When
my
father
was
killed
by
accident
,
he
chanced
to
be
one
of
the
finders
.
<EOS>
He
was
mooning
about
,
I
suppose
,
taking
liberties
with
people
's
chins
;
but
there
he
was
,
somehow
.
<EOS>
He
brought
the
news
home
to
my
sister
early
in
the
morning
,
and
brought
Miss
Abbey
Potterson
,
a
neighbour
,
to
help
break
it
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
mooning
about
the
house
when
I
was
fetched
home
in
the
afternoon
---
they
did
n't
know
where
to
find
me
till
my
sister
could
be
brought
round
sufficiently
to
tell
them
---
and
then
he
mooned
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
is
that
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
gradually
released
the
boy
's
arm
,
as
if
he
were
thoughtful
,
and
they
walked
on
side
by
side
as
before
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
silence
between
them
,
Bradley
resumed
the
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
---
<EOS>
your
sister
---
"
with
a
curious
break
both
before
and
after
the
words
,
"
has
received
hardly
any
teaching
,
Hexam
?
"
  
"
Hardly
any
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sacrificed
,
no
doubt
,
to
her
father
's
objections
.
<EOS>
I
remember
them
in
your
case
.
<EOS>
Yet
---
your
sister
---
scarcely
looks
or
speaks
like
an
ignorant
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
has
as
much
thought
as
the
best
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
Too
much
,
perhaps
,
without
teaching
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
call
the
fire
at
home
,
her
books
,
for
she
was
always
full
of
fancies
---
sometimes
quite
wise
fancies
,
considering
---
when
she
sat
looking
at
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
that
,
"
said
Bradley
Headstone
.
  
<EOS>
His
pupil
was
a
little
surprised
by
this
striking
in
with
so
sudden
and
decided
and
emotional
an
objection
,
but
took
it
as
a
proof
of
the
master
's
interest
in
himself
.
<EOS>
It
emboldened
him
to
say
:
  
"
I
have
never
brought
myself
to
mention
it
openly
to
you
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
and
you
're
my
witness
that
I
could
n't
even
make
up
my
mind
to
take
it
from
you
before
we
came
out
to
-
night
;
but
it
's
a
painful
thing
to
think
that
if
I
get
on
as
well
as
you
hope
,
I
shall
be
---
I
wo
n't
say
disgraced
,
because
I
do
n't
mean
disgraced
---
<EOS>
but
---
  
rather
put
to
the
blush
if
it
was
known
---
by
a
sister
who
has
been
very
good
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Bradley
Headstone
in
a
slurring
way
,
for
his
mind
scarcely
seemed
to
touch
that
point
,
so
smoothly
did
it
glide
to
another
,
"
and
<EOS>
there
is
this
possibility
to
consider
.
<EOS>
Some
man
who
had
worked
his
way
might
come
to
admire
---
your
sister
---
and
might
even
in
time
bring
himself
to
think
of
marrying
---
your
sister
---
 
<EOS>
and
it
would
be
a
sad
drawback
and
a
heavy
penalty
upon
him
,
if
,
overcoming
in
his
mind
<EOS>
other
inequalities
of
condition
and
other
considerations
against
it
,
this
inequality
and
this
consideration
remained
in
full
force
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
much
my
own
meaning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
"
said
Bradley
Headstone
,
"
but
you
spoke
of
a
mere
brother
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
case
I
have
supposed
would
be
a
much
stronger
case
;
because
an
admirer
,
a
husband
,
would
form
the
connexion
voluntarily
,
besides
being
obliged
to
proclaim
it
:
which
a
brother
is
not
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
you
know
,
it
must
be
said
of
you
that
you
could
n't
help
yourself
:
while
it
would
be
said
of
him
,
with
equal
reason
,
that
he
could
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
since
Lizzie
was
left
free
by
father
's
death
,
I
have
thought
that
such
a
young
woman
might
soon
acquire
more
than
enough
to
pass
muster
.
<EOS>
And
sometimes
I
have
even
thought
that
perhaps
Miss
Peecher
---
"
  
"
For
the
purpose
,
I
would
advise
Not
Miss
Peecher
,
"
Bradley
Headstone
struck
in
with
a
recurrence
of
his
late
decision
of
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
think
of
it
for
me
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Hexam
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
'll
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
'll
think
maturely
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
'll
think
well
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Their
walk
was
almost
a
silent
one
afterwards
,
until
it
ended
at
the
school
-
house
.
<EOS>
There
,
one
of
neat
Miss
Peecher
's
little
windows
,
like
the
eyes
in
needles
,
was
illuminated
,
and
in
a
corner
near
it
sat
Mary
Anne
watching
,
while
Miss
Peecher
at
the
table
stitched
at
the
neat
little
body
she
was
making
up
by
brown
paper
pattern
for
her
own
wearing
.
<EOS>
N.B.
Miss
Peecher
and
Miss
Peecher
's
pupils
were
not
much
encouraged
in
the
unscholastic
art
of
needlework
,
by
Government
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
Anne
with
her
face
to
the
window
,
held
her
arm
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mary
Anne
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Headstone
coming
home
,
ma'am
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
about
a
minute
,
Mary
Anne
again
hailed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mary
Anne
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Gone
in
and
locked
his
door
,
ma'am
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Peecher
repressed
a
sigh
as
she
gathered
her
work
together
for
bed
,
and
transfixed
that
part
of
her
dress
where
her
heart
would
have
been
if
she
had
had
the
dress
on
,
with
a
sharp
,
sharp
needle
.
   
<EOS>
STILL
EDUCATIONAL
.
 
<EOS>
The
person
of
the
house
,
doll
's
dressmaker
and
manufacturer
of
ornamental
pincushions
and
pen
-
wipers
,
sat
in
her
quaint
little
low
arm
-
chair
,
singing
in
the
dark
,
until
Lizzie
came
back
.
<EOS>
The
person
of
the
house
had
attained
that
dignity
while
yet
of
very
tender
years
indeed
,
through
being
the
only
trustworthy
person
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
Lizzie
-
Mizzie
-
Wizzie
,
"
said
she
,
breaking
off
in
her
song
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
news
out
of
doors
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
news
in
doors
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Lizzie
,
playfully
smoothing
the
bright
long
fair
hair
which
grew
very
luxuriant
and
beautiful
on
the
head
of
the
doll
's
dressmaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
see
,
said
the
blind
man
.
<EOS>
Why
the
last
news
is
,
that
I
do
n't
mean
to
marry
your
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
-
o
,
"
shaking
her
head
and
her
chin
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
like
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
to
his
master
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
that
I
think
he
's
bespoke
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
finished
putting
the
hair
carefully
back
over
the
misshapen
shoulders
,
and
then
lighted
a
candle
.
<EOS>
It
showed
the
little
parlour
to
be
dingy
,
but
orderly
and
clean
.
<EOS>
She
stood
it
on
the
mantelshelf
,
remote
from
the
dressmaker
's
eyes
,
and
then
put
the
room
door
open
,
and
the
house
door
open
,
and
turned
the
little
low
chair
and
its
occupant
towards
the
outer
air
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sultry
night
,
and
this
was
a
fine
-
weather
arrangement
when
the
day
's
work
was
done
.
<EOS>
To
complete
it
,
she
seated
herself
in
a
chair
by
the
side
of
the
little
chair
,
and
protectingly
drew
under
her
arm
the
spare
hand
that
crept
up
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
what
your
loving
Jenny
Wren
calls
the
best
time
in
the
day
and
night
,
"
said
the
person
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Her
real
name
was
Fanny
Cleaver
;
but
she
had
long
ago
chosen
to
bestow
upon
herself
the
appellation
of
Miss
Jenny
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
thinking
,
"
Jenny
went
on
,
"
as
I
sat
at
work
to
-
day
,
what
a
thing
it
would
be
,
if
I
should
be
able
to
have
your
company
till
I
am
married
,
or
at
least
courted
.
<EOS>
Because
when
I
am
courted
,
I
shall
make
Him
do
some
of
the
things
that
you
do
for
me
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
brush
my
hair
like
you
do
,
or
help
me
up
and
down
stairs
like
you
do
,
and
he
could
n't
do
anything
like
you
do
;
but
he
could
take
my
work
home
,
and
he
could
call
for
orders
in
his
clumsy
way
.
<EOS>
And
he
shall
too
.
<EOS>
I
'll
trot
him
about
,
I
can
tell
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Jenny
Wren
had
her
personal
vanities
---
happily
for
her
---
and
no
intentions
were
stronger
in
her
breast
than
the
various
trials
and
torments
that
were
,
in
the
fulness
of
time
,
to
be
inflicted
upon
"
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wherever
he
may
happen
to
be
just
at
present
,
or
whoever
he
may
happen
to
be
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
"
I
know
his
tricks
and
his
manners
,
and
I
give
him
warning
to
look
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
you
are
rather
hard
upon
him
?
"
asked
her
friend
,
smiling
,
and
smoothing
her
hair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
,
"
replied
the
sage
Miss
Wren
,
with
an
air
of
vast
experience
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
they
do
n't
care
for
you
,
those
fellows
,
if
you
're
not
hard
upon
'em
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
saying
If
I
should
be
able
to
have
your
company
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
What
a
large
If
!
<EOS>
Ai
n't
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
intention
of
parting
company
,
Jenny
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
or
you
'll
go
directly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
so
little
to
be
relied
upon
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
more
to
be
relied
upon
than
silver
and
gold
.
<EOS>
"
As
she
said
it
,
Miss
Wren
suddenly
broke
off
,
screwed
up
her
eyes
and
her
chin
,
and
looked
prodigiously
knowing
"
<EOS>
Aha
!
  
<EOS>
"
Who
comes
here
?
  
<EOS>
"
A
Grenadier
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
he
want
?
  
<EOS>
"
A
pot
of
beer
.
  
<EOS>
And
nothing
else
in
the
world
,
my
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
man
's
figure
paused
on
the
pavement
at
the
outer
door
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
ai
n't
it
?
"
said
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
am
told
,
"
was
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
come
in
,
if
you
're
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
good
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
'll
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
gave
his
hand
to
Jenny
Wren
,
and
he
gave
his
hand
to
Lizzie
,
and
he
stood
leaning
by
the
door
at
Lizzie
's
side
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
strolling
with
his
cigar
,
he
said
,
(
it
was
smoked
out
and
gone
by
this
time
,
)
and
he
had
strolled
round
to
return
in
that
direction
that
he
might
look
in
as
he
passed
.
<EOS>
Had
she
not
seen
her
brother
to
-
night
?
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
whose
manner
was
a
little
troubled
.
  
<EOS>
Gracious
condescension
on
our
brother
's
part
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
thought
he
had
passed
my
young
gentleman
on
the
bridge
yonder
.
<EOS>
Who
was
his
friend
with
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
The
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Looked
like
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
sat
so
still
,
that
one
could
not
have
said
wherein
the
fact
of
her
manner
being
troubled
was
expressed
;
and
yet
one
could
not
have
doubted
it
.
<EOS>
Eugene
was
as
easy
as
ever
;
but
perhaps
,
as
she
sat
with
her
eyes
cast
down
,
it
might
have
been
rather
more
perceptible
that
his
attention
was
concentrated
upon
her
for
certain
moments
,
than
its
concentration
upon
any
subject
for
any
short
time
ever
was
,
elsewhere
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
report
,
Lizzie
,
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
having
promised
you
that
an
eye
should
be
always
kept
on
Mr.
Riderhood
through
my
friend
Lightwood
,
I
like
occasionally
to
renew
my
assurance
that
I
keep
my
promise
,
and
keep
my
friend
up
to
the
mark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
doubted
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Generally
,
I
confess
myself
a
man
to
be
doubted
,
"
returned
Eugene
,
coolly
,
"
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
sharp
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
airy
Eugene
,
"
I
am
a
bad
idle
dog
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
do
n't
you
reform
and
be
a
good
dog
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
Eugene
,
"
there
's
nobody
who
makes
it
worth
my
while
.
<EOS>
Have
you
considered
my
suggestion
,
Lizzie
?
"
 
<EOS>
This
in
a
lower
voice
,
but
only
as
if
it
were
a
graver
matter
;
not
at
all
to
the
exclusion
of
the
person
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
thought
of
it
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
but
I
have
not
been
able
to
make
up
my
mind
to
accept
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
False
pride
!
"
said
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
I
hope
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
False
pride
!
"
repeated
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
else
is
it
?
<EOS>
The
thing
is
worth
nothing
in
itself
.
<EOS>
The
thing
is
worth
nothing
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
can
it
be
worth
to
me
?
<EOS>
You
know
the
most
I
make
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
propose
to
be
of
some
use
to
somebody
---
which
I
never
was
in
this
world
,
and
never
shall
be
on
any
other
occasion
---
by
paying
some
qualified
person
of
your
own
sex
and
age
,
so
many
(
or
rather
so
few
)
<EOS>
contemptible
shillings
,
to
come
here
,
certain
nights
in
the
week
,
and
give
you
certain
instruction
which
you
would
n't
want
if
you
had
n't
been
a
self
-
denying
daughter
and
sister
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
it
's
good
to
have
it
,
or
you
would
never
have
so
devoted
yourself
to
your
brother
's
having
it
.
<EOS>
Then
why
not
have
it
:
especially
when
our
friend
Miss
Jenny
here
would
profit
by
it
too
?
<EOS>
If
I
proposed
to
be
the
teacher
,
or
to
attend
the
lessons
---
obviously
incongruous
!
 
<EOS>
---
but
as
to
that
,
I
might
as
well
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
,
or
not
on
the
globe
at
all
.
<EOS>
False
pride
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Because
true
pride
would
n't
shame
,
or
be
shamed
by
,
your
thankless
brother
.
<EOS>
True
pride
would
n't
have
schoolmasters
brought
here
,
like
doctors
,
to
look
at
a
bad
case
.
<EOS>
True
pride
would
go
to
work
and
do
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
,
well
enough
,
for
you
know
that
your
own
true
pride
would
do
it
to
-
morrow
,
if
you
had
the
ways
and
means
which
false
pride
wo
n't
let
me
supply
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
add
no
more
than
this
.
<EOS>
Your
false
pride
does
wrong
to
yourself
and
does
wrong
to
your
dead
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
to
my
father
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
with
an
anxious
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
to
your
father
?
<EOS>
Can
you
ask
!
<EOS>
By
perpetuating
the
consequences
of
his
ignorant
and
blind
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
By
resolving
not
to
set
right
the
wrong
he
did
you
.
<EOS>
By
determining
that
the
deprivation
to
which
he
condemned
you
,
and
which
he
forced
upon
you
,
shall
always
rest
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
chanced
to
be
a
subtle
string
to
sound
,
in
her
who
had
so
spoken
to
her
brother
within
the
hour
.
<EOS>
It
sounded
far
more
forcibly
,
because
of
the
change
in
the
speaker
for
the
moment
;
the
passing
appearance
of
earnestness
,
complete
conviction
,
injured
resentment
of
suspicion
,
generous
and
unselfish
interest
.
<EOS>
All
these
qualities
,
in
him
usually
so
light
and
careless
<EOS>
,
she
felt
to
be
inseparable
from
some
touch
of
their
opposites
in
her
own
breast
.
<EOS>
She
thought
,
had
she
,
so
far
below
him
and
so
different
,
rejected
this
disinterestedness
,
because
of
some
vain
misgiving
that
he
sought
her
out
,
or
heeded
any
personal
attractions
that
he
might
descry
in
her
?
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
,
pure
of
heart
and
purpose
,
could
not
bear
to
think
it
.
<EOS>
Sinking
before
her
own
eyes
,
as
she
suspected
herself
of
it
,
she
drooped
her
head
as
though
she
had
done
him
some
wicked
and
grievous
injury
,
and
broke
into
silent
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
distressed
,
"
said
Eugene
,
very
,
very
kindly
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
is
not
I
who
have
distressed
you
.
<EOS>
I
meant
no
more
than
to
put
the
matter
in
its
true
light
before
you
;
though
I
acknowledge
I
did
it
selfishly
enough
,
for
I
am
disappointed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Disappointed
of
doing
her
a
service
.
<EOS>
How
else
could
he
be
disappointed
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
break
my
heart
,
"
laughed
Eugene
;
"
it
wo
n't
stay
by
me
eight
-
and
-
forty
hours
;
but
I
am
genuinely
disappointed
.
<EOS>
I
had
set
my
fancy
on
doing
this
little
thing
for
you
and
for
our
friend
Miss
Jenny
.
<EOS>
The
novelty
of
my
doing
anything
in
the
least
useful
,
had
its
charms
.
<EOS>
I
see
,
now
,
that
I
might
have
managed
it
better
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
affected
to
do
it
wholly
for
our
friend
Miss
J.
<EOS>
I
might
have
got
myself
up
,
morally
,
as
Sir
Eugene
Bountiful
.
<EOS>
But
upon
my
soul
I
ca
n't
make
flourishes
,
and
I
would
rather
be
disappointed
than
try
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
he
meant
to
follow
home
what
was
in
Lizzie
's
thoughts
,
it
was
skilfully
done
.
<EOS>
If
he
followed
it
by
mere
fortuitous
coincidence
,
it
was
done
by
an
evil
chance
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
opened
out
so
naturally
before
me
,
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
The
ball
seemed
so
thrown
into
my
hands
by
accident
!
<EOS>
I
happen
to
be
originally
brought
into
contact
with
you
,
Lizzie
,
on
those
two
occasions
that
you
know
of
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
be
able
to
promise
you
that
a
watch
shall
be
kept
upon
that
false
accuser
,
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
I
happen
to
be
able
to
give
you
some
little
consolation
in
the
darkest
hour
of
your
distress
,
by
assuring
you
that
I
do
n't
believe
him
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
occasion
I
tell
you
that
I
am
the
idlest
and
least
of
lawyers
,
but
that
I
am
better
than
none
,
in
a
case
I
have
noted
down
with
my
own
hand
,
and
that
you
may
be
always
sure
of
my
best
help
,
and
incidentally
of
Lightwood
's
too
,
in
your
efforts
to
clear
your
father
.
<EOS>
So
,
it
gradually
takes
my
fancy
that
I
may
help
you
---
so
easily
!
 
<EOS>
---
to
clear
your
father
of
that
other
blame
which
I
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago
,
and
which
is
a
just
and
real
one
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
explained
myself
,
for
I
am
heartily
sorry
to
have
distressed
you
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
claim
to
mean
well
,
but
I
really
did
mean
honestly
and
simply
well
,
and
I
want
you
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
doubted
that
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
"
said
Lizzie
;
the
more
repentant
,
the
less
he
claimed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Though
if
you
had
quite
understood
my
whole
meaning
at
first
,
I
think
you
would
not
have
refused
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
you
would
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
do
n't
know
that
I
should
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Then
why
refuse
now
you
do
understand
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
easy
for
me
to
talk
to
you
,
"
returned
Lizzie
,
in
some
confusion
,
"
for
you
see
all
the
consequences
of
what
I
say
,
as
soon
as
I
say
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
all
the
consequences
,
"
laughed
Eugene
,
"
and
take
away
my
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
Hexam
,
as
I
truly
respect
you
,
and
as
I
am
your
friend
and
a
poor
devil
of
a
gentleman
,
I
protest
I
do
n't
even
now
understand
why
you
hesitate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
appearance
of
openness
,
trustfulness
,
unsuspecting
generosity
,
in
his
words
and
manner
,
that
won
the
poor
girl
over
;
 
and
not
only
won
her
over
,
but
again
caused
her
to
feel
as
though
she
had
been
influenced
by
the
opposite
qualities
,
with
vanity
at
their
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
hesitate
any
longer
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
think
the
worse
of
me
for
having
hesitated
at
all
.
<EOS>
For
myself
and
for
Jenny
---
you
let
me
answer
for
you
,
Jenny
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
creature
had
been
leaning
back
,
attentive
,
with
her
elbows
resting
on
the
elbows
of
her
chair
,
and
her
chin
upon
her
hands
.
<EOS>
Without
changing
her
attitude
,
she
answered
,
"
Yes
!
"
<EOS>
so
suddenly
that
it
rather
seemed
as
if
she
had
chopped
the
monysyllable
than
spoken
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
myself
and
for
Jenny
,
I
thankfully
accept
your
kind
offer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Agreed
!
<EOS>
Dismissed
!
<EOS>
"
said
Eugene
,
giving
Lizzie
his
hand
before
lightly
waving
it
,
as
if
he
waved
the
whole
subject
away
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
may
not
be
often
that
so
much
is
made
of
so
little
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
fell
to
talking
playfully
with
Jenny
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
of
setting
up
a
doll
,
Miss
Jenny
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
not
,
"
replied
the
dressmaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
to
break
it
.
<EOS>
All
you
children
do
.
"
  
"
But
that
makes
good
for
trade
,
you
know
,
Miss
Wren
,
"
returned
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
Much
as
people
's
breaking
promises
and
contracts
and
bargains
of
all
sorts
,
makes
good
for
my
trade
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
"
Miss
Wren
retorted
;
"
but
you
had
better
by
half
set
up
a
pen
-
wiper
,
and
turn
industrious
,
and
use
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
we
were
all
as
industrious
as
you
,
little
Busy
-
Body
,
we
should
begin
to
work
as
soon
as
we
could
crawl
,
and
there
would
be
a
bad
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
,
"
returned
the
little
creature
,
with
a
flush
suffusing
her
face
,
"
bad
for
your
backs
and
your
legs
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Eugene
;
shocked
---
to
do
him
justice
---
at
the
thought
of
trifling
with
her
infirmity
.
"
<EOS>
Bad
for
business
,
bad
for
business
.
<EOS>
If
we
all
set
to
work
as
soon
as
we
could
use
our
hands
,
it
would
be
all
over
with
the
doll
's
dressmakers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
in
that
,
"
replied
Miss
Wren
;
"
you
have
a
sort
of
an
idea
in
your
noddle
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
in
a
changed
tone
;
"
Talking
of
ideas
,
my
Lizzie
,
"
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
as
they
had
sat
at
first
,
"
I
wonder
how
it
happens
that
when
I
am
work
,
work
,
working
here
,
all
alone
in
the
summer
-
time
<EOS>
,
I
smell
flowers
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
a
commonplace
individual
,
I
should
say
,
"
Eugene
suggested
languidly
---
for
he
was
growing
weary
of
the
person
of
the
house
---
  
"
that
you
smell
flowers
because
you
do
smell
flowers
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
I
do
n't
,
"
said
the
little
creature
,
resting
one
arm
upon
the
elbow
of
her
chair
,
resting
her
chin
upon
that
hand
,
and
looking
vacantly
before
her
;
"
this
is
not
a
flowery
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
It
's
anything
but
that
.
<EOS>
And
yet
as
I
sit
at
work
,
I
smell
miles
of
flowers
.
<EOS>
I
smell
roses
,
till
I
think
I
see
the
rose
-
leaves
lying
in
heaps
,
bushels
,
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
I
smell
fallen
leaves
,
till
I
put
down
my
hand
---
<EOS>
so
---
and
expect
to
make
them
rustle
.
<EOS>
I
smell
the
white
and
the
pink
May
in
the
hedges
,
and
all
sorts
of
flowers
that
I
never
was
among
.
<EOS>
For
I
have
seen
very
few
flowers
indeed
,
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pleasant
fancies
to
have
,
Jenny
dear
!
"
said
her
friend
:
with
a
glance
towards
Eugene
as
if
she
would
have
asked
him
whether
they
were
given
the
child
in
compensation
for
her
losses
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
think
,
Lizzie
,
when
they
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
the
birds
I
hear
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
cried
the
little
creature
,
holding
out
her
hand
and
looking
upward
,
"
how
they
sing
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
face
and
action
for
the
moment
,
quite
inspired
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Then
the
chin
dropped
musingly
upon
the
band
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
my
birds
sing
better
than
other
birds
,
and
my
flowers
smell
better
than
other
flowers
.
<EOS>
For
when
I
was
a
little
child
,
"
in
a
tone
as
though
it
were
ages
ago
,
"
the
children
that
I
used
to
see
early
in
the
morning
were
very
different
from
any
others
that
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
like
me
;
they
were
not
chilled
,
anxious
,
ragged
,
or
beaten
;
they
were
never
in
pain
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
like
the
children
of
the
neighbours
;
they
never
made
me
tremble
all
over
,
by
setting
up
shrill
noises
,
and
they
never
mocked
me
.
<EOS>
Such
numbers
of
them
too
!
<EOS>
All
in
white
dresses
,
and
with
something
shining
on
the
borders
,
and
on
their
heads
,
that
I
have
never
been
able
to
imitate
with
my
work
,
though
I
know
it
so
well
.
<EOS>
They
used
to
come
down
in
long
bright
slanting
rows
,
and
say
all
together
,
`
`
Who
is
this
in
pain
!
<EOS>
Who
is
this
in
pain
!
"
<EOS>
"
When
I
told
them
who
it
was
,
they
answered
,
`
`
Come
and
play
with
us
!
"
<EOS>
"
When
I
said
`
`
I
never
play
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
play
!
"
<EOS>
"
they
swept
about
me
and
took
me
up
,
and
made
me
light
.
<EOS>
Then
it
was
all
delicious
ease
and
rest
till
they
laid
me
down
,
and
said
,
all
together
,
`
`
Have
patience
,
and
we
will
come
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
Whenever
they
came
back
,
I
used
to
know
they
were
coming
before
I
saw
the
long
bright
rows
,
by
hearing
them
ask
,
all
together
a
long
way
off
,
`
`
Who
is
this
in
pain
!
<EOS>
who
is
this
in
pain
!
"
<EOS>
"
And
I
used
to
cry
out
,
`
`
O
my
blessed
children
,
it
's
poor
me
.
<EOS>
Have
pity
on
me
.
<EOS>
Take
me
up
and
make
me
light
!
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
  
By
degrees
,
as
she
progressed
in
this
remembrance
,
the
hand
was
raised
,
the
late
ecstatic
look
returned
,
and
she
became
quite
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Having
so
paused
for
a
moment
,
silent
,
with
a
listening
smile
upon
her
face
<EOS>
,
she
looked
round
and
recalled
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
poor
fun
you
think
me
;
do
n't
you
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
?
<EOS>
You
may
well
look
tired
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
Saturday
night
,
and
I
wo
n't
detain
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
to
say
,
Miss
Wren
,
"
observed
Eugene
,
quite
ready
to
profit
by
the
hint
,
"
you
wish
me
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
's
Saturday
night
,
"
she
returned
,
"
and
my
child
's
coming
home
.
<EOS>
And
my
child
is
a
troublesome
bad
child
,
and
costs
me
a
world
of
scolding
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
you
did
n't
see
my
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
doll
?
<EOS>
"
said
Eugene
,
not
understanding
,
and
looking
for
an
explanation
.
  
<EOS>
But
Lizzie
,
with
her
lips
only
,
shaping
the
two
words
,
"
Her
father
,
"
 
he
delayed
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
took
his
leave
immediately
.
<EOS>
At
the
corner
of
the
street
he
stopped
to
light
another
cigar
,
and
possibly
to
ask
himself
what
he
was
doing
otherwise
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
the
answer
was
indefinite
and
vague
.
<EOS>
Who
knows
what
he
is
doing
,
who
is
careless
what
he
does
!
  
<EOS>
A
man
stumbled
against
him
as
he
turned
away
,
who
mumbled
some
maudlin
apology
.
<EOS>
Looking
after
this
man
,
Eugene
saw
him
go
in
at
the
door
by
which
he
himself
had
just
come
out
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
man
's
stumbling
into
the
room
,
Lizzie
rose
to
leave
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
away
,
Miss
Hexam
,
"
he
said
in
a
submissive
manner
,
speaking
thickly
and
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
fly
from
unfortunate
man
in
shattered
state
of
health
.
<EOS>
Give
poor
invalid
honor
of
your
company
.
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
---
ai
n't
catching
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
murmured
that
she
had
something
to
do
in
her
own
room
,
and
went
away
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
's
my
Jenny
?
"
said
the
man

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
's
my
Jenny
Wren
,
best
of
children
,
object
dearest
affections
broken
-
hearted
invalid
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
which
the
person
of
the
house
,
stretching
out
her
arm
in
an
attitude
of
command
,
replied
with
irresponsive
asperity
:
"
Go
along
with
you
!
<EOS>
Go
along
into
your
corner
!
<EOS>
Get
into
your
corner
directly
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
wretched
spectacle
made
as
if
he
would
have
offered
some
remonstrance
;
but
not
venturing
to
resist
the
person
of
the
house
,
thought
better
of
it
,
and
went
and
sat
down
on
a
particular
chair
of
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
-
h
-
h
!
"
cried
the
person
of
the
house
,
pointing
her
little
finger
,
"
You
bad
old
boy
!
<EOS>
Oh
-
h
-
h
you
naughty
,
wicked
creature
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
shaking
figure
,
unnerved
and
disjointed
from
head
to
foot
,
put
out
its
two
hands
a
little
way
,
as
making
overtures
of
peace
and
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
Abject
tears
stood
in
its
eyes
,
and
stained
the
blotched
red
of
its
cheeks
.
<EOS>
The
swollen
lead
-
coloured
under
lip
trembled
with
a
shameful
whine
.
<EOS>
The
whole
indecorous
thread
bare
ruin
,
from
the
broken
shoes
to
the
prematurely
-
grey
scanty
hair
,
grovelled
.
<EOS>
Not
with
any
sense
worthy
to
be
called
a
sense
,
of
this
dire
reversal
of
the
places
of
parent
and
child
,
but
in
a
pitiful
expostulation
to
be
let
off
from
a
scolding
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
your
tricks
and
your
manners
,
"
cried
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
where
you
've
been
to
!
"
<EOS>
(
which
indeed
it
did
not
require
discernment
to
discover
)
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
disgraceful
old
chap
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
very
breathing
of
the
figure
was
contemptible
,
as
it
laboured
and
rattled
in
that
operation
,
like
a
blundering
clock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Slave
,
slave
,
slave
,
from
morning
to
night
,
"
pursued
the
person
of
the
house
,
"
and
all
for
this
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
that
<EOS>
emphasized
"
<EOS>
What
,
"
which
absurdly
frightened
the
figure
.
<EOS>
As
often
as
the
person
of
the
house
worked
her
way
round
to
it
---
even
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
it
was
coming
 
---
he
collapsed
in
an
extra
degree
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
been
taken
up
,
and
locked
up
,
"
said
the
person
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
been
poked
into
cells
and
black
holes
,
and
run
over
by
rats
and
spiders
and
beetles
.
<EOS>
I
know
their
tricks
and
their
manners
,
and
they
'd
have
tickled
you
nicely
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
you
ashamed
of
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
"
stammered
the
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
the
person
of
the
house
,
terrifying
him
by
a
grand
muster
of
her
spirits
and
forces
before
recurring
to
the
emphatic
word
,
"
What
do
you
mean
by
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Circumstances
over
which
had
no
control
,
"
was
the
miserable
creature
's
plea
in
extenuation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
circumstance
you
and
control
you
too
,
"
retorted
the
person
of
the
house
,
speaking
with
vehement
sharpness
,
"
if
you
talk
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
'll
give
you
in
charge
to
the
police
,
and
have
you
fined
five
shillings
when
you
ca
n't
pay
,
and
then
I
wo
n't
pay
the
money
for
you
,
and
you
'll
be
transported
for
life
.
<EOS>
How
should
you
like
to
be
transported
for
life
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Should
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
Poor
shattered
invalid
.
<EOS>
Trouble
nobody
long
,
"
cried
the
wretched
figure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
"
said
the
person
of
the
house
,
tapping
the
table
near
her
in
a
business
-
like
manner
,
and
shaking
her
head
and
her
chin
;
 
<EOS>
"
you
know
what
you
've
got
to
do
.
<EOS>
Put
down
your
money
this
instant
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
obedient
figure
began
to
rummage
in
its
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
"
Spent
a
fortune
out
of
your
wages
,
I
'll
be
bound
!
"
said
the
person
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Put
it
here
!
<EOS>
All
you
've
got
left
!
<EOS>
Every
farthing
!
"
  
<EOS>
Such
a
business
as
he
made
of
collecting
it
from
his
dogs'-eared
pockets
;
of
expecting
it
in
this
pocket
,
and
not
finding
it
;
of
not
expecting
it
in
that
pocket
,
and
passing
it
over
;
of
finding
no
pocket
where
that
other
pocket
ought
to
be
!
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
all
?
"
<EOS>
demanded
the
person
of
the
house
,
when
a
confused
heap
of
pence
and
shillings
lay
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Got
no
more
,
"
was
the
rueful
answer
,
with
an
accordant
shake
of
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
make
sure
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
you
've
got
to
do
.
<EOS>
Turn
all
your
pockets
inside
out
,
and
leave
'em
so
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
person
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
He
obeyed
.
<EOS>
And
if
anything
could
have
made
him
look
more
abject
or
more
dismally
ridiculous
than
before
,
it
would
have
been
his
so
displaying
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
but
seven
and
eightpence
halfpenny
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Miss
Wren
,
after
reducing
the
heap
to
order
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
prodigal
old
son
!
<EOS>
Now
you
shall
be
starved
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
do
n't
starve
me
,
"
he
urged
,
whimpering
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
treated
as
you
ought
to
be
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
"
you
'd
be
fed
upon
the
skewers
of
cats
'
meat
;
---
only
the
skewers
,
after
the
cats
had
had
the
meat
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
stumbled
out
of
the
corner
to
comply
,
he
again
put
out
both
his
hands
,
and
pleaded
:
"
Circumstances
over
which
no
control
---
"
  
"
Get
along
with
you
to
bed
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Wren
,
snapping
him
up
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
going
to
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
Go
to
bed
this
moment
!
"
  
<EOS>
Seeing
another
emphatic
<EOS>
"
What
"
upon
its
way
,
he
evaded
it
by
complying
,
and
was
heard
to
shuffle
heavily
up
stairs
,
and
shut
his
door
,
and
throw
himself
on
his
bed
.
<EOS>
Within
a
little
while
afterwards
,
Lizzie
came
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
have
our
supper
,
Jenny
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
bless
us
and
save
us
,
we
need
have
something
to
keep
us
going
,
"
returned
Miss
Jenny
,
shrugging
her
shoulders
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
laid
a
cloth
upon
the
little
bench
(
more
handy
for
the
person
of
the
house
than
an
ordinary
table
)
,
and
put
upon
it
such
plain
fare
as
they
were
accustomed
to
have
,
and
drew
up
a
stool
for
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
for
supper
!
<EOS>
What
are
you
thinking
of
,
Jenny
darling
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
,
"
she
returned
,
coming
out
of
a
deep
study
,
"
what
I
would
do
to
Him
,
if
he
should
turn
out
a
drunkard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
he
wo
n't
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
take
care
of
that
,
beforehand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
try
to
take
care
of
it
beforehand
,
but
he
might
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
dear
,
all
those
fellows
with
their
tricks
and
their
manners
do
deceive
!
"
<EOS>
With
the
little
fist
in
full
action
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
so
,
I
tell
you
what
I
think
I
'd
do
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
asleep
,
I
'd
make
a
spoon
red
hot
,
and
I
'd
have
some
boiling
liquor
bubbling
in
a
saucepan
,
and
I
'd
take
it
out
hissing
,
and
I
'd
open
his
mouth
with
the
other
hand
---
or
perhaps
he
'd
sleep
with
his
mouth
ready
open
---
<EOS>
and
I
'd
pour
it
down
his
throat
,
and
blister
it
and
choke
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
would
do
no
such
horrible
thing
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
n't
I
?
<EOS>
Well
;
perhaps
I
should
n't
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
like
to
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
equally
sure
you
would
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
even
like
to
?
<EOS>
Well
,
you
generally
know
best
.
<EOS>
Only
you
have
n't
always
lived
among
it
as
I
have
lived
---
and
your
back
is
n't
bad
and
your
legs
are
not
queer
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
they
went
on
with
their
supper
,
Lizzie
tried
to
bring
her
round
to
that
prettier
and
better
state
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
charm
was
broken
.
<EOS>
The
person
of
the
house
was
the
person
of
a
house
full
of
sordid
shames
and
cares
,
with
an
upper
room
in
which
that
abased
figure
was
infecting
even
innocent
sleep
with
sensual
brutality
and
degradation
.
<EOS>
The
doll
's
dressmaker
had
become
a
little
quaint
shrew
;
of
the
world
,
worldly
;
of
the
earth
,
earthy
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
doll
's
dressmaker
!
<EOS>
How
often
so
dragged
down
by
hands
that
should
have
raised
her
up
;
how
often
so
misdirected
when
losing
her
way
on
the
eternal
road
,
and
asking
guidance
!
<EOS>
Poor
,
poor
little
doll
's
dressmaker
!
   
<EOS>
A
PIECE
OF
WORK
.
 
<EOS>
Britannia
,
sitting
meditating
one
fine
day
(
perhaps
in
the
attitude
in
which
she
is
presented
on
the
copper
coinage
)
,
discovers
all
of
a
sudden
that
she
wants
Veneering
in
Parliament
.
<EOS>
It
occurs
to
her
that
Veneering
is
"
a
representative
man
"
---
which
can
not
in
these
times
be
doubted
---
and
that
Her
Majesty
's
faithful
Commons
are
incomplete
without
him
.
<EOS>
So
,
Britannia
mentions
to
a
legal
gentleman
of
her
acquaintance
that
if
Veneering
will
"
put
down
"
five
thousand
pounds
,
he
may
write
a
couple
of
initial
letters
after
his
name
at
the
extremely
cheap
rate
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
per
letter
.
<EOS>
It
is
clearly
understood
between
Britannia
and
the
legal
gentleman
that
nobody
is
to
take
up
the
five
thousand
pounds
,
but
that
being
put
down
they
will
disappear
by
magical
conjuration
and
enchantment
.
  
<EOS>
The
legal
gentleman
in
Britannia
's
confidence
going
straight
from
that
lady
to
Veneering
,
thus
commissioned
,
Veneering
declares
himself
highly
flattered
,
but
requires
breathing
time
to
ascertain
"
whether
his
friends
will
rally
round
him
.
<EOS>
"
Above
all
things
,
he
says
,
it
behoves
him
to
be
clear
,
at
a
crisis
of
this
importance
,
"
whether
his
friends
will
rally
round
him
.
"
<EOS>
The
legal
gentleman
,
in
the
interests
of
his
client
can
not
allow
much
time
for
this
purpose
,
as
the
lady
rather
thinks
she
knows
somebody
prepared
to
put
down
six
thousand
pounds
;
but
he
says
he
will
give
Veneering
four
hours
.
  
<EOS>
Veneering
then
says
to
Mrs.
Veneering
,
"
We
must
work
,
"
and
throws
himself
into
a
Hansom
cab
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
in
the
same
moment
relinquishes
baby
to
Nurse
;
presses
her
aquiline
hands
upon
her
brow
,
to
arrange
the
throbbing
intellect
within
;
orders
out
the
carriage
;
and
repeats
in
a
distracted
and
devoted
manner
,
compounded
of
Ophelia
and
any
self
-
immolating
female
of
antiquity
you
may
prefer
,
"
We
must
work
.
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
having
instructed
his
driver
to
charge
at
the
Public
in
the
streets
,
like
the
Life
-
Guards
at
Waterloo
,
is
driven
furiously
to
Duke
Streets
,
Saint
James
's
.
<EOS>
There
,
he
finds
Twemlow
in
his
lodgings
,
fresh
from
the
hands
of
a
secret
artist
who
has
been
doing
something
to
his
hair
with
yolks
of
eggs
.
<EOS>
The
process
requiring
that
Twemlow
<EOS>
shall
,
for
two
hours
after
the
application
,
allow
his
hair
to
stick
upright
and
dry
gradually
,
he
is
in
an
appropriate
state
for
the
receipt
of
startling
intelligence
;
looking
equally
like
the
Monument
on
Fish
Street
Hill
,
and
King
Priam
on
a
certain
incendiary
occasion
not
wholly
unknown
as
a
neat
point
from
the
classics
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Twemlow
,
"
says
Veneering
,
grasping
both
his
hands
,
"
as
the
dearest
and
oldest
of
my
friends
---
"
  
(
"
Then
there
can
be
no
more
doubt
about
it
in
future
,
"
thinks
Twemlow
,
"
and
I
am
!
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
---
Are
you
of
opinion
that
your
cousin
,
Lord
Snigsworth
,
would
give
his
name
as
a
Member
of
my
Committee
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
go
so
far
as
to
ask
for
his
lordship
;
I
only
ask
for
his
name
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
he
would
give
me
his
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
sudden
low
spirits
,
Twemlow
replies
,
"
I
do
n't
think
he
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
political
opinions
,
"
says
Veneering
,
not
previously
aware
of
having
any
,
"
are
identical
with
those
of
Lord
Snigsworth
,
and
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
public
feeling
and
public
principle
,
Lord
Snigsworth
would
give
me
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
might
be
so
,
"
says
Twemlow
;
"
<EOS>
but
---
"
And
perplexedly
scratching
his
head
,
forgetful
of
the
yolks
of
eggs
,
is
the
more
discomfited
by
being
reminded
how
stickey
he
is
.
  
<EOS>
"
Between
such
old
and
intimate
friends
as
ourselves
,
"
pursues
Veneering
,
"
there
should
in
such
a
case
be
no
reserve
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
that
if
I
ask
you
to
do
anything
for
me
which
you
do
n't
like
to
do
,
or
feel
the
slightest
difficulty
in
doing
,
you
will
freely
tell
me
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
,
Twemlow
is
so
kind
as
to
promise
,
with
every
appearance
of
most
heartily
intending
to
keep
his
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
have
any
objection
to
write
down
to
Snigsworthy
Park
,
and
ask
this
favor
of
Lord
Snigsworth
?
<EOS>
Of
course
if
it
were
granted
I
should
know
that
I
owed
it
solely
to
you
;
while
at
the
same
time
you
would
put
it
to
Lord
Snigsworth
entirely
upon
public
grounds
.
<EOS>
Would
you
have
any
objection
?
"
  
<EOS>
Says
Twemlow
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
"
You
have
exacted
a
promise
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
,
my
dear
Twemlow
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
you
expect
me
to
keep
it
honorably
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
my
dear
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
whole
,
then
;
---
observe
me
,
"
urges
Twemlow
with
great
nicety
,
as
if
,
in
the
case
of
its
having
been
off
the
whole
,
he
would
have
done
it
directly
---
"
on
the
whole
,
I
must
beg
you
to
excuse
me
from
addressing
any
communication
to
Lord
Snigsworth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bless
you
,
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
says
Veneering
;
horribly
disappointed
,
but
grasping
him
by
both
hands
again
,
in
a
particularly
fervent
manner
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
poor
Twemlow
should
decline
to
inflict
a
letter
on
his
noble
cousin
(
who
has
gout
in
the
temper
)
,
inasmuch
as
his
noble
cousin
,
who
allows
him
a
small
annuity
on
which
he
lives
,
takes
it
out
of
him
,
as
the
phrase
goes
,
in
extreme
severity
;
 
putting
him
,
when
he
visits
at
Snigsworthy
Park
,
under
a
kind
of
martial
law
;
ordaining
that
he
shall
hang
his
hat
on
a
particular
peg
,
sit
on
a
particular
chair
,
talk
on
particular
subjects
to
particular
people
,
and
perform
particular
exercises
:
such
as
sounding
the
praises
of
the
Family
Varnish
(
not
to
say
Pictures
)
,
and
abstaining
from
the
choicest
of
the
Family
Wines
unless
expressly
invited
to
partake
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
thing
,
however
,
I
can
do
for
you
,
"
says
Twemlow
;
"
and
that
is
,
work
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
blesses
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
,
"
says
Twemlow
,
in
a
rising
hurry
of
spirits
,
"
to
the
club
;
---
let
us
see
now
;
what
o'clock
is
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Twenty
minutes
to
eleven
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
,
"
says
Twemlow
,
"
at
the
club
by
ten
minutes
to
twelve
,
and
I
'll
never
leave
it
all
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
feels
that
his
friends
are
rallying
round
him
,
and
says
,
"
Thank
you
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
knew
I
could
rely
upon
you
.
<EOS>
I
said
to
Anastatia
before
leaving
home
just
now
to
come
to
you
---
of
course
the
first
friend
I
have
seen
on
a
subject
so
momentous
to
me
,
my
dear
Twemlow
<EOS>
---
I
said
to
Anastatia
,
`
`
We
must
work
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
"
You
were
right
,
you
were
right
,
"
replies
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
.
<EOS>
Is
she
working
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
,
"
says
Veneering
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Twemlow
,
polite
little
gentleman
that
he
is
.
"
<EOS>
A
woman
's
tact
is
invaluable
.
<EOS>
To
have
the
dear
sex
with
us
,
is
to
have
everything
with
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
not
imparted
to
me
,
"
remarks
Veneering
,
"
what
you
think
of
my
entering
the
House
of
Commons
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
rejoins
Twemlow
,
feelingly
,
"
that
it
is
the
best
club
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
again
blesses
him
,
plunges
down
stairs
,
rushes
into
his
Hansom
,
and
directs
the
driver
to
be
up
and
at
the
British
Public
,
and
to
charge
into
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Twemlow
,
in
an
increasing
hurry
of
spirits
,
gets
his
hair
down
as
well
as
he
can
---
which
is
not
very
well
;
for
,
after
these
glutinous
applications
it
is
restive
,
and
has
a
surface
on
it
somewhat
in
the
nature
of
pastry
---
and
gets
to
the
club
by
the
appointed
time
.
<EOS>
At
the
club
he
promptly
secures
a
large
window
,
writing
materials
,
and
all
the
newspapers
,
and
establishes
himself
,
immoveable
,
to
be
respectfully
contemplated
by
Pall
Mall
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
when
a
man
enters
who
nods
to
him
,
Twemlow
says
,
"
Do
you
know
Veneering
?
"
 
<EOS>
Man
says
,
"
No
;
member
of
the
club
?
"
<EOS>
Twemlow
says
,
"
Yes
.
<EOS>
Coming
in
for
Pocket
-
Breaches
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Man
says
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Hope
he
may
find
it
worth
the
money
!
"
<EOS>
yawns
,
and
saunters
out
.
<EOS>
Towards
six
o'clock
of
the
afternoon
,
Twemlow
begins
to
persuade
himself
that
he
is
positively
jaded
with
work
,
and
thinks
it
much
to
be
regretted
that
he
was
not
brought
up
as
a
Parliamentary
agent
.
  
<EOS>
From
Twemlow
's
,
Veneering
dashes
at
Podsnap
's
place
of
business
.
<EOS>
Finds
Podsnap
reading
the
paper
,
standing
,
and
inclined
to
be
oratorical
over
the
astonishing
discovery
he
has
made
,
that
Italy
is
not
England
.
<EOS>
Respectfully
entreats
Podsnap
's
pardon
for
stopping
the
flow
of
his
words
of
wisdom
,
and
informs
him
what
is
in
the
wind
.
<EOS>
Tells
Podsnap
that
their
political
opinions
are
identical
.
<EOS>
Gives
Podsnap
to
understand
that
he
,
Veneering
,
formed
his
political
opinions
while
sitting
at
the
feet
of
him
,
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
Seeks
earnestly
to
know
whether
Podsnap
"
will
rally
round
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Says
Podsnap
,
something
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
first
of
all
,
Veneering
,
do
you
ask
my
advice
?
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
falters
that
as
so
old
and
so
dear
a
friend
---
   
"
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
all
very
well
<EOS>
,
"
says
Podsnap
;
"
but
have
you
made
up
your
mind
to
take
this
borough
of
Pocket
-
Breaches
on
its
own
terms
,
or
do
you
ask
my
opinion
whether
you
shall
take
it
or
leave
it
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
repeats
that
his
heart
's
desire
and
his
soul
's
thirst
are
,
that
Podsnap
shall
rally
round
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
be
plain
with
you
,
Veneering
,
"
says
Podsnap
,
knitting
his
brows
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
infer
that
I
do
n't
care
about
Parliament
,
from
the
fact
of
my
not
being
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
Why
,
of
course
Veneering
knows
that
!
<EOS>
Of
course
Veneering
knows
that
if
Podsnap
chose
to
go
there
,
he
would
be
there
,
in
a
space
of
time
that
might
be
stated
by
the
light
and
thoughtless
as
a
jiffy
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
worth
my
while
,
"
pursues
Podsnap
,
becoming
handsomely
mollified
,
"
and
it
is
the
reverse
of
important
to
my
position
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
my
wish
to
set
myself
up
as
law
for
another
man
,
differently
situated
.
<EOS>
You
think
it
is
worth
your
while
,
and
is
important
to
your
position
.
<EOS>
Is
that
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
Always
with
the
proviso
that
Podsnap
will
rally
round
him
,
Veneering
thinks
it
is
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
do
n't
ask
my
advice
,
"
says
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
.
<EOS>
Then
I
wo
n't
give
it
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
do
ask
my
help
.
<EOS>
Good
.
<EOS>
Then
I
'll
work
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
instantly
blesses
him
,
and
apprises
him
that
Twemlow
is
already
working
.
<EOS>
Podsnap
does
not
quite
approve
that
anybody
should
be
already
working
---
regarding
it
rather
in
the
light
of
a
liberty
 
---
but
tolerates
Twemlow
,
and
says
he
is
a
well
-
connected
old
female
who
will
do
no
harm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
very
particular
to
do
to
-
day
,
"
adds
Podsnap
,
"
and
I
'll
mix
with
some
influential
people
.
<EOS>
I
had
engaged
myself
to
dinner
,
but
I
'll
send
Mrs.
Podsnap
and
get
off
going
myself
,
and
I
'll
dine
with
you
at
eight
.
<EOS>
It
's
important
we
should
report
progress
and
compare
notes
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
me
see
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
have
a
couple
of
active
energetic
fellows
,
of
gentlemanly
manners
,
to
go
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
,
after
cogitation
,
thinks
of
Boots
and
Brewer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whom
I
have
met
at
your
house
,
"
says
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
They
'll
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
Let
them
each
have
a
cab
,
and
go
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
immediately
mentions
what
a
blessing
he
feels
it
,
to
possess
a
friend
capable
of
such
grand
administrative
suggestions
,
and
really
is
elated
at
this
going
about
of
Boots
and
Brewer
,
as
an
idea
wearing
an
electioneering
aspect
and
looking
desperately
like
business
.
<EOS>
Leaving
Podsnap
,
at
a
hand
-
gallop
,
he
descends
upon
Boots
and
Brewer
,
who
enthusiastically
rally
round
him
by
at
once
bolting
off
in
cabs
,
taking
opposite
directions
.
<EOS>
Then
Veneering
repairs
to
the
legal
gentleman
in
Britannia
's
confidence
,
and
with
him
transacts
some
delicate
affairs
of
business
,
and
issues
an
address
to
the
independent
electors
of
Pocket
-
Breaches
,
and
announcing
that
he
is
coming
among
them
for
their
suffrages
,
as
the
mariner
returns
to
the
home
of
his
early
childhood
:
a
phrase
which
is
none
the
worse
for
his
never
having
been
near
the
place
in
his
life
,
and
not
even
now
distinctly
knowing
where
it
is
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
,
during
the
same
eventful
hours
,
is
not
idle
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
does
the
carriage
turn
out
,
all
complete
,
than
she
turns
into
it
,
all
complete
,
and
gives
the
word
"
To
Lady
Tippins
's
.
"
<EOS>
That
charmer
dwells
over
a
staymaker
's
in
the
Belgravian
Borders
,
with
a
life
-
size
model
in
the
window
on
the
ground
floor
,
of
a
distinguished
beauty
in
a
blue
petticoat
,
stay
-
lace
in
hand
,
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
the
town
in
innocent
surprise
.
<EOS>
As
well
she
may
,
to
find
herself
dressing
under
the
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Tippins
at
home
?
<EOS>
Lady
Tippins
at
home
,
with
the
room
darkened
,
and
her
back
(
like
the
lady
's
at
the
ground
-
floor
window
,
though
for
a
different
reason
)
cunningly
turned
towards
the
light
.
<EOS>
Lady
Tippins
is
so
surprised
by
seeing
her
dear
Mrs.
Veneering
so
early
---
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
the
pretty
creature
calls
it
---
  
<EOS>
that
her
eyelids
almost
go
up
,
under
the
influence
of
that
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
To
whom
Mrs.
Veneering
incoherently
communicates
,
how
that
Veneering
has
been
offered
Pocket
-
Breaches
;
how
that
it
is
the
time
for
rallying
round
;
how
that
Veneering
has
said
"
We
must
work
"
;
 
how
that
she
is
here
,
as
a
wife
and
mother
,
to
entreat
Lady
Tippins
to
work
;
how
that
the
carriage
is
at
Lady
Tippins
's
disposal
for
purposes
of
work
;
how
that
she
,
proprietess
of
said
bran
new
elegant
equipage
,
will
return
home
on
foot
---
on
bleeding
feet
if
need
be
---
to
work
(
not
specifying
how
)
,
until
she
drops
by
the
side
of
baby
's
crib
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
says
Lady
Tippins
,
"
compose
yourself
;
we
'll
bring
him
in
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lady
Tippins
really
does
work
,
and
work
the
Veneering
horses
too
;
for
she
clatters
about
town
all
day
,
calling
upon
everybody
she
knows
,
and
showing
her
entertaining
powers
and
green
fan
to
immense
advantage
,
by
rattling
on
with
,
<EOS>
My
dear
soul
,
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
suppose
me
to
be
?
<EOS>
You
'll
never
guess
.
<EOS>
I
'm
pretending
to
be
an
electioneering
agent
.
<EOS>
And
for
what
places
?
<EOS>
Poce
of
all
Pocket
-
Breaches
.
<EOS>
And
why
?
<EOS>
Because
the
dearest
friend
I
have
in
the
world
has
bought
it
.
<EOS>
And
who
is
the
dearest
friend
I
have
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
A
man
of
the
name
of
Veneering
.
<EOS>
Not
omitting
his
wife
,
who
is
the
other
dearest
friend
I
have
in
the
world
;
and
I
positively
declare
I
forgot
their
baby
,
<EOS>
who
is
the
other
.
<EOS>
And
we
are
carrying
on
this
little
farce
to
keep
up
appearances
,
and
is
n't
it
refreshing
!
<EOS>
Then
,
my
precious
child
,
the
fun
of
it
is
that
nobody
knows
who
these
Veneerings
are
,
and
that
they
know
nobody
,
and
that
they
have
a
house
out
of
the
Tales
of
the
Genii
,
and
give
dinners
out
of
the
Arabian
Nights
.
<EOS>
Curious
to
see
'em
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
Say
you
'll
know
'em
.
<EOS>
Come
and
dine
with
'em
.
<EOS>
They
sha
n't
bore
you
.
<EOS>
Say
who
shall
meet
you
.
<EOS>
We
'll
make
up
a
party
of
our
own
,
and
I
'll
engage
that
they
shall
not
interfere
with
you
for
one
single
moment
.
<EOS>
You
really
ought
to
see
their
gold
and
silver
camels
.
<EOS>
I
call
their
dinner
-
table
,
the
Caravan
.
<EOS>
Do
come
and
dine
with
my
Veneerings
,
my
own
Veneerings
,
my
exclusive
property
,
the
dearest
friends
I
have
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
And
above
all
,
my
dear
,
be
sure
you
promise
me
your
vote
and
interest
and
all
sorts
of
plumpers
for
Pocket
-
Breaches
:
for
we
could
n't
think
of
spending
sixpence
on
it
,
my
love
,
and
can
only
consent
to
be
brought
in
by
the
spontaneous
thingummies
of
the
incorruptible
whatdoyoucallums

<EOS>
Now
,
the
point
of
view
seized
by
the
bewitching
Tippins
,
that
this
same
working
and
rallying
round
is
to
keep
up
appearances
,
may
have
something
in
it
,
but
not
all
the
truth
.
<EOS>
More
is
done
,
or
considered
to
be
done
---
which
does
as
well
---
by
taking
cabs
,
and
"
going
about
,
"
than
the
fair
Tippins
knew
of
.
<EOS>
Many
vast
vague
reputations
have
been
made
,
solely
by
taking
cabs
and
going
about
.
<EOS>
This
particularly
obtains
in
all
Parliamentary
affairs
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
business
in
hand
be
to
get
a
man
in
,
or
get
a
man
out
,
or
get
a
man
over
,
or
promote
a
railway
,
or
jockey
a
railway
,
or
what
else
,
nothing
is
understood
to
be
so
effectual
as
scouring
nowhere
in
a
violent
hurry
---
in
short
,
as
taking
cabs
and
going
about
.
  
<EOS>
Probably
because
this
reason
is
in
the
air
,
Twemlow
,
far
from
being
singular
in
his
persuasion
that
he
works
like
a
Trojan
,
is
capped
by
Podsnap
,
who
in
his
turn
is
capped
by
Boots
and
Brewer
.
<EOS>
At
eight
o'clock
,
when
all
these
hard
workers
assemble
to
dine
at
Veneering
's
,
it
is
understood
that
the
cabs
of
Boots
and
Brewer
must
n't
leave
the
door
,
but
that
pails
of
water
must
be
brought
from
the
nearest
baiting
-
place
,
and
cast
over
the
horses
'
legs
on
the
very
spot
,
lest
Boots
and
Brewer
should
have
instant
occasion
to
mount
and
away
.
<EOS>
Those
fleet
messengers
require
the
Analytical
to
see
that
their
hats
are
deposited
where
they
can
be
laid
hold
of
at
an
instant
's
notice
;
and
they
dine
(
remarkably
well
though
)
with
the
air
of
firemen
in
charge
of
an
engine
,
expecting
intelligence
of
some
tremendous
conflagration
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
faintly
remarks
,
as
dinner
opens
,
that
many
such
days
would
be
too
much
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Many
such
days
would
be
too
much
for
all
of
us
,
"
says
Podsnap
;
 
"
but
we
'll
bring
him
in
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
bring
him
in
,
"
says
Lady
Tippins
,
sportively
waving
her
green
fan
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Veneering
for
ever
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
bring
him
in
!
"
says
Twemlow
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
bring
him
in
!
"
<EOS>
say
Boots
and
Brewer
.
  
<EOS>
Strictly
speaking
,
it
would
be
hard
to
show
cause
why
they
should
not
bring
him
in
<EOS>
,
Pocket
-
Breaches
having
closed
its
little
bargain
,
and
there
being
no
opposition
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
is
agreed
that
they
must
"
work
"
 
to
the
last
,
and
that
if
they
did
not
work
,
something
indefinite
would
happen
.
<EOS>
It
is
likewise
agreed
that
they
are
all
so
exhausted
with
the
work
behind
them
,
and
need
to
be
so
fortified
for
the
work
before
them
,
as
to
require
peculiar
strengthening
from
Veneering
's
cellar
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
the
Analytical
has
orders
to
produce
the
cream
of
the
cream
of
his
binns
,
and
therefore
it
falls
out
that
rallying
becomes
rather
a
trying
word
for
the
occasion
;
Lady
Tippins
being
observed
gamely
to
inculcate
the
necessity
of
rearing
round
their
dear
Veneering
;
<EOS>
Podsnap
advocating
roaring
round
him
;
Boots
and
Brewer
declaring
their
intention
of
reeling
round
him
;
Boots
and
Veneering
thanking
his
devoted
friends
one
and
all
,
with
great
emotion
,
for
rarullarulling
round
him
.
  
<EOS>
In
these
inspiring
moments
,
Brewer
strikes
out
an
idea
which
is
the
great
hit
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
consults
his
watch
,
and
says
(
like
Guy
Fawkes
)
,
he
'll
now
go
down
to
the
House
of
Commons
and
see
how
things
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
keep
about
the
lobby
for
an
hour
or
so
,
"
says
Brewer
,
with
a
deeply
mysterious
countenance
,
"
and
if
things
look
well
,
I
wo
n't
come
back
,
but
will
order
my
cab
for
nine
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
do
better
,
"
says
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
Veneering
expresses
his
inability
ever
to
acknowledge
this
last
service
.
<EOS>
Tears
stand
in
Mrs.
Veneering
's
affectionate
eyes
.
<EOS>
Boots
shows
envy
,
loses
ground
,
and
is
regarded
as
possessing
a
second
-
rate
mind
.
<EOS>
They
all
crowd
to
the
door
,
to
see
Brewer
off
.
<EOS>
Brewer
says
to
his
driver
,
"
Now
,
is
your
horse
pretty
fresh
?
"
<EOS>
eyeing
the
animal
with
critical
scrutiny
.
<EOS>
Driver
says
he
's
as
fresh
as
butter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Put
him
along
then
,
"
says
Brewer
;
"
House
of
Commons
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Driver
darts
up
,
Brewer
leaps
in
,
they
cheer
him
as
he
departs
,
and
Mr.
Podsnap
says
,
"
Mark
my
words
,
sir
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
man
of
resource
;
that
's
a
man
to
make
his
way
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
time
comes
for
Veneering
to
deliver
a
neat
and
appropriate
stammer
to
the
men
of
Pocket
-
Breaches
,
only
Podsnap
and
Twemlow
accompany
him
by
railway
to
that
sequestered
spot
.
<EOS>
The
legal
gentleman
is
at
the
Pocket
-
Breaches
Branch
Station
,
with
an
open
carriage
with
a
printed
bill
"
Veneering
for
ever
"
stuck
upon
it
,
as
if
it
were
a
wall
;
and
they
gloriously
proceed
,
amidst
the
grins
of
the
populace
,
to
a
feeble
little
town
hall
on
crutches
,
with
some
onions
and
bootlaces
under
it
,
which
the
legal
gentleman
says
are
a
Market
;
and
from
the
front
window
of
that
edifice
<EOS>
Veneering
speaks
to
the
listening
earth
.
<EOS>
In
the
moment
of
his
taking
his
hat
off
,
Podsnap
,
as
per
agreement
made
with
Mrs.
Veneering
,
telegraphs
to
that
wife
and
mother
,
"
He
's
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
loses
his
way
in
the
usual
No
Thoroughfares
of
speech
,
and
Podsnap
and
Twemlow
say
Hear
hear
!
<EOS>
and
sometimes
,
when
he
ca
n't
by
any
means
back
himself
out
of
some
very
unlucky
No
Thoroughfare
,
"
He
-
a
-
a
-
r
He
-
a
-
a
-
r
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
an
air
of
facetious
conviction
,
as
if
the
ingenuity
of
the
thing
gave
them
a
sensation
of
exquisite
pleasure
.
<EOS>
But
Veneering
makes
two
remarkably
good
points
;
 
so
good
,
that
they
are
supposed
to
have
been
suggested
to
him
by
the
legal
gentleman
in
Britannia
's
confidence
,
while
briefly
conferring
on
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
Point
the
first
is
this
.
<EOS>
Veneering
institutes
an
original
comparison
between
the
country
,
and
a
ship
;
pointedly
calling
the
ship
,
the
Vessel
of
the
State
,
and
the
Minister
the
Man
at
the
Helm
.
<EOS>
Veneering
's
object
is
to
let
Pocket
-
Breaches
know
that
his
friend
on
his
right
<EOS>
(
Podsnap
)
is
a
man
of
wealth
.
<EOS>
Consequently
says
he
,
"
<EOS>
And
,
gentlemen
,
when
the
timbers
of
the
Vessel
of
the
State
are
unsound
and
the
Man
at
the
Helm
is
unskilful
,
would
those
great
Marine
Insurers
,
who
rank
among
our
world
-
famed
merchant
-
princes
---
  
would
they
insure
her
,
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
Would
they
underwrite
her
?
<EOS>
Would
they
incur
a
risk
in
her
?
<EOS>
Would
they
have
confidence
in
her
?
<EOS>
Why
,
gentlemen
,
if
I
appealed
to
my
honorable
friend
upon
my
right
,
himself
among
the
greatest
and
most
respected
of
that
great
and
much
respected
class
,
he
would
answer
No
!
"
  
<EOS>
Point
the
second
is
this
.
<EOS>
The
telling
fact
that
Twemlow
is
related
to
Lord
Snigsworth
,
must
be
let
off
.
<EOS>
Veneering
supposes
a
state
of
public
affairs
that
probably
never
could
by
any
possibility
exist
(
though
this
is
not
quite
certain
,
in
consequence
of
his
picture
being
unintelligible
to
himself
and
everybody
else
)
,
and
thus
proceeds
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
gentlemen
,
if
I
were
to
indicate
such
a
programme
to
any
class
of
society
,
I
say
it
would
be
received
with
derision
,
would
be
pointed
at
by
the
finger
of
scorn
.
<EOS>
If
I
indicated
such
a
programme
to
any
worthy
and
intelligent
tradesman
of
your
town
---
nay
,
I
will
here
be
personal
,
and
say
Our
town
---
what
would
he
reply
?
<EOS>
He
would
reply
,
`
`
Away
with
it
!
"
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
he
would
reply
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
In
his
honest
indignation
he
would
reply
,
`
`
Away
with
it
!
"
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
I
mounted
higher
in
the
social
scale
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
drew
my
arm
through
the
arm
of
my
respected
friend
upon
my
left
,
and
,
walking
with
him
through
the
ancestral
woods
of
his
family
,
and
under
the
spreading
beeches
of
Snigsworthy
Park
,
approached
the
noble
hall
,
crossed
the
courtyard
,
entered
by
the
door
,
went
up
the
staircase
,
and
,
passing
from
room
to
room
,
found
myself
at
last
in
the
august
presence
of
my
friend
's
near
kinsman
,
Lord
Snigsworth
.
<EOS>
And
suppose
I
said
to
that
venerable
earl
,
`
`
My
Lord
,
I
am
here
before
your
lordship
,
presented
by
your
lordship
's
near
kinsman
,
my
friend
upon
my
left
,
to
indicate
that
programme
;
"
"
what
would
his
lordship
answer
?
<EOS>
Why
,
he
would
answer
,
`
`
Away
with
it
!
"
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
That
's
what
he
would
answer
,
gentlemen
.
`
<EOS>
`
Away
with
it
!
"
<EOS>
"
Unconsciously
using
,
in
his
exalted
sphere
,
the
exact
language
of
the
worthy
and
intelligent
tradesman
of
our
town
,
the
near
and
dear
kinsman
of
my
friend
upon
my
left
would
answer
in
his
wrath
,
`
`
Away
with
it
!
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
Veneering
finishes
with
this
last
success
,
and
Mr.
Podsnap
telegraphs
to
Mrs.
Veneering
,
"
He
's
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
dinner
is
had
at
the
Hotel
with
the
legal
gentleman
,
and
then
there
are
in
due
succession
,
nomination
,
and
declaration
.
<EOS>
Finally
Mr.
Podsnap
telegraphs
to
Mrs.
Veneering
,
<EOS>
"
We
have
brought
him
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Another
gorgeous
dinner
awaits
them
on
their
return
to
the
Veneering
halls
,
and
Lady
Tippins
awaits
them
,
and
Boots
and
Brewer
await
them
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
modest
assertion
on
everybody
's
part
that
everybody
single
-
handed
"
brought
him
in
;
"
but
in
the
main
it
is
conceded
by
all
,
that
that
stroke
of
business
on
Brewer
's
part
,
in
going
down
to
the
house
that
night
to
see
how
things
looked
,
was
the
master
-
stroke
.
  
<EOS>
A
touching
little
incident
is
related
by
Mrs.
Veneering
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
is
habitually
disposed
to
be
tearful
,
and
has
an
extra
disposition
that
way
after
her
late
excitement
.
<EOS>
Previous
to
withdrawing
from
the
dinner
-
table
with
Lady
Tippins
,
she
says
,
in
a
pathetic
and
physically
weak
manner
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
all
think
it
foolish
of
me
,
I
know
,
but
I
must
mention
it
.
<EOS>
As
I
sat
by
Baby
's
crib
,
on
the
night
before
the
election
,
Baby
was
very
uneasy
in
her
sleep
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Analytical
chemist
,
who
is
gloomily
looking
on
,
has
diabolical
impulses
to
suggest
"
Wind
"
and
throw
up
his
situation
;
but
represses
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
an
interval
almost
convulsive
,
Baby
curled
her
little
hands
in
one
another
and
smiled
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
stopping
here
,
Mr.
Podsnap
deems
it
incumbent
on
him
to
say
:
"
I
wonder
why
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Could
it
be
,
I
asked
myself
,
"
says
Mrs.
Veneering
,
looking
about
her
for
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
"
that
the
Fairies
were
telling
Baby
that
her
papa
would
shortly
be
an
M.P.
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
overcome
by
the
sentiment
is
Mrs.
Veneering
,
that
they
all
get
up
to
make
a
clear
stage
for
Veneering
,
who
goes
round
the
table
to
the
rescue
,
and
bears
her
out
backward
,
with
her
feet
impressively
scraping
the
carpet
:
after
remarking
that
her
work
has
been
too
much
for
her
strength
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
fairies
made
any
mention
of
the
five
thousand
pounds
,
and
it
disagreed
with
Baby
,
is
not
speculated
upon
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
little
Twemlow
,
quite
done
up
,
is
touched
,
and
still
continues
touched
after
he
is
safely
housed
over
the
livery
-
stable
yard
in
Duke
Street
,
Saint
James
's
.
<EOS>
But
there
,
upon
his
sofa
,
a
tremendous
consideration
breaks
in
upon
the
mild
gentleman
,
putting
all
softer
considerations
to
the
rout
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gracious
heavens
!
<EOS>
Now
I
have
time
to
think
of
it
,
he
never
saw
one
of
his
constituents
in
all
his
days
,
until
we
saw
them
together
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
having
paced
the
room
in
distress
of
mind
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
the
innocent
Twemlow
returns
to
his
sofa
and
moans
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
either
go
distracted
,
or
die
,
of
this
man
.
<EOS>
He
comes
upon
me
too
late
in
life
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
strong
enough
to
bear
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
CUPID
PROMPTED
.
 
<EOS>
To
use
the
cold
language
of
the
world
,
Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle
rapidly
improved
the
acquaintance
of
Miss
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
To
use
the
warm
language
of
Mrs.
Lammle
,
she
and
her
sweet
Georgiana
soon
became
one
:
in
heart
,
in
mind
,
in
sentiment
,
in
soul
.
  
<EOS>
Whenever
Georgiana
could
escape
from
the
thraldom
of
Podsnappery
;
 
could
throw
off
the
bedclothes
of
the
custard
-
coloured
phaÎton
,
and
get
up
;
could
shrink
out
of
the
range
of
her
mother
's
rocking
,
and
(
so
to
speak
)
rescue
her
poor
little
frosty
toes
from
being
rocked
over
;
 
she
repaired
to
her
friend
,
Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Podsnap
by
no
means
objected
.
<EOS>
As
a
consciously
"
splendid
woman
,
"
accustomed
to
overhear
herself
so
denominated
by
elderly
osteologists
pursuing
their
studies
in
dinner
society
,
Mrs.
Podsnap
could
dispense
with
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Podsnap
,
for
his
part
,
on
being
informed
where
Georgiana
was
,
swelled
with
patronage
of
the
Lammles
.
<EOS>
That
they
,
when
unable
to
lay
hold
of
him
,
should
respectfully
grasp
at
the
hem
of
his
mantle
;
that
they
,
when
they
could
not
bask
in
the
glory
of
him
the
sun
,
should
take
up
with
the
pale
reflected
light
of
the
watery
young
moon
his
daughter
;
appeared
quite
natural
,
becoming
,
and
proper
.
<EOS>
It
gave
him
a
better
opinion
of
the
discretion
of
the
Lammles
than
he
had
heretofore
held
,
as
showing
that
they
appreciated
the
value
of
the
connexion
.
<EOS>
So
,
Georgiana
repairing
to
her
friend
,
Mr.
Podsnap
went
out
to
dinner
,
and
to
dinner
,
and
yet
to
dinner
,
arm
in
arm
with
Mrs.
Podsnap
:
settling
his
obstinate
head
in
his
cravat
and
shirt
-
collar
,
much
as
if
he
were
performing
on
the
Pandean
pipes
,
in
his
own
honor
,
the
triumphal
march
,
See
the
conquering
Podsnap
comes
,
Sound
the
trumpets
,
beat
the
drums
!
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
trait
in
Mr.
Podsnap
's
character
(
and
in
one
form
or
other
it
will
be
generally
seen
to
pervade
the
depths
and
shallows
of
Podsnappery
)
,
that
he
could
not
endure
a
hint
of
disparagement
of
any
friend
or
acquaintance
of
his
.
"
<EOS>
How
dare
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
would
seem
to
say
,
in
such
a
case
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
I
have
licensed
this
person
.
<EOS>
This
person
has
taken
out
my
certificate
.
<EOS>
Through
this
person
you
strike
at
me
,
Podsnap
the
Great
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
not
that
I
particularly
care
for
the
person
's
dignity
,
but
that
I
do
most
particularly
care
for
Podsnap
's
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hence
,
if
any
one
in
his
presence
had
presumed
to
doubt
the
responsibility
of
the
Lammles
,
he
would
have
been
mightily
huffed
.
<EOS>
Not
that
any
one
did
,
for
Veneering
,
M.P.
,
was
always
the
authority
for
their
being
very
rich
,
and
perhaps
believed
it
.
<EOS>
As
indeed
he
might
,
if
he
chose
,
for
anything
he
knew
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
's
house
in
Sackville
Street
,
Piccadilly
,
was
but
a
temporary
residence
.
<EOS>
It
had
done
well
enough
,
they
informed
their
friends
,
for
Mr.
Lammle
when
a
bachelor
,
but
it
would
not
do
now
.
<EOS>
So
,
they
were
always
looking
at
palatial
residences
in
the
best
situations
,
and
always
very
nearly
taking
or
buying
one
,
but
never
quite
concluding
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
Hereby
they
made
for
themselves
a
shining
little
reputation
apart
.
<EOS>
People
said
,
on
seeing
a
vacant
palatial
residence
,
"
The
very
thing
for
the
Lammles
!
"
and
wrote
to
the
Lammles
about
it
,
and
the
Lammles
always
went
to
look
at
it
,
but
unfortunately
it
never
exactly
answered
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
they
suffered
so
many
disappointments
,
that
they
began
to
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
build
a
palatial
residence
.
<EOS>
And
hereby
they
made
another
shining
reputation
;
many
persons
of
their
acquaintance
becoming
by
anticipation
dissatisfied
with
their
own
houses
,
and
envious
of
the
non
-
existent
Lammle
structure
.
  
<EOS>
The
handsome
fittings
and
furnishings
of
the
house
in
Sackville
Street
were
piled
thick
and
high
over
the
skeleton
up
-
stairs
,
and
if
it
ever
whispered
from
under
its
load
of
upholstery
,
"
<EOS>
Here
I
am
in
the
closet
!
<EOS>
"
it
was
to
very
few
ears
,
and
certainly
never
to
Miss
Podsnap
's
.
<EOS>
What
Miss
Podsnap
was
particularly
charmed
with
,
next
to
the
graces
of
her
friend
,
was
the
happiness
of
her
friend
's
married
life
.
<EOS>
This
was
frequently
their
theme
of
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
,
"
said
Miss
Podsnap
,
"
Mr.
Lammle
is
like
a
lover
.
<EOS>
At
least
I
<EOS>
---
I
should
think
he
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Georgiana
,
darling
!
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
holding
up
a
forefinger
,
"
Take
care
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
goodness
me
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Podsnap
,
reddening
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
said
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alfred
,
you
know
,
"
hinted
Mrs.
Lammle
,
playfully
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
never
to
say
Mr.
Lammle
any
more
,
Georgiana
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Alfred
,
then
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
it
's
no
worse
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
I
had
said
something
shocking
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
saying
something
wrong
to
ma
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
me
,
Georgiana
dearest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
to
you
;
you
are
not
ma
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
bestowed
a
sweet
and
loving
smile
upon
her
friend
,
which
Miss
Podsnap
returned
as
she
best
could
.
<EOS>
They
sat
at
lunch
in
Mrs.
Lammle
's
own
boudoir
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
dearest
Georgiana
,
Alfred
is
like
your
notion
of
a
lover
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
that
,
Sophronia
,
"
Georgiana
replied
,
beginning
to
conceal
her
elbows
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
any
notion
of
a
lover
.
<EOS>
The
dreadful
wretches
that
ma
brings
up
at
places
to
torment
me
,
are
not
lovers
.
<EOS>
I
only
mean
that
Mr.
---
"
  
"
Again
,
dearest
Georgiana
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
That
Alfred
---
"
  
"
Sounds
much
better
,
darling
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
---
Loves
you
so
.
<EOS>
He
always
treats
you
with
such
delicate
gallantry
and
attention
.
<EOS>
Now
,
do
n't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
with
a
rather
singular
expression
crossing
her
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
believe
that
he
loves
me
,
fully
as
much
as
I
love
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
happiness
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Miss
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
know
,
my
Georgiana
,
"
Mrs.
Lammle
resumed
presently
,
"
that
there
is
something
suspicious
in
your
enthusiastic
sympathy
with
Alfred
's
tenderness
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
no
,
I
hope
not
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
n't
it
rather
suggest
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
archly
,
"
that
my
Georgiana
's
little
heart
is
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Podsnap
blushingly
besought
her
.
"
<EOS>
Please
do
n't
!
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Sophronia
,
that
I
only
praise
Alfred
,
because
he
is
your
husband
and
so
fond
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sophronia
's
glance
was
as
if
a
rather
new
light
broke
in
upon
her
.
<EOS>
It
shaded
off
into
a
cool
smile
,
as
she
said
,
with
her
eyes
upon
her
lunch
,
and
her
eyebrows
raised
:
  
"
You
are
quite
wrong
,
my
love
,
in
your
guess
at
my
meaning
.
<EOS>
What
I
insinuated
was
,
that
my
Georgiana
's
little
heart
was
growing
conscious
of
a
vacancy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
have
anybody
say
anything
to
me
in
that
way
for
I
do
n't
know
how
many
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
what
way
,
my
Georgiana
?
"
inquired
Mrs.
Lammle
,
still
smiling
coolly
with
her
eyes
upon
her
lunch
,
and
her
eyebrows
raised
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
returned
poor
little
Miss
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
should
go
out
of
my
mind
,
Sophronia
,
with
vexation
and
shyness
and
detestation
,
if
anybody
did
.
<EOS>
It
's
enough
for
me
to
see
how
loving
you
and
your
husband
are
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
different
thing
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
bear
to
have
anything
of
that
sort
going
on
with
myself
.
<EOS>
I
should
beg
and
pray
to
---
to
have
the
person
taken
away
and
trampled
upon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
here
was
Alfred
.
<EOS>
Having
stolen
in
unobserved
,
he
playfully
leaned
on
the
back
of
Sophronia
's
chair
,
and
,
as
Miss
Podsnap
saw
him
,
put
one
of
Sophronia
's
wandering
locks
to
his
lips
,
and
waved
a
kiss
from
it
towards
Miss
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
about
husbands
and
detestations
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
captivating
Alfred
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
they
say
,
"
returned
his
wife
,
"
that
listeners
never
hear
any
good
of
themselves
;
though
you
---
but
pray
how
long
have
you
been
here
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
This
instant
arrived
,
my
own
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
may
go
on
---
though
if
you
had
been
here
but
a
moment
or
two
sooner
,
you
would
have
heard
your
praises
sounded
by
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
,
if
they
were
to
be
called
praises
at
all
which
I
really
do
n't
think
they
were
,
"
explained
Miss
Podsnap
in
a
flutter
,
"
for
being
so
devoted
to
Sophronia
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sophronia
!
"
murmured
Alfred
.
<EOS>
"
My
life
!
"
and
kissed
her
hand
.
<EOS>
In
return
for
which
she
kissed
his
watch
-
chain
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
not
I
who
was
to
be
taken
away
and
trampled
upon
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Alfred
,
drawing
a
seat
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
Georgiana
,
my
soul
,
"
replied
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Alfred
touchingly
appealed
to
Georgiana
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
was
nobody
,
"
replied
Miss
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
nonsense
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
are
determined
to
know
,
Mr.
Inquisitive
<EOS>
Pet
,
as
I
suppose
you
are
,
"
said
the
happy
and
fond
Sophronia
,
smiling
,
<EOS>
"
it
was
any
one
who
should
venture
to
aspire
to
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sophronia
,
my
love
,
"
remonstrated
Mr.
Lammle
,
becoming
graver
,
"
you
are
not
serious
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alfred
,
my
love
,
"
returned
his
wife
,
"
I
dare
say
Georgiana
was
not
,
but
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
this
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
,
"
shows
the
accidental
combinations
that
there
are
in
things
!
<EOS>
Could
you
believe
,
my
Ownest
,
that
I
came
in
here
with
the
name
of
an
aspirant
to
our
Georgiana
on
my
lips
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
could
believe
,
Alfred
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
anything
that
you
told
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
dear
one
!
<EOS>
And
I
anything
that
you
told
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
How
delightful
those
interchanges
,
and
the
looks
accompanying
them
!
<EOS>
Now
,
if
the
skeleton
up
-
stairs
had
taken
that
opportunity
,
for
instance
,
of
calling
out
"
Here
I
am
,
suffocating
in
the
closet
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
my
honor
,
my
dear
Sophronia
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
I
know
what
that
is
,
love
,
"
said
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
,
my
darling
---
that
I
came
into
the
room
all
but
uttering
young
Fledgeby
's
name
.
<EOS>
Tell
Georgiana
,
dearest
,
about
young
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
do
n't
!
<EOS>
Please
do
n't
!
"
cried
Miss
Podsnap
,
putting
her
fingers
in
her
ears
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
laughed
in
her
gayest
manner
,
and
,
removing
her
Georgiana
's
unresisting
hands
,
and
playfully
holding
them
in
her
own
at
arms
'
length
,
sometimes
near
together
and
sometimes
wide
apart
,
went
on
:
  
"
You
must
know
,
you
dearly
beloved
little
goose
,
that
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
certain
person
called
young
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
And
this
young
Fledgeby
,
who
was
of
an
excellent
family
and
rich
,
was
known
to
two
other
certain
persons
,
dearly
attached
to
one
another
and
called
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle
.
<EOS>
So
this
young
Fledgeby
,
being
one
night
at
the
play
,
there
sees
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle
,
a
certain
heroine
called
---
"
  
"
No
,
do
n't
say
Georgiana
Podsnap
!
"
<EOS>
pleaded
that
young
lady
almost
in
tears
.
<EOS>
"
Please
do
n't
.
<EOS>
Oh
do
do
do
say
somebody
else
!
<EOS>
Not
Georgiana
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
Oh
do
n't
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
other
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
laughing
airily
,
and
,
full
of
affectionate
blandishments
,
opening
and
closing
Georgiana
's
arms
like
a
pair
of
compasses
,
"
than
my
little
Georgiana
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
So
this
young
Fledgeby
goes
to
that
Alfred
Lammle
and
says
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
ple
-
e
-
e
-
ease
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Georgiana
,
as
if
the
supplication
were
being
squeezed
out
of
her
by
powerful
compression
.
<EOS>
"
I
so
hate
him
for
saying
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
saying
what
,
my
dear
?
"
laughed
Mrs.
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
what
he
said
,
"
cried
Georgiana
wildly
,
"
but
I
hated
him
all
the
same
for
saying
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
always
laughing
in
her
most
captivating
way
,
"
the
poor
young
fellow
<EOS>
only
says
that
he
is
stricken
all
of
a
heap
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
shall
I
ever
do
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
goodness
what
a
Fool
he
must
be
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
---
And
implores
to
be
asked
to
dinner
,
and
to
make
a
fourth
at
the
play
another
time
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
dines
to
-
morrow
and
goes
to
the
Opera
with
us
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
<EOS>
Except
,
my
dear
Georgiana
---
and
what
will
you
think
of
this
!
---
that
he
is
infinitely
shyer
than
you
,
and
far
more
afraid
of
you
than
you
ever
were
of
any
one
in
all
your
days
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
perturbation
of
mind
Miss
Podsnap
still
fumed
and
plucked
at
her
hands
a
little
,
but
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
notion
of
anybody
's
being
afraid
of
her
.
<EOS>
With
that
advantage
,
Sophronia
flattered
her
and
rallied
her
more
successfully
,
and
then
the
insinuating
Alfred
flattered
her
and
rallied
her
,
and
promised
that
at
any
moment
when
she
might
require
that
service
at
his
hands
,
he
would
take
young
Fledgeby
out
and
trample
on
him
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
remained
amicably
understood
that
young
Fledgeby
was
to
come
to
admire
,
and
that
Georgiana
was
to
come
to
be
admired
;
and
Georgiana
with
the
entirely
new
sensation
in
her
breast
of
having
that
prospect
before
her
,
and
with
many
kisses
from
her
dear
Sophronia
in
present
possession
,
preceded
six
feet
one
of
discontented
footman
(
an
amount
of
the
article
that
always
came
for
her
when
she
walked
home
)
to
her
father
's
dwelling
.
  
<EOS>
The
happy
pair
being
left
together
,
Mrs.
Lammle
said
to
her
husband
:
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
understand
this
girl
,
sir
,
your
dangerous
fascinations
have
produced
some
effect
upon
her
.
<EOS>
I
mention
the
conquest
in
good
time
because
I
apprehend
your
scheme
to
be
more
important
to
you
than
your
vanity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
mirror
on
the
wall
before
them
,
and
her
eyes
just
caught
him
smirking
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
gave
the
reflected
image
a
look
of
the
deepest
disdain
,
and
the
image
received
it
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
Next
moment
they
quietly
eyed
each
other
,
as
if
they
,
the
principals
,
had
had
no
part
in
that
expressive
transaction
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
that
Mrs.
Lammle
tried
in
some
manner
to
excuse
her
conduct
to
herself
by
depreciating
the
poor
little
victim
of
whom
she
spoke
with
acrimonious
contempt
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
too
that
in
this
she
did
not
quite
succeed
,
for
it
is
very
difficult
to
resist
confidence
,
and
she
knew
she
had
Georgiana
's
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
between
the
happy
pair
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
conspirators
who
have
once
established
an
understanding
,
may
not
be
overfond
of
repeating
the
terms
and
objects
of
their
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
Next
day
came
;
came
Georgiana
;
and
came
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
Georgiana
had
by
this
time
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
house
and
its
frequenters
.
<EOS>
As
there
was
a
certain
handsome
room
with
a
billiard
table
in
it
---
on
the
ground
floor
,
eating
out
a
backyard
---
which
might
have
been
Mr.
Lammle
's
office
,
or
library
,
but
was
called
by
neither
name
,
but
simply
Mr.
Lammle
's
room
,
so
it
would
have
been
hard
for
stronger
female
heads
than
Georgiana
's
to
determine
whether
its
frequenters
were
men
of
pleasure
or
men
of
business
.
<EOS>
Between
the
room
and
the
men
there
were
strong
points
of
general
resemblance
.
<EOS>
Both
were
too
gaudy
,
too
slangey
,
too
odorous
of
cigars
,
and
too
much
given
to
horseflesh
;
the
latter
characteristic
being
exemplified
in
the
room
by
its
decorations
,
and
in
the
men
by
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
High
-
stepping
horses
seemed
necessary
to
all
Mr.
Lammle
's
friends
---
as
necessary
as
their
transaction
of
business
together
in
a
gipsy
way
at
untimely
hours
of
the
morning
and
evening
,
and
in
rushes
and
snatches
.
<EOS>
There
were
friends
who
seemed
to
be
always
coming
and
going
across
the
Channel
,
on
errands
about
the
Bourse
,
and
Greek
and
Spanish
and
India
and
Mexican
and
par
and
premium
and
discount
and
three
quarters
and
seven
eighths
.
<EOS>
There
were
other
friends
who
seemed
to
be
always
lolling
and
lounging
in
and
out
of
the
City
,
on
questions
of
the
Bourse
,
and
Greek
and
Spanish
and
India
and
Mexican
and
par
and
premium
and
discount
and
three
quarters
and
seven
eighths
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
feverish
,
boastful
,
and
indefinably
loose
;
and
they
all
ate
and
drank
a
great
deal
;
and
made
bets
in
eating
and
drinking
.
<EOS>
They
all
spoke
of
sums
of
money
,
and
only
mentioned
the
sums
and
left
the
money
to
be
understood
;
as
"
five
and
forty
thousand
Tom
,
"
or
"
Two
hundred
and
twenty
-
two
on
every
individual
share
in
the
lot
Joe
.
<EOS>
"
They
seemed
to
divide
the
world
into
two
classes
of
people
;
people
who
were
making
enormous
fortunes
,
and
people
who
were
being
enormously
ruined
.
<EOS>
They
were
always
in
a
hurry
,
and
yet
seemed
to
have
nothing
tangible
to
do
;
except
a
few
of
them
(
these
,
mostly
asthmatic
and
thick
-
lipped
)
who
were
for
ever
demonstrating
to
the
rest
,
with
gold
pencil
-
cases
which
they
could
hardly
hold
because
of
the
big
rings
on
their
forefingers
,
how
money
was
to
be
made
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
they
all
swore
at
their
grooms
,
and
the
grooms
were
not
quite
as
respectful
or
complete
as
other
men
's
grooms
;
seeming
somehow
to
fall
short
of
the
groom
point
as
their
masters
fell
short
of
the
gentleman
point
.
  
<EOS>
Young
Fledgeby
was
none
of
these
.
<EOS>
Young
Fledgeby
had
a
peachy
cheek
,
or
a
cheek
compounded
of
the
peach
and
the
red
red
red
wall
on
which
it
grows
,
and
was
an
awkward
,
sandy
-
haired
,
small
-
eyed
youth
,
exceeding
slim
(
his
enemies
would
have
said
lanky
)
,
and
prone
to
self
-
examination
in
the
articles
of
whisker
and
moustache
.
<EOS>
While
feeling
for
the
whisker
that
he
anxiously
expected
,
Fledgeby
underwent
remarkable
fluctuations
of
spirits
,
ranging
along
the
whole
scale
from
confidence
to
despair
.
<EOS>
There
were
times
when
he
started
,
as
exclaiming
"
By
Jupiter
here
<EOS>
it
is
at
last
!
<EOS>
"
There
were
other
times
when
,
being
equally
depressed
,
he
would
be
seen
to
shake
his
head
,
and
give
up
hope
.
<EOS>
To
see
him
at
those
periods
leaning
on
a
chimneypiece
,
like
as
on
an
urn
containing
the
ashes
of
his
ambition
,
with
the
cheek
that
would
not
sprout
,
upon
the
hand
on
which
that
cheek
had
forced
conviction
,
was
a
distressing
sight
.
  
<EOS>
Not
so
was
Fledgeby
seen
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Arrayed
in
superb
raiment
,
with
his
opera
hat
under
his
arm
,
he
concluded
his
self
-
examination
hopefully
,
awaited
the
arrival
of
Miss
Podsnap
,
and
talked
small
-
talk
with
Mrs.
Lammle
.
<EOS>
In
facetious
homage
to
the
smallness
of
his
talk
,
and
the
jerky
nature
of
his
manners
,
Fledgeby
's
familiars
had
agreed
to
confer
upon
him
(
behind
his
back
)
<EOS>
the
honorary
title
of
Fascination
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Warm
weather
,
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
said
Fascination
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
thought
it
scarcely
as
warm
as
it
had
been
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
said
Fascination
Fledgeby
,
with
great
quickness
of
repartee
;
"
but
I
expect
it
will
be
devilish
warm
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
threw
off
another
little
scintillation
.
"
<EOS>
Been
out
to
-
day
,
Mrs.
Lammle
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
answered
,
for
a
short
drive
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
people
,
"
said
Fascination
Fledgeby
,
"
are
accustomed
to
take
long
drives
;
but
it
generally
appears
to
me
that
if
they
make
'em
too
long
,
they
overdo
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Being
in
such
feather
,
he
might
have
surpassed
himself
in
his
next
sally
,
had
not
Miss
Podsnap
been
announced
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
flew
to
embrace
her
darling
little
Georgy
,
and
when
the
first
transports
were
over
,
presented
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
came
on
the
scene
last
,
for
he
was
always
late
,
and
so
were
the
frequenters
always
late
;
all
hands
being
bound
to
be
made
late
,
by
private
information
about
the
Bourse
,
and
Greek
and
Spanish
and
India
and
Mexican
and
par
and
premium
and
discount
and
three
quarters
and
seven
eighths
.
  
<EOS>
A
handsome
little
dinner
was
served
immediately
,
and
Mr.
Lammle
sat
sparkling
at
his
end
of
the
table
,
with
his
servant
behind
his
chair
,
and
his
ever
-
lingering
doubts
upon
the
subject
of
his
wages
behind
himself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
's
utmost
powers
of
sparkling
were
in
requisition
to
-
day
,
for
Fascination
Fledgeby
and
Georgiana
not
only
struck
each
other
speechless
,
but
struck
each
other
into
astonishing
attitudes
;
Georgiana
,
as
she
sat
facing
Fledgeby
,
making
such
efforts
to
conceal
her
elbows
as
were
totally
incompatible
with
the
use
of
a
knife
and
fork
;
and
Fledgeby
,
as
he
sat
facing
Georgiana
,
avoiding
her
countenance
by
every
possible
device
,
and
betraying
the
discomposure
of
his
mind
in
feeling
for
his
whiskers
with
his
spoon
,
his
wine
glass
,
and
his
bread
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle
had
to
prompt
,
and
this
is
how
they
prompted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Georgiana
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
,
low
and
smiling
,
and
sparkling
all
over
,
like
a
harlequin
;
"
you
are
not
in
your
usual
spirits
.
<EOS>
Why
are
you
not
in
your
usual
spirits
,
Georgiana
?
"
  
<EOS>
Georgiana
faltered
that
she
was
much
the
same
as
she
was
in
general
;
she
was
not
aware
of
being
different
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
aware
of
being
different
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
my
dear
Georgiana
!
<EOS>
who
are
always
so
natural
and
unconstrained
with
us
!
<EOS>
who
are
such
a
relief
from
the
crowd
that
are
all
alike
!
<EOS>
who
are
the
embodiment
of
gentleness
,
simplicity
,
and
reality
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Podsnap
looked
at
the
door
,
as
if
she
entertained
confused
thoughts
of
taking
refuge
from
these
compliments
in
flight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
will
be
judged
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
,
raising
his
voice
a
little
,
"
by
my
friend
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
   
DON'T
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Podsnap
faintly
ejaculated
:
when
Mrs.
Lammle
took
the
prompt
-
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Alfred
,
my
dear
,
but
I
can
not
part
with
Mr.
Fledgeby
quite
yet
;
you
must
wait
for
him
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
and
I
are
engaged
in
a
personal
discussion
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fledgeby
must
have
conducted
it
on
his
side
with
immense
art
,
for
no
appearance
of
uttering
one
syllable
had
escaped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
personal
discussion
,
Sophronia
,
my
love
?
<EOS>
What
discussion
?
<EOS>
Fledgeby
,
I
am
jealous
.
<EOS>
What
discussion
,
Fledgeby
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
him
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
Trying
too
look
as
if
he
knew
anything
about
it
,
Fascination
replied
,
"
Yes
,
tell
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
were
discussing
then
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
if
you
must
know
,
Alfred
,
whether
Mr.
Fledgeby
was
in
his
usual
flow
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
is
the
very
point
,
Sophronia
,
that
Georgiana
and
I
were
discussing
as
to
herself
!
<EOS>
What
did
Fledgeby
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
a
likely
thing
,
sir
,
that
I
am
going
to
tell
you
everything
,
and
be
told
nothing
!
<EOS>
What
did
Georgiana
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Georgiana
said
she
was
doing
her
usual
justice
to
herself
to
-
day
,
and
I
said
she
was
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Precisely
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
what
I
said
to
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
"
  
<EOS>
Still
,
it
would
n't
do
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
look
at
one
another
.
<EOS>
No
,
not
even
when
the
sparkling
host
proposed
that
the
quartette
should
take
an
appropriately
sparkling
glass
of
wine
.
<EOS>
Georgiana
looked
from
her
wine
glass
at
Mr.
Lammle
and
at
Mrs.
Lammle
;
but
might
n't
,
could
n't
,
should
n't
,
would
n't
,
look
at
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
Fascination
looked
from
his
wine
glass
at
Mrs.
Lammle
and
at
Mr.
Lammle
;
but
might
n't
,
could
n't
,
should
n't
,
would
n't
,
look
at
Georgiana
.
  
<EOS>
More
prompting
was
necessary
.
<EOS>
Cupid
must
be
brought
up
to
the
mark
.
<EOS>
The
manager
had
put
him
down
in
the
bill
for
the
part
,
and
he
must
play
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sophronia
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
,
"
I
do
n't
like
the
colour
of
your
dress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
appeal
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
to
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
I

said
Mr.
Lammle
,
"
to
Georgiana

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Georgy
,
my

remarked
Mrs.
Lammle
aside
to
her
dear
girl
,
"
I
rely
upon
you
not
to
go
over
to
the
opposition
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fascination
wished
to
know
if
the
colour
were
not
called
rose
-
colour
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
said
Mr.
Lammle
;
actually
he
knew
everything
;
it
was
really
rose
-
colour
.
<EOS>
Fascination
took
rose
-
colour
to
mean
the
colour
of
roses
.
<EOS>
(
In
this
he
was
very
warmly
supported
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
.
)
<EOS>
Fascination
had
heard
the
term
Queen
of
Flowers
applied
to
the
Rose
.
<EOS>
Similarly
,
it
might
be
said
that
the
dress
was
the
Queen
of
Dresses
.
<EOS>
(
"
Very
happy
,
Fledgeby
!
"
from
Mr.
Lammle
.
)
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
,
Fascination
's
opinion
was
that
we
all
had
our
eyes
---
or
at
least
a
large
majority
of
us
---
and
that
---
and
---
and
his
further
opinion
was
several
ands
,
with
nothing
beyond
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
to
desert
me
in
that
way

<EOS>
Oh

Mr.
Fledgeby

abandon
my

declare
for
blue

!
"
cried
Mr.
Lammle
;
"
your
dress
is
condemned
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
stealing
her
affectionate
hand
towards
her
dear
girl
's
,
"
what
does
Georgy
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
She
says
,
"
replied
Mr.
Lammle
,
interpreting
for
her
,
"
that
in
her
eyes
you
look
well
in
any
colour
,
Sophronia
,
and
that
if
she
had
expected
to
be
embarrassed
by
so
pretty
a
compliment
as
she
has
received
,
she
would
have
worn
another
colour
herself
.
<EOS>
Though
I
tell
her
,
in
reply
,
that
it
would
not
have
saved
her
,
for
whatever
colour
she
had
worn
would
have
been
Fledgeby
's
colour
.
<EOS>
But
what
does
Fledgeby
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Lammle
,
interpreting
for
him
,
and
patting
the
back
of
her
dear
girl
's
hand
,
as
if
it
were
Fledgeby
who
was
patting
it
,
"
that
it
was
no
compliment
,
but
a
little
natural
act
of
homage
that
he
could
n't
resist
.
<EOS>
And
,
"
expressing
more
feeling
as
if
it
were
more
feeling
on
the
part
of
Fledgeby
,
"
he
is
right
,
he
is
right
!
"
  
<EOS>
Still
,
no
not
even
now
,
would
they
look
at
one
another
.
<EOS>
Seeming
to
gnash
his
sparkling
teeth
,
studs
,
eyes
,
and
buttons
,
all
at
once
,
Mr.
Lammle
secretly
bent
a
dark
frown
on
the
two
,
expressive
of
an
intense
desire
to
bring
them
together
by
knocking
their
heads
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
this
opera
of
to
-
night
,
Fledgeby
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
stopping
very
short
,
to
prevent
himself
from
running
on
into
"
confound
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
no
,
not
exactly
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
fact
I
do
n't
know
a
note
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
do
you
know
it
,
Georgy
?
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
N
-
no
,
"
replied
Georgiana
,
faintly
,
under
the
sympathetic
coincidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
charmed
by
the
discovery
which
flowed
from
the
premises
,
"
you
neither
of
you
know
it
!
<EOS>
How
charming
!
"
  
<EOS>
Even
the
craven
Fledgeby
felt
that
the
time
was
now
come
when
he
must
strike
a
blow
.
<EOS>
He
struck
it
by
saying
,
partly
to
Mrs.
Lammle
and
partly
to
the
circumambient
air
,
"
I
consider
myself
very
fortunate
in
being
reserved
by
---
"
  
As
he
stopped
dead
,
Mr.
Lammle
,
making
that
gingerous
bush
of
his
whiskers
to
look
out
of
,
offered
him
the
word
"
Destiny
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
was
n't
going
to
say
that
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
say
Fate
.
<EOS>
I
consider
it
very
fortunate
that
Fate
has
written
in
the
book
of
---
in
the
book
which
is
its
own
property
---
that
I
should
go
to
that
opera
for
the
first
time
under
the
memorable
circumstances
of
going
with
Miss
Podsnap
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
which
Georgiana
replied
,
hooking
her
two
little
fingers
in
one
another
,
and
addressing
the
tablecloth
,
"
Thank
you
,
but
I
generally
go
with
no
one
<EOS>
but
you
,
Sophronia
,
and
I
like
that
very
much
.
"
  
<EOS>
Content
perforce
with
this
success
for
the
time
,
Mr.
Lammle
let
Miss
Podsnap
out
of
the
room
,
as
if
he
were
opening
her
cage
door
,
and
Mrs.
Lammle
followed
.
<EOS>
Coffee
being
presently
served
up
stairs
,
he
kept
a
watch
on
Fledgeby
until
Miss
Podsnap
's
cup
was
empty
,
and
then
directed
him
with
his
finger
(
as
if
that
young
gentleman
were
a
slow
Retriever
)
to
go
and
fetch
it
.
<EOS>
This
feat
he
performed
,
not
only
without
failure
,
but
even
with
the
original
embellishment
of
informing
Miss
Podsnap
that
green
tea
was
considered
bad
for
the
nerves
.
<EOS>
Though
there
Miss
Podsnap
unintentionally
threw
him
out
by
faltering
,
"
Oh
,
is
it
indeed
?
<EOS>
How
does
it
act
?
<EOS>
"
Which
he
was
not
prepared
to
elucidate
.
  
<EOS>
The
carriage
announced
,
Mrs.
Lammle
said
,
"
Do
n't
mind
me
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
my
skirts
and
cloak
occupy
both
my
hands
,
take
Miss
Podsnap
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
took
her
,
and
Mrs.
Lammle
went
next
,
and
Mr.
Lammle
went
last
,
savagely
following
his
little
flock
,
like
a
drover
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
all
sparkle
and
glitter
in
the
box
at
the
Opera
,
and
there
he
and
his
dear
wife
made
a
conversation
between
Fledgeby
and
Georgiana
in
the
following
ingenious
and
skilful
manner
.
<EOS>
They
sat
in
this
order
:
Mrs.
Lammle
,
Fascination
Fledgeby
,
Georgiana
,
Mr.
Lammle
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
made
leading
remarks
to
Fledgeby
,
only
requiring
monosyllabic
replies
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
did
the
like
with
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
At
times
Mrs.
Lammle
would
lean
forward
to
address
Mr.
Lammle
to
this
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Alfred
,
my
dear
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
very
justly
says
,
apropos
of
the
last
scene
,
that
true
constancy
would
not
require
any
such
stimulant
as
the
stage
deems
necessary
.
"
<EOS>
To
which
Mr.
Lammle
would
reply
,
"
Ay
,
Sophronia
,
my
love
,
but
as
Georgiana
has
observed
to
me
,
the
lady
had
no
sufficient
reason
to
know
the
state
of
the
gentleman
's
affections
.
<EOS>
"
To
which
Mrs.
Lammle
would
rejoin
,
"
Very
true
,
Alfred
;
but
Mr.
Fledgeby
points
out
,
"
this
.
<EOS>
To
which
Alfred
would
demur
:
"
Undoubtedly
,
Sophronia
,
but
Georgiana
acutely
remarks
,
"
 
that
.
<EOS>
Through
this
device
the
two
young
people
conversed
at
great
length
and
committed
themselves
to
a
variety
of
delicate
sentiments
,
without
having
once
opened
their
lips
,
save
to
say
yes
or
no
,
and
even
that
not
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
Fledgeby
took
his
leave
of
Miss
Podsnap
at
the
carriage
door
,
and
the
Lammles
dropped
her
at
her
own
home
,
and
on
the
way
Mrs.
Lammle
archly
rallied
her
,
in
her
fond
and
protecting
manner
,
by
saying
at
intervals
,
"
Oh
little
Georgiana
,
little
Georgiana
!
"
 
<EOS>
Which
was
not
much
;
but
the
tone
added
,
`
`
You
have
enslaved
your
Fledgeby
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
thus
the
Lammles
got
home
at
last
,
and
the
lady
sat
down
moody
and
weary
,
looking
at
her
dark
lord
engaged
in
a
deed
of
violence
with
a
bottle
of
soda
-
water
as
though
he
were
wringing
the
neck
of
some
unlucky
creature
and
pouring
its
blood
down
his
throat
.
<EOS>
As
he
wiped
his
dripping
whiskers
in
an
ogreish
way
,
he
met
her
eyes
,
and
pausing
,
said
,
with
no
very
gentle
voice
:
  
"
Well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
such
an
absolute
Booby
necessary
to
the
purpose
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
I
am
doing
.
<EOS>
He
is
no
such
dolt
as
you
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
genius
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
sneer
,
perhaps
;
and
you
take
a
lofty
air
upon
yourself
,
perhaps
!
<EOS>
But
I
tell
you
this
:
---
<EOS>
when
that
young
fellow
's
interest
is
concerned
,
he
holds
as
tight
as
a
horse
-
leech
.
<EOS>
When
money
is
in
question
with
that
young
fellow
,
he
is
a
match
for
the
Devil
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
a
match
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
.
<EOS>
Almost
as
good
a
one
as
you
thought
me
for
you
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
quality
of
youth
in
him
,
but
such
as
you
have
seen
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Touch
him
upon
money
,
and
you
touch
no
booby
then
.
<EOS>
He
really
is
a
dolt
,
I
suppose
,
in
other
things
;
but
it
answers
his
one
purpose
very
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Has
she
money
in
her
own
right
in
any
case
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
she
has
money
in
her
own
right
in
any
case
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
so
well
to
-
day
,
Sophronia
,
that
I
answer
the
question
,
<EOS>
though
you
know
I
object
to
any
such
questions
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
so
well
to

day
,
Sophronia
,
that
you
must
be
tired
.
<EOS>
Get
to
bed

<EOS>
MERCURY
PROMPTING
 
<EOS>
Fledgeby
deserved
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
's
eulogium
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
meanest
cur
existing
,
with
a
single
pair
of
legs
.
<EOS>
And
instinct
(
a
word
we
all
clearly
understand
)
going
largely
on
four
legs
,
and
reason
always
on
two
,
meanness
on
four
legs
never
attains
the
perfection
of
meanness
on
two
.
  
<EOS>
The
father
of
this
young
gentleman
had
been
a
money
-
lender
,
who
had
transacted
professional
business
with
the
mother
of
this
young
gentleman
,
when
he
,
the
latter
,
was
waiting
in
the
vast
dark
ante
-
chambers
of
the
present
world
to
be
born
.
<EOS>
The
lady
,
a
widow
,
being
unable
to
pay
the
money
-
lender
,
married
him
;
and
in
due
course
,
Fledgeby
was
summoned
out
of
the
vast
dark
ante
-
chambers
to
come
and
be
presented
to
the
Registrar
-
General
.
<EOS>
Rather
a
curious
speculation
how
Fledgeby
would
otherwise
have
disposed
of
his
leisure
until
Doomsday
.
  
<EOS>
Fledgeby
's
mother
offended
her
family
by
marrying
Fledgeby
's
father
.
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
the
easiest
achievements
in
life
to
offend
your
family
when
your
family
want
to
get
rid
of
you
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
's
mother
's
family
had
been
very
much
offended
with
her
for
being
poor
,
and
broke
with
her
for
becoming
comparatively
rich
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
's
mother
's
family
was
the
Snigsworth
family
.
<EOS>
She
had
even
the
high
honour
to
be
cousin
to
Lord
Snigsworth
<EOS>
---
so
many
times
removed
that
the
noble
Earl
would
have
had
no
compunction
in
removing
her
one
time
more
and
dropping
her
clean
outside
the
cousinly
pale
;
but
cousin
for
all
that
.
  
<EOS>
Among
her
pre
-
matrimonial
transactions
with
Fledgeby
's
father
,
Fledgeby
's
mother
had
raised
money
of
him
at
a
great
disadvantage
on
a
certain
reversionary
interest
.
<EOS>
The
reversion
falling
in
soon
after
they
were
married
,
Fledgeby
's
father
laid
hold
of
the
cash
for
his
separate
use
and
benefit
.
<EOS>
This
led
to
subjective
differences
of
opinion
,
not
to
say
objective
interchanges
of
boot
-
jacks
,
backgammon
boards
,
and
other
such
domestic
missiles
,
between
Fledgeby
's
father
and
Fledgeby
's
mother
,
and
those
led
to
Fledgeby
's
mother
spending
as
much
money
as
she
could
,
and
to
Fledgeby
's
father
doing
all
he
could
n't
to
restrain
her
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
's
childhood
had
been
,
in
consequence
,
a
stormy
one
;
but
the
winds
and
the
waves
had
gone
down
in
the
grave
,
and
Fledgeby
flourished
alone
.
  
<EOS>
He
lived
in
chambers
in
the
Albany
,
did
Fledgeby
,
and
maintained
a
spruce
appearance
.
<EOS>
But
his
youthful
fire
was
all
composed
of
sparks
from
the
grindstone
;
and
as
the
sparks
flew
off
,
went
out
,
and
never
warmed
anything
,
be
sure
that
Fledgeby
had
his
tools
at
the
grindstone
,
and
turned
it
with
a
wary
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
came
round
to
the
Albany
to
breakfast
with
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
Present
on
the
table
,
one
scanty
pot
of
tea
,
one
scanty
loaf
,
two
scanty
pats
of
butter
,
two
scanty
rashers
of
bacon
,
two
pitiful
eggs
,
and
an
abundance
of
handsome
china
bought
a
second
-
hand
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
think
of
Georgiana
?
"
asked
Mr.
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
very
deliberately
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
,
my
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
misunderstand
me
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
I
'll
tell
you
that
.
<EOS>
I
mean
I
'll
tell
you
something
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
anything
,
old
fellow
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
there
you
misunderstand
me
again
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
I
'll
tell
you
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
sparkled
at
him
,
but
frowned
at
him
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
deep
and
you
're
ready
.
<EOS>
Whether
I
am
deep
or
not
,
never
mind
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
ready
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
do
one
thing
,
Lammle
,
I
can
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
And
I
intend
always
doing
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
long
-
headed
fellow
,
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
be
,
or
may
not
be
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
a
short
-
tongued
fellow
,
it
may
amount
to
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Lammle
,
I
am
never
going
to
answer
questions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
it
was
the
simplest
question
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
so
,
but
things
are
not
always
what
they
seem
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
man
examined
as
a
witness
in
Westminster
Hall
.
<EOS>
Questions
put
to
him
seemed
the
simplest
in
the
world
,
but
turned
out
to
be
anything
rather
than
that
,
after
he
had
answered
'em
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Then
he
should
have
held
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
held
his
tongue
he
would
have
kept
out
of
scrapes
that
he
got
into
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
held
my
tongue
,
you
would
never
have
seen
the
subject
of
my
question
,
"
remarked
Lammle
,
darkening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Lammle
,
"
said
Fascination
Fledgeby
,
calmly
feeling
for
his
whisker
,
"
it
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
be
led
on

<EOS>
I
ca
n't
manage
a
discussion
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
manage
to
hold
my
tongue
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
fell
back
upon
propitiation
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
you
could
!
<EOS>
Why
,
when
these
fellows
of
our
acquaintance
drink
and
you
drink
with
them
,
the
more
talkative
they
get
,
the
more
silent
you
get
.
<EOS>
The
more
they
let
out
,
the
more
you
keep
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
object
,
Lammle
,
"
returned
Fledgeby
,
with
an
internal
chuckle
,
"
to
being
understood
,
though
I
object
to
being
questioned
.
<EOS>
That
certainly
is
the
way
I
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
all
the
rest
of
us
are
discussing
our
ventures
,
none
of
us
ever
know
what
a
single
venture
of
yours
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
none
of
you
ever
will
from
me
,
Lammle
,
"
replied
Fledgeby
,
with
another
internal
chuckle
;
"
that
certainly
is
the
way
I
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
of
course
it
is
,
I
know
!
"
rejoined
Lammle
,
with
a
flourish
of
frankness
,
and
a
laugh
,
and
stretching
out
his
hands
as
if
to
show
the
universe
a
remarkable
man
in
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
n't
known
it
of
my
Fledgeby
,
should
I
have
proposed
our
little
compact
of
advantage
,
to
my
Fledgeby
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
remarked
Fascination
,
shaking
his
head
slyly
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
not
to
be
got
at
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
vain
.
<EOS>
That
sort
of
vanity
do
n't
pay
,
Lammle
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
Compliments
only
make
me
hold
my
tongue
the

"
  
<EOS>
Alfred
Lammle
pushed
his
plate
away
(
no
great
sacrifice
under
the
circumstances
of
there
being
so
little
in
it
)
,
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
and
contemplated
Fledgeby
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Then
he
slowly
released
his
left
hand
from
its
pocket
,
and
made
that
bush
of
his
whiskers
,
still
contemplating
him
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Then
he
slowly
broke
silence
,
and
slowly
said
:
"
What
---
<EOS>
the
---
  
Dev
-
il
is
this
fellow
about
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Now
,
look
here
,
Lammle
,
"
said
Fascination
Fledgeby
,
with
the
meanest
of
twinkles
in
his
meanest
of
eyes
:
which
were
too
near
together
,
by
the
way
:
<EOS>
"
look
here
,
Lammle
;
I
am
very
well
aware
that
I
did
n't
show
to
advantage
last
night
,
and
that
you
and
your
wife
---
  
<EOS>
who
,
I
consider
,
is
a
very
clever
woman
and
an
agreeable
woman
---
  
did
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
calculated
to
show
to
advantage
under
that
sort
of
circumstances
.
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
you
two
did
show
to
advantage
,
and
managed
capitally
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
you
on
that
account
come
talking
to
me
as
if
I
was
your
doll
and
puppet
,
because
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
all
this
,
"
cried
Alfred
,
after
studying
with
a
look
the
meanness
that
was
fain
to
have
the
meanest
help
,
and
yet
was
<EOS>
so
mean
as
to
turn
upon
it
:
"
all
this
because
of
one
simple
natural
question
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
waited
till
I
thought
proper
to
say
something
about
it
of
myself
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
your
coming
over
me
with
your
Georgianas
,
as
if
you
was
her
proprietor
and
mine
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
when
you
are
in
the
gracious
mind
to
say
anything
about
it
of
yourself
,
"
retorted
Lammle
,
"
pray
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
you
managed
capitally
.
<EOS>
You
and
your
wife
both
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
go
on
managing
capitally
,
I
'll
go
on
doing
my
part
.
<EOS>
Only
do
n't
crow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
crow
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lammle
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
  
<EOS>
"
Or
,
"
pursued
the
other
---
"
or
take
it
in
your
head
that
people
are
your
puppets
because
they
do
n't
come
out
to
advantage
at
the
particular
moments
when
you
do
,
with
the
assistance
of
a
very
clever
and
agreeable
wife
.
<EOS>
All
the
rest
keep
on
doing
,
and
let
Mrs.
Lammle
keep
on
doing
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
have
held
my
tongue
when
I
thought
proper
,
and
I
have
spoken
when
I
thought
proper
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
that
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
question
is
,
"
proceeded
Fledgeby
,
with
the
greatest
reluctance
,
"
will
you
have
another
egg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
wo
n't
,
"
said
Lammle
,
shortly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
're
right
and
will
find
yourself
better
without
it
,
"
 
replied
Fascination
,
in
greatly
improved
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
ask
you
if
you
'll
have
another
rasher
would
be
unmeaning
flattery
,
for
it
would
make
you
thirsty
all
day
.
<EOS>
Will
you
have
some
more
bread
and
butter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
wo
n't
,
"
repeated
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
,
"
said
Fascination
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
not
a
mere
retort
for
the
sound
's
sake
,
but
was
a
cheerful
cogent
consequence
of
the
refusal
;
for
if
Lammle
had
applied
himself
again
to
the
loaf
,
it
would
have
been
so
heavily
visited
,
in
Fledgeby
's
opinion
,
as
to
demand
abstinence
from
bread
,
on
his
part
,
for
the
remainder
of
that
meal
at
least
,
if
not
for
the
whole
of
the
next
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
this
young
gentleman
(
for
he
was
but
three
-
and
-
twenty
)
combined
with
the
miserly
vice
of
an
old
man
,
any
of
the
open
-
handed
vices
of
a
young
one
,
was
a
moot
point
;
so
very
honorably
did
he
keep
his
own
counsel
.
<EOS>
He
was
sensible
of
the
value
of
appearances
as
an
investment
,
and
liked
to
dress
well
;
but
he
drove
a
bargain
for
every
moveable
about
him
,
from
the
coat
on
his
back
to
the
china
on
his
breakfast
-
table
;
and
every
bargain
by
representing
somebody
's
ruin
or
somebody
's
loss
,
acquired
a
peculiar
charm
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
part
of
his
avarice
to
take
,
within
narrow
bounds
,
long
odds
at
races
;
if
he
won
,
he
drove
harder
bargains
;
 
if
he
lost
,
he
half
starved
himself
until
next
time
.
<EOS>
Why
money
should
be
so
precious
to
an
Ass
too
dull
and
mean
to
exchange
it
for
any
other
satisfaction
,
is
strange
;
but
there
is
no
animal
so
sure
to
get
laden
with
it
,
as
the
Ass
who
sees
nothing
written
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
sky
but
the
three
letters
L.
S.
D.
---
not
Luxury
,
Sensuality
,
Dissoluteness
,
which
they
often
stand
for
,
but
the
three
dry
letters
.
<EOS>
Your
concentrated
Fox
is
seldom
comparable
to
your
concentrated
Ass
in
money

breeding

<EOS>
Fascination
Fledgeby
feigned
to
be
a
young
gentleman
living
on
his
means
,
but
was
known
secretly
to
be
a
kind
of
outlaw
in
the
billbroking
line
,
and
to
put
money
out
at
high
interest
in
various
ways
.
<EOS>
His
circle
of
familiar
acquaintance
,
from
Mr.
Lammle
round
,
all
had
a
touch
of
the
outlaw
,
as
to
their
rovings
in
the
merry
greenwood
of
Jobbery
Forest
,
lying
on
the
outskirts
of
the
Share
-
Market
and
the
Stock
Exchange
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
,
Lammle
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
eating
his
bread
and
butter
,
"
always
did
go
in
for
female
society
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Always
,
"
replied
Lammle
,
glooming
considerably
under
his
late
treatment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Came
natural
to
you
,
eh
?
"
said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
sex
were
pleased
to
like
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Lammle
sulkily
,
but
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
not
been
able
to
help
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Made
a
pretty
good
thing
of
marrying
,
did
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
smiled
(
an
ugly
smile
)
,
and
tapped
one
tap
upon
his
nose
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
late
governor
made
a
mess
of
it
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
Geor

is
the
right
name
Georgina
or
Georgiana

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
thinking
yesterday
,
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
there
was
such
a
name

<EOS>
I
thought
it
must
end
in
ina

<EOS>
"
Why

"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
play
---
<EOS>
if
you
can

the
Concertina
,
you
know

"
replied
Fledgeby
,
meditating
very
slowly
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
have
---
when
you
catch
it
---
the
Scarlatina

<EOS>
And
you
can
come
down
from

Well

<EOS>
"
You
were
going
to
remark
of
Georgiana

?
"
<EOS>
Lammle
moodily
hinted
,
after
waiting
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
remark
of
Georgiana
,
sir
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
not
at
all
pleased
to
be
reminded
of
his
having
forgotten
it
,
"
that
she
do
n't
seem
to
be
violent

<EOS>
Do
n't
seem
to
be
of

in

<EOS>
"
She
has
the
gentleness
of
the
dove
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
'll
say
so
,
"
replied
Fledgeby
,
sharpening
,
the
moment
his
interest
was
touched
by
another
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
know
,
the
real
lookout
is
this
:

what
I
say
,
not
what
you
say

<EOS>
I
say

having
my
late
governor

my

that
Georgiana

<EOS>
The
respected
Mr.
Lammle
was
a
bully
,
by
nature
and
by
usual
practice
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
,
as
Fledgeby
's
affronts
cumulated
,
that
conciliation
by
no
means
answered
the
purpose
here
,
he
now
directed
a
scowling
look
into
Fledgeby
's
small
eyes
for
the
effect
of
the
opposite
treatment
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
by
what
he
saw
there
,
he
burst
into
a
violent
passion
and
struck
his
hand
upon
the
table
,
making
the
china
ring
and
dance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
offensive
fellow
,
sir
,
"
cried
Mr.
Lammle
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
highly
offensive
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
this
behaviour
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say

"
remonstrated
Fledgeby

<EOS>
"
Do

break
out

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You

Mr.

"
You

<EOS>
"
I

urged
Fledgeby
,
quailing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
coarse
and
vulgar
vagabond
!
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
,
looking
fiercely
about
him
,
"
if
your
servant
was
here
to
give
me
sixpence
of
your
money

get
my
boots
cleaned

not

I
'd
kick
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
No
you
would

pleaded
Fledgeby
,
"
I
am
sure
you
'd
think
better
of
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
what

Mr.

said
Lammle
advancing
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
Since
you
presume

contradict

I
'll
assert
myself
a
little

<EOS>
Give

<EOS>
Fledgeby
covered
it
with
his
hand
instead

and
said
,
retreating
,
<EOS>
"
I
beg

<EOS>
"
Give

your

repeated
Lammle

<EOS>
Still
covering
that
feature
and
backing
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
reiterated
(
apparently
with
a
severe
cold
in
his
head
)
,
"
I
beg

I
beg

<EOS>
And

exclaimed
Lammle
,
stopping
and
making
the
most
of
his
chest
---
"
<EOS>
This
fellow
presumes
on
my
having
selected
him
out
of
all
the
young
fellows
I
know

for

advantageous
opportunity

<EOS>
This
fellow
presumes
on
my
having
in
my
desk
round
the
corner
,
his
dirty
note
of
hand
for
a
wretched
sum
payable
on
the
occurrence

a
certain
event

which
event
can
only
be

<EOS>
This
fellow
,
Fledgeby
,
presumes
to
be
impertinent
to

,
Lammle

<EOS>
Give
me
your
nose

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No

Stop

<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon

said
Fledgeby
,
with
humility
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
,
sir

"
demanded
Mr.
Lammle
,
seeming
too
furious
to
understand

<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon

repeated
Fledgeby

<EOS>
"
Repeat
your
words
louder

<EOS>
The
just
indignation

sent
the
blood
boiling
to
my
head

<EOS>
I
do

<EOS>
"
I

repeated
Fledgeby

with
laborious
explanatory
politeness

"
I
beg
your
pardon

<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
paused
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
a
man
of
honour

"
said
he
,
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
,
"
I
am
disarmed

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
also
took
a
chair
,
though
less
demonstratively
,
and
by
slow
approaches
removed
his
hand
from
his
nose
.
<EOS>
Some
natural
diffidence
assailed
him
as
to
blowing
it
,
so
shortly
after
its
having
assumed
a
personal
and
delicate
,
not
to
say
public
,
character

but
he
overcame
his
scruples
by
degrees
,
and
modestly
took
that
liberty
under
an
implied
protest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lammle
,
"
he
said
sneakingly
,
when
that
was
done
,
"
I
hope
we
are
friends
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
"
returned
Lammle
,
"
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
gone
too
far
in
making
myself
disagreeable
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
"
but
I
never
intended
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
no
more
,
say
no
more
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
repeated
in
a
magnificent
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Give
me
your
"
---
Fledgeby
started
---
"
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
shook
hands
,
and
on
Mr.
Lammle
's
part
,
in
particular
,
there
ensued
great
geniality
.
<EOS>
For
,
he
was
quite
as
much
of
a
dastard
as
the
other
,
and
had
been
in
equal
danger
of
falling
into
the
second
place
for
good
,
when
he
took
heart
just
in
time
,
to
act
upon
the
information
conveyed
to
him
by
Fledgeby
's
eye
.
  
<EOS>
The
breakfast
ended
in
a
perfect
understanding
.
<EOS>
Incessant
machinations
were
to
be
kept
at
work
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
;
 
love
was
to
be
made
for
Fledgeby
,
and
conquest
was
to
be
insured
to
him
;
he
on
his
part
very
humbly
admitting
his
defects
as
to
the
softer
social
arts
,
and
entreating
to
be
backed
to
the
utmost
by
his
two
able
coadjutors
.
  
<EOS>
Little
recked
Mr.
Podsnap
of
the
traps
and
toils
besetting
his
Young
Person
.
<EOS>
He
regarded
her
as
safe
within
the
Temple
of
Podsnappery
,
biding
the
fulness
of
time
when
she
,
Georgiana
,
should
take
him
,
Fitz
-
Podsnap
,
who
with
all
his
worldly
goods
should
her
endow
.
<EOS>
It
would
call
a
blush
into
the
cheek
of
his
standard
Young
Person
to
have
anything
to
do
with
such
matters
save
to
take
as
directed
,
and
with
worldly
goods
as
per
settlement
to
be
endowed
.
<EOS>
Who
giveth
this
woman
to
be
married
to
this
man
?
<EOS>
I
,
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
Perish
the
daring
thought
that
any
smaller
creation
should
come
between
!
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
public
holiday
,
and
Fledgeby
did
not
recover
his
spirits
or
his
usual
temperature
of
nose
until
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Walking
into
the
City
in
the
holiday
afternoon
,
he
walked
against
a
living
stream
setting
out
of
it
;
and
thus
,
when
he
turned
into
the
precincts
of
St.
Mary
Axe
,
he
found
a
prevalent
repose
and
quiet
there
.
<EOS>
A
yellow
overhanging
plaster
-
fronted
house
at
which
he
stopped
was
quiet
too
.
<EOS>
The
blinds
were
all
drawn
down
,
and
the
inscription
Pubsey
and
Co.
seemed
to
doze
in
the
counting
-
house
window
on
the
ground
-
floor
giving
on
the
sleepy
street
.
  
<EOS>
Fledgeby
knocked
and
rang
,
and
Fledgeby
rang
and
knocked
,
but
no
one
came
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
crossed
the
narrow
street
and
looked
up
at
the
house
-
windows
,
but
nobody
looked
down
at
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
He
got
out
of
temper
,
crossed
the
narrow
street
again
,
and
pulled
the
housebell
as
if
it
were
the
house
's
nose
,
and
he
were
taking
a
hint
from
his
late
experience
.
<EOS>
His
ear
at
the
keyhole
seemed
then
,
at
last
,
to
give
him
assurance
that
something
stirred
within
.
<EOS>
His
eye
at
the
keyhole
seemed
to
confirm
his
ear
,
for
he
angrily
pulled
the
house
's
nose
again
,
and
pulled
and
pulled
and
continued
to
pull
,
until
a
human
nose
appeared
in
the
dark
doorway
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
you
sir
!
"
cried
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
These
are
nice
games
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
addressed
an
old
Jewish
man
in
an
ancient
coat
,
long
of
skirt
,
and
wide
of
pocket
.
<EOS>
A
venerable
man
,
bald
and
shining
at
the
top
of
his
head
,
and
with
long
grey
hair
flowing
down
at
its
sides
and
mingling
with
his
beard
.
<EOS>
A
man
who
with
a
graceful
Eastern
action
of
homage
bent
his
head
,
and
stretched
out
his
hands
with
the
palms
downward
,
as
if
to
deprecate
the
wrath
of
a
superior
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
been
up
to
?
"
said
Fledgeby
,
storming
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Generous
Christian
master
,
"
urged
the
Jewish
man
,
"
it
being
holiday
,
I
looked
for
no
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Holiday
be
blowed
!
"
said
Fledgeby
,
entering
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
to
do
with
holidays
?
<EOS>
Shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
his
former
action
the
old
man
obeyed
.
<EOS>
In
the
entry
hung
his
rusty
large
-
brimmed
low
-
crowned
hat
,
as
long
out
of
date
as
his
coat
;
in
the
corner
near
it
stood
his
staff
---
no
walking
-
stick
but
a
veritable
staff
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
turned
into
the
counting
-
house
,
perched
himself
on
a
business
stool
,
and
cocked
his
hat
.
<EOS>
There
were
light
boxes
on
shelves
in
the
counting
-
house
,
and
strings
of
mock
beads
hanging
up
.
<EOS>
There
were
samples
of
cheap
clocks
,
and
samples
of
cheap
vases
of
flowers
.
<EOS>
Foreign
toys
,
all
.
  
<EOS>
Perched
on
the
stool
with
his
hat
cocked
on
his
head
and
one
of
his
legs
dangling
,
the
youth
of
Fledgeby
hardly
contrasted
to
advantage
with
the
age
of
the
Jewish
man
as
he
stood
with
his
bare
head
bowed
,
and
his
eyes
(
which
he
only
raised
in
speaking
)
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
His
clothing
was
worn
down
to
the
rusty
hue
of
the
hat
in
the
entry
,
but
though
he
looked
shabby
<EOS>
he
did
not
look
mean
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Fledgeby
,
though
not
shabby
,
did
look
mean
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
told
me
what
you
were
up
to
,
you
sir
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
scratching
his
head
with
the
brim
of
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
was
breathing
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
cellar
,
that
you
did
n't
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
house
-
top
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
!
<EOS>
That
's
a
way
of
doing
business
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
the
old
man
represented
with
a
grave
and
patient
air
,
"
there
must
be
two
parties
to
the
transaction
of
business
,
and
the
holiday
has
left
me
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Ca
n't
be
buyer
and
seller
too
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
the
Jews
say
;
 
ai
n't
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
least
we
say
truly
,
if
we
say
so
,
"
answered
the
old
man
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
people
need
speak
the
truth
sometimes
,
for
they
lie
enough
,
"
 
remarked
Fascination
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
there
is
,
"
returned
the
old
man
with
quiet
emphasis
,
"
too
much
untruth
among
all
denominations
of
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rather
dashed
,
Fascination
Fledgeby
took
another
scratch
at
his
intellectual
head
with
his
hat
,
to
gain
time
for
rallying
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
instance
,
"
he
resumed
,
as
though
it
were
he
who
had
spoken
last
,
"
who
but
<EOS>
you
and
I
ever
heard
of
a
poor
Jew
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Jews
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
raising
his
eyes
from
the
ground
with
his
former
smile
.
<EOS>
"
They
hear
of
poor
Jews
often
,
and
are
very
good
to
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bother
that
!
"
returned
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
You
'd
persuade
me
if
you
could
,
that
you
are
a
poor
Jew
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
'd
confess
how
much
you
really
did
make
out
of
my
late
governor
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
a
better
opinion
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
only
bent
his
head
,
and
stretched
out
his
hands
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
go
on
posturing
like
a
Deaf
and
Dumb
School
,
"
said
the
ingenous
Fledgeby
,
"
but
express
yourself
like
a
Christian
---
or
as
nearly
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
had
sickness
and
misfortunes
,
and
was
so
poor
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
as
hopelessly
to
owe
the
father
,
principal
and
interest
.
<EOS>
The
son
inheriting
,
was
so
merciful
as
to
forgive
me
both
,
and
place
me
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
a
little
gesture
as
though
he
kissed
the
hem
of
an
imaginary
garment
worn
by
the
noble
youth
before
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
humbly
done
,
but
picturesquely
,
and
was
not
abasing
to
the
doer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
say
more
,
I
see
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
looking
at
him
as
if
he
would
like
to
try
the
effect
of
extracting
a
double
-
tooth
or
two
,
"
<EOS>
and
so
it
's
of
no
use
my
putting
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
confess
this
,
Riah
;
 
who
believes
you
to
be
poor
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
're
right
,
"
assented
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
,
"
repeated
the
old
man
with
a
grave
slow
wave
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
All
scout
it
as
a
fable
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
say
`
`
This
little
fancy
business
is
not
mine
;
"
"
"
with
a
lithe
sweep
of
his
easily
-
turning
hand
around
him
,
to
comprehend
the
various
objects
on
the
shelves
;
"
`
`
it
is
the
little
business
of
a
Christian
young
gentleman
who
places
me
,
his
servant
,
in
trust
and
charge
here
,
and
to
whom
I
am
accountable
for
every
single
bead
,
"
"
they
would
laugh
.
<EOS>
When
,
in
the
larger
money
-
business
,
I
tell
the
borrowers
---
"
  
"
I
say
,
old
chap
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Fledgeby
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
you
mind
what
you
do
tell
'
em
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
tell
them
no
more
than
I
am
about
to
repeat
.
<EOS>
When
I
tell
them
,
`
`
I
can
not
promise
this
,
I
can
not
answer
for
the
other
,
I
must
see
my
principal
,
I
have
not
the
money
,
I
am
a
poor
man
and
it
does
not
rest
with
me
,
"
"
they
are
so
unbelieving
and
so
impatient
,
that
they
sometimes
curse
me
in
Jehovah
's
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
deuced
good
,
that
is
!
"
said
Fascination
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
at
other
times
they
say
,
`
`
Can
it
never
be
done
without
these
tricks
,
Mr.
Riah
?
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
Mr.
Riah
,
we
know
the
arts
of
your
people
"
"
---
my
people
!

`
`
If
the
money
is
to
be
lent
,
fetch
it
,
fetch
it
;
 
if
it
is
not
to
be
lent
,
keep
it
and
say
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
They
never
believe
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
right
,
"
said
Fascination
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
say
,
`
`
We
know
,
Mr.
Riah
,
we
know

<EOS>
We
have
but
to
look
at
you
,
and
we
know

<EOS>
"
"
  
"
Oh
,
a
good
'
un
are
you
for
the
post
,
"
thought
Fledgeby
,
"
and
a
good
'
un
was
I
to
mark
you
out
for
it
!
<EOS>
I
may
be
slow
,
but
I
am
precious
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
Not
a
syllable
of
this
reflection
shaped
itself
in
any
scrap
of
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
breath
,
lest
it
should
tend
to
put
his
servant
's
price
up
.
<EOS>
But
looking
at
the
old
man
as
he
stood
quiet
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
eyes
cast
down
,
he
felt
that
to
relinquish
an
inch
of
his
baldness
,
an
inch
of
his
grey
hair
,
an
inch
of
his
coat
-
skirt
,
an
inch
of
his
hat
brim
,
an
inch
of
his
walking
-
staff
,
would
be
to
relinquish
hundreds
of
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
Riah
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
mollified
by
these
self
-
approving
considerations
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
go
a
little
more
into
buying
-
up
queer
bills
.
<EOS>
Look
out
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
it
shall
be
done

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Casting
my
eye
over
the
accounts
,
I
find
that
branch
of
business
pays
pretty
fairly
,
and
I
am
game
for
extending
it
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
know
people
's
affairs
likewise
.
<EOS>
So
look
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
will
,
promptly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Put
it
about
in
the
right
quarters
,
that
you
'll
buy
queer
bills
by
the
lump
---
by
the
pound
weight
if
that
's
all
---
supposing
you
see
your
way
to
a
fair
chance
on
looking
over
the
parcel

<EOS>
And
there
's
one
thing
more
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
with
the
books
for
periodical
inspection
as
usual
,
at
eight
on
Monday
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Riah
drew
some
folding
tablets
from
his
breast
and
noted
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
I
wanted
to
say
at
the
present
time
,
"
continued
Fledgeby
in
a
grudging
vein
,
as
he
got
off
the
stool
,
"
except
that
I
wish
you
'd
take
the
air
where
you
can
hear
the
bell

either
one

two

both

By

the

do
you
take

pot

<EOS>
"
Sir
,
there
are
leads
there

made
a

garden
there

To
bury
your
money
in

you
old
dodger

A

bury

Twelve
shillings
a
week
,
even
when
they
are
an
old
man
's
wages
,
bury
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know
what
you
really
are
worth
,
"
returned
Fledgeby
,
with
whom
his
growing
rich
on
that
stipend
and
gratitude
<EOS>
was
a
very
convenient
fiction
.
"
<EOS>
But
come
!
<EOS>
Let
's
have
a
look
at
your
garden
on
the
tiles
,
before
I
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
took
a
step
back
,
and
hesitated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
sir
,
I
have
company
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
,
by
George
!
"
said
Fledgeby
;
"
I
suppose
you
happen
to
know
whose
premises
these
are
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
they
are
yours
,
and
I
am
your
servant
in
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
thought
you
might
have
overlooked
that
,
"
retorted
Fledgeby
,
with
his
eyes
on
Riah
's
beard
as
he
felt
for
his
own
;
"
having
company
on
my
premises
,
you
know
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
up
and
see
the
guests
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
hope
for
your
admission
that
they
can
do
no
harm
.
"
  
<EOS>
Passing
him
with
a
courteous
reverence
,
specially
unlike
any
action
that
Mr.
Fledgeby
could
for
his
life
have
imparted
to
his
own
head
and
hands
,
the
old
man
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
As
he
toiled
on
before
,
with
his
palm
upon
the
stair
-
rail
,
and
his
long
black
skirt
,
a
very
gaberdine
,
overhanging
each
successive
step
,
he
might
have
been
the
leader
in
some
pilgrimage
of
devotional
ascent
to
a
prophet
's
tomb
.
<EOS>
Not
troubled
by
any
such
weak
imagining
,
Fascination
Fledgeby
merely
speculated
on
the
time
of
life
at
which
his
beard
had
begun
,
and
thought
once
more
what
a
good
'
un
he
was
for
the
part
.
  
<EOS>
Some
final
wooden
steps
conducted
them
,
stooping
under
a
low
penthouse
roof
,
to
the
house
-
top
.
<EOS>
Riah
stood
still
,
and
,
turning
to
his
master
,
pointed
out
his
guests
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
Hexam
and
Jenny
Wren
.
<EOS>
For
whom
,
perhaps
with
some
old
instinct
of
his
race
,
the
gentle
Jew
had
spread
a
carpet
.
<EOS>
Seated
on
it
,
against
no
more
romantic
object
than
a
blackened
chimney
-
stack
over
which
some
humble
creeper
had
been
trained
,
they
both
pored
over
one
book
;
both
with
attentive
faces
;
Jenny
with
the
sharper
;
Lizzie
with
the
more
perplexed
.
<EOS>
Another
little
book
or
two
were
lying
near
,
and
a
common
basket
of
common
fruit
,
and
another
basket
full
of
strings
of
beads
and
tinsel
scraps
.
<EOS>
A
few
boxes
of
humble
flowers
and
evergreens
completed
the
garden
;
and
the
encompassing
wilderness
of
dowager
old
chimneys
twirled
their
cowls
and
fluttered
their
smoke
,
rather
as
if
they
were
bridling
,
and
fanning
themselves
,
and
looking
on
in
a
state
of
airy
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
Taking
her
eyes
off
the
book
,
to
test
her
memory
of
something
in
it
,
Lizzie
was
the
first
to
see
herself
observed
.
<EOS>
As
she
rose
,
Miss
Wren
likewise
became
conscious
,
and
said
,
irreverently
addressing
the
great
chief
of
the
premises
:
"
Whoever
you
are
,
I
ca
n't
get
up
,
because
my
back
's
bad
and
my
legs
are
queer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
master
,
"
said
Riah
,
stepping
forward
.
  
<EOS>
(
"
Do
n't
look
like
anybody
's
master
,
"
observed
Miss
Wren
to
herself
,
with
a
hitch
of
her
chin
and
eyes
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
sir
,
"
pursued
the
old
man
,
"
is
a
little
dressmaker
for
little
people
.
<EOS>
Explain
to
the
master
,
Jenny
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dolls
;
that
's
all
,
"
said
Jenny
,
shortly
.
<EOS>
"
Very
difficult
to
fit
too
,
because
their
figures
are
so
uncertain
.
<EOS>
You
never
know
where
to
expect
their
waists
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
friend
,
"
resumed
the
old
man
,
motioning
towards
Lizzie
;
"
and
as
industrious
as
virtuous
.
<EOS>
But
that
they
both
are
.
<EOS>
They
are
busy
early
and
late
,
sir
,
early
and
late
;
and
in
bye
-
times
,
as
on
this
holiday
,
they
go
to
book
-
learning
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
much
good
to
be
got
out
of
that
,
"
remarked
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Depends
upon
the
person
!
"
<EOS>
quoth
Miss
Wren
,
snapping
him
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
made
acquaintance
with
my
guests
,
sir
,
"
pursued
the
Jew
,
with
an
evident
purpose
of
drawing
out
the
dressmaker
,
"
through
their
coming
here
to
buy
of
our
damage
and
waste
for
Miss
Jenny
's
millinery
.
<EOS>
Our
waste
goes
into
the
best
of
company
,
sir
,
on
her
rosy
-
cheeked
little
customers
.
<EOS>
They
wear
it
in
their
hair
,
and
on
their
ball
-
dresses
,
and
even
(
so
she
tells
me
)
are
presented
at
Court
with
it
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Fledgeby
,
on
whose
intelligence
this
doll
-
fancy
made
rather
strong
demands
;
"
she
's
been
buying
that
basketful
to
-
day
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
she
has
,
"
Miss
Jenny
interposed
;
"
and
paying
for
it
too
,
most
likely
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
's
have
a
look
at
it
,
"
said
the
suspicious
chief
.
<EOS>
Riah
handed
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
How
much
for
this
now
?
"
  
"
Two
precious
silver
shillings
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
Riah
confirmed
her
with
two
nods
,
as
Fledgeby
looked
to
him
.
<EOS>
A
nod
for
each
shilling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
poking
into
the
contents
of
the
basket
with
his
forefinger
,
"
the
price
is
not
so
bad
.
<EOS>
You
have
got
good
measure
,
<EOS>
Miss
What
-
is
-
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
Jenny
,
"
suggested
that
young
lady
with
great
calmness
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
got
good
measure
,
Miss
Jenny
;
but
the
price
is
not
so
bad
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
And
you
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
turning
to
the
other
visitor
,
"
do
you
buy
anything
here
,
miss
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
sell
anything
neither
,
miss
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Looking
askew
at
the
questioner
<EOS>
,
Jenny
stole
her
hand
up
to
her
friend
's
,
and
drew
her
friend
down
,
so
that
she
bent
beside
her
on
her
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
thankful
to
come
here
for
rest
,
sir
,
"
said
Jenny
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
you
do
n't
know
what
the
rest
of
this
place
is
to
us
;
does
he
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
It
's
the
quiet
,
and
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
quiet
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Fledgeby
,
with
a
contemptuous
turn
of
his
head
towards
the
City
's
roar
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
air
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
with
a
"
Poof
!
"
<EOS>
at
the
smoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Jenny
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
so
high
.
<EOS>
And
you
see
the
clouds
rushing
on
above
the
narrow
streets
,
not
minding
them
,
and
you
see
the
golden
arrows
pointing
at
the
mountains
in
the
sky
from
which
the
wind
comes
,
and
you
feel
as
if
you
were
dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
creature
looked
above
her
,
holding
up
her
slight
transparent
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
feel
when
you
are
dead
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Fledgeby
,
much
perplexed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
so
tranquil
!
"
cried
the
little
creature
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
so
peaceful
and
so
thankful
!
<EOS>
And
you
hear
the
people
who
are
alive
,
crying
,
and
working
,
and
calling
to
one
another
down
in
the
close
dark
streets
,
and
you
seem
to
pity
them
so
!
<EOS>
And
such
a
chain
has
fallen
from
you
,
and
such
a
strange
good
sorrowful
happiness
comes
upon
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
eyes
fell
on
the
old
man
,
who
,
with
his
hands
folded
,
quietly
looked
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
it
was
only
just
now
,
"
said
the
little
creature
,
pointing
at
him
,
"
that
I
fancied
I
saw
him
come
out
of
his
grave
!
<EOS>
He
toiled
out
at
that
low
door
so
bent
and
worn
,
and
then
he
took
his
breath
and
stood
upright
,
and
looked
all
round
him
at
the
sky
,
and
the
wind
blew
upon
him
,
and
his
life
down
in
the
dark
was
over
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Till
he
was
called
back
to
life
,
"
she
added
,
looking
round
at
Fledgeby
with
that
lower
look
of
sharpness
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
call
him
back
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
long
enough
coming
,
anyhow
,
"
grumbled
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
dead
,
you
know
,
"
said
Jenny
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
Get
down
to
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
seemed
to
think
it
rather
a
good
suggestion
,
and
with
a
nod
turned
round
.
<EOS>
As
Riah
followed
to
attend
him
down
the
stairs
,
the
little
creature
called
out
to
the
Jew
in
a
silvery
tone
,
"
Do
n't
be
long
gone
.
<EOS>
Come
back
,
and
be
dead
!
"
<EOS>
And
still
as
they
went
down
they
heard
the
little
sweet
voice
,
more
and
more
faintly
,
half
calling
and
half
singing
,
"
Come
back
and
be
dead
,
Come
back
and
be
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
got
down
into
the
entry
,
Fledgeby
,
pausing
under
the
shadow
of
the
broad
old
hat
,
and
mechanically
poising
the
staff
,
said
to
the
old
man
:
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
handsome
girl
,
that
one
in
her
senses
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
as
good
as
handsome
,
"
answered
Riah
.
  
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
"
observed
Fledgeby
,
with
a
dry
whistle
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
she
ai
n't
bad
enough
to
put
any
chap
up
to
the
fastenings
,
and
get
the
premises
broken
open
.
<EOS>
You
look
out
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
weather
eye
awake
,
and
do
n't
make
any
more
acquaintances
,
however
handsome
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
always
keep
my
name
to
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
assuredly
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
they
ask
it
,
say
it
's
Pubsey
,
or
say
it
's
Co
,
or
say
it
's
anything
you
like
,
but
what
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
grateful
servant
---
in
whose
race
gratitude
is
deep
,
strong
,
and
enduring
---
bowed
his
head
,
and
actually
did
now
put
the
hem
of
his
coat
to
his
lips
:
though
so
lightly
that
the
wearer
knew
nothing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
Fascination
Fledgeby
went
his
way
,
exulting
in
the
artful
cleverness
with
which
he
had
turned
his
thumb
down
on
a
Jew
,
and
the
old
man
went
his
different
way
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
As
he
mounted
,
the
call
or
song
began
to
sound
in
his
ears
again
,
and
,
looking
above
,
he
saw
the
face
of
the
little
creature
looking
down
out
of
a
Glory
of
her
long
bright
radiant
hair
,
and
musically
repeating
to
him
,
like
a
vision
:
  
<EOS>
"
Come
up
and
be
dead
!
<EOS>
Come
up
and
be
dead
!

<EOS>
A
RIDDLE
WITHOUT
AN
ANSWER
.
 
<EOS>
Again
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
and
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
sat
together
in
the
Temple
.
<EOS>
This
evening
,
however
,
they
were
not
together
in
the
place
of
business
of
the
eminent
solicitor
,
but
in
another
dismal
set
of
chambers
facing
it
on
the
same
second
-
floor
;
on
whose
dungeon
-
like
black
outer
-
door
appeared
the
legend
:
  
Private
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
(=
<EOS>
>
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
's
Offices
opposite
.
)
  
<EOS>
Appearances
indicated
that
this
establishment
was
a
very
recent
institution
.
<EOS>
The
white
letters
of
the
inscription
were
extremely
white
and
extremely
strong
to
the
sense
of
smell
,
the
complexion
of
the
tables
and
chairs
was
(
like
Lady
Tippins
's
)
a
little
too
blooming
to
be
believed
in
,
and
the
carpets
and
floorcloth
seemed
to
rush
at
the
beholder
's
face
in
the
unusual
prominency
of
their
patterns
.
<EOS>
But
the
Temple
,
accustomed
to
tone
down
both
the
still
life
and
the
human
life
that
has
much
to
do
with
it
,
would
soon
get
the
better
of
all
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Eugene
,
on
one
side
of
the
fire
,
"
I
feel
tolerably
comfortable
.
<EOS>
I
hope
the
upholsterer
may
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
he
?
"
asked
Lightwood
,
from
the
other
side
of
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
pursued
Eugene
,
reflecting
,
"
he
is
not
in
the
secret
of
our
pecuniary
affairs
,
so
perhaps
he
may
be
in
an
easy
frame
of
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
pay
him
,
"
said
Mortimer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
,
really
?
"
returned
Eugene
,
indolently
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
pay
him
,
Eugene
,
for
my
part
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
in
a
slightly
injured
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
mean
to
pay
him
too
,
"
retorted
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
then
I
mean
so
much
that
I
---
that
I
do
n't
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mean
?
"
  
"
So
much
that
I
only
mean
and
shall
always
only
mean
and
nothing
more
,
my
dear
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
same
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
friend
,
lying
back
in
his
easy
chair
,
watched
him
lying
back
in
his
easy
chair
,
as
he
stretched
out
his
legs
on
the
hearth
-
rug
,
and
said
,
with
the
amused
look
that
Eugene
Wrayburn
could
always
awaken
in
him
without
seeming
to
try
or
care
:
  
"
Anyhow
,
your
vagaries
have
increased
the
bill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Calls
the
domestic
virtues
vagaries
!
"
exclaimed
Eugene
,
raising
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
very
complete
little
kitchen
of
ours
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
"
in
which
nothing
will
ever
be
cooked
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
dear
Mortimer
,
"
returned
his
friend
,
lazily
lifting
his
head
a
little
to
look
at
him
,
"
how
often
have
I
pointed
out
to
you
that
its
moral
influence
is
the
important
thing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Its
moral
influence
on
this
fellow
!
"
exclaimed
Lightwood
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
me
the
favour
,
"
said
Eugene
,
getting
out
of
his
chair
with
much
gravity
,
"
to
come
and
inspect
that
feature
of
our
establishment
which
you
rashly
disparage
.
<EOS>
"
With
that
,
taking
up
a
candle
,
he
conducted
his
chum
into
the
fourth
room
of
the
set
of
chambers
---
a
little
narrow
room
---
which
was
very
completely
and
neatly
fitted
as
a
kitchen
.
<EOS>
"
See
!

said
Eugene
,
"
miniature

<EOS>
The
moral
influence
of
these
objects
,
in
forming
the
domestic
virtues
,
may
have
an
immense
influence
upon
me
;
not
upon
you
,
for
you
are
a
hopeless
case
,
but
upon
me
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
have
an
idea
that
I
feel
the
domestic
virtues
already
forming
.
<EOS>
Do
me
the
favour
to

<EOS>
To
what
use
do
I
devote
them
?
<EOS>
I
receive
a
bill
---
say
from
Jones

<EOS>
I
docket
it
neatly
at
the
secrÈtaire
,
Jones
,
and
I
put
it
into
pigeon
-
hole
J.
<EOS>
It
's
the
next
thing
to
a
receipt
and
is
quite
as
satisfactory
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
very
much
wish
,
Mortimer
,
"
 
sitting
on
his
bed
,
with
the
air
of
a
philosopher
lecturing
a
disciple
,
"
that
my
example
might
induce
you
to
cultivate
habits
of
punctuality
and
method
;
and
,
by
means
of
the
moral
influences
with
which
I
have
surrounded
you
,
to
encourage
the
formation
of
the
domestic
virtues
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
laughed
again
,
with
his
usual
commentaries
of
"
How
can
you
be
so
ridiculous
,
Eugene
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
What
an
absurd
fellow
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
but
when
his
laugh
was
out
,
there
was
something
serious
,
if
not
anxious
,
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
Despite
that
pernicious
assumption
of
lassitude
and
indifference
,
which
had
become
his
second
nature
,
he
was
strongly
attached
to
his
friend
.
<EOS>
He
had
founded
himself
upon
Eugene
when
they
were
yet
boys
at
school
;
and
at
this
hour
imitated
him
no
less
,
admired
him
no
less
,
loved
him
no
less
,
than
in
those
departed
days
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eugene
,
"
said
he
,
"
if
I
could
find
you
in
earnest
for
a
minute
,
I
would
try
to
say
an
earnest
word
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
An
earnest
word
?
"
repeated
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
The
moral
influences
are
beginning
to
work
.
<EOS>
Say
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
will
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
though
you
are
not
earnest
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
desire
for
earnestness
,
"
murmured
Eugene
,
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
meditating
deeply
,
"
I
trace
the
happy
influences
of
the
little
flour
-
barrel
and
the
coffee
-
mill
.
<EOS>
Gratifying
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Eugene
,
"
resumed
Mortimer
,
disregarding
the
light
interruption
.
<EOS>
and
laying
a
hand
upon
Eugene
's
shoulder
,
as
he
,
Mortimer
,
stood
before
him
seated
on
his
bed
,
"
you
are
withholding
something
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eugene
looked
at
him
,
but
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
this
past
summer
,
you
have
been
withholding
something
from
me
.
<EOS>
Before
we
entered
on
our
boating
vacation
,
you
were
as
bent
upon
it
as
I
have
seen
you
upon
anything
since
we
first
rowed
together
.
<EOS>
But
you
cared
very
little
for
it
when
it
came
,
often
found
it
a
tie
and
a
drag
upon
you
,
and
were
constantly
away
.
<EOS>
Now
it
was
well
enough
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
,
a
dozen
times
,
twenty
times
,
to
say
to
me
in
your
own
odd
manner
,
which
I
know
<EOS>
so
well
<EOS>
and
like
so
much
,
that
your
disappearances
were
precautions
against
our
boring
one
another
;
but
of
course
after
a
short
while
I
began
to
know
that
they
covered
something
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
what
it
is
,
as
you
have
not
told
me
;
but
the
fact
is
so
.
<EOS>
Say
,
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
give
you
my
word
of
honor
,
Mortimer
,
"
returned
Eugene
,
after
a
serious
pause
of
a
few
moments
,
"
that
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
know
,
Eugene
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
,
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
know
less
about
myself
than
about
most
people
in
the
world
,
and
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
some
design
in
your
mind
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
any
rate
,
you
have
some
subject
of
interest
there
which
used
not
to
be
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
ca
n't
say
,
"
replied
Eugene
,
shaking
his
head
blankly
,
after
pausing
again
to
reconsider
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
times
I
have
thought
yes
;
at
other
times
I
have
thought
no
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
have
been
inclined
to
pursue
such
a
subject
;
now
I
have
felt
that
it
was
absurd
,
and
that
it
tired
and
embarrassed
me
.
<EOS>
Absolutely
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
Frankly
and
faithfully
;
 
I
would
if
I
could
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
replying
,
he
clapped
a
hand
,
in
his
turn
,
on
his
friend
's
shoulder
,
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
upon
the
bed
,
and
said
:
  
"
You
must
take
your
friend
as
he
is
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
am
,
my
dear
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
You
know
how
dreadfully
susceptible
I
am
to
boredom
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
when
I
became
enough
of
a
man
to
find
myself
an
embodied
conundrum
,
I
bored
myself
to
the
last
degree
by
trying
to
find
out
what
I
meant
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
at
length
I
gave
it
up
,
and
declined
to
guess
any
more
.
<EOS>
Then
how
can
I
possibly
give
you
the
answer
that
I
have
not
discovered
?
<EOS>
The
old
nursery
form
runs
,
`
`
Riddle
-
me
-
riddle
-
me
-
ree
,
p'raps
<EOS>
you
ca
n't
tell
me
what
this
may
be
?
"
<EOS>
"
 
My
reply
runs
,
"
No
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
life
,
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
much
of
what
was
fantastically
true
to
his
own
knowledge
of
this
utterly
careless
Eugene
,
mingled
with
the
answer
,
that
Mortimer
could
not
receive
it
as
a
mere
evasion
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
was
given
with
an
engaging
air
of
openness
,
and
of
special
exemption
of
the
one
friend
he
valued
,
from
his
reckless
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
dear
boy
!
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
try
the
effect
of
smoking
.
<EOS>
If
it
enlightens
me
at
all
on
this
question
,
I
will
impart
unreservedly
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
returned
to
the
room
they
had
come
from
,
and
,
finding
it
heated
,
opened
a
window
.
<EOS>
Having
lighted
their
cigars
,
they
leaned
out
of
this
window
,
smoking
,
and
looking
down
at
the
moonlight
,
as
it
shone
into
the
court
below
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
enlightenment
,
"
resumed
Eugene
,
after
certain
minutes
of
silence
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
sincerely
apologetic
,
my
dear
Mortimer
,
but
nothing
comes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
nothing
comes
,
"
returned
Mortimer
,
"
nothing
can
come
from
it
.
<EOS>
So
I
shall
hope
that
this
may
hold
good
throughout
,
and
that
there
may
be
nothing
on
foot
.
<EOS>
Nothing
injurious
to
you
,
Eugene
,
or
<EOS>
---
"
  
Eugene
stayed
him
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
on
him
arm
,
while
he
took
a
piece
of
earth
from
an
old
flowerpot
on
the
window
-
sill
and
dexterously
shot
it
at
a
little
point
of
light
opposite
;
having
done
which
to
his
satisfaction
,
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
Or
?
"
  
"
Or
injurious
to
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
,
"
said
Eugene
,
taking
another
little
piece
of
earth
,
and
shooting
it
with
great
precision
at
the
former
mark
,
"
how
injurious
to
any
one
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
,
"
said
Eugene
,
taking
,
as
he
said
the
word
,
another
shot
,
"
to
whom
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Checking
himself
with
another
piece
of
earth
in
his
hand
,
Eugene
looked
at
his
friend
inquiringly
and
a
little
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
concealed
or
half
-
expressed
meaning
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Two
belated
wanderers
in
the
mazes
of
the
law
,
"
said
Eugene
,
attracted
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
,
and
glancing
down
as
he
spoke
,
"
stray
into
the
court
.
<EOS>
They
examine
the
door
-
posts
of
number
one
,
seeking
the
name
they
want
.
<EOS>
Not
finding
it
at
number
one
,
they
come
to
number
two
.
<EOS>
On
the
hat
of
wanderer
number
two
,
the
shorter
one
,
I
drop
this
pellet
.
<EOS>
Hitting
him
on
the
hat
,
I
smoke
serenely
,
and
become
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
sky
.
"
  
<EOS>
Both
the
wanderers
looked
up
towards
the
window
;
but
,
after
interchanging
a
mutter
or
two
,
soon
applied
themselves
to
the
doorposts
below
.
<EOS>
There
they
seemed
to
discover
what
they
wanted
,
for
they
disappeared
from
view
by
entering
at
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
"
When
they
emerge
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
you
shall
see
me
bring
them
both
down
;
"
and
so
prepared
two
pellets
for
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
reckoned
on
their
seeking
his
name
,
or
Lightwood
's
.
<EOS>
But
either
the
one
or
the
other
would
seem
to
be
in
question
,
for
now
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
on
duty
to
-
night
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
"
stay
you
where
you
are
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
Requiring
no
persuasion
,
he
stayed
there
,
smoking
quietly
,
and
not
at
all
curious
to
know
who
knocked
,
until
Mortimer
spoke
to
him
from
within
the
room
,
and
touched
him
.
<EOS>
Then
,
drawing
in
his
head
,
he
found
the
visitors
to
be
young
Charley
Hexam
and
the
schoolmaster
;
both
standing
facing
him
,
and
both
recognized
at
a
glance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
recollect
this
young
fellow
,
Eugene
?
"
said
Mortimer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
look
at
him
,
"
returned
Wrayburn
,
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
.
<EOS>
I
recollect
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
about
to
repeat
that
former
action
of
taking
him
by
the
chin
,
but
the
boy
had
suspected
him
of
it
,
and
had
thrown
up
his
arm
with
an
angry
start
.
<EOS>
Laughingly
,
Wrayburn
looked
to
Lightwood
for
an
explanation
of
this
odd
visit
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
he
has
something
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Surely
it
must
be
to
you
,
Mortimer
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
thought
,
but
he
says
no
.
<EOS>
He
says
it
is
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
say
so
,
interposed
the
boy
.
<EOS>
And
I
mean
to
say
what
I
want
to
say
,
too
,
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
!
"
  
<EOS>
Passing
him
with
his
eyes
as
if
there
were
nothing
where
he
stood
,
Eugene
looked
on
to
Bradley
Headstone
.
<EOS>
With
consummate
indolence
,
he
turned
to
Mortimer
,
inquiring
:
"
<EOS>
And
who
may
this
other
person
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
Charles
Hexam
's
friend
,
"
said
Bradley
;
"
I
am
Charles
Hexam
's
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
sir
,
you
should
teach
your
pupils
better
manners
,
"
returned
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
Composedly
smoking
,
he
leaned
an
elbow
on
the
chimneypiece
,
at
the
side
of
the
fire
,
and
looked
at
the
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
cruel
look
,
in
its
cold
disdain
of
him
,
as
a
creature
of
no
worth
.
<EOS>
The
schoolmaster
looked
at
him
,
and
that
,
too
,
was
a
cruel
look
,
though
of
the
different
kind
,
that
it
had
a
raging
jealousy
and
fiery
wrath
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
Very
remarkably
,
neither
Eugene
Wrayburn
nor
Bradley
Headstone
looked
at
all
at
the
boy
.
<EOS>
Through
the
ensuing
dialogue
,
those
two
,
no
matter
who
spoke
,
or
whom
was
addressed
,
looked
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
secret
,
sure
perception
between
them
,
which
set
them
against
one
another
in
all
ways
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
some
high
respects
,
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
"
said
Bradley
,
answering
him
with
pale
and
quivering
lips
,
"
the
natural
feelings
of
my
pupils
are
stronger
than
my
teaching
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
most
respects
,
I
dare
say
,
"
replied
Eugene
,
enjoying
his
cigar
,
"
though
whether
high
or
low
is
of
no
importance
.
<EOS>
You
have
my
name
very
correctly
.
<EOS>
Pray
what
is
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
concern
you
much
to
know
,
but
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
interposed
Eugene
,
striking
sharply
and
cutting
him
short
at
his
mistake
,
"
it
does
not
concern
me
at
all
to
know
.
<EOS>
I
can
say
Schoolmaster
,
which
is
a
most
respectable
title
.
<EOS>
You
are
right
,
Schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
dullest
part
of
this
goad
in
its
galling
of
Bradley
Headstone
,
that
he
had
made
it
himself
in
a
moment
of
incautious
anger
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
set
his
lips
so
as
to
prevent
their
quivering
,
but
they
quivered
fast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
"
said
the
boy
,
"
I
want
a
word
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
wanted
it
so
much
,
that
we
have
looked
out
your
address
in
the
book
,
and
we
have
been
to
your
office
,
and
we
have
come
from
your
office
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
given
yourself
much
trouble
,
Schoolmaster
,
"
observed
Eugene
,
blowing
the
feathery
ash
from
his
cigar
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
may
prove
remunerative
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
glad
to
speak
,
"
pursued
the
boy
,
"
in
presence
of
Mr.
Lightwood
,
because
it
was
through
Mr.
Lightwood
that
you
ever
saw
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
mere
moment
,
Wrayburn
turned
his
eyes
aside
from
the
schoolmaster
to
note
the
effect
of
the
last
word
on
Mortimer
,
who
,
standing
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
,
as
soon
as
the
word
was
spoken
,
turned
his
face
towards
the
fire
and
looked
down
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Similarly
,
it
was
through
Mr.
Lightwood
that
you
ever
saw
her
again
,
for
you
were
with
him
on
the
night
when
my
father
was
found
,
and
so
I
found
you
with
her
on
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
Since
then
,
you
have
seen
my
sister
often
.
<EOS>
You
have
seen
my
sister
oftener
and
oftener
.
<EOS>
And
I
want
to
know
why
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
this
worth
while
,
Schoolmaster
?
"
<EOS>
murmured
Eugene
,
with
the
air
of
a
disinterested
adviser
.
<EOS>
"
So
much
trouble
for
nothing
?
<EOS>
You
should
know
best
,
but
I
think
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
"
answered
Bradley
,
with
his
passion
rising
,
<EOS>
"
why
you
address
me
---
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
?
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
Then
I
wo
n't
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
it
so
tauntingly
in
his
perfect
placidity
,
that
the
respectable
right
-
hand
,
clutching
the
respectable
hair
-
guard
of
the
respectable
watch
could
have
wound
it
round
his
throat
and
strangled
him
with
it
.
<EOS>
Not
another
word
did
Eugene
deem
it
worth
while
to
utter
,
but
stood
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
smoking
,
and
looking
imperturbably
at
the
chafing
Bradley
Headstone
with
his
clutching
right
-
hand
,
until
Bradley
was
wellnigh
mad
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
"
proceeded
the
boy
,
"
we
not
only
know
this
that
I
have
charged
upon
you
,
but
we
know
more
.
<EOS>
It
has
not
yet
come
to
my
sister
's
knowledge
that
we
have
found
it
out
,
but
we
have
.
<EOS>
We
had
a
plan
,
Mr.
Headstone
and
I
,
for
my
sister
's
education
,
and
for
its
being
advised
and
overlooked
by
Mr.
Headstone
,
who
is
a
much
more
competent
authority
,
whatever
you
may
pretend
to
think
,
as
you
smoke
,
than
you
could
produce
,
if
you
tried
.
<EOS>
Then
,
what
do
we
find
?
<EOS>
What
do
we
find
,
Mr.
Lightwood
?
<EOS>
Why
,
we
find
that
my
sister
is
already
being
taught
,
without
our
knowing
it
.
<EOS>
We
find
that
while
my
sister
gives
an
unwilling
and
cold
ear
to
our
schemes
for
her
advantage
---
I
,
her
brother
,
and
Mr.
Headstone
,
the
most
competent
authority
,
as
his
certificates
would
easily
prove
,
that
could
be
produced
---
she
is
wilfully
and
willingly
profiting
by
other
schemes
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
and
taking
pains
,
too
,
<EOS>
for
I
know
what
such
pains
are
.
<EOS>
And
so
does
Mr.
Headstone
!
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Somebody
pays
for
this
,
is
a
thought
that
naturally
occurs
to
us
;
who
pays
?
<EOS>
We
apply
ourselves
to
find
out
,
Mr.
Lightwood
,
and
we
find
that
your
friend
,
this
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
here
,
pays
.
<EOS>
Then
I
ask
him
what
right
<EOS>
has
he
to
do
it
,
and
what
does
he
mean
by
it
,
and
how
comes
he
to
be
taking
such
a
liberty
without
my
consent
,
when
I
am
raising
myself
in
the
scale
of
society
by
my
own
exertions
and
Mr.
Headstone
's
aid
,
and
have
no
right
to
have
any
darkness
cast
upon
my
prospects
,
or
any
imputation
upon
my
respectability
,
through
my
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
boyish
weakness
of
this
speech
,
combined
with
its
great
selfishness
,
made
it
a
poor
one
indeed
.
<EOS>
And
yet
Bradley
Headstone
,
used
to
the
little
audience
of
a
school
,
and
unused
to
the
larger
ways
of
men
,
showed
a
kind
of
exultation
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
tell
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
"
pursued
the
boy
,
forced
into
the
use
of
the
third
person
by
the
hopelessness
of
addressing
him
in
the
first
,
"
that
I
object
to
his
having
any
acquaintance
at
all
with
my
sister
,
and
that
I
request
him
to
drop
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
to
take
it
into
his
head
that
I
am
afraid
of
my
sister
's
caring
for
him
---
"
  
(
As
the
boy
sneered
,
the
Master
sneered
,
and
Eugene
blew
off
the
feathery
ash
again
.
)
   
---
<EOS>
"
But
I
object
to
it
,
and
that
's
enough
.
<EOS>
I
am
more
important
to
my
sister
than
he
thinks
.
<EOS>
As
I
raise
myself
,
I
intend
to
raise
her
;
she
knows
that
,
and
she
has
to
look
to
me
for
her
prospects
.
<EOS>
Now
I
understand
all
this
very
well
,
and
so
does
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
My
sister
is
an
excellent
girl
,
but
she
has
some
romantic
notions
;
 
not
about
such
things
as
your
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburns
,
but
about
the
death
of
my
father
and
other
matters
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wrayburn
encourages
those
notions
to
make
himself
of
importance
,
and
so
she
thinks
she
ought
be
grateful
to
him
,
and
perhaps
even
likes
to
be
.
<EOS>
Now
I
do
n't
choose
her
to
be
grateful
to
him
,
or
to
be
grateful
to
anybody
but
me
,
except
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
And
I
tell
Mr.
Wrayburn
that
if
he
do
n't
take
heed
of
what
I
say
,
it
will
be
worse
for
her
.
<EOS>
Let
him
turn
that
over
in
his
memory
,
and
make
sure
of
it
.
<EOS>
Worse
for
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
pause
ensued
,
in
which
the
schoolmaster
looked
very
awkward
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
suggest
,
Schoolmaster
,
"
said
Eugene
,
removing
his
fastwaning
cigar
from
his
lips
to
glance
at
it
,
"
that
you
can
now
take
your
pupil
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
Mr.
Lightwood
,
"
added
the
boy
,
with
a
burning
face
,
under
the
flaming
aggravation
of
getting
no
sort
of
answer
or
attention
,
"
I
hope
you
'll
take
notice
of
what
I
have
said
to
your
friend
,
and
of
what
your
friend
has
heard
me
say
,
word
by
word
,
whatever
he
pretends
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
You
are
bound
to
take
notice
of
it
,
Mr.
Lightwood
,
for
,
as
I
have
already
mentioned
,
you
first
brought
your
friend
into
my
sister
's
company
,
and
but
for
you
we
never
should
have
seen
him
.
<EOS>
Lord
knows
none
of
us
ever
wanted
him
,
any
more
than
any
of
us
will
ever
miss
him
.
<EOS>
Now
Mr.
Headstone
,
as
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
has
been
obliged
to
hear
what
I
had
to
say
,
and
could
n't
help
himself
,
and
as
I
have
said
it
out
to
the
last
word
,
we
have
done
all
we
wanted
to
do
,
and
may
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
down
-
stairs
,
and
leave
me
a
moment
,
Hexam
,
"
he
returned
.
<EOS>
The
boy
complying
with
an
indignant
look
and
as
much
noise
as
he
could
make
,
swung
out
of
the
room
;
and
Lightwood
went
to
the
window
,
and
leaned
there
,
looking
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
me
of
no
more
value
than
the
dirt
under
your
feet
,
"
 
said
Bradley
to
Eugene
,
speaking
in
a
carefully
weighed
and
measured
tone
,
or
he
could
not
have
spoken
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Schoolmaster
,
"
replied
Eugene
,
"
I
do
n't
think
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
true
,
"
returned
the
other
;
"
you
know
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
coarse
,
"
Eugene
retorted
;
"
but
you
do
n't
know
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
at
least
I
know
very
well
that
it
would
be
idle
to
set
myself
against
you
in
insolent
words
or
overbearing
manners
.
<EOS>
That
lad
who
has
just
gone
out
could
put
you
to
shame
in
half
-
a
-
dozen
branches
of
knowledge
in
half
an
hour
,
but
you
can
throw
him
aside
like
an
inferior
.
<EOS>
You
can
do
as
much
by
me
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
beforehand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Possibly
,
"
remarked
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
more
than
a
lad
,
"
said
Bradley
,
with
his
clutching
hand
,
"
and
I
   
WILL
be
heard
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
a
schoolmaster
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
you
are
always
being
heard
.
<EOS>
That
ought
to
content
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
does
not
content
me
,
"
replied
the
other
,
white
with
passion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
that
a
man
,
in
forming
himself
for
the
duties
I
discharge
,
and
in
watching
and
repressing
himself
daily
to
discharge
them
well
,
dismisses
a
man
's
nature
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
judging
from
what
I
see
as
I
look
at
you
,
to
be
rather
too
passionate
for
a
good
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
As
he
spoke
,
he
tossed
away
the
end
of
his
cigar
.
  
<EOS>
"
Passionate
with
you
,
sir
<EOS>
,
I
admit
I
am
.
<EOS>
Passionate
with
you
,
sir
,
I
respect
myself
for
being
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
Devils
for
my
pupils
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
For
your
Teachers
,
I
should
rather
say
,
"
replied
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
my
name
is
Bradley
Headstone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
justly
said
,
my
good
sir
,
your
name
can
not
concern
me
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
more
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
This
more
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
a
misfortune
is
mine
,
"
cried
Bradley
,
breaking
off
to
wipe
the
starting
perspiration
from
his
face
as
he
shook
from
head
to
foot
,
"
that
I
can
not
so
control
myself
as
to
appear
a
stronger
creature
than
this
,
when
a
man
who
has
not
felt
in
all
his
life
what
I
have
felt
in
a
day
can
so
command
himself
!
"
<EOS>
He
said
it
in
a
very
agony
,
and
even
followed
it
with
an
errant
motion
of
his
hands
as
if
he
could
have
torn
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
Wrayburn
looked
on
at
him
,
as
if
he
found
him
beginning
to
be
rather
an
entertaining
study
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
I
desire
to
say
something
to
you
on
my
own
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Schoolmaster
,
"
returned
Eugene
,
with
a
languid
approach
to
impatience
as
the
other
again
struggled
with
himself
;
 
"
say
what
you
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
And
let
me
remind
you
that
the
door
is
standing
open
,
and
your
young
friend
waiting
for
you
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
accompanied
that
youth
here
,
sir
,
I
did
so
with
the
purpose
of
adding
,
as
a
man
whom
you
should
not
be
permitted
to
put
aside
,
in
case
you
put
him
aside
as
a
boy
,
that
his
instinct
is
correct
and
right
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
Bradley
Headstone
,
with
great
effort
and
difficulty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
asked
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
the
other
,
flushed
and
fierce
.
<EOS>
"
I
strongly
support
him
in
his
disapproval
of
your
visits
to
his
sister
,
and
in
his
objection
to
your
officiousness
---
and
worse
---
in
what
you
taken
upon
yourself
to
do
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
asked
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
determined
to
tell
you
that
you
are
not
justified
in
these
proceedings
,
and
that
they
are
injurious
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
her
schoolmaster
as
well
as
her
brother
's
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Or
perhaps
you
would
like
to
be
?
"
said
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
stab
that
the
blood
followed
,
in
its
rush
to
Bradley
Headstone
's
face
,
as
swiftly
as
if
it
had
been
dealt
with
a
dagger
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
"
was
as
much
as
he
could
utter
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
natural
ambition
enough
,
"
said
Eugene
,
coolly
.
<EOS>
"
Far
be
it
from
me
to
say
otherwise
.
<EOS>
The
sister
---
who
is
something
too
much
upon
your
lips
,
perhaps
---
is
so
very
different
from
all
the
associations
to
which
she
has
been
used
,
and
from
all
the
low
obscure
people
about
her
,
that
it
is
a
very
natural
ambition
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
throw
my
obscurity
in
my
teeth
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
can
hardly
be
,
for
I
know
nothing
concerning
it
,
Schoolmaster
,
and
seek
to
know
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
reproach
me
with
my
origin
,
"
said
Bradley
Headstone
;
<EOS>
"
you
cast
insinuations
at
my
bringing
-
up
.
<EOS>
But
I
tell
you
,
sir
,
I
have
worked
my
way
onward
,
out
of
both
and
in
spite
of
both
,
and
have
a
right
to
be
considered
a
better
man
than
you
,
with
better
reasons
for
being
proud
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
I
can
reproach
you
with
what
is
not
within
my
knowledge
,
or
how
I
can
cast
stones
that
were
never
in
my
hand
,
is
a
problem
for
the
ingenuity
of
a
schoolmaster
to
prove
,
"
returned
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
If
you
suppose
that
boy
---
"
  
"
Who
really
will
be
tired
of
waiting
,
"
said
Eugene
,
politely
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
suppose
that
boy
to
be
friendless
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
you
deceive
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
am
his
friend
,
and
you
shall
find
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
find
him
on
the
stairs
,
"
remarked
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
have
promised
yourself
,
sir
,
that
you
could
do
what
you
chose
here
,
because
you
had
to
deal
with
a
mere
boy
,
inexperienced
,
friendless
,
and
unassisted
.
<EOS>
But
I
give
you
warning
that
this
mean
calculation
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
You
have
to
do
with
a
man
also
.
<EOS>
You
have
to
do
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
support
him
,
and
,
if
need
be
,
require
reparation
for
him
.
<EOS>
My
hand
and
heart
are
in
this
cause
,
and
are
open
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
---
quite
a
coincidence
---
the
door
is
open
,
"
remarked
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
scorn
your
shifty
evasions
,
and
I
scorn
you
,
"
said
the
Schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
meanness
of
your
nature
you
revile
me
with
the
meanness
of
my
birth
.
<EOS>
I
hold
you
in
contempt
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
do
n't
profit
by
this
visit
,
and
act
accordingly
,
you
will
find
me
as
bitterly
in
earnest
against
you
as
I
could
be
if
I
deemed
you
worth
a
second
thought
on
my
own
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
consciously
bad
grace
and
stiff
manner
,
as
Wrayburn
looked
so
easily
and
calmly
on
,
he
went
out
with
these
words
,
and
the
heavy
door
closed
like
a
furnace
-
door
upon
his
red
and
white
heats
of
rage
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
curious
monomaniac
,
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
seems
to
believe
that
everybody
was
acquainted
with
his
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
Lightwood
being
still
at
the
window
,
to
which
he
had
in
delicacy
withdrawn
,
Eugene
called
to
him
,
and
he
fell
to
slowly
pacing
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Eugene
,
as
he
lighted
another
cigar
,
"
I
fear
my
unexpected
visitors
have
been
troublesome
.
<EOS>
If
as
a
set
-
off
(
excuse
the
legal
phrase
from
a
barrister
-
at
-
law
)
<EOS>
you
would
like
to
ask
Tippins
to
tea
,
I
pledge
myself
to
make
love
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eugene
,
Eugene
,
Eugene
,
"
replied
Mortimer
,
still
pacing
the
room
<EOS>
,
"
I
am
sorry
for
this
.
<EOS>
And
to
think
that
I
have
been
so
blind
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
blind
,
dear
boy
?
"
inquired
his
unmoved
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
were
your
words
that
night
at
the
river
-
side
public
-
house
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Lightwood
,
stopping
.
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
that
you
asked
me
?
<EOS>
Did
I
feel
like
a
dark
combination
of
traitor
and
pickpocket
when
I
thought
of
that
girl
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
seem
to
remember
the
expression
,
"
said
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
feel
when
you
think
of
her
just
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
friend
made
no
direct
reply
,
but
observed
,
after
a
few
whiffs
of
his
cigar
,
"
Do
n't
mistake
the
situation
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
better
girl
in
all
this
London
than
Lizzie
Hexam

<EOS>
There
is
no
better
among
my
people
at
home

no
better
among
your
people

<EOS>
"
Granted
.
<EOS>
What
follows
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
Eugene
,
looking
after
him
dubiously
as
he
paced
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
"
you
put
me
again
upon
guessing
the
riddle
that
I
have
given
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eugene
,
do
you
design
to
capture
and
desert
this
girl

<EOS>
"
My

fellow

pursue
her

<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
I
do
n't
design
anything
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
design
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
I
am
incapable
of
designs
.
<EOS>
If
I
conceived
a
design
,
I
should
speedily
abandon
it
,
exhausted
by
the
operation

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Eugene
,
Eugene
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mortimer
,
not
that
tone
of
melancholy
reproach
,
I
entreat
.
<EOS>
What
can
I
do
more
than
tell
you
all
know
,
and
acknowledge
my
ignorance
of
all
I
do
n't
know
!
<EOS>
How
does
that
little
old
song
go
,
which
,
under
pretence
of
being
cheerful
,
is
by
far
the
most
lugubrious
I
ever
heard
in
my
life
?
   
<EOS>
`
`
Away
with
melancholy
,
  
Nor
doleful
changes
ring
  
On
life
and
human
folly
,
  
But
merrily
merrily
sing
  
Fal
la
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
Do
n't
let
us
sing
Fal
la
,
my
dear
Mortimer
(
which
is
comparatively
unmeaning
)
,
but
let
us
sing
that
we
give
up
guessing
the
riddle
altogether
.
"
  
"
Are
you
in
communication
with
this
girl
,
Eugene
,
and
is
what
these
people
say
true
?

<EOS>
"
I
concede
both
admissions
to
my
honorable
and
learned
friend

<EOS>
"
Then
what
is
to
come
of
it

What

you
doing

Where
are
you
going
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mortimer
,
one
would
think
the
schoolmaster
had
left
behind
him
a
catechizing
infection
.
<EOS>
You
are
ruffled
by
the
want
of
another
cigar
.
<EOS>
Take
one
of
these
,
I
entreat
.
<EOS>
Light
it
at
mine
,
which
is
in
perfect
order
.
<EOS>
So
!
<EOS>
Now
do
me
the
justice
to
observe
that
I
am
doing
all
I
can
towards
self
-
improvement
,
and
that
you
have
a
light
thrown
on
those
household
implements
which
,
when
you
only
saw
them
as
in
a
glass
darkly
,
you
were
hastily
<EOS>
---
I
must
say
hastily
---
inclined
to
depreciate
.
<EOS>
Sensible
of
my
deficiencies
,
I
have
surrounded
myself
with
moral
influences
expressly
meant
to
promote
the
formation
of
the
domestic
virtues
.
<EOS>
To
those
influences
,
and
to
the
improving
society
of
my
friend
from
boyhood
,
commend
me
with
your
best
wishes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
Eugene
!
"
said
Lightwood
,
affectionately
,
now
standing
near
him
,
so
that
they
both
stood
in
one
little
cloud
of
smoke
;
"
I
would
that
you
answered
my
three
questions
!
<EOS>
What
is
to
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
What
are
you
doing
?
<EOS>
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
my
dear
Mortimer
,
"
returned
Eugene
,
lightly
fanning
away
the
smoke
with
his
hand
for
the
better
exposition
of
his
frankness
of
face
and
manner
,
"
believe
me
,
I
would
answer
them
instantly
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
But
to
enable
me
to
do
so
,
I
must
first
have
found
out
the
troublesome
conundrum
long
abandoned
.
<EOS>
Here
it
is
.
<EOS>
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
"
 
<EOS>
Tapping
his
forehead
and
breast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Riddle
-
me
,
riddle
-
me
-
ree
<EOS>
,
perhaps
you
ca
n't
tell
me
what
this
may
be
?
---
<EOS>
No
,
upon
my
life
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
I
give
it
up

"
   
<EOS>
IN
WHICH
A
FRIENDLY
MOVE
IS
ORIGINATED
.
 
<EOS>
The
arrangement
between
Mr.
Boffin
and
his
literary
man
,
Mr.
Silas
Wegg
,
so
far
altered
with
the
altered
habits
of
Mr.
Boffin
's
life
,
as
that
the
Roman
Empire
usually
declined
in
the
morning
and
in
the
eminently
aristocratic
family
mansion
,
rather
than
in
the
evening
,
as
of
yore
,
and
in
Boffin
's
Bower
.
<EOS>
There
were
occasions
,
however
,
when
Mr.
Boffin
,
seeking
a
brief
refuge
from
the
blandishments
of
fashion
,
would
present
himself
at
the
Bower
after
dark
,
to
anticipate
the
next
sallying
forth
of
Wegg
,
and
would
there
,
on
the
old
settle
,
pursue
the
downward
fortunes
of
those
enervated
and
corrupted
masters
of
the
world
who
were
by
this
time
on
their
last
legs
.
<EOS>
If
Wegg
had
been
worse
paid
for
his
office
,
or
better
qualified
to
discharge
it
,
he
would
have
considered
these
visits
complimentary
and
agreeable
;
but
,
holding
the
position
of
a
handsomely
-
remunerated
humbug
,
he
resented
them
.
<EOS>
This
was
quite
according
to
rule
,
for
the
incompetent
servant
,
by
whomsoever
employed
,
is
always
against
his
employer
.
<EOS>
Even
those
born
governors
,
noble
and
right
honorable
creatures
,
who
have
been
the
most
imbecile
in
high
places
,
have
uniformly
shown
themselves
the
most
opposed
(
sometimes
in
belying
distrust
,
sometimes
in
vapid
insolence
)
to
their
employer
.
<EOS>
What
is
in
such
wise
true
of
the
public
master
and
servant
,
is
equally
true
of
the
private
master
and
servant
all
the
world
over
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Silas
Wegg
did
at
last
obtain
free
access
to
"
Our
House
,
"
as
he
had
been
wo
nt
to
call
the
mansion
outside
which
he
had
sat
shelterless
so
long
,
and
when
he
did
at
last
find
it
in
all
particulars
as
different
from
his
mental
plans
of
it
as
according
to
the
nature
of
things
it
well
could
be
,
that
far
-
seeing
and
far
-
reaching
character
,
by
way
of
asserting
himself
and
making
out
a
case
for
compensation
,
affected
to
fall
into
a
melancholy
strain
of
musing
over
the
mournful
past
;
as
if
the
house
<EOS>
and
he
had
had
a
fall
in
life
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
,
sir
,
"
Silas
would
say
to
his
patron
,
sadly
nodding
his
head
and
musing
,
"
was
once
Our
House
!
<EOS>
This
,
sir
,
is
the
building
from
which
I
have
so
often
seen
those
great
creatures
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
Master
George
,
Aunt
Jane
,
and
Uncle
Parker
"
---
whose
very
names
were
of
his
own
inventing
---
"
pass
and
repass
!
<EOS>
And
has
it
come
to
this
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Ah
dear
me
,
dear
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
tender
were
his
lamentations
,
that
the
kindly
Mr.
Boffin
was
quite
sorry
for
him
,
and
almost
felt
mistrustful
that
in
buying
the
house
he
had
done
him
an
irreparable
injury
.
  
<EOS>
Two
or
three
diplomatic
interviews
,
the
result
of
great
subtlety
on
Mr.
Wegg
's
part
,
but
assuming
the
mask
of
careless
yielding
to
a
fortuitous
combination
of
circumstances
impelling
him
towards
Clerkenwell
,
had
enabled
him
to
complete
his
bargain
with
Mr.
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bring
me
round
to
the
Bower
,
"
said
Silas
,
when
the
bargain
was
closed
,
"
<EOS>
next
Saturday
evening
,
and
if
a
sociable
glass
of
old
Jamaikey
warm
should
meet
your
views
,
I
am
not
the
man
to
begrudge
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
aware
of
my
being
poor
company
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr.
Venus
,
"
but
be
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
being
so
<EOS>
,
here
is
Saturday
evening
come
,
and
here
is
Mr.
Venus
come
,
and
ringing
at
the
Bower
-
gate
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
opens
the
gate
,
descries
a
sort
of
brown
paper
truncheon
under
Mr.
Venus
's
arm
,
and
remarks
,
in
a
dry
tone
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
thought
perhaps
you
might
have
come
in
a
cab
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
replies
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
above
a
parcel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Above
a
parcel
!
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
"
says
Wegg
,
with
some
dissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
But
does
not
openly
growl
,
"
a
certain
sort
of
parcel
might
be
above
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
your
purchase
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
says
Venus
,
politely
handing
it
over
,
"
and
I
am
glad
to
restore
it
to
the
source
from
whence
<EOS>
it
 
---
flowed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
"
says
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
Now
this
affair
is
concluded
,
I
may
mention
to
you
in
a
friendly
way
that
I
've
my
doubts
whether
,
if
I
had
consulted
a
lawyer
,
you
could
have
kept
this
article
back
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
only
throw
it
out
as
a
legal
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
<EOS>
I
bought
you
in
open
contract
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
buy
human
flesh
and
blood
in
this
country
,
sir
;
not
alive
,
you
ca
n't
,
"
says
Wegg
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
query
,
bone
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
a
legal
point
?
"
asks
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
a
legal
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
competent
to
speak
upon
that
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
says
Venus
,
reddening
and
growing
something
louder
;
"
but
upon
a
point
of
fact
I
think
myself
competent
to
speak
;
and
as
a
point
of
fact
I
would
have
seen
you
---
will
you
allow
me
to
say
,
further
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
say
more
than
further
,
if
I
was
you
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
suggests
,
pacifically
.
   
---
"
Before
I
'd
have
given
that
packet
into
your
hand
without
being
paid
my
price
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
how
the
point
of
law
may
stand
,
but
I
'm
thoroughly
confident
upon
the
point
of
fact
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Venus
is
irritable
(
no
doubt
owing
to
his
disappointment
in
love
)
,
and
as
it
is
not
the
cue
of
Mr.
Wegg
to
have
him
out
of
temper
,
the
latter
gentleman
soothingly
remarks
,
"
I
only
put
it
as
a
little
case
;
I
only
put
it
ha'porthetically
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'd
rather
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
you
put
it
another
time
,
penn'orthetically
,
"
 
is
Mr.
Venus
's
retort
,
"
for
I
tell
you
candidly
I
do
n't
like
your
little
-
cases
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arrived
by
this
time
in
Mr.
Wegg
's
sitting
-
room
,
made
bright
on
the
chilly
evening
by
gaslight
and
fire
,
Mr.
Venus
softens
and
compliments
him
on
his
abode
;
profiting
by
the
occasion
to
remind
Wegg
that
he
(
Venus
)
told
him
he
had
got
into
a
good
thing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tolerable
,
"
Wegg
rejoins
.
"
<EOS>
But
bear
in
mind
,
Mr.
Venus
,
that
there
's
no
gold
without
its
alloy
.
<EOS>
Mix
for
yourself
and
take
a
seat
in
the
chimbley
-
corner
.
<EOS>
Will
you
perform
upon
a
pipe
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
but
an
indifferent
performer
,
sir
,
"
returns
the
other
;
"
but
I
'll
accompany
you
with
a
whiff
or
two
at
intervals
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
Mr.
Venus
mixes
,
and
Wegg
mixes
;
and
Mr.
Venus
lights
and
puffs
,
and
Wegg
lights
and
puffs
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
's
alloy
even
in
this
metal
of
yours
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
you
was
remarking
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mystery
,
"
returns
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
it
,
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
have
the
life
knocked
out
of
former
inhabitants
of
this
house
,
in
the
gloomy
dark
,
and
not
know
who
did
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Might
you
have
any
suspicions
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returns
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
who
profits
by
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
no
suspicions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
said
which
,
Mr.
Wegg
smokes
and
looks
at
the
fire
with
a
most
determined
expression
of
Charity
;
as
if
he
had
caught
that
cardinal
virtue
by
the
skirts
as
she
felt
it
her
painful
duty
to
depart
from
him
,
and
held
her
by
main
force
.
  
<EOS>
"
Similarly
,
"
resumes
Wegg
,
<EOS>
"
I
have
observations
as
I
can
offer
upon
certain
points
and
parties
;
but
I
make
no
objections
,
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
Here
is
an
immense
fortune

from
the
clouds
upon
a
person
that
shall
be
nameless

<EOS>
Here
is
a
weekly
allowance
,
with
a
certain
weight
of
coals
,
drops
from
the
clouds
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Which
of
us
is
the
better
man
?
<EOS>
Not
the
person
that
shall
be
nameless
.
<EOS>
That
's
an
observation

mine
,
but
I
do
n't
make
it
an
objection

<EOS>
I
take
my
allowance

my
certain
weight

He
takes
his
fortune

Mr.

"
  
<EOS>
"
Again
look
here

pursues
Silas
,
with
an
oratorical
flourish
of
his
pipe
and
his
wooden
leg
:
<EOS>
the
latter
having
an
undignified
tendency
to
tilt
him
back
in
his
chair
;
"
here
's
another
observation
,
Mr.
Venus
,
unaccompanied
with
an
objection
.
<EOS>
Him
that
shall
be
nameless

liable
to
be
talked
over

<EOS>
He
gets
talked
over

<EOS>
Him

having
me
at

naturally
looking

be
promoted
higher

you
may
perhaps
say
meriting
to
be
promoted
higher

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Venus
murmurs
that
he
does
say
so
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
---
Him
that
shall
be
nameless
,
under
such
circumstances
passes
me
by
,
and
puts
a
talking
-
over
stranger
above
my
head
.
<EOS>
Which
of
us
two
is
the
better
man
?
<EOS>
Which
of

two
can
repeat
most
poetry
?
<EOS>
Which
of

two
has
,
in
the
service
of
him
that
shall
be
nameless
,
tackled
the
Romans
,
both
civil

military
,
till
he
has
got
as
husky
as
if
he
'd
been
weaned
and
ever
since
brought
up
on
sawdust
?
<EOS>
Not
the
talking
-
over
stranger
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
house
is
as
free
to
him
as
if
it
was
his
,
and
he
has
his
room
,
and
is
put
upon
a
footing
,
and
draws
about
a
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
I
am
banished
to
the
Bower
,
to
be
found
in
it
like
a
piece
of
furniture
whenever
wanted

<EOS>
Merit
,
therefore
,
do
n't
win

<EOS>
That
's
the
way
it
works
.
<EOS>
I
observe
it
,
because
I
ca
n't
help
observing
it
,
being
accustomed
to
take
a
powerful
sight

notice

I
do

Ever

Not

Mr.

You

Yes
,
Mr.

peeped
in
from
curiosity

<EOS>
"
Did
you
see
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing

the
dust

yard

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
rolls
his
eyes
all
round
the
room
,
in
that
ever
unsatisfied
quest
of
his
,
and
then
rolls
his
eyes
<EOS>
all
round
Mr.
Venus
;
as
if
suspicious
of
his
having
something
about
him
to
be
found
out

<EOS>
"
And

,

he
pursues

being
acquainted

<EOS>
This

clause
as
a
softening
compliment
to
Mr.

.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
true
,
sir
,
"
replies
Venus
,
winking
his
weak
eyes
,
and
running
his
fingers
through
his
dusty
shock
of
hair
,
"
that
I
was
so
,
before
a
certain
observation
soured
me
.
<EOS>
You
understand
to
what
I
allude
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
<EOS>
To
a
certain
written
statement
respecting
not
wishing
to
be
regarded
in
a
certain
light
.
<EOS>
Since
that
,
all
is
fled

gall

<EOS>
"
Not
all

says
Mr.
Wegg
,
in
a
tone
of
sentimental
condolence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returns
Venus
,
"
all
!
<EOS>
The
world
may
deem
it
harsh
,

I
'd
quite
as
soon
pitch
into
my
best
friend

not

<EOS>
Indeed

I
'd
sooner

"
  
<EOS>
Involuntarily
making
a
pass
with
his
wooden
leg
to
guard
himself
as
Mr.
Venus
springs
up
in
the
emphasis
of
this
unsociable
declaration
,
Mr.
Wegg
tilts
over
on
his
back
,
chair
and
all
,
and
is
rescued
by
that
harmless
misanthrope
,
in
a
disjointed
state
and
ruefully
rubbing
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
lost
your
balance
,
Mr.
Wegg

"
says
Venus
,
handing
him
his
pipe
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
about
time

do
it
,

grumbles
Silas
,
"
when
a
man
's
visitors
,
without
a
word
of
notice
,
conduct
themselves
with
the
sudden
wiciousness
of
Jacks

in

boxes

Do
n't
come
flying
out

soured

Yes

it

says
Wegg
argumentatively
,
"
a
well
-
governed
mind
can
be
soured
sitting

<EOS>
And
as
to
being
regarded
in
lights

there
's
bumpey
lights

In

"
again
rubbing
his
head
,
"
I
object
to
regard
myself

I
'll
bear
it
in

If
you
'll

good

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
slowly
subdues
his
ironical
tone
and
his
lingering
irritation
,
and
resumes
his
pipe
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
talking
of
old
Mr.

Not
a

Mr.

Only
known

have
a
little
deal
with

then

A
very
inquisitive
character

Mr.

regarding
what
was
found
in

As
inquisitive

secret

Ah

You
found
him
secret

<EOS>
returns
Wegg
,
with
a
greedy
relish
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
had
always
the
look
of
it

the
manner
of
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"

with
another
roll
of
his

As

what
was
found
in

dust
now

Did
you
ever
hear
him
mention
how
he
found
it
,
my
dear
friend

<EOS>
Living
on
the
mysterious
premises

one
would
like
to
know
.
<EOS>
For
instance
,
where
he
found
things
?
<EOS>
Or
,
for
instance
,
how
he
set
about
it
?
<EOS>
Whether
he
began
at
the
top
of
the
mounds

whether
he
began
at
the
bottom

<EOS>
Whether
he
prodded

Mr.
Wegg

skilful

expressive

he
scooped

<EOS>
Should

prodded

again

neither

Because
I

the
sorting

On

occasion

"
Mr.
Wegg
,
with
a
hop
on
his
wooden
leg
,
hitches
his
chair
a
little
nearer
;
more
as
if
he
were
proposing
that
himself

Mr.

mix
again

than
that
they

replenish
their

Living

says
Wegg
when
the
other
has
acted
on
his
hospitable
entreaty

now

Mr.

claps
on
his
spectacles

admiringly
surveys
Mr.

from
head

Wegg

holding
Mr.

out

flat

ready
for
smiting

now
smiting
it

Being

cries
Wegg
;

the
apostrophe
is
not
the
less
impressive
for
the
Being
's
hand
being
actually
upon
his
rum
and
water
;

your

returns
that
practical
anatomist

after
drinking

judge
likely

again
holding

tell
his

chiromancy

holding

up

smiting
it

The
palm
of
Silas
Wegg
descends
with
a
sounding
smack
upon
the
palm
of
Venus
,
and
Wegg
lavishly
exclaims
,
"
Twin
in
opinion
equally
with
feeling
!
<EOS>
Mix
a
little
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
Having
now
hitched
his
wooden
leg
and
his
chair
close
in
front
of
Mr.
Venus
,
Mr.
Wegg
rapidly
mixes
for
both
,
gives
his
visitor
his
glass
,
touches
its
rim
with
the
rim
of
his
own
,
puts
his
own
to
his
lips
,
puts
it
down
,
and
spreading
his
hands
on
his
visitor
's
knees
thus
addresses
him
:
  
"
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
that
I
object
to
being
passed
over
for
a
stranger
,
though
I
regard
the
stranger
as
a
more
than
doubtful
customer
.
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
for
the
sake
of
making
money
,
though
money
is
ever
welcome
.
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
for
myself
,
though
I
am
not
so
haughty
as
to
be
above
doing
myself
a
good
turn
.
<EOS>
It
's
for
the
cause
of
the
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
passively
winking
his
weak
eyes
both
at
once
,
demands
:
"
What
is
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
friendly
move
,
sir
,
that
I
now
propose
.
<EOS>
You
see
the
move
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Till
you
have
pointed
it
out
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
I
ca
n't
say
whether
I
do
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
there
is
anything
to
be
found
on
these
premises
,
let
us
find
it
together
.
<EOS>
Let
us
make
the
friendly
move
of
agreeing
to
look
for
it
together
.
<EOS>
Let
us
make
the
friendly
move
of
agreeing
to
share
the
profits
of
it
equally
betwixt
us
.
<EOS>
In
the
cause
of
the
right
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
Silas
assuming
a
noble
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
says
Mr.
Venus
,
looking
up
,
after
meditating
with
his
hair
held
in
his
hands
,
as
if
he
could
only
fix
his
attention
by
fixing
his
head
;
"
if
anything
was
to
be
unburied
from
under
the
dust
,
it
would
be
kept
a
secret
by
you
and
me
?
<EOS>
Would
that
be
it
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
would
depend
upon
what
it
was
,
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
Say
it
was
money
,
or
plate
,
or
jewellery
,
it
would
be
as
much
ours
as
anybody
else
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
rubs
an
eyebrow
,
interrogatively
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
cause
of
the
right
it
would
.
<EOS>
Because
it
would
be
unknowingly
sold
with
the
mounds
else
,
and
the
buyer
would
get
what
he
was
never
meant
to
have
,
and
never
bought
.
<EOS>
And
what
would
that
be
,
Mr.
Venus
,
but
the
cause
of
the
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
it
was
papers
,
"
Mr.
Venus
propounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
According
to
what
they
contained
we
should
offer
to
dispose
of
'em
to
the
parties
most
interested
,
"
replies
Wegg
,
promptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
cause
of
the
right
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Always
so
,
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
If
the
parties
should
use
them
in
the
cause
of
the
wrong
,
that
would
be
their
act
and
deed
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
opinion
of
you
,
sir
,
to
which
it
is
not
easy
to
give
mouth
.
<EOS>
Since
I
called
upon
you
that
evening
when
you
were
,
as
I
may
say
,
floating
your
powerful
mind
in
tea
,
I
have
felt
that
you
required
to
be
roused
with
an
object
.
<EOS>
In
this
friendly
move
,
sir
,
you
will
have
a
glorious
object
to
rouse
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
then
goes
on
to
enlarge
upon
what
throughout
has
been
uppermost
in
his
crafty
mind
:
---
the
qualifications
of
Mr.
Venus
for
such
a
search
.
<EOS>
He
expatiates
on
Mr.
Venus
's
patient
habits
and
delicate
manipulation
;
on
his
skill
in
piecing
little
things
together
;
on
his
knowledge
of
various
tissues
and
textures
;
on
the
likelihood
of
small
indications
leading
him
on
to
the
discovery
of
great
concealments
.
<EOS>
"
While
as
to
myself
,
"
says
Wegg
,
"
I
am
not
good
at
it
.
<EOS>
Whether
I
gave
myself
up
to
prodding
,
or
whether
I
gave
myself
up
to
scooping
,
I
could
n't
do
it
with
that
delicate
touch
so
as
not
to
show
that
I
was
disturbing
the
mounds
.
<EOS>
Quite
different
with
you
going
to
work
(
as
you
would
)
<EOS>
in
the
light
of
a
fellow
-
man
,
holily
pledged
in
a
friendly
move
to
his
brother
man
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
next
modestly
remarks
on
the
want
of
adaptation
in
a
wooden
leg
to
ladders
and
such
like
airy
perches
,
and
also
hints
at
an
inherent
tendency
in
that
timber
fiction
,
when
called
into
action
for
the
purposes
of
a
promenade
on
an
ashey
slope
,
to
stick
itself
into
the
yielding
foothold
,
and
peg
its
owner
to
one
spot
.
<EOS>
Then
,
leaving
this
part
of
the
subject
,
he
remarks
on
the
special
phenomenon
that
before
his
installation
in
the
Bower
,
it
was
from
Mr.
Venus
that
he
first
heard
of
the
legend
of
hidden
wealth
in
the
Mounds
:
"
which
,
"
he
observes
with
a
vaguely
pious
air
,
"
was
surely
never
meant
for
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lastly
,
he
returns
to
the
cause
of
the
right
,
gloomily
foreshadowing
the
possibility
of
something
being
unearthed
to
criminate
Mr.
Boffin
(
of
whom
he
once
more
candidly
admits
it
can
not
be
denied
that
he
profits
by
a
murder
)
,
and
anticipating
his
denunciation
by
the
friendly
movers
to
avenging
justice
.
<EOS>
And
this
,
Mr.
Wegg
expressly
points
out
,
not
at
all
for
the
sake
of
the
reward
---
though
it
would
be
a
want
of
principle
not
to
take
it
.
  
<EOS>
To
all
this
,
Mr.
Venus
,
with
his
shock
of
dusty
hair
cocked
after
the
manner
of
a
terrier
's
ears
,
attends
profoundly
.
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Wegg
,
having
finished
,
opens
his
arms
wide
,
as
if
to
show
Mr.
Venus
how
bare
his
breast
is
,
and
then
folds
them
pending
a
reply
,
Mr.
Venus
winks
at
him
with
both
eyes
some
little
time
before
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
have
tried
it
by
yourself
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
he
says
when
he
does
speak
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
found
out
the
difficulties
by
experience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
I
have
tried
it
,
"
replies
Wegg
,
a
little
dashed
by
the
hint
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
skimmed
it
.
<EOS>
Skimmed
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
found
nothing
besides
the
difficulties
?
"
  
<EOS>
Wegg
shakes
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
scarcely
know
what
to
say
to
this
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
observes
Venus
,
after
ruminating
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
yes
,
"
Wegg
naturally
urges
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
n't
soured
,
my
answer
would
be
no
.
<EOS>
But
being
soured
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
and
driven
to
reckless
madness
and
desperation
,
I
suppose
it
's
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wegg
joyfully
reproduces
the
two
glasses
,
repeats
the
ceremony
of
clinking
their
rims
,
and
inwardly
drinks
with
great
heartiness
to
the
health
and
success
in
life
of
the
young
lady
who
has
reduced
Mr.
Venus
to
his
present
convenient
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
The
articles
of
the
friendly
move
are
then
severally
recited
and
agreed
upon
.
<EOS>
They
are
but
secrecy
,
fidelity
,
and
perseverance
.
<EOS>
The
Bower
to
be
always
free
of
access
to
Mr.
Venus
for
his
researches
,
and
every
precaution
to
be
taken
against
their
attracting
observation
in
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
footstep
!
"
<EOS>
exclaims
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
cries
Wegg
,
starting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Outside
.
<EOS>
St
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
are
in
the
act
of
ratifying
the
treaty
of
friendly
move
,
by
shaking
hands
upon
it
.
<EOS>
They
softly
break
off
,
light
their
pipes
which
have
gone
out
,
and
lean
back
in
their
chairs
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
a
footstep
.
<EOS>
It
approaches
the
window
,
and
a
hand
taps
at
the
glass
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
<EOS>
calls
Wegg
;
meaning
come
round
by
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
the
heavy
old
-
fashioned
sash
is
slowly
raised
,
and
a
head
slowly
looks
in
out
of
the
dark
background
of
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
is
Mr.
Silas
Wegg
here
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
see
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
friendly
movers
might
not
have
been
quite
at
their
ease
,
even
though
the
visitor
had
entered
in
the
usual
manner
.
<EOS>
But
,
leaning
on
the
breast
-
high
window
,
and
staring
in
out
of
the
darkness
,
they
find
the
visitor
extremely
embarrassing
.
<EOS>
Especially
Mr.
Venus
:
who
removes
his
pipe
,
draws
back
his
head
,
and
stares
at
the
starer
,
as
if
it
were
his
own
Hindoo
baby
come
to
fetch
him
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
evening
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
The
yard
gate
-
lock
should
be
looked
to
,
if
you
please
;
it
do
n't
catch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
"
<EOS>
falters
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
disturb
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
coming
in
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
a
message
for
you
,
which
I
undertook
to
deliver
on
my
way
home
to
my
lodgings
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
two
minds
about
coming
beyond
the
gate
without
ringing
:
<EOS>
not
knowing
<EOS>
but
you
might
have
a
dog
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
,
"
mutters
Wegg
,
with
his
back
turned
as
he
rose
from
his
chair
.
<EOS>
St
!
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
The
talking
-
over
stranger
,
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
any
one
I
know
?
<EOS>
"
inquires
the
staring
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
Friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
Passing
the
evening
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
beg
his
pardon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
wishes
you
to
know
that
he
does
not
expect
you
to
stay
at
home
any
evening
,
on
the
chance
of
his
coming
.
<EOS>
It
has
occurred
to
him
that
he
may
,
without
intending
it
,
have
been
a
tie
upon
you
.
<EOS>
In
future
,
if
he
should
come
without
notice
,
he
will
take
his
chance
of
finding
you
,
and
it
will
be
all
the
same
to
him
if
he
does
not
.
<EOS>
I
undertook
to
tell
you
on
my
way
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
and
"
Good
night
,
"
the
Secretary
lowers
the
window
,
and
disappears
.
<EOS>
They
listen
,
and
hear
his
footsteps
go
back
to
the
gate
,
and
hear
the
gate
close
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
for
that
individual
,
Mr.
Venus
,
"
remarks
Wegg
,
when
he
is
fully
gone
,
"
I
have
been
passed
over
!
<EOS>
Let
me
ask
you
what
you
think
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Apparently
,
Mr.
Venus
does
not
know
what
to
think
of
him
,
for
he
makes
sundry
efforts
to
reply
,
without
delivering
himself
of
any
other
articulate
utterance
than
that
he
has
"
a
singular
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
double
look
,
you
mean
,
sir
,
"
rejoins
Wegg
,
playing
bitterly
upon
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
his
look
.
<EOS>
Any
amount
of
singular
look
for
me
,
but
not
a
double
look
!
<EOS>
That
's
an
under
-
handed
mind
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
say
there
's
something
against
him
?
"
<EOS>
Venus
asks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Something
against
him
?
"
repeats
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
Something
?
<EOS>
What
would
the
relief
be
to
my
feelings
---
as
a
fellow
-
man
---
if
I
was
n't
the
slave
of
truth
,
and
did
n't
feel
myself
compelled
to
answer
,
Everything
!
"
  
<EOS>
See
into
what
wonderful
maudlin
refuges
,
featherless
ostriches
plunge
their
heads
!
<EOS>
It
is
such
unspeakable
moral
compensation
to
Wegg
,
to
be
overcome
by
the
consideration
that
Mr.
Rokesmith
has
an
underhanded
mind
!
  
<EOS>
"
On
this
starlight
night
,
Mr.
Venus
,
"
he
remarks
,
when
he
is
showing
that
friendly
mover
out
across
the
yard
,
and
both
are
something
the
worse
for
mixing
again
and
again
:
"
on
this
starlight
night
to
think
that
talking
-
over
strangers
,
and
underhanded
minds
,
can
go
walking
home
under
the
sky
,
as
if
they
was
all
square
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
spectacle
of
those
orbs
,
"
says
Mr.
Venus
,
gazing
upward
with
his
hat
tumbling
off
,
"
brings
heavy
on
me
her
crushing
words
that
she
did
not
wish
to
regard
herself
nor
yet
to
be
regarded
in
that
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
I
know
!
<EOS>
I
know
!
<EOS>
You
need
n't
repeat
'
em
,
"
says
Wegg
,
pressing
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
But
think
how
those
stars
steady
me
in
the
cause
of
the
right
against
some
that
shall
be
nameless
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
that
I
bear
malice
.
<EOS>
But
see
how
they
glisten
with
old
remembrances
!
<EOS>
Old
remembrances
of
what
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
begins
drearily
replying
,
"
Of
her
words
,
in
her
own
handwriting
,
that
she
does
not
wish
to
regard
herself
,
nor
yet

"
 
when
Silas
cuts
him
short
with
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Remembrances
of
Our
House
,
of
Master
George
,
of
Aunt
Jane
,
of
Uncle
Parker

all
laid
waste

All
offered
up
sacrifices

<EOS>
IN

AN
INNOCENT
ELOPEMENT
OCCURS

The

the
Golden
Dustman
,
had
become
as
much
at
home
in
his
eminently
aristocratic
family
mansion
as
he
was
likely
ever
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
feel
that
,
like
an
eminently
aristocratic
family
cheese
,
it
was
much
too
large
for
his
wants
,
and
bred
an
infinite
amount
of
parasites
;
but
he
was
content
to
regard
this
drawback
on
his
property
as
a
sort
of
perpetual
Legacy
Duty
.
<EOS>
He
felt
the
more
resigned
to
it
,
forasmuch
as
Mrs.
Boffin
enjoyed
herself
completely
,
and
Miss
Bella
was
delighted
.
  
<EOS>
That
young
lady
was
,
no
doubt
,
an
acquisition
to
the
Boffins
.
<EOS>
She
was
far
too
pretty
to
be
unattractive
anywhere
,
and
far
too
quick
of
perception
to
be
below
the
tone
of
her
new
career
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
improved
her
heart
might
be
a
matter
of
taste
that
was
open
to
question
;
 
but
as
touching
another
matter
of
taste
,
its
improvement
of
her
appearance
and
manner
,
there
could
be
no
question
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
And
thus
it
soon
came
about
that
Miss
Bella
began
to
set
Mrs.
Boffin
right
;
and
even
further
,
that
Miss
Bella
began
to
feel
ill
at
ease
,
and
as
it
were
responsible
,
when
she
saw
Mrs.
Boffin
going
wrong
.
<EOS>
Not
that
so
sweet
a
disposition
and
so
sound
a
nature
<EOS>
could
ever
go
very
wrong
even
among
the
great
visiting
authorities
who
agreed
that
the
Boffins
were
"
charmingly
vulgar
"
(
which
for
certain
was
not
their
own
case
in
saying
so
)
,
but
that
when
she
made
a
slip
on
the
social
ice
on
which
all
the
children
of
Podsnappery
,
with
genteel
souls
to
be
saved
,
are
required
to
skate
in
circles
,
or
to
slide
in
long
rows
,
she
inevitably
tripped
Miss
Bella
up
(
so
that
young
lady
felt
)
,
and
caused
her
to
experience
great
confusion
under
the
glances
of
the
more
skilful
performers
engaged
in
those
ice
-
exercises
.
  
<EOS>
At
Miss
Bella
's
time
of
life
it
was
not
be
expected
that
she
should
examine
herself
very
closely
on
the
congruity
or
stability
of
her
position
in
Mr.
Boffin
's
house
.
<EOS>
And
as
she
had
never
been
sparing
of
complaints
of
her
old
home
when
she
had
no
other
to
compare
it
with
,
so
there
was
no
novelty
of
ingratitude
or
disdain
in
her
very
much
preferring
her
new
one
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
invaluable
man
is
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
after
some
two
or
three
months
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
quite
make
him
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Neither
could
Bella
,
so
she
found
the
subject
rather
interesting
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
takes
more
care
of
my
affairs
,
morning
,
noon
,
and
night
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
than
fifty
other
men
put
together
either
could
or
would
;
 
and
yet
he
has
ways
of
his
own
that
are
like
tying
a
scaffolding
-
pole
right
across
the
road
,
and
bringing
me
up
short
when
I
am
almost
a
-
walking
arm
in
arm
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
how
so
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
he
wo
n't
meet
any
company
here
,
but
you
.
<EOS>
When
we
have
visitors
,
I
should
wish
him
to
have
his
regular
place
at
the
table
like
ourselves
;
but
no
,
he
wo
n't
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
considers
himself
above
it
,
"
said
Miss
Bella
,
with
an
airy
toss
of
her
head
,
"
I
should
leave
him
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
that
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Mr.
Boffin
,
thinking
it
over
.
"
<EOS>
He
do
n't
consider
himself
above
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
considers
himself
beneath
it
,
"
suggested
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
If
so
,
he
ought
to
know
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
;
nor
it
ai
n't
that
,
neither
.
<EOS>
No
,
"
repeated
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
shake
of
his
head
,
after
again
thinking
it
over
;
"
Rokesmith
's
a
modest
man
,
but
he
do
n't
consider
himself
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
does
he
consider
,
sir
?
"
asked
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dashed
if
I
know
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
It
seemed
at
first
as
if
it
was
only
Lightwood
that
he
objected
to
meet
.
<EOS>
And
now
it
seems
to
be
everybody
,
except
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
"
thought
Miss
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
---
deed
!
<EOS>
That
's
it
,
is
it
!
"
<EOS>
For
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
had
dined
there
two
or
three
times
,
and
she
had
met
him
elsewhere
,
and
he
had
shown
her
some
attention
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
cool
in
a
Secretary
---
and
Pa
's
lodger
---
to
make
me
the
subject
of
his
jealousy
!
"
  
<EOS>
That
Pa
's
daughter
should
be
so
contemptuous
of
Pa
's
lodger
<EOS>
was
odd
;
but
there
were
odder
anomalies
than
that
in
the
mind
of
the
spoilt
girl
:
the
doubly
spoilt
girl
:
spoilt
first
by
poverty
,
and
then
by
wealth
.
<EOS>
Be
it
this
history
's
part
,
however
,
to
leave
them
to
unravel
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
little
too
much
,
I
think
,
"
Miss
Bella
reflected
scornfully
,
"
to
have
Pa
's
lodger
laying
claim
to
me
,
and
keeping
eligible
people
off
!
<EOS>
A
little
too
much
,
indeed
,
to
have
the
opportunities
opened
to
me
by
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
appropriated
by
a
mere
Secretary
and
Pa
's
lodger
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
not
so
very
long
ago
that
Bella
had
been
fluttered
by
the
discovery
that
this
same
Secretary
and
lodger
seemed
to
like
her
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
the
eminently
aristocratic
mansion
and
Mrs.
Boffin
's
dressmaker
had
not
come
into
play
then
.
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
seemingly
retiring
manners
a
very
intrusive
person
,
this
Secretary
and
lodger
,
in
Miss
Bella
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
Always
a
light
in
his
office
-
room
when
we
came
home
from
the
play
or
Opera
,
and
he
always
at
the
carriage
-
door
to
hand
us
out
.
<EOS>
Always
a
provoking
radiance
too
on
Mrs.
Boffin
's
face
,
and
an
abominably
cheerful
reception
of
him
,
as
if
it
were
possible
seriously
to
approve
what
the
man
had
in
his
mind
!
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
charge
me
,
Miss
Wilfer
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
encountering
her
by
chance
alone
in
the
great
drawing
-
room
,
"
with
commissions
for
home
.
<EOS>
I
shall
always
be
happy
to
execute
any
commands
you
may
have
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
what
may
you
mean
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
"
inquired
Miss
Bella
,
with
languidly
drooping
eyelids
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
home
?
<EOS>
I
mean
your
father
's
house
at
Holloway
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
coloured
under
the
retort
---
so
skilfully
thrust
,
that
the
words
seemed
to
be
merely
a
plain
answer
,
given
in
plain
good
faith
---
and
said
,
rather
more
emphatically
and
sharply
:
  
"
What
commissions
and
commands
are
you
speaking
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
such
little
words
of
remembrance
as
I
assume
you
send
somehow
or
other
,
"
replied
the
Secretary
with
his
former
air
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
pleasure
to
me
if
you
would
make
me
the
bearer
of
them
.
<EOS>
As
you
know
,
I
come
and
go
between
the
two
houses
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
remind
me
of
that
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
too
quick
in
this
petulant
sally
against
"
Pa
's
lodger
;
"
 
and
she
felt
that
she
had
been
so
when
she
met
his
quiet
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
send
many
---
what
was
your
expression
?
<EOS>
---
words
of
remembrance
to
me
,
"
said
Bella
,
making
haste
to
take
refuge
in
illusage
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
frequently
ask
me
about
you
,
and
I
give
them
such
slight
intelligence
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
's
truly
given
,
"
exclaimed
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
can
not
doubt
it
,
for
it
would
be
very
much
against
you
,
if
you
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
not
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
I
deserve
the
reproach
,
which
is
very
just
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
beg
you
not
to
do
so
,
but
that
it
shows
you
to
such
admirable
advantage
,
"
he
replied
with
earnestness
.
"
<EOS>
Forgive
me
;
I
could
not
help
saying
that
.
<EOS>
To
return
to
what
I
have
digressed
from
,
let
me
add
that
perhaps
they
think
I
report
them
to
you
,
deliver
little
messages
,
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
But
I
forbear
to
trouble
you
,
as
you
never
ask
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
,
looking
at
him
as
if
he
had
reproved
her
"
to
see
them
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
,
"
he
asked
,
hesitating
,
said
to
me
,
or
to
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
which
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
both
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
make
it
a
message
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
if
you
like
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
Message
or
no
message
<EOS>
,
I
am
going
to
see
them
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
will
tell
them
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
lingered
a
moment
,
as
though
to
give
her
the
opportunity
of
prolonging
the
conversation
if
she
wished
.
<EOS>
As
she
remained
silent
,
he
left
her
.
<EOS>
Two
incidents
of
the
little
interview
were
felt
by
Miss
Bella
herself
,
when
alone
again
,
to
be
very
curious
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
,
that
he
unquestionably
left
her
with
a
penitent
air
upon
her
,
and
a
penitent
feeling
in
her
heart
.
<EOS>
The
second
was
,
that
she
had
not
had
an
intention
or
a
thought
of
going
home
,
until
she
had
announced
it
to
him
as
a
settled
design
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
I
mean
by
it
,
or
what
can
he
mean
by
it
?
"
was
her
mental
inquiry
:
"
<EOS>
He
has
no
right
to
any
power
over
me
,
and
how
do
I
come
to
mind
him
when
I
do
n't
care
for
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
,
insisting
that
Bella
should
make
to
-
morrow
's
expedition
in
the
chariot
<EOS>
,
she
went
home
in
great
grandeur
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
and
Miss
Lavinia
had
speculated
much
on
the
probabilities
and
improbabilities
of
her
coming
in
this
gorgeous
state
,
and
,
on
beholding
the
chariot
from
the
window
at
which
they
were
secreted
to
look
out
for
it
,
agreed
that
it
must
be
detained
at
the
door
as
long
as
possible
,
for
the
mortification
and
confusion
of
the
neighbours
.
<EOS>
Then
they
repaired
to
the
usual
family
room
,
to
receive
Miss
Bella
with
a
becoming
show
of
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
The
family
room
looked
very
small
and
very
mean
,
and
the
downward
staircase
by
which
it
was
attained
looked
very
narrow
and
very
crooked
.
<EOS>
The
little
house
and
all
its
arrangements
were
a
poor
contrast
to
the
eminently
aristocratic
dwelling
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
hardly
believe
,
"
 
thought
Bella
,
"
that
I
ever
did
endure
life
in
this
place
!
"
  
<EOS>
Gloomy
majesty
on
the
part
of
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
and
native
pertness
on
the
part
of
Lavvy
,
did
not
mend
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Bella
really
stood
in
natural
need
of
a
little
help
,
and
she
got
none
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
presenting
a
cheek
to
be
kissed
,
as
sympathetic
and
responsive
as
the
back
of
the
bowl
of
a
spoon
,
"
is
quite
an
honor
!
<EOS>
You
will
probably
find
your
sister
Lavvy
grown
,
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ma
,
"
Miss
Lavinia
interposed
,
"
there
can
be
no
objection
to
your
being
aggravating
,
because
Bella
richly
deserves
it
;
but
I
really
must
request
that
you
will
not
drag
in
such
ridiculous
nonsense
as
my
having
grown
when
I
am
past
the
growing
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
grew
,
myself
,
"
Mrs.
Wilfer
sternly
proclaimed
,
"
after
I
was
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
well
,
Ma
,
"
returned
Lavvy
,
"
<EOS>
then
I
think
you
had
much
better
have
left
it
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
lofty
glare
with
which
the
majestic
woman
received
this
answer
,
might
have
embarrassed
a
less
pert
opponent
,
but
it
had
no
effect
upon
Lavinia
:
who
,
leaving
her
parent
to
the
enjoyment
of
any
amount
of
glaring
that
she
might
deem
desirable
under
the
circumstances
,
accosted
her
sister
,
undismayed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
wo
n't
consider
yourself
quite
disgraced
,
<EOS>
Bella
,
if
I
give
you
a
kiss
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
And
how
do
you
do
,
Bella
?
<EOS>
And
how
are
your
Boffins
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Peace
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
"
<EOS>
Hold
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
suffer
this
tone
of
levity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
goodness
me
!
<EOS>
How
are
your
Spoffins
,
then
?
"
said
Lavvy
,
"
since
Ma
so
very
much
objects
to
your
Boffins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impertinent
girl
!
<EOS>
Minx
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
dread
severity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
whether
I
am
a
Minx
,
or
a
Sphinx
,
"
returned
Lavinia
,
coolly
,
tossing
her
head
;
"
it
's
exactly
the
same
thing
to
me
,
and
I
'd
every
bit
as
soon
be
one
as
the
other
;
but
I
know
this
---
  
<EOS>
I
'll
not
grow
after
I
am
married
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
?
<EOS>
You
will
not
?
"
repeated
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
solemnly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Ma
,
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
Nothing
shall
induce
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
having
waved
her
gloves
,
became
loftily
pathetic
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
was
to
be
expected
;
"
thus
she
spake
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
child
of
mine
deserts
me
for
the
proud
and
prosperous
,
and
another
child
of
mine
despises
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
quite
fitting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ma
,
"
Bella
struck
in
,
"
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
are
prosperous
,
no
doubt
;
but
you
have
no
right
to
say
they
are
proud
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
very
well
that
they
are
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
Ma
,
"
said
Lavvy
,
bouncing
over
to
the
enemy
without
a
word
of
notice
,
"
you
must
know
very
well
---
or
if
you
do
n't
,
more
shame
for
you
!
---
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
are
just
absolute
perfection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
courteously
receiving
the
deserter
,
"
it
would
seem
that
we
are
required
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
And
this
,
Lavinia
,
is
my
reason
for
objecting
to
a
tone
of
levity
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
(
of
whose
physiognomy
I
can
never
speak
with
the
composure
I
would
desire
to
preserve
)
,
and
your
mother
,
are
not
on
terms
of
intimacy
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
a
moment
to
be
supposed
that
she
and
her
husband
dare
to
presume
to
speak
of
this
family
as
the
Wilfers
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
therefore
condescend
to
speak
of
them
as
the
Boffins
.
<EOS>
No
;
 
for
such
a
tone
---
call
it
familiarity
,
levity
,
equality
,
or
what
<EOS>
you
will
 
---
would
imply
those
social
interchanges
which
do
not
exist
.
<EOS>
Do
I
render
myself
intelligible
?
"
  
<EOS>
Without
taking
the
least
notice
of
this
inquiry
,
albeit
delivered
in
an
imposing
and
forensic
manner
,
Lavinia
reminded
her
sister
,
"
After
all
,
you
know
,
Bella
,
you
have
n't
told
us
how
your
Whatshisnames
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
speak
of
them
here
,
"
replied
Bella
,
suppressing
indignation
,
and
tapping
her
foot
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
much
too
kind
and
too
good
to
be
drawn
into
these
discussions
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
put
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
biting
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
"
Why
adopt
a
circuitous
form
of
speech
?
<EOS>
It
is
polite
and
it
is
obliging
;
but
why
do
it
?
<EOS>
Why
not
openly
say
that
they
are
much
too
kind
and
too
good
for
us
?
<EOS>
We
understand
the
allusion
.
<EOS>
Why
disguise
the
phrase
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ma
,
"
said
Bella
,
with
one
beat
of
her
foot
,
"
you
are
enough
to
drive
a
saint
mad
,
and
so
is
Lavvy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unfortunate
Lavvy
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
.
<EOS>
"
She
always
comes
in
for
it
.
<EOS>
My
poor
child
!
"
<EOS>
But
Lavvy
,
with
the
suddenness
of
her
former
desertion
,
now
bounced
over
to
the
other
enemy
:
very
sharply
remarking
,
"
Do
n't
patronise
me
,
Ma
,
because
I
can
take
care
of
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
wonder
,
"
resumed
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
directing
her
observations
to
her
elder
daughter
,
as
safer
on
the
whole
than
her
utterly
unmanageable
younger
,
"
that
you
found
time
and
inclination
to
tear
yourself
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
and
come
to
see
us
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
only
wonder
that
our
claims
,
contending
against
the
superior
claims
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
had
any
weight
.
<EOS>
I
feel
I
ought
to
be
thankful
for
gaining
so
much
,
in
competition
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
.
"
<EOS>
(
The
good
lady
bitterly
emphasized
the
first
letter
of
the
word
Boffin
,
as
if
it
represented
her
chief
objection
to
the
owners
of
that
name
,
and
as
if
she
could
have
borne
Doffin
,
Moffin
,
or
Poffin
much
better
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Ma
,
"
said
Bella
,
angrily
,
<EOS>
"
you
force
me
to
say
that
I
am
truly
sorry
I
did
come
home
,
and
that
I
never
will
come
home
again
,
except
when
poor
dear
Pa
is
here
.
<EOS>
For
,
Pa
is
too
magnanimous
to
feel
envy
and
spite
towards
my
generous
friends
,
and
Pa
is
delicate
enough
and
gentle
enough
to
remember
the
sort
of
little
claim
they
thought
I
had
upon
them
and
the
unusually
trying
position
in
which
,
through
no
act
of
my
own
,
I
had
been
placed
.
<EOS>
And
I
always
did
love
poor
dear
Pa
better
than
all
the
rest
of
you
put
together
,
and
I
always
do
<EOS>
and
I
always
shall
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Bella
,
deriving
no
comfort
from
her
charming
bonnet
and
her
elegant
dress
,
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
R.
W.
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
lifting
up
her
eyes
and
apostrophising
the
air
,
"
that
if
you
were
present
,
it
would
be
a
trial
to
your
feelings
to
hear
your
wife
and
the
mother
of
your
family
depreciated
in
your
name
.
<EOS>
But
Fate
has
spared
you
this
,
R.
W.
,
whatever
it
may
have
thought
proper
to
inflict
upon
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mrs.
Wilfer
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
the
Boffins
!
"
protested
Miss
Lavinia
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
who
objects
to
their
being
called
the
Boffins
.
<EOS>
I
   
WILL
call
'em
the
Boffins
.
<EOS>
The
Boffins
,
the
Boffins
,
the
Boffins
!
<EOS>
And
I
say
they
are
mischief
-
making
Boffins
,
and
<EOS>
I
say
the
Boffins
have
set
Bella
against
me
,
and
I
tell
the
Boffins
to
their
faces
:
"
which
was
not
strictly
the
fact
,
but
the
young
lady
was
excited
:
"
that
they
are
detestable
Boffins
,
disreputable
Boffins
,
odious
Boffins
,
beastly
Boffins
.
<EOS>
There
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Miss
Lavinia
burst
into
tears
.
  
<EOS>
The
front
garden
-
gate
clanked
,
and
the
Secretary
was
seen
coming
at
a
brisk
pace
up
the
steps
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
Me
to
open
the
door
to
him
,
"
 
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
rising
with
stately
resignation
as
she
shook
her
head
and
dried
her
eyes
;
"
we
have
at
present
no
stipendiary
girl
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
If
he
sees
these
traces
of
emotion
on
our
cheeks
,
let
him
construe
them
as
he
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
those
words
she
stalked
out
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
she
stalked
in
again
,
proclaiming
in
her
heraldic
manner
,
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
is
the
bearer
of
a
packet
for
Miss
Bella
Wilfer
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
followed
close
upon
his
name
,
and
of
course
saw
what
was
amiss
.
<EOS>
But
he
discreetly
affected
to
see
nothing
,
and
addressed
Miss
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Boffin
intended
to
have
placed
this
in
the
carriage
for
you
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
wished
you
to
have
it
,
as
a
little
keepsake
he
had
prepared
---
it
is
only
a
purse
,
Miss
Wilfer
---
but
as
he
was
disappointed
in
his
fancy
,
I
volunteered
to
come
after
you
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
took
it
in
her
hand
,
and
thanked
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
quarrelling
here
a
little
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
but
not
more
than
we
used
;
you
know
our
agreeable
ways
among
ourselves
.
<EOS>
You
find
me
just
going
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
mamma
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Lavvy
!
"
<EOS>
And
with
a
kiss
for
each
Miss
Bella
turned
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
Secretary
would
have
attended
her
,
but
Mrs.
Wilfer
advancing
and
saying
with
dignity
,
"
Pardon
me
!
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
assert
my
natural
right
to
escort
my
child
to
the
equipage
which
is
in
waiting
for
her
,
"
he
begged
pardon
and
gave
place
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
magnificent
spectacle
indeed
,
to
see
Mrs.
Wilfer
throw
open
the
house
---
door
,
and
loudly
demand
with
extended
gloves
,
"
The
male
domestic
of
Mrs.
Boffin
!
"
 
<EOS>
To
whom
presenting
himself
,
she
delivered
the
brief
but
majestic
charge
,
"
Miss
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
Coming
out
!
"
<EOS>
and
so
delivered
her
over
,
like
a
female
Lieutenant
of
the
Tower
relinquishing
a
State
Prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
this
ceremonial
was
for
some
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
perfectly
paralysing
on
the
neighbours
,
and
was
much
enhanced
by
the
worthy
lady
airing
herself
for
that
term
in
a
kind
of
splendidly
serene
trance
on
the
top
step
.
  
<EOS>
When
Bella
was
seated
in
the
carriage
,
she
opened
the
little
packet
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
It
contained
a
pretty
purse
,
and
the
purse
contained
a
bank
note
for
fifty
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
This
shall
be
a
joyful
surprise
for
poor
dear
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
and
I
'll
take
it
myself
into
the
City
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
was
uninformed
respecting
the
exact
locality
of
the
place
of
business
of
Chicksey
Veneering
and
Stobbles
,
but
knew
it
to
be
near
Mincing
Lane
,
she
directed
herself
to
be
driven
to
the
corner
of
that
darksome
spot
.
<EOS>
Thence
she
despatched
"
the
male
domestic
of
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
in
search
of
the
counting
-
house
of
Chicksey
Veneering
and
Stobbles
,
with
a
message
importing
that
if
R.
Wilfer
could
come
out
,
there
was
a
lady
waiting
who
would
be
glad
to
speak
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
delivery
of
these
mysterious
words
from
the
mouth
of
a
footman
caused
so
great
an
excitement
in
the
counting
-
house
,
that
a
youthful
scout
was
instantly
appointed
to
follow
Rumty
,
observe
the
lady
,
and
come
in
with
his
report
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
agitation
by
any
means
diminished
,
when
the
scout
rushed
back
with
the
intelligence
that
the
lady
was
"
a
slap
-
up
gal
in
a
bang
-
up
chariot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Rumty
himself
,
with
his
pen
behind
his
ear
under
his
rusty
hat
,
arrived
at
the
carriage
-
door
in
a
breathless
condition
,
and
had
been
fairly
lugged
into
the
vehicle
by
his
cravat
and
embraced
almost
unto
choking
,
before
he
recognised
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
he
then
panted
,
incoherently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
gracious
me
!
<EOS>
What
a
lovely
woman
you
are
!
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
been
unkind
and
forgotten
your
mother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
been
to
see
them
,
<EOS>
Pa
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
and
how
---
how
did
you
find
your
mother
?
"
asked
R.
W.
,
dubiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
disagreeable
,
Pa
,
and
so
was
Lavvy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
sometimes
a
little
liable
to
it
,
"
observed
the
patient
cherub
;
"
but
I
hope
you
made
allowances
,
Bella
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
was
disagreeable
too
,
Pa
;
we
were
all
of
us
disagreeable
together
.
<EOS>
But
I
want
you
to
come
and
dine
with
me
somewhere
,
<EOS>
Pa.
"
  
"
Why
,
my
dear
,
I
have
already
partaken
of
a
---
if
one
might
mention
such
an
article
in
this
superb
chariot
---
of
a
---
Saveloy
,
"
replied
R.
Wilfer
,
modestly
dropping
his
voice
on
the
word
,
as
he
eyed
the
canary
-
coloured
fittings
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
That
's
nothing
,
Pa
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
it
ai
n't
as
much
as
one
could
sometimes
wish
it
to
be
,
my
dear
,
"
he
admitted
,
drawing
his
hand
across
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Still
when
,
circumstances
over
which
you
have
no
control
,
interpose
obstacles
between
yourself
and
Small
Germans
,
you
ca
n't
do
better
than
bring
a
contented
mind
to
bear
on
"
---
again
dropping
his
voice
in
deference
to
the
chariot
---
"
Saveloys
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
poor
good
Pa
!
<EOS>
Pa
,
do
,
I
beg
and
pray
,
get
leave
for
the
rest
of
the
day
,
and
come
and
pass
it
with
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
I
'll
cut
back
and
ask
for
leave
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
before
you
cut
back
,
"
said
Bella
,
who
had
already
taken
him
by
the
chin
,
pulled
his
hat
off
,
and
begun
to
stick
up
his
hair
in
her
old
way
,
"
do
say
that
you
are
sure
I
am
giddy
and
inconsiderate
,
but
have
never
really
slighted
you
,
<EOS>
Pa.
"
  
"
My
dear
,
I
say
it
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
And
might
I
likewise
observe
,
"
her
father
delicately
hinted
,
with
a
glance
out
at
window
,
"
that
perhaps
it
might
be
calculated
to
attract
attention
,
having
one
's
hair
publicly
done
by
a
lovely
woman
in
an
elegant
turn
-
out
in
Fenchurch
Street
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
laughed
and
put
on
his
hat
again
.
<EOS>
But
when
his
boyish
figure
bobbed
away
,
its
shabbiness
and
cheerful
patience
smote
the
tears
out
of
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
hate
that
Secretary
for
thinking
it
of
me
,
"
 
she
said
to
herself
,
"
and
yet
it
seems
half
true
!
"
  
<EOS>
Back
came
her
father
,
more
like
a
boy
than
ever
,
in
his
release
from
school
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
right
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Leave
given
at
once
.
<EOS>
Really
very
handsomely
done
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
where
can
we
find
some
quiet
place
,
Pa
,
in
which
I
can
wait
for
you
while
you
go
on
an
errand
for
me
,
if
I
send
the
carriage
away
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
demanded
cogitation
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
my
dear
,
"
he
explained
,
"
you
really
have
become
such
a
very
lovely
woman
,
that
it
ought
to
be
a
very
quiet
place
.
<EOS>
"
At
length
he
suggested
,
"
Near
the
garden
up
by
the
Trinity
House
on
Tower
Hill
.
"
<EOS>
So
,
they
were
driven
there
,
and
Bella
dismissed
the
chariot
;
sending
a
pencilled
note
by
it
to
Mrs.
Boffin
,
that
she
was
with
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Pa
,
attend
to
what
I
am
going
to
say
,
and
promise
and
vow
to
be
obedient
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
and
vow
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ask
no
questions
.
<EOS>
You
take
this
purse
;
you
go
to
the
nearest
place
where
they
keep
everything
of
the
very
very
best
,
ready
made
;
you
buy
and
put
on
,
the
most
beautiful
suit
of
clothes
,
the
most
beautiful
hat
,
and
the
most
beautiful
pair
of
bright
boots
(
patent
leather
,
Pa
,
mind
!
)
<EOS>
that
are
to
be
got
for
money
;
and
you
come
back
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
Bella
---
"
  
"
Take
care
,
Pa
!
"
pointing
her
forefinger
at
him
,
merrily
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
promised
and
vowed
.
<EOS>
It
's
perjury
,
you
know
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
water
in
the
foolish
little
fellow
's
eyes
,
but
she
kissed
them
dry
(
though
her
own
were
wet
)
,
and
he
bobbed
away
again
.
<EOS>
After
half
an
hour
,
he
came
back
,
so
brilliantly
transformed
,
that
Bella
was
obliged
to
walk
round
him
in
ecstatic
admiration
twenty
times
,
before
she
could
draw
her
arm
through
his
,
and
delightedly
squeeze
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
hugging
him
close
,
"
take
this
lovely
woman
out
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
shall
we
go
,
my
dear
?
"
  
"
Greenwich
!
"
said
Bella
,
valiantly
.
"
<EOS>
And
be
sure
you
treat
this
lovely
woman
with
everything
of
the
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
they
were
going
along
to
take
boat
,
"
Do
n't
you
wish
,
my
dear
,
"
said
R.
W.
,
timidly
,
"
that
your
mother
was
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
,
Pa
,
for
I
like
to
have
you
all
to
myself
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
was
always
your
little
favourite
at
home
,
and
you
were
always
mine
.
<EOS>
We
have
run
away
together
often
,
before
now
;
have
n't
we
,
Pa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
we
have
!
<EOS>
Many
a
Sunday
when
your
mother
was
 
---
was
a
little
liable
to
it
,
"
repeating
his
former
delicate
expression
after
pausing
to
cough
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
I
am
afraid
I
was
seldom
or
never
as
good
as
I
ought
to
have
been
,
<EOS>
Pa.
I
made
you
carry
me
,
over
and
over
again
,
when
you
should
have
made
me
walk
;
and
I
often
drove
you
in
harness
,
when
you
would
much
rather
have
sat
down
and
read
your
newspaper
:
<EOS>
did
n't
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
,
sometimes
.
<EOS>
But
Lor
,
what
a
child
you
were
!
<EOS>
What
a
companion
you
were
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Companion
?
<EOS>
That
's
just
what
I
want
to
be
to
-
day
,
Pa.
"
  
"
You
are
safe
to
succeed
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
Your
brothers
and
sisters
have
all
in
their
turns
been
companions
to
me
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
but
only
to
a
certain
extent
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
has
,
throughout
life
,
been
a
companion
that
any
man
might
---
might
look
up
to
---
and
---
and
commit
the
sayings
of
,
to
memory
---
and
---
form
himself
upon
---
if
he
---
"
  
"
If
he
liked
the
model
?
"
suggested
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
-
ell
,
ye
-
es
,
"
he
returned
,
thinking
about
it
,
not
quite
satisfied
with
the
phrase
:
"
or
perhaps
I
might
say
,
if
it
was
in
him
.
<EOS>
Supposing
,
for
instance
,
that
a
man
wanted
to
be
always
marching
,
he
would
find
your
mother
an
inestimable
companion
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
had
any
taste
for
walking
,
or
should
wish
at
any
time
to
break
into
a
trot
,
he
might
sometimes
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
keep
step
with
your
mother
.
<EOS>
Or
take
it
this
way
,
Bella
,
"
he
added
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
;
"
Supposing
that
a
man
had
to
go
through
life
,
we
wo
n't
say
with
a
companion
,
but
we
'll
say
to
a
tune
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
Supposing
that
the
tune
allotted
to
him
was
the
Dead
March
in
Saul
.
<EOS>
Well
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
very
suitable
tune
for
particular
occasions
---
none
better
---
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
keep
time
with
in
the
ordinary
run
of
domestic
transactions
.
<EOS>
For
instance
,
if
he
took
his
supper
after
a
hard
day
,
to
the
Dead
March
in
Saul
,
his
food
might
be
likely
to
sit
heavy
on
him
.
<EOS>
Or
,
if
he
was
at
any
time
inclined
to
relieve
his
mind
by
singing
a
comic
song
or
dancing
a
hornpipe
,
and
was
obliged
to
do
it
to
the
Dead
March
in
Saul
,
he
might
find
himself
put
out
in
the
execution
of
his
lively
intentions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Pa
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Bella
,
as
she
hung
upon
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
I
will
say
for
you
,
my
dear
,
"
the
cherub
pursued
mildly
and
without
a
notion
of
complaining
,
"
is
,
that
you
are
so
adaptable
.
<EOS>
So
adaptable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
I
am
afraid
I
have
shown
a
wretched
temper
,
<EOS>
Pa.
I
am
afraid
I
have
been
very
complaining
,
and
very
capricious
.
<EOS>
I
seldom
or
never
thought
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
sat
in
the
carriage
just
now
and
saw
you
coming
along
the
pavement
,
I
reproached
myself
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
of
such
a
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
happy
and
a
chatty
man
was
Pa
in
his
new
clothes
that
day
.
<EOS>
Take
it
for
all
in
all
,
it
was
perhaps
the
happiest
day
he
had
ever
known
in
his
life
:
not
even
excepting
that
on
which
his
heroic
partner
had
approached
the
nuptial
altar
to
the
tune
of
the
Dead
March
in
Saul
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
expedition
down
the
river
was
delightful
,
and
the
little
room
overlooking
the
river
into
which
they
were
shown
for
dinner
was
delightful
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
delightful
.
<EOS>
The
park
was
delightful
,
the
punch
was
delightful
,
the
dishes
of
fish
were
delightful
,
the
wine
was
delightful
.
<EOS>
Bella
was
more
delightful
than
any
other
item
in
the
festival
;
drawing
Pa
out
in
the
gayest
manner
;
making
a
point
of
always
mentioning
herself
as
the
lovely
woman
;
stimulating
Pa
to
order
things
,
by
declaring
that
the
lovely
woman
insisted
on
being
treated
with
them
;
and
in
short
causing
Pa
to
be
quite
enraptured
with
the
consideration
that
he
was
the
Pa
of
such
a
charming
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
as
they
sat
looking
at
the
ships
and
steamboats
making
their
way
to
the
sea
with
the
tide
that
was
running
down
,
the
lovely
woman
imagined
all
sorts
of
voyages
for
herself
and
Pa.
<EOS>
Now
,
Pa
,
in
the
character
of
owner
of
a
lumbering
square
-
sailed
collier
,
was
tacking
away
to
Newcastle
,
to
fetch
black
diamonds
to
make
his
fortune
with
;
now
,
Pa
was
going
to
China
in
that
handsome
three
-
masted
ship
,
to
bring
home
opium
,
with
which
he
would
for
ever
cut
out
Chicksey
Veneering
and
Stobbles
,
and
to
bring
home
silks
and
shawls
without
end
for
the
decoration
of
his
charming
daughter
.
<EOS>
Now
,
John
Harmon
's
disastrous
fate
was
all
a
dream
,
and
he
had
come
home
and
found
the
lovely
woman
just
the
article
for
him
,
and
the
lovely
woman
had
found
him
just
the
article
for
her
,
and
they
were
going
away
on
a
trip
,
in
their
gallant
bark
,
to
look
after
their
vines
,
with
streamers
flying
at
all
points
,
a
band
playing
on
deck
,
and
Pa
established
in
the
great
cabin
.
<EOS>
Now
,
John
Harmon
was
consigned
to
his
grave
again
,
and
a
merchant
of
immense
wealth
(
name
unknown
)
had
courted
and
married
the
lovely
woman
,
and
he
was
so
enormously
rich
that
everything
you
saw
upon
the
river
sailing
or
steaming
belonged
to
him
,
and
he
kept
a
perfect
fleet
of
yachts
for
pleasure
,
and
that
little
impudent
yacht
which
you
saw
over
there
,
with
the
great
white
sail
,
was
called
The
Bella
,
in
honor
of
his
wife
,
and
she
held
her
state
aboard
when
it
pleased
her
,
like
a
modern
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
Anon
,
there
would
embark
in
that
troop
-
ship
when
she
got
to
Gravesend
,
a
mighty
general
,
of
large
property
(
name
also
unknown
)
,
who
would
n't
hear
of
going
to
victory
without
his
wife
,
and
whose
wife
was
the
lovely
woman
,
and
she
was
destined
to
become
the
idol
of
all
the
red
coats
and
blue
jackets
alow
and
aloft
.
<EOS>
And
then
again
:
you
saw
that
ship
being
towed
out
by
a
steam
-
tug
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
where
did
you
suppose
she
was
going
to
?
<EOS>
She
was
going
among
the
coral
reefs
and
cocoa
-
nuts
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
,
and
she
was
chartered
for
a
fortunate
individual
of
the
name
of
Pa
(
himself
on
board
,
and
much
respected
by
all
hands
)
,
and
she
was
going
,
for
his
sole
profit
and
advantage
,
to
fetch
a
cargo
of
sweet
-
smelling
woods
,
the
most
beautiful
that
ever
were
seen
,
and
the
most
profitable
that
never
were
heard
of
,
and
<EOS>
her
cargo
would
be
a
great
fortune
,
as
indeed
it
ought
to
be
:
the
lovely
woman
who
had
purchased
her
and
fitted
her
expressly
for
this
voyage
,
being
married
to
an
Indian
Prince
,
who
was
a
Something
-
or
-
Other
,
and
who
wore
Cashmere
shawls
all
over
himself
,
and
diamonds
and
emeralds
blazing
in
his
turban
,
and
was
beautifully
coffee
-
coloured
and
excessively
devoted
,
though
a
little
too
jealous
.
<EOS>
Thus
Bella
ran
on
merrily
,
in
a
manner
perfectly
enchanting
to
Pa
,
who
was
as
willing
to
put
his
head
into
the
Sultan
's
tub
of
water
as
the
beggar
-
boys
below
the
window
were
to
put
their
heads
in
the
mud
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Pa
after
dinner
,
"
we
may
come
to
the
conclusion
at
home
,
that
we
have
lost
you
for
good
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
say
.
<EOS>
All
she
was
able
to
report
was
,
that
she
was
most
handsomely
supplied
with
everything
she
could
possibly
want
,
and
that
whenever
she
hinted
at
leaving
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
they
would
n't
hear
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Pa
,
"
pursued
Bella
,
"
I
'll
make
a
confession
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
most
mercenary
little
wretch
that
ever
lived
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hardly
have
thought
it
of
you
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
her
father
,
first
glancing
at
himself
,
and
then
at
the
dessert
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
what
you
mean
,
Pa
,
but
it
's
not
that
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
that
I
care
for
money
to
keep
as
money
,
but
I
do
care
so
much
for
what
it
will
buy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Really
I
think
most
of
us
do
,
"
returned
R.
W.
  
"
But
not
to
the
dreadful
extent
that
I
do
,
Pa.
O
-
o
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
,
screwing
the
exclamation
out
of
herself
with
a
twist
of
her
dimpled
chin
.
<EOS>
"
I
   
AM
so
mercenary
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
wistful
glance
R.
W.
said
,
in
default
of
having
anything
better
to
say
:
"
About
when
did
you
begin
to
feel
it
coming
on
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
Pa.
<EOS>
That
's
the
terrible
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
at
home
,
and
only
knew
what
it
was
to
be
poor
,
I
grumbled
but
did
n't
so
much
mind
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
at
home
expecting
to
be
rich
,
I
thought
vaguely
of
all
the
great
things
I
would
do
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
had
been
disappointed
of
my
splendid
fortune
,
and
came
to
see
it
from
day
to
day
in
other
hands
,
and
to
have
before
my
eyes
what
it
could
really
do
,
then
I
became
the
mercenary
little
wretch
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
your
fancy
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
it
's
nothing
of
the
sort
,
Pa
!
"
<EOS>
said
Bella
,
nodding
at
him
,
with
her
very
pretty
eyebrows
raised
as
high
as
they
would
go
,
and
looking
comically
frightened
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
fact
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
avariciously
scheming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
<EOS>
But
how
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
Pa.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
,
because
we
have
always
been
favourites
of
each
other
's
,
and
because
you
are
not
like
a
Pa
,
but
more
like
a
sort
of
a
younger
brother
with
a
dear
venerable
chubbiness
on
him
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
"
added
Bella
,
laughing
as
she
pointed
a
rallying
finger
at
his
face
,
"
because
I
have
got
you
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
secret
expedition
.
<EOS>
If
ever
you
tell
of
me
,
I
'll
tell
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
Ma
that
you
dined
at
Greenwich
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
;
seriously
,
my
dear
,
"
observed
R.
W.
,
with
some
trepidation
of
manner
,
"
it
might
be
as
well
not
to
mention
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
laughed
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
n't
like
it
,
sir
!
<EOS>
So
you
keep
my
confidence
,
and
I
'll
keep
yours
.
<EOS>
But
betray
the
lovely
woman
,
and
you
shall
find
her
a
serpent
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
may
give
me
a
kiss
,
Pa
,
and
I
should
like
to
give
your
hair
a
turn
,
because
it
has
been
dreadfully
neglected
in
my
absence
.
"
  
<EOS>
R.
W.
submitted
his
head
to
the
operator
,
and
the
operator
went
on
talking
;
at
the
same
time
putting
separate
locks
of
his
hair
through
a
curious
process
of
being
smartly
rolled
over
her
two
revolving
forefingers
,
which
were
then
suddenly
pulled
out
of
it
in
opposite
lateral
directions
.
<EOS>
On
each
of
these
occasions
the
patient
winced
and
winked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
up
my
mind
that
I
must
have
money
,
Pa.
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
ca
n't
beg
it
,
borrow
it
,
or
steal
it
;
and
so
I
have
resolved
that
I
must
marry
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
R.
W.
cast
up
his
eyes
towards
her
,
as
well
as
he
could
under
the
operating
circumstances
,
and
said
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
,
"
My
de
-
ar
Bella
!
"
  
"
Have
resolved
,
I
say
,
Pa
,
that
to
get
money
<EOS>
I
must
marry
money
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
which
,
I
am
always
looking
out
for
money
to
captivate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
de
-
a
-
r
Bella
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Pa
,
that
is
the
state
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
If
ever
there
was
a
mercenary
plotter
whose
thoughts
and
designs
were
always
in
her
mean
occupation
,
I
am
the
amiable
creature
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
care
.
<EOS>
I
hate
and
detest
being
poor
,
and
I
wo
n't
be
poor
if
I
can
marry
money
.
<EOS>
Now
you
are
deliciously
fluffy
,
Pa
,
and
in
a
state
to
astonish
the
waiter
and
pay
the
bill
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
my
dear
Bella
,
this
is
quite
alarming
at
your
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
so
,
Pa
,
but
you
would
n't
believe
it
,
"
returned
Bella
,
with
a
pleasant
childish
gravity
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
shocking
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
quite
so
,
if
you
fully
knew
what
you
said
,
my
dear
,
or
meant
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Pa
,
I
can
only
tell
you
that
I
mean
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
Talk
to
me
of
love
!
"
<EOS>
said
Bella
,
contemptuously
:
though
her
face
and
figure
certainly
rendered
the
subject
no
incongruous
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Talk
to
me
of
fiery
dragons
!
<EOS>
But
talk
to
me
of
poverty
and
wealth
,
and
there
indeed
we
touch
upon
realities
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
De

ar

this
is
becoming
Awful
---
"
her
father
was
emphatically
beginning
:
when
she
stopped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pa
,
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Did
you
marry
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
did
n't
,
my
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
hummed
the
Dead
March
in
Saul
,
and
said
,
after
all
it
signified
very
little
!
<EOS>
But
seeing
him
look
grave
and
downcast
,
she
took
him
round
the
neck
and
kissed
him
back
to
cheerfulness
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
that
last
touch
,
Pa
;
it
was
only
said
in
joke
.
<EOS>
Now
mind
!
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
tell
of
me
,
and
I
'll
not
tell
of
you
.
<EOS>
And
more
than
that
;
I
promise
to
have
no
secrets
from
you
,
Pa
,
and
you
may
make
certain
that
,
whatever
mercenary
things
go
on
,
I
shall
always
tell
you
all
about
them
in
strict
confidence
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fain
to
be
satisfied
with
this
concession
from
the
lovely
woman
,
R.
W.
rang
the
bell
,
and
paid
the
bill
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
all
the
rest
of
this
,
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
rolling
up
the
purse
when
they
were
alone
again
,
hammering
it
small
with
her
little
fist
on
the
table
,
and
cramming
it
into
one
of
the
pockets
of
his
new
waistcoat
,
"
is
for
you
,
to
buy
presents
with
for
them
at
home
,
and
to
pay
bills
with
,
and
to
divide
as
you
like
,
and
spend
exactly
as
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
Last
of
all
take
notice
,
Pa
,
that
it
's
not
the
fruit
of
any
avaricious
scheme
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
if
it
was
,
your
little
mercenary
wretch
of
a
daughter
would
n't
make
so
free
with
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
After
which
,
she
tugged
at
his
coat
with
both
hands
,
and
pulled
him
all
askew
in
buttoning
that
garment
over
the
precious
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
then
tied
her
dimples
into
her
bonnet
-
strings
in
a
very
knowing
way
,
and
took
him
back
to
London
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
Mr.
Boffin
's
door
,
she
set
him
with
his
back
against
it
,
tenderly
took
him
by
the
ears
as
convenient
handles
for
her
purpose
,
and
kissed
him
until
he
knocked
muffled
double
knocks
at
the
door
with
the
back
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
she
once
more
reminded
him
of
their
compact
and
gaily
parted
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
Not
so
gaily
,
however
,
but
that
tears
filled
her
eyes
as
he
went
away
down
the
dark
street
.
<EOS>
Not
so
gaily
,
but
that
she
several
times
said
,
"
Ah
,
poor
little
Pa
!
<EOS>
Ah
,
poor
dear
struggling
shabby
little
Pa
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
before
she
took
heart
to
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Not
so
gaily
,
but
that
the
brilliant
furniture
seemed
to
stare
her
out
of
countenance
as
if
it
insisted
on
being
compared
with
the
dingy
furniture
at
home
.
<EOS>
Not
so
gaily
,
but
that
she
fell
into
very
low
spirits
sitting
late
in
her
own
room
,
and
very
heartily
wept
,
as
she
wished
,
now
that
the
deceased
old
John
Harmon
had
never
made
a
will
about
her
,
now
that
the
deceased
young
John
Harmon
had
lived
to
marry
her
.
"
<EOS>
Contradictory
things
to
wish
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
but
my
life
and
fortunes
are
so
contradictory
altogether
that
what
can
I
expect
myself
to
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
IN
WHICH
<EOS>
THE
ORPHAN
MAKES
<EOS>
HIS
WILL
.
 
<EOS>
The
Secretary
,
working
in
the
Dismal
Swamp
betimes
next
morning
,
was
informed
that
a
youth
waited
in
the
hall
who
gave
the
name
of
Sloppy
.
<EOS>
The
footman
who
communicated
this
intelligence
made
a
decent
pause
before
uttering
the
name
,
to
express
that
it
was
forced
on
his
reluctance
by
the
youth
in
question
,
and
that
if
the
youth
had
had
the
good
sense
and
good
taste
to
inherit
some
other
name
it
would
have
spared
the
feelings
of
him
the
bearer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Boffin
will
be
very
well
pleased
,
"
said
the
Secretary
in
a
perfectly
composed
way
.
<EOS>
"
Show
him
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sloppy
being
introduced
,
remained
close
to
the
door
:
revealing
in
various
parts
of
his
form
many
surprising
,
confounding
,
and
incomprehensible
buttons
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
"
said
John
Rokesmith
,
in
a
cheerful
tone
of
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
expecting
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sloppy
explained
that
he
had
meant
to
come
before
,
but
that
the
Orphan
(
of
whom
he
made
mention
as
Our
Johnny
)
had
been
ailing
,
and
he
had
waited
to
report
him
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
is
well
now
?
"
said
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
he
ai
n't
,
"
said
Sloppy
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sloppy
having
shaken
his
head
to
a
considerable
extent
,
proceeded
to
remark
that
he
thought
Johnny
"
must
have
took
'em
from
the
Minders
.
<EOS>
"
Being
asked
what
he
meant
,
he
answered
,
them
that
come
out
upon
him
and
partickler
his
chest
.
<EOS>
Being
requested
to
explain
himself
,
he
stated
that
there
was
some
of
'em
wot
<EOS>
you
could
n't
kiver
with
a
sixpence
.
<EOS>
Pressed
to
fall
back
upon
a
nominative
case
,
he
opined
that
they
wos
about
as
red
as
ever
red
could
be
.
"
<EOS>
But
as
long
as
they
strikes
out'ards
,
sir
,
"
continued
Sloppy
,
"
they
ai
n't
so
much
.
<EOS>
It
's
their
striking
in'ards
that
's
to
be
kep
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
Rokesmith
hoped
the
child
had
had
medical
attendance
?
<EOS>
Oh
yes
,
said
Sloppy
,
he
had
been
took
to
the
doctor
's
shop
once
.
<EOS>
And
what
did
the
doctor
call
it
?
<EOS>
Rokesmith
asked
him
.
<EOS>
After
some
perplexed
reflection
,
Sloppy
answered
,
brightening
,
"
He
called
it
something
as
wos
wery
long
for
spots
.
"
<EOS>
Rokesmith
suggested
measles
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
with
confidence
,
"
ever
so
much
longer
than
them
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
(
Mr.
Sloppy
was
elevated
by
this
fact
,
and
seemed
to
consider
that
it
reflected
credit
on
the
poor
little
patient
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Boffin
will
be
sorry
to
hear
this
,
"
said
Rokesmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Higden
said
so
,
sir
,
when
she
kep
it
from
her
,
hoping
as
Our
Johnny
would
work
round
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
hope
he
will
?
"
said
Rokesmith
,
with
a
quick
turn
upon
the
messenger
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
answered
Sloppy
.
<EOS>
"
It
all
depends
on
their
striking
in'ards
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
then
went
on
to
say
that
whether
Johnny
had
"
took
'em
"
from
the
Minders
,
or
whether
the
Minders
had
"
took
'em
"
from
Johnny
,
the
Minders
had
been
sent
home
and
had
"
got
'
em
.
"
<EOS>
Furthermore
,
that
Mrs.
Higden
's
days
and
nights
being
devoted
to
Our
Johnny
,
who
was
never
out
of
her
lap
,
<EOS>
the
whole
of
the
mangling
arrangements
had
devolved
upon
himself
,
and
he
had
had
"
rayther
a
tight
time
.
<EOS>
"
The
ungainly
piece
of
honesty
beamed
and
blushed
as
he
said
it
,
quite
enraptured
with
the
remembrance
of
having
been
serviceable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Last
night
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
"
when
I
was
a
-
turning
at
the
wheel
pretty
late
,
the
mangle
seemed
to
go
like
Our
Johnny
's
breathing
.
<EOS>
It
begun
beautiful
,
then
as
it
went
out
it
shook
a
little
and
got
unsteady
,
then
as
it
took
the
turn
to
come
home
<EOS>
it
had
a
rattle
-
like
and
lumbered
a
bit
,
then
it
come
smooth
,
and
so
it
went
on
till
I
scarce
know'd
<EOS>
which
was
mangle
and
which
was
Our
Johnny
.
<EOS>
Nor
Our
Johnny
,
he
scarce
<EOS>
know'd
<EOS>
either
,
for
sometimes
when
the
mangle
lumbers
he
says
,
`
`
Me
choking
,
Granny
!
"
<EOS>
"
and
Mrs.
Higden
holds
him
up
in
her
lap
and
says
to
me
`
`
Bide
a
bit
,
Sloppy
,
"
"
and
we
all
stops
together
.
<EOS>
And
when
Our
Johnny
gets
his
breathing
again
,
I
turns
again
,
and
we
all
goes
on
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sloppy
had
gradually
expanded
with
his
description
into
a
stare
and
a
vacant
grin
.
<EOS>
He
now
contracted
,
being
silent
,
into
a
half
-
repressed
gush
of
tears
,
and
,
under
pretence
of
being
heated
,
drew
the
under
part
of
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
with
a
singularly
awkward
,
laborious
,
and
roundabout
smear
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
unfortunate
,
"
said
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
and
break
it
to
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Stay
you
here
,
Sloppy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sloppy
stayed
there
,
staring
at
the
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
,
until
the
Secretary
and
Mrs.
Boffin
came
back
together
.
<EOS>
And
with
Mrs.
Boffin
was
a
young
lady
<EOS>
(
Miss
Bella
Wilfer
by
name
)
who
was
better
worth
staring
at
<EOS>
,
it
occurred
to
Sloppy
,
than
the
best
of
wall
-
papering
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
poor
dear
pretty
little
John
Harmon
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
mum
,
"
said
the
sympathetic
Sloppy
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
think
he
is
in
a
very
,
very
bad
way
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
pleasant
creature
with
her
wholesome
cordiality
.
  
<EOS>
Put
upon
his
good
faith
,
and
finding
it
in
collision
with
his
inclinations
,
Sloppy
threw
back
his
head
and
uttered
a
mellifluous
howl
,
rounded
off
with
a
sniff
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
bad
as
that
!
"
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
.
"
<EOS>
And
Betty
Higden
not
to
tell
me
of
it
sooner
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
might
have
been
mistrustful
,
mum
,
"
answered
Sloppy
,
hesitating
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
what
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
?
"
  
"
I
think
she
might
have
been
mistrustful
,
mum
,
"
returned
Sloppy
with
submission
,
"
of
standing
in
Our
Johnny
's
light
.
<EOS>
There
's
so
much
trouble
in
illness
,
and
so
much
expense
,
and
she
's
seen
such
a
lot
of
its
being
objected
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
never
can
have
thought
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
that
I
would
grudge
the
dear
child
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
mum
,
but
she
might
have
thought
(
as
a
habit
-
like
)
of
its
standing
in
Johnny
's
light
,
and
might
have
tried
to
bring
him
through
it
unbeknownst
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sloppy
knew
his
ground
well
.
<EOS>
To
conceal
herself
in
sickness
,
like
a
lower
animal
;
to
creep
out
of
sight
and
coil
herself
away
and
die
;
had
become
this
woman
's
instinct
.
<EOS>
To
catch
up
in
her
arms
the
sick
child
who
was
dear
to
her
,
and
hide
it
as
if
it
were
a
criminal
,
and
keep
off
all
ministration
but
such
as
her
own
ignorant
tenderness
and
patience
could
supply
,
had
become
this
woman
's
idea
of
maternal
love
,
fidelity
,
and
duty
.
<EOS>
The
shameful
accounts
we
read
,
every
week
in
the
Christian
year
,
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honorable
boards
,
the
infamous
records
of
small
official
inhumanity
,
do
not
pass
by
the
people
as
they
pass
by
us
.
<EOS>
And
hence
these
irrational
,
blind
,
and
obstinate
prejudices
,
so
astonishing
to
our
magnificence
,
and
having
no
more
reason
in
them
<EOS>
---
God
save
the
Queen
and
Con
-
found
their
politics
---
<EOS>
no
,
than
smoke
has
in
coming
from
fire
!
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
a
right
place
for
the
poor
child
to
stay
in
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
us
,
dear
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
what
to
do
for
the
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
already
thought
what
to
do
,
and
the
consultation
was
very
short
.
<EOS>
He
could
pave
the
way
,
he
said
,
in
half
an
hour
,
and
then
they
would
go
down
to
Brentford
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
take
me
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
Therefore
a
carriage
was
ordered
,
of
capacity
to
take
them
all
,
and
in
the
meantime
Sloppy
was
regaled
,
feasting
alone
in
the
Secretary
's
room
,
with
a
complete
realization
of
that
fairy
vision
---
meat
,
beer
,
vegetables
,
and
pudding
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
which
his
buttons
became
more
importunate
of
public
notice
than
before
,
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
about
the
region
of
the
waistband
,
which
modestly
withdrew
into
a
creasy
retirement
.
  
<EOS>
Punctual
to
the
time
,
appeared
the
carriage
and
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
He
sat
on
the
box
,
and
Mr.
Sloppy
graced
the
rumble
.
<EOS>
So
,
to
the
Three
Magpies
as
before
:
where
Mrs.
Boffin
and
Miss
Bella
were
handed
out
,
and
whence
they
all
went
on
foot
to
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
's
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
way
down
,
they
had
stopped
at
a
toy
-
shop
,
and
had
bought
that
noble
charger
,
a
description
of
whose
points
and
trappings
<EOS>
had
on
the
last
occasion
conciliated
the
then
worldly
-
minded
orphan
,
and
also
a
Noah
's
ark
,
and
also
a
yellow
bird
with
an
artificial
voice
in
him
,
and
also
a
military
doll
so
well
dressed
that
if
he
had
only
been
of
life
-
size
<EOS>
his
brother
-
officers
in
the
Guards
might
never
have
found
him
out
.
<EOS>
Bearing
these
gifts
,
they
raised
the
latch
of
Betty
Higden
's
door
,
and
saw
her
sitting
in
the
dimmest
and
furthest
corner
with
poor
Johnny
in
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
's
my
boy
,
Betty
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Mrs.
Boffin
,
sitting
down
beside
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
bad
!
<EOS>
He
's
bad
!
"
said
Betty
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
be
afeerd
<EOS>
he
'll
not
be
yours
any
more
than
mine
.
<EOS>
All
others
belonging
to
him
have
gone
to
the
Power
and
the
Glory
,
and
I
have
a
mind
that
they
're
drawing
him
to
them
---
leading
him
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
why
else
he
clenches
his
little
hand
as
if
it
had
hold
of
a
finger
that
I
ca
n't
see
.
<EOS>
Look
at
it
,
"
said
Betty
,
opening
the
wrappers
in
which
the
flushed
child
lay
,
and
showing
his
small
right
hand
lying
closed
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
always
so
.
<EOS>
It
do
n't
mind
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
asleep
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
You
're
not
asleep
,
my
Johnny
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Johnny
,
with
a
quiet
air
of
pity
for
himself
,
and
without
opening
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
the
lady
,
Johnny
.
<EOS>
And
the
horse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Johnny
could
bear
the
lady
,
with
complete
indifference
,
but
not
the
horse
.
<EOS>
Opening
his
heavy
eyes
,
he
slowly
broke
into
a
smile
on
beholding
that
splendid
phenomenon
,
and
wanted
to
take
it
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
much
too
big
,
it
was
put
upon
a
chair
where
he
could
hold
it
by
the
mane
and
contemplate
it
.
<EOS>
Which
he
soon
forgot
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
Johnny
murmuring
something
with
his
eyes
<EOS>
closed
,
and
Mrs.
Boffin
not
knowing
what
,
old
Betty
bent
her
ear
to
listen
and
took
pains
to
understand
.
<EOS>
Being
asked
by
her
to
repeat
what
he
had
said
,
he
did
so
two
or
three
times
,
and
then
it
came
out
that
he
must
have
seen
more
than
they
supposed
when
he
looked
up
to
see
the
horse
,
for
the
murmur
was
,
"
Who
is
the
boofer
lady
?
<EOS>
"
Now
,
the
boofer
,
or
beautiful
,
lady
was
Bella
;
and
whereas
this
notice
from
the
poor
baby
would
have
touched
her
of
itself
,
it
was
rendered
more
pathetic
by
the
late
melting
of
her
heart
to
her
poor
little
father
,
and
their
joke
about
the
lovely
woman
.
<EOS>
So
,
Bella
's
behaviour
was
very
tender
and
very
natural
when
she
kneeled
on
the
brick
floor
to
clasp
the
child
,
and
when
the
child
,
with
a
child
's
admiration
of
what
is
young
and
pretty
,
fondled
the
boofer
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
good
dear
Betty
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
hoping
that
she
saw
her
opportunity
,
and
laying
her
hand
persuasively
on
her
arm
;
"
we
have
come
to
remove
Johnny
from
this
cottage
to
where
he
can
be
taken
better
care
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Instantly
,
and
before
another
word
could
be
spoken
,
the
old
woman
started
up
with
blazing
eyes
,
and
rushed
at
the
door
with
the
sick
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stand
away
from
me
every
one
of
ye
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
out
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
what
ye
mean
now
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
my
way
,
all
of
ye
.
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
kill
the
Pretty
,
and
kill
myself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
stay
!
"
<EOS>
said
Rokesmith
,
soothing
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
understand
too
well
.
<EOS>
I
know
too
much
about
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
've
run
from
it
too
many
a
year
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Never
for
me
,
nor
for
the
child
,
while
there
's
water
enough
in
England
to
cover
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
terror
,
the
shame
,
the
passion
of
horror
and
repugnance
,
firing
the
worn
face
and
perfectly
maddening
it
,
would
have
been
a
quite
terrible
sight
,
if
embodied
in
one
old
fellow
-
creature
alone
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
"
crops
up
"
---
as
our
slang
goes
---
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honorable
boards
,
in
other
fellow
-
creatures
,
rather
frequently
!
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
been
chasing
me
all
my
life
,
but
it
shall
never
take
me
nor
mine
alive
!
"
<EOS>
cried
old
Betty
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
done
with
ye
.
<EOS>
I
'd
have
fastened
door
and
window
and
starved
out
,
afore
<EOS>
I
'd
ever
have
let
ye
in
,
if
I
had
known
what
ye
came
for
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
catching
sight
of
Mrs.
Boffin
's
wholesome
face
,
she
relented
,
and
crouching
down
by
the
door
and
bending
over
her
burden
to
hush
it
,
said
humbly
:
"
Maybe
my
fears
has
put
me
wrong
.
<EOS>
If
they
have
so
,
tell
me
,
and
the
good
Lord
forgive
me
!
<EOS>
I
'm
quick
to
take
this
fright
,
I
know
,
and
my
head
is
summ'at
light
with
wearying
and
watching
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
there
!
"
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
<EOS>
Say
no
more
of
it
,
Betty
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
mistake
,
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
Any
one
of
us
might
have
made
it
in
your
place
,
and
felt
just
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Lord
bless
ye
!
"
said
the
old
woman
,
stretching
out
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
see
,
Betty
,
"
pursued
the
sweet
compassionate
soul
,
holding
the
hand
kindly
,
"
what
I
really
did
mean
,
and
what
I
should
have
begun
by
saying
out
,
if
I
had
only
been
a
little
wiser
and
handier
.
<EOS>
We
want
to
move
Johnny
to
a
place
where
there
are
none
but
children
;
a
place
set
up
on
purpose
for
sick
children
;
where
the
good
doctors
and
nurses
pass
their
lives
with
children
,
talk
to
none
but
children
,
touch
none
but
children
,
comfort
and
cure
none
but
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
really
such
a
place
?
"
asked
the
old
woman
,
with
a
gaze
of
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Betty
,
on
my
word
,
and
you
shall
see
it
.
<EOS>
If
my
home
was
a
better
place
for
the
dear
boy
,
I
'd
take
him
to
it
;
but
indeed
indeed
it
's
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
take
him
,
"
returned
Betty
,
fervently
kissing
the
comforting
hand
,
"
where
you
will
,
my
deary
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
hard
,
but
that
I
believe
your
face
and
voice
,
and
I
will
,
as
long
as
I
can
see
and
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
victory
gained
,
Rokesmith
made
haste
to
profit
by
it
,
for
he
saw
how
wofully
time
had
been
lost
.
<EOS>
He
despatched
Sloppy
to
bring
the
carriage
to
the
door
;
caused
the
child
to
be
carefully
wrapped
up
;
bade
old
Betty
get
her
bonnet
on
;
collected
the
toys
,
enabling
the
little
fellow
to
comprehend
that
his
treasures
were
to
be
transported
with
him
;
and
had
all
things
prepared
so
easily
that
they
were
ready
for
the
carriage
as
soon
as
it
appeared
,
and
in
a
minute
afterwards
were
on
their
way
.
<EOS>
Sloppy
they
left
behind
,
relieving
his
overcharged
breast
with
a
paroxysm
of
mangling
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
Children
's
Hospital
,
the
gallant
steed
,
the
Noah
's
ark
,
the
yellow
bird
,
and
the
officer
in
the
Guards
,
were
made
as
welcome
as
their
child
-
owner
.
<EOS>
But
the
doctor
said
aside
to
Rokesmith
,
"
This
should
have
been
days
ago
.
<EOS>
Too
late
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
However
,
they
were
all
carried
up
into
a
fresh
airy
room
,
and
there
Johnny
came
to
himself
,
out
of
a
sleep
or
a
swoon
or
whatever
it
was
,
to
find
himself
lying
in
a
little
quiet
bed
,
with
a
little
platform
over
his
breast
,
on
which
were
already
arranged
,
to
give
him
heart
and
urge
him
to
cheer
up
,
the
Noah
's
ark
,
the
noble
steed
,
and
the
yellow
bird
;
with
the
officer
in
the
Guards
doing
duty
over
the
whole
,
quite
as
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
country
as
if
he
had
been
upon
Parade
.
<EOS>
And
at
the
bed
's
head
was
a
colored
picture
beautiful
to
see
,
representing
as
it
were
another
Johnny
seated
on
the
knee
of
some
Angel
surely
who
loved
little
children
.
<EOS>
And
,
marvellous
fact
,
to
lie
and
stare
at
:
Johnny
had
become
one
of
a
little
family
,
all
in
little
quiet
beds
(
except
two
playing
dominoes
in
little
arm
-
chairs
at
a
little
table
on
the
hearth
)
:
<EOS>
and
on
all
the
little
beds
were
little
platforms
<EOS>
whereon
were
to
be
seen
dolls
'
houses
,
<EOS>
woolly
dogs
with
mechanical
barks
in
them
not
very
dissimilar
from
the
artificial
voice
pervading
the
bowels
of
the
yellow
bird
,
tin
armies
,
Moorish
tumblers
,
wooden
tea
things
,
and
the
riches
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
As
Johnny
murmured
something
in
his
placid
admiration
,
the
ministering
women
at
his
bed
's
head
asked
him
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
that
he
wanted
to
know
whether
all
these
were
brothers
and
sisters
of
his
?
<EOS>
So
they
told
him
yes
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
then
,
that
he
wanted
to
know
whether
God
had
brought
them
all
together
there
?
<EOS>
So
they
told
him
yes
again
.
<EOS>
They
made
out
then
,
that
he
wanted
to
know
whether
they
would
all
get
out
of
pain
?
<EOS>
So
they
answered
yes
to
that
question
likewise
,
and
made
him
understand
that
the
reply
included
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Johnny
's
powers
of
sustaining
conversation
were
as
yet
so
very
imperfectly
developed
,
even
in
a
state
of
health
,
that
in
sickness
they
were
little
more
than
monosyllabic
.
<EOS>
But
,
he
had
to
be
washed
and
tended
,
and
remedies
were
applied
,
and
though
those
offices
were
far
,
far
more
skilfully
and
lightly
done
than
ever
anything
had
been
done
for
him
in
his
little
life
,
so
rough
and
short
,
they
would
have
hurt
and
tired
him
but
for
an
amazing
circumstance
which
laid
hold
of
his
attention
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
less
than
the
appearance
on
his
own
little
platform
in
pairs
,
of
All
Creation
,
on
its
way
into
his
own
particular
ark
:
the
elephant
leading
,
and
the
fly
,
with
a
diffident
sense
of
his
size
,
politely
bringing
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
A
very
little
brother
lying
in
the
next
bed
with
a
broken
leg
,
was
so
enchanted
by
this
spectacle
that
his
delight
exalted
its
enthralling
interest
;
and
so
came
rest
and
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
are
not
afraid
to
leave
the
dear
child
here
,
Betty
,
"
whispered
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
Most
willingly
,
most
thankfully
,
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
they
kissed
him
,
and
left
him
there
,
and
old
Betty
was
to
come
back
early
in
the
morning
,
and
nobody
but
Rokesmith
knew
for
certain
how
that
the
doctor
had
said
,
"
This
should
have
been
days
ago
.
<EOS>
Too
late
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
Rokesmith
knowing
it
,
and
knowing
that
his
bearing
it
in
mind
would
be
acceptable
thereafter
to
that
good
woman
who
had
been
the
only
light
in
the
childhood
of
desolate
John
Harmon
dead
and
gone
,
resolved
that
late
at
night
he
would
go
back
to
the
bedside
of
John
Harmon
's
namesake
,
and
see
how
it
fared
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
family
whom
God
had
brought
together
were
not
all
asleep
,
but
were
all
quiet
.
<EOS>
From
bed
to
bed
,
a
light
womanly
tread
and
a
pleasant
fresh
face
passed
in
the
silence
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
A
little
head
would
lift
itself
up
into
the
softened
light
here
and
there
,
to
be
kissed
as
the
face
went
by
---
for
these
little
patients
are
very
loving
---
and
would
then
submit
itself
to
be
composed
to
rest
again
.
<EOS>
The
mite
with
the
broken
leg
was
restless
,
and
moaned
;
but
after
a
while
turned
his
face
towards
Johnny
's
bed
,
to
fortify
himself
with
a
view
of
the
ark
,
and
fell
asleep
.
<EOS>
Over
most
of
the
beds
,
the
toys
were
yet
grouped
as
the
children
had
left
them
when
they
last
laid
themselves
down
,
and
,
in
their
innocent
grotesqueness
and
incongruity
,
they
might
have
stood
for
the
children
's
dreams
.
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
came
in
too
,
to
see
how
it
fared
with
Johnny
.
<EOS>
And
he
and
Rokesmith
stood
together
,
looking
down
with
compassion
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Johnny
?
<EOS>
"
Rokesmith
was
the
questioner
,
and
put
an
arm
round
the
poor
baby
as
he
made
a
struggle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Him
!
"
said
the
little
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
Those
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
quick
to
understand
children
,
and
,
taking
the
horse
,
the
ark
,
the
yellow
bird
,
and
the
man
in
the
Guards
,
from
Johnny
's
bed
,
softly
placed
them
on
that
of
his
next
neighbour
,
the
mite
with
the
broken
leg
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
weary
and
yet
a
pleased
smile
,
and
with
an
action
as
if
he
stretched
his
little
figure
out
to
rest
,
the
child
heaved
his
body
on
the
sustaining
arm
,
and
seeking
Rokesmith
's
face
with
his
lips
,
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
A
kiss
for
the
boofer
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
now
bequeathed
all
he
had
to
dispose
of
,
and
arranged
his
affairs
in
this
world
,
Johnny
,
thus
speaking
,
left
it
.
   
<EOS>
A
SUCCESSOR
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
's
brethren
had
found
themselves
exceedingly
uncomfortable
in
their
minds
,
because
they
were
required
to
bury
the
dead
too
hopefully
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
Reverend
Frank
,
inclining
to
the
belief
that
they
were
required
to
do
one
or
two
other
things
(
say
out
of
nine
-
and
-
thirty
)
calculated
to
trouble
their
consciences
rather
more
if
they
would
think
as
much
about
them
,
<EOS>
held
his
peace
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
was
a
forbearing
man
,
who
noticed
many
sad
warps
and
blights
in
the
vineyard
wherein
he
worked
,
and
did
not
profess
that
they
made
him
savagely
wise
.
<EOS>
He
only
learned
that
the
more
he
himself
knew
,
<EOS>
in
his
little
limited
human
way
,
the
better
he
could
distantly
imagine
what
Omniscience
might
know
.
  
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
if
the
Reverend
Frank
had
had
to
read
the
words
that
troubled
some
of
his
brethren
,
and
profitably
touched
innumerable
hearts
,
in
a
worse
case
than
Johnny
's
,
he
would
have
done
so
out
of
the
pity
and
humility
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
Reading
them
over
Johnny
,
he
thought
of
his
own
six
children
,
but
not
of
his
poverty
,
and
read
them
with
dimmed
eyes
.
<EOS>
And
very
seriously
did
he
and
his
bright
little
wife
,
who
had
been
listening
,
look
down
into
the
small
grave
and
walk
home
arm
-
in
-
arm
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
grief
in
the
aristocratic
house
,
and
there
was
joy
in
the
Bower
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
argued
,
if
an
orphan
were
wanted
,
was
he
not
an
orphan
himself
,
and
could
a
better
be
desired
?
<EOS>
And
why
go
beating
about
Brentford
bushes
,
seeking
orphans
forsooth
who
had
established
no
claims
upon
you
and
made
no
sacrifices
for
you
,
when
here
was
an
orphan
ready
to
your
hand
who
had
given
up
in
your
cause
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
Master
George
,
Aunt
Jane
,
and
Uncle
Parker
?
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
chuckled
,
consequently
,
when
he
heard
the
tidings
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
was
afterwards
affirmed
by
a
witness
who
shall
at
present
be
nameless
,
that
in
the
seclusion
of
the
Bower
he
poked
out
his
wooden
leg
,
in
the
stage
-
ballet
manner
,
and
executed
a
taunting
or
triumphant
pirouette
on
the
genuine
leg
remaining
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
John
Rokesmith
's
manner
towards
Mrs.
Boffin
at
this
time
,
was
more
the
manner
of
a
young
man
towards
a
mother
,
than
that
of
a
Secretary
towards
his
employer
's
wife
.
<EOS>
It
had
always
been
marked
by
a
subdued
affectionate
deference
that
seemed
to
have
sprung
up
on
the
very
day
of
his
engagement
;
whatever
was
odd
in
her
dress
or
her
ways
had
seemed
to
have
no
oddity
for
him
;
he
had
sometimes
borne
a
quietly
-
amused
face
in
her
company
,
but
still
it
had
seemed
as
if
the
pleasure
her
genial
temper
and
radiant
nature
yielded
him
,
could
have
been
quite
as
naturally
expressed
in
a
tear
as
in
a
smile
.
<EOS>
The
completeness
of
his
sympathy
with
her
fancy
for
having
a
little
John
Harmon
to
protect
and
rear
,
he
had
shown
in
every
act
and
word
,
and
now
that
the
kind
fancy
was
disappointed
,
he
treated
it
with
a
manly
tenderness
and
respect
for
which
she
could
hardly
thank
him
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
thank
you
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
and
I
thank
you
most
kindly
.
<EOS>
You
love
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
everybody
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
ought
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
;
"
but
we
do
n't
all
of
us
do
what
we
ought
;
do
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
John
Rokesmith
replied
,
"
Some
among
us
supply
the
shortcomings
of
the
rest
.
<EOS>
You
have
loved
children
well
,
Mr.
Boffin
has
told
me
.
"
  
"
Not
a
bit
better
than
he
has
,
but
that
's
his
way
;
he
puts
all
the
good
upon
me
.
<EOS>
You
speak
rather
sadly
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
sounds
to
me
so
.
<EOS>
Were
you
one
of
many
children
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
only
child
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
there
was
another
.
<EOS>
Dead
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
or
mother
alive
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
rest
of
your
relations
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
---
if
I
ever
had
any
living
.
<EOS>
I
never
heard
of
any
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
point
of
the
dialogue
Bella
came
in
with
a
light
step
.
<EOS>
She
paused
at
the
door
a
moment
,
hesitating
whether
to
remain
or
retire
;
 
perplexed
by
finding
that
she
was
not
observed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
mind
an
old
lady
's
talk
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
but
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Are
you
quite
sure
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
that
you
have
never
had
a
disappointment
in
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
sure
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
ask
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
for
this
reason
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
you
have
a
kind
of
kept
-
down
manner
with
you
,
which
is
not
like
your
age
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
be
thirty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
yet
thirty
.
"
  
<EOS>
Deeming
it
high
time
to
make
her
presence
known
,
Bella
coughed
here
to
attract
attention
,
begged
pardon
,
and
said
she
would
go
,
fearing
that
she
interrupted
some
matter
of
business
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
do
n't
go
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
because
we
are
coming
to
business
,
instead
of
having
begun
it
,
and
you
belong
to
it
as
much
now
,
my
dear
Bella
,
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
But
I
want
my
Noddy
to
consult
with
us
.
<EOS>
Would
somebody
be
so
good
as
find
my
Noddy
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Rokesmith
departed
on
that
errand
,
and
presently
returned
accompanied
by
Mr.
Boffin
at
his
jog
-
trot
.
<EOS>
Bella
felt
a
little
vague
trepidation
as
to
the
subject
-
matter
of
this
same
consultation
,
until
Mrs.
Boffin
announced
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
come
and
sit
by
me
,
my
dear
,
"
said
that
worthy
soul
,
taking
her
comfortable
place
on
a
large
ottoman
in
the
centre
of
the
room
,
and
drawing
her
arm
through
Bella
's
;
"
and
Noddy
,
you
sit
here
,
and
Mr.
Rokesmith
you
sit
there
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
see
,
what
I
want
to
talk
about
,
is
this
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Milvey
have
sent
me
the
kindest
note
possible
(
which
Mr.
Rokesmith
just
now
read
to
me
out
loud
,
for
I
ai
n't
good
at
handwritings
)
,
offering
to
find
me
another
little
child
to
name
and
educate
and
bring
up
.
<EOS>
Well
.
<EOS>
This
has
set
me
thinking
.
<EOS>
"
  
(
"
And
she
is
a
steam
-
ingein
at
it
,
"
murmured
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
an
admiring
parenthesis
,
"
when
she
once
begins
.
<EOS>
It
may
n't
be
so
easy
to
start
her
;
but
once
started
,
she
's
a
ingein
.
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
---
This
has
set
me
thinking
,
I
say
,
"
repeated
Mrs.
Boffin
,
cordially
beaming
under
the
influence
of
her
husband
's
compliment
,
"
and
I
have
thought
two
things
.
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
that
I
have
grown
timid
of
reviving
John
Harmon
's
name
.
<EOS>
It
's
an
unfortunate
name
,
and
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
should
reproach
myself
if
I
gave
it
to
another
dear
child
,
and
it
proved
again
unlucky
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Now
,
whether
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
gravely
propounding
a
case
for
his
Secretary
's
opinion
;
"
whether
one
might
call
that
a
superstition
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
matter
of
feeling
with
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
said
Rokesmith
,
gently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
name
has
always
been
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
It
has
now
this
new
unfortunate
association
connected
with
it
.
<EOS>
The
name
has
died
out
.
<EOS>
Why
revive
it
?
<EOS>
Might
I
ask
Miss
Wilfer
what
she
thinks
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
not
been
a
fortunate
name
for
me
,
"
said
Bella
,
colouring
---
  
"
or
at
least
it
was
not
,
until
it
led
to
my
being
here
---
<EOS>
but
that
is
not
the
point
in
my
thoughts
.
<EOS>
As
we
had
given
the
name
to
the
poor
child
and
as
the
poor
child
took
so
lovingly
to
me
,
I
think
I
should
feel
jealous
of
calling
another
child
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
feel
as
if
the
name
had
become
endeared
to
me
,
and
I
had
no
right
to
use
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
's
your
opinion
?
<EOS>
"
remarked
Mr.
Boffin
,
observant
of
the
Secretary
's
face
and
again
addressing
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
again
,
it
is
a
matter
of
feeling
,
"
returned
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Miss
Wilfer
's
feeling
very
womanly
and
pretty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
give
us
your
opinion
,
Noddy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
opinion
,
old
lady
,
"
returned
the
Golden
Dustman
,
"
is
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
we
agree
not
to
revive
John
Harmon
's
name
,
but
to
let
it
rest
in
the
grave
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
as
Mr.
Rokesmith
says
,
a
matter
of
feeling
,
but
Lor
how
many
matters
are
matters
of
feeling
!
<EOS>
Well
;
and
so
I
come
to
the
second
thing
I
have
thought
of
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
Bella
,
my
dear
,
and
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
that
when
I
first
named
to
my
husband
my
thoughts
of
adopting
a
little
orphan
boy
in
remembrance
of
John
Harmon
,
I
further
named
to
my
husband
that
it
was
comforting
to
think
that
how
the
poor
boy
would
be
benefited
by
John
's
own
money
,
and
protected
from
John
's
own
forlornness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
,
hear
!
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
So
she
did
.
<EOS>
Ancoar
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
Ancoar
,
Noddy
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
because
I
am
going
to
say
something
else
.
<EOS>
I
meant
that
,
I
am
sure
,
as
much
as
I
still
mean
it
.
<EOS>
But
this
little
death
has
made
me
ask
myself
the
question
,
seriously
,
whether
I
was
n't
too
bent
upon
pleasing
myself
.
<EOS>
Else
why
did
I
seek
out
so
much
for
a
pretty
child
,
and
a
child
quite
to
my
liking
?
<EOS>
Wanting
to
do
good
,
why
not
do
it
for
its
own
sake
,
and
put
my
tastes
and
likings
by
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
Bella
;
and
perhaps
she
said
it
with
some
little
sensitiveness
arising
out
of
those
old
curious
relations
of
hers
towards
the
murdered
man
;
"
perhaps
,
in
reviving
the
name
,
you
would
not
have
liked
to
give
it
to
a
less
interesting
child
than
the
original
.
<EOS>
He
interested
you
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
,
giving
her
a
squeeze
,
"
<EOS>
it
's
kind
of
you
to
find
that
reason
out
,
and
I
hope
it
may
have
been
so
,
and
indeed
to
a
certain
extent
<EOS>
I
believe
it
was
so
,
but
I
am
afraid
not
to
the
whole
extent
.
<EOS>
However
,
that
do
n't
come
in
question
now
,
because
we
have
done
with
the
name

<EOS>
"
Laid
it
up
as

remembrance

suggested
Bella
,
musingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Much
better
said
,
my
dear
;
laid
it
up
as
a
remembrance
.
<EOS>
Well
then
;
I
have
been
thinking
<EOS>
if
I
take
any
orphan
to
provide
for
,
let
it
not
be
a
pet
and
a
plaything
for
me
,
but
a
creature
to
be
helped
for
its
own
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
pretty
then
?
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
,
stoutly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
prepossessing
then
?
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
necessarily
so
.
<EOS>
That
's
as
it
may
happen
.
<EOS>
A
well
-
disposed
boy
comes
in
my
way
who
may
be
even
a
little
wanting
in
such
advantages
for
getting
on
in
life
,
but
is
honest
and
industrious
and
requires
a
helping
hand
and
deserves
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
very
much
in
earnest
and
quite
determined
to
be
unselfish
,
let
me
take
care
of
him
.

<EOS>
Here
the
footman
whose
feelings
had
been
hurt
on
the
former
occasion
,
appeared
,
and
crossing
to
Rokesmith
apologetically
announced
the
objectionable
Sloppy
.
  
<EOS>
The
four
members
of
Council
looked
at
one
another
,
and
paused
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
he
be
brought
here
,
ma'am
?
"
asked
Rokesmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
footman
disappeared
,
reappeared
presenting
Sloppy
,
and
retired
much
disgusted
.
  
<EOS>
The
consideration
of
Mrs.
Boffin
had
clothed
Mr.
Sloppy
in
a
suit
of
black
,
on
which
the
tailor
had
received
personal
directions
from
Rokesmith
to
expend
the
utmost
cunning
of
his
art
,
with
a
view
to
the
concealment
of
the
cohering
and
sustaining
buttons
.
<EOS>
But
,
so
much
more
powerful
were
the
frailties
of
Sloppy
's
form
than
the
strongest
resources
of
tailoring
science
,
that
he
now
stood
before
the
Council
,
a
perfect
Argus
in
the
way
of
buttons
:
shining
and
winking
and
gleaming
and
twinkling
out
of
a
hundred
of
those
eyes
of
bright
metal
,
at
the
dazzled
spectators
.
<EOS>
The
artistic
taste
of
some
unknown
hatter
had
furnished
him
with
a
hatband
of
wholesale
capacity
which
was
fluted
behind
,
from
the
crown
of
his
hat
to
the
brim
,
and
terminated
in
a
black
bunch
,
from
which
the
imagination
shrunk
discomfited
and
the
reason
revolted
.
<EOS>
Some
special
powers
with
which
his
legs
were
endowed
,
had
already
hitched
up
his
glossy
trousers
at
the
ankles
,
and
bagged
them
at
the
knees
;
while
similar
gifts
in
his
arms
had
raised
his
coat
-
sleeves
from
his
wrists
and
accumulated
them
at
his
elbows
.
<EOS>
Thus
set
forth
,
with
the
additional
embellishments
of
a
very
little
tail
to
his
coat
,
and
a
yawning
gulf
at
his
waistband
,
Sloppy
stood
confessed
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
is
Betty
,
my
good
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
asked
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
mum
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
"
she
do
pretty
nicely
,
and
sending
her
dooty
and
many
thanks
for
the
tea
and
all
faviours
and
wishing
to
know
the
family
's
healths
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
just
come
,
Sloppy
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
mum
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
not
had
your
dinner
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
mum
.
<EOS>
But
I
mean
to
it
.
<EOS>
For
I
ai
n't
forgotten
your
handsome
orders
that
I
was
never
to
go
away
without
having
had
a
good
'
un
off
of
meat
and
beer
and
pudding
---
<EOS>
no
:
there
was
four
of
'em
,
for
I
reckoned
'em
up
when
I
had
'em
;
meat
one
,
beer
two
,
vegetables
three
,
and
which
was
four
?
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Why
,
pudding
,
he
was
four
!
"
<EOS>
Here
Sloppy
threw
his
head
back
,
opened
his
mouth
wide
,
and
laughed
rapturously
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
the
two
poor
little
Minders
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Striking
right
out
,
mum
,
and
coming
round
beautiful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
looked
on
the
other
three
members
of
Council
,
and
then
said
,
beckoning
with
her
finger
:
  
"
Sloppy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
mum
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
forward
,
Sloppy
.
<EOS>
Should
you
like
to
dine
here
every
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Off
of
all
four
on
'em
,
mum
?
<EOS>
O
mum
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sloppy
's
feelings
obliged
him
to
squeeze
his
hat
,
and
contract
one
leg
at
the
knee
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
And
should
you
like
to
be
always
taken
care
of
here
,
if
you
were
industrious
and
deserving
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
mum
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
But
there
's
Mrs.
Higden
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
checking
himself
in
his
raptures
,
drawing
back
,
and
shaking
his
head
with
very
serious
meaning
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
Mrs.
Higden
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Higden
goes
before
all
.
<EOS>
None
can
ever
be
better
friends
to
me
than
Mrs.
Higden
's
been
.
<EOS>
And
she
must
be
turned
for
,
must
Mrs.
Higden
.
<EOS>
Where
would
Mrs.
Higden
be
if
she
warn't
turned
for
!
"
<EOS>
At
the
mere
thought
of
Mrs.
Higden
in
this
inconceivable
affliction
,
Mr.
Sloppy
's
countenance
became
pale
,
and
manifested
the
most
distressful
emotions
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
right
as
right
can
be
,
Sloppy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
"
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
tell
you
otherwise
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
seen
to
.
<EOS>
If
Betty
Higden
can
be
turned
for
all
the
same
,
you
shall
come
here
and
be
taken
care
of
for
life
,
and
be
made
able
to
keep
her
in
other
ways
than
the
turning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Even
as
to
that
,
mum
,
"
answered
the
ecstatic
Sloppy
,
"
the
turning
might
be
done
in
the
night
,
do
n't
you
see
?
<EOS>
I
could
be
here
in
the
day
,
and
turn
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
no
sleep
,
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
Or
even
if
I
any
ways
should
want
a
wink
or
two
,
"
added
Sloppy
,
after
a
moment
's
apologetic
reflection
,
"
I
could
take
'em
turning
.
<EOS>
I
've
took
'em
turning
many
a
time
,
and
enjoyed
'em
wonderful
!
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
grateful
impulse
of
the
moment
,
Mr.
Sloppy
kissed
Mrs.
Boffin
's
hand
,
and
then
detaching
himself
from
that
good
creature
that
he
might
have
room
enough
for
his
feelings
,
threw
back
his
head
,
opened
his
mouth
wide
,
and
uttered
a
dismal
howl
.
<EOS>
It
was
creditable
to
his
tenderness
of
heart
,
but
suggested
that
he
might
on
occasion
give
some
offence
to
the
neighbours
:
the
rather
,
as
the
footman
looked
in
,
and
begged
pardon
,
finding
he
was
not
wanted
,
but
excused
himself
,
on
the
ground
"
that
he
thought
it
was
Cats

<EOS>
SOME
AFFAIRS
OF
THE
HEART
.
 
<EOS>
Little
Miss
Peecher
,
from
her
little
official
dwelling
-
house
,
with
its
little
windows
like
the
eyes
in
needles
,
and
its
little
doors
like
the
covers
of
school
-
books
,
was
very
observant
indeed
of
the
object
of
her
quiet
affections
.
<EOS>
Love
,
though
said
to
be
afflicted
with
blindness
,
is
a
vigilant
watchman
,
and
Miss
Peecher
kept
him
on
double
duty
over
Mr.
Bradley
Headstone
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
that
she
was
naturally
given
to
playing
the
spy
---
it
was
not
that
she
was
at
all
secret
,
plotting
,
or
mean
---
<EOS>
it
was
simply
that
she
loved
the
irresponsive
Bradley
with
all
the
primitive
and
homely
stock
of
love
that
had
never
been
examined
or
certificated
out
of
her
.
<EOS>
If
her
faithful
slate
had
had
the
latent
qualities
of
sympathetic
paper
,
and
its
pencil
those
of
invisible
ink
,
many
a
little
treatise
calculated
to
astonish
the
pupils
would
have
come
bursting
through
the
dry
sums
in
school
-
time
under
the
warming
influence
of
Miss
Peecher
's
bosom
.
<EOS>
For
,
oftentimes
when
school
was
not
,
and
her
calm
leisure
and
calm
little
house
were
her
own
,
Miss
Peecher
would
commit
to
the
confidential
slate
an
imaginary
description
of
how
,
upon
a
balmy
evening
at
dusk
,
two
figures
might
have
been
observed
in
the
market
-
garden
ground
round
the
corner
,
of
whom
one
,
being
a
manly
form
,
bent
over
the
other
,
being
a
womanly
form
of
short
stature
and
some
compactness
,
and
breathed
in
a
low
voice
<EOS>
the
words
,
"
Emma
Peecher
,
wilt
thou
be
my
own
?
"
<EOS>
after
which
the
womanly
form
's
head
reposed
upon
the
manly
form
's
shoulder
,
and
the
nightingales
tuned
up
.
<EOS>
Though
all
unseen
,
and
unsuspected
by
the
pupils
,
Bradley
Headstone
even
pervaded
the
school
exercises
.
<EOS>
Was
Geography
in
question
?
<EOS>
He
would
come
triumphantly
flying
out
of
Vesuvius
and
Aetna
ahead
of
the
lava
,
and
would
boil
unharmed
in
the
hot
springs
of
Iceland
,
and
would
float
majestically
down
the
Ganges
and
the
Nile
.
<EOS>
Did
History
chronicle
a
king
of
men
?
<EOS>
Behold
him
in
pepper
-
and
-
salt
pantaloons
,
with
his
watch
-
guard
round
his
neck
.
<EOS>
Were
copies
to
be
written
?
<EOS>
In
capital
B
's
and
H
's
most
of
the
girls
under
Miss
Peecher
's
tuition
were
half
a
year
ahead
of
every
other
letter
in
the
alphabet
.
<EOS>
And
Mental
Arithmetic
,
administered
by
Miss
Peecher
,
often
devoted
itself
to
providing
Bradley
Headstone
with
a
wardrobe
of
fabulous
extent
:
fourscore
and
four
neck
-
ties
at
two
and
ninepence
-
halfpenny
,
two
gross
of
silver
watches
at
four
pounds
fifteen
and
sixpence
,
seventy
-
four
black
hats
at
eighteen
shillings
;
and
many
similar
superfluities
.
  
<EOS>
The
vigilant
watchman
,
using
his
daily
opportunities
of
turning
his
eyes
in
Bradley
's
direction
,
soon
apprized
Miss
Peecher
that
Bradley
was
more
preoccupied
than
had
been
his
wo
nt
,
and
more
given
to
strolling
about
with
a
downcast
and
reserved
face
,
turning
something
difficult
in
his
mind
that
was
not
in
the
scholastic
syllabus
.
<EOS>
Putting
this
and
that
together
---
combining
under
the
head
"
this
,
"
present
appearances
and
the
intimacy
with
Charley
Hexam
,
and
ranging
under
the
head
"
that
"
the
visit
to
his
sister
,
the
watchman
reported
to
Miss
Peecher
his
strong
suspicions
that
the
sister
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
said
Miss
Peecher
,
as
she
sat
making
up
her
weekly
report
on
a
half
-
holiday
afternoon
,
"
what
they
call
Hexam
's
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
Anne
,
at
her
needlework
,
attendant
and
attentive
,
held
her
arm
up

<EOS>

"
She

returned
Miss
Peecher
,
in
a
tunefully
instructive
voice
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
Lizzie
a
Christian
name
,
Mary
Anne
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
Anne
laid
down
her
work
,
rose
,
hooked
herself
behind
,
as
being
under
catechization
,
and
replied
:
"
No
,
it
is
a
corruption
,
Miss
Peecher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
gave
her
that
name
?
"
<EOS>
Miss
Peecher
was
going
on
,
from
the
mere
force
of
habit
,
when
she
checked
herself
,
on
Mary
Anne
's
evincing
theological
impatience
to
strike
in
with
her
godfathers
and
her
godmothers
,
and
said
:
"
I
mean
of
what
name
is
it
a
corruption
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Elizabeth
,
or
Eliza

<EOS>
"
Right
,
Mary
Anne

<EOS>
Whether
there
were
any
Lizzies
in

early
Christian
Church
must
be
considered
very
doubtful

very
doubtful

"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Peecher
was
exceedingly
sage
here
.
<EOS>
"
Speaking
correctly
,
we
say
,
then
,
that
Hexam
's
sister
is
called
Lizzie
;
not
that
she
is
named
so

Do

<EOS>
"
We

And
where

pursued
Miss
Peecher
,
complacent
in
her
little
transparent
fiction
of
conducting
the
examination
in
a
semi
-
official
manner
for
Mary
Anne
's
benefit
,
not
her
own
,
"
where
does
this
young
woman

who

called

not

live

Think

now

before
answering

it
was
written

<EOS>
Exactly
so

<EOS>
And
what

does
this
young
woman
pursue

Mary

<EOS>
Take
time

<EOS>
"
Oh

said
Miss

pondering

in

exclaimed
Miss
Peecher
,
with
a
flushed
glance
at
the
looking
-
glass
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
answered
very
well
,
Mary
Anne
.
<EOS>
You
are
forming
an
excellent
habit
of
arranging
your
thoughts
clearly
.
<EOS>
That
will
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
discreet
Mary
Anne
resumed
her
seat
and
her
silence
,
and
stitched
,
and
stitched
,
and
was
stitching
when
the
schoolmaster
's
shadow
came
in
before
him
,
announcing
that
he
might
be
instantly
expected
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
evening
,
Miss
Peecher
,
"
he
said
,
pursuing
the
shadow
,
and
taking
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
evening

Mr.
Headstone

Anne

<EOS>
"
Thank
you

"
said
Bradley
,
seating
himself
in
his
constrained
manner
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
but
a
flying
visit
.
<EOS>
I
have
looked
in
,
on
my
way
,
to
ask
a
kindness
of
you
as
a
neighbour

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
on
your
way
,
Mr.
Headstone

"
asked
Miss
Peecher
.
  
<EOS>
"
On

I
am
going

<EOS>
"
Church
Street
,
Smith
Square
,
by
Mill
Bank

"
repeated
Miss
Peecher
,
in
her
own
thoughts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
Hexam
has
gone
to
get
a
book
or
two
he
wants
,
and
will
probably
be
back
before
me
.
<EOS>
As
we
leave
my
house
empty
,
I
took
the
liberty
of
telling
him
I
would
leave
the
key
here
.
<EOS>
Would
you
kindly
allow
me
to
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
Going
for
an
evening
walk
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Partly
for
a
walk
,
and
partly
for
---
on
business
.

"
Business
in
Church
Street
,
Smith
Square
,
by
Mill
Bank

"
repeated
Miss
Peecher
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Having
said
which
,
"
pursued
Bradley
,
laying
his
door
-
key
on
the
table
,
"
I
must
be
already
going
.
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
I
can
do
for
you
,
Miss
Peecher
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
In
which
direction
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
In
the
direction
of
Westminster
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mill
Bank
,
"
Miss
Peecher
repeated
in
her
own
thoughts
once
again
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
thank
you
,
Mr.
Headstone
;
I
'll
not
trouble
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
could
n't
trouble
me
,
"
said
the
schoolmaster
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
returned
Miss
Peecher
,
though
not
aloud
;
"
but
you
can
trouble
me
!
"
<EOS>
And
for
all
her
quiet
manner
,
and
her
quiet
smile
,
she
was
full
of
trouble
as
he
went
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
right
touching
his
destination
.
<EOS>
He
held
as
straight
a
course
for
the
house
of
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
as
the
wisdom
of
his
ancestors
,
exemplified
in
the
construction
of
the
intervening
streets
,
would
let
him
,
and
walked
with
a
bent
head
hammering
at
one
fixed
idea
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
an
immoveable
idea
since
he
first
set
eyes
upon
her
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
as
if
all
that
he
could
suppress
in
himself
he
her
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
as
if
all
that
he
could
suppress
in
himself
he
had
suppressed
,
as
if
all
that
he
could
restrain
in
himself
he
had
restrained
,
and
the
time
had
come
---
in
a
rush
,
in
a
moment
---
when
the
power
of
self
-
command
had
departed
from
him
.
<EOS>
Love
at
first
sight
is
a
trite
expression
quite
sufficiently
discussed
;
enough
that
in
certain
smouldering
natures
like
this
man
's
,
that
passion
leaps
into
a
blaze
,
and
makes
such
head
as
fire
does
in
a
rage
of
wind
,
when
other
passions
,
but
for
its
mastery
,
could
be
held
in
chains
.
<EOS>
As
a
multitude
of
weak
,
imitative
natures
are
always
lying
by
,
ready
to
go
mad
upon
the
next
wrong
idea
that
may
be
broached
---
in
these
times
,
generally
some
form
of
tribute
to
Somebody
for
something
that
never
was
done
,
or
,
if
ever
done
,
that
was
done
by
Somebody
Else
<EOS>
---
so
these
less
ordinary
natures
may
lie
by
for
years
,
ready
on
the
touch
of
an
instant
to
burst
into
flame
.
  
<EOS>
The
schoolmaster
went
his
way
,
brooding
and
brooding
,
and
a
sense
of
being
vanquished
in
a
struggle
might
have
been
pieced
out
of
his
worried
face
.
<EOS>
Truly
,
in
his
breast
there
lingered
a
resentful
shame
to
find
himself
defeated
by
this
passion
for
Charley
Hexam
's
sister
,
though
in
the
very
self
-
same
moments
he
was
concentrating
himself
upon
the
object
of
bringing
the
passion
to
a
successful
issue
.
  
<EOS>
He
appeared
before
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
sitting
alone
at
her
work
.
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
"
thought
that
sharp
young
personage
,
"
it
's
you
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
I
know
your
tricks
and
your
manners
,
my
friend
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hexam
's
sister
,
"
said
Bradley
Headstone
,
"
is
not
come
home
yet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
a
conjuror
,
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
wait
,
if
you
please
,
for
I
want
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
?
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
's
mutual
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
glanced
distrustfully
at
the
shrewd
face
again
bending
over
the
work
,
and
said
,
trying
to
conquer
doubt
and
hesitation
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
n't
imply
that
my
visit
will
be
unacceptable
to
Hexam
's
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
call
her
that
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bear
you
to
call
her
that
,
"
 
returned
Miss
Wren
,
snapping
her
fingers
in
a
volley
of
impatient
snaps
,
"
for
I
do
n't
like
Hexam
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
wrinkled
her
nose
,
to
express
dislike
.
"
<EOS>
Selfish
.
<EOS>
Thinks
only
of
himself
.
<EOS>
The
way
with
all
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
way
with
all
of
us
?
<EOS>
Then
you
do
n't
like
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
-
so
,
"
replied
Miss
Wren
,
with
a
shrug
and
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
know
much
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
was
not
aware
It
was
the
way
with
all
of
us
,
"
said
Bradly
,
returning
to
the
accusation
,
a
little
injured
.
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
say
,
some
of
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Meaning
,
"
returned
the
little
creature
,
"
every
one
of
you
,
but
you
.
<EOS>
Hah
!
<EOS>
Now
look
this
lady
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
This
is
Mrs.
Truth
.
<EOS>
The
Honorable
.
<EOS>
Full
-
dressed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
glanced
at
the
doll
she
held
up
for
his
observation
---
which
had
been
lying
on
its
face
on
her
bench
,
while
with
a
needle
and
thread
she
fastened
the
dress
on
at
the
back
---
and
looked
from
it
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
stand
the
Honorable
Mrs.
T.
on
my
bench
in
this
corner
against
the
wall
,
where
her
blue
eyes
can
shine
upon
you
,
"
pursued
Miss
Wren
,
doing
so
,
and
making
two
little
dabs
at
him
in
the
air
with
her
needle
,
as
if
she
pricked
him
with
it
in
his
own
eyes
;
"
and
I
defy
you
to
tell
me
,
with
Mrs.
T.
for
a
witness
,
what
you
have
come
here
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
see
Hexam
's
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Miss
Wren
,
hitching
her
chin
.
<EOS>
"
But
on
whose
account
?
"
  
"
Her
own
.
"
  
"
O
Mrs.
T.
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
You
hear
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
reason
with
her
,
"
pursued
Bradley
,
half
humouring
what
was
present
,
and
half
angry
with
what
was
not
present
;
"
for
her
own
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
Mrs.
T.
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
dressmaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
her
own
sake
,
"
repeated
Bradley
,
warming
,
"
and
for
her
brother
's
,
and
as
a
perfectly
disinterested
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Really
,
Mrs.
T.
,
"
remarked
the
dressmaker
,
"
since
it
comes
to
this
,
we
must
positively
turn
you
with
your
face
to
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
hardly
done
so
,
when
Lizzie
Hexam
arrived
,
and
showed
some
surprise
on
seeing
Bradley
Headstone
there
,
and
Jenny
shaking
her
little
first
at
him
close
before
her
eyes
,
and
the
Honorable
Mrs.
T.
with
her
face
to
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
perfectly
disinterested
person
,
Lizzie
dear
,
"
said
the
knowing
Miss
Wren
,
"
come
to
talk
with
you
,
for
your
own
sake
and
your
brother
's
.
<EOS>
Think
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
there
ought
to
be
no
third
party
present
at
anything
<EOS>
so
very
kind
<EOS>
and
so
very
serious
;
 
<EOS>
and
so
,
if
you
'll
remove
the
third
party
upstairs
,
my
dear
,
the
third
party
will
retire
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
took
the
hand
which
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
held
out
to
her
for
the
purpose
of
being
supported
away
,
but
only
looked
at
her
with
an
inquiring
smile
,
and
made
no
other
movement
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
third
party
hobbles
awfully
,
you
know
,
when
she
's
left
to
herself
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
"
her
back
being
so
bad
,
and
her
legs
so
queer
;
so
she
ca
n't
retire
gracefully
unless
you
help
her
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
can
do
no
better
than
stay
where
she
is
,
"
returned
Lizzie
,
releasing
the
hand
,
and
laying
her
own
lightly
on
Miss
Jenny
's
curls
.
<EOS>
And
then
to
Bradley
:
"
From
Charley
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
an
irresolute
way
,
and
stealing
a
clumsy
look
at
her
,
Bradley
rose
to
place
a
chair
for
her
,
and
then
returned
to
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
Strictly
speaking
,
"
said
he
,
"
I
come
from
Charley
,
because
I
left
him
only
a
little
while
ago
;
but
I
am
not
commissioned
by
Charley
.
<EOS>
I
come
of
my
own
spontaneous
act
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
her
elbows
on
her
bench
,
<EOS>
and
her
chin
upon
her
hands
<EOS>
,
Miss
Jenny
Wren
sat
looking
at
him
with
a
watchful
sidelong
look
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
in
her
different
way
,
sat
looking
at
him
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
"
began
Bradley
,
with
a
mouth
so
dry
that
he
had
some
difficulty
in
articulating
his
words
:
the
consciousness
of
which
rendered
his
manner
still
more
ungainly
and
undecided
;
"
the
truth
is
,
that
Charley
,
having
no
secrets
from
me
(
to
the
best
of
my
belief
)
,
has
confided
the
whole
of
this
matter
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
came
to
a
stop
,
and
Lizzie
asked
:
"
What
matter
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
"
returned
the
schoolmaster
,
stealing
another
look
at
her
,
and
seeming
to
try
in
vain
to
sustain
it
;
for
the
look
dropped
as
it
lighted
on
her
eyes
,
"
that
it
might
be
so
superfluous
as
to
be
almost
impertinent
,
to
enter
upon
a
definition
of
it
.
<EOS>
My
allusion
was
to
this
matter
of
your
having
put
aside
your
brother
's
plans
for
you
,
and
given
the
preference
to
those
of
Mr.
---
I
believe
the
name
is
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
made
this
point
of
not
being
certain
of
the
name
,
with
another
uneasy
look
at
her
,
which
dropped
like
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
being
said
on
the
other
side
,
he
had
to
begin
again
,
and
began
with
new
embarrassment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
brother
's
plans
were
communicated
to
me
when
he
first
had
them
in
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
he
spoke
to
me
about
them
when
I
was
last
here
---
when
we
were
walking
back
together
,
and
when
I
---
when
the
impression
was
fresh
upon
me
of
having
seen
his
sister
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
might
have
been
no
meaning
in
it
,
but
the
little
dressmaker
here
removed
one
of
her
supporting
hands
from
her
chin
,
and
musingly
turned
the
Honorable
Mrs.
T.
with
her
face
to
the
company
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
she
fell
into
her
former
attitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
approved
of
his
idea
,
"
said
Bradley
,
with
his
uneasy
look
wandering
to
the
doll
,
and
unconsciously
resting
there
longer
than
it
had
rested
on
Lizzie
,
"
both
because
your
brother
ought
naturally
to
be
the
originator
of
any
such
scheme
,
and
because
I
hoped
to
be
able
to
promote
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
had
inexpressible
pleasure
,
I
should
have
taken
inexpressible
interest
,
in
promoting
it
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
must
acknowledge
that
when
your
brother
was
disappointed
,
I
too
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
avoid
reservation
or
concealment
,
and
I
fully
acknowledge
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
appeared
to
have
encouraged
himself
by
having
got
so
far
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
he
went
on
with
much
greater
firmness
and
force
of
emphasis
:
though
with
a
curious
disposition
to
set
his
teeth
,
and
with
a
curious
tight
-
screwing
movement
of
his
right
hand
in
the
clenching
palm
of
his
left
,
like
the
action
of
one
who
was
being
physically
hurt
,
and
was
unwilling
to
cry
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
man
of
strong
feelings
,
and
I
have
strongly
felt
this
disappointment
.
<EOS>
I
do
strongly
feel
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
show
what
I
feel
;
 
some
of
us
are
obliged
habitually
to
keep
it
down
.
<EOS>
To
keep
it
down
.
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
your
brother
.
<EOS>
He
has
taken
the
matter
so
much
to
heart
that
he
has
remonstrated
(
in
my
presence
he
remonstrated
)
with
Mr.
Engene
Wrayburn
,
if
that
be
the
name
.
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
quite
ineffectually
.
<EOS>
As
any
one
not
blinded
to
the
real
character
of
Mr.
 
---
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
---
would
readily
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Lizzie
again
,
and
held
the
look
.
<EOS>
And
his
face
turned
from
burning
red
to
white
,
and
from
white
back
to
burning
red
,
and
so
for
the
time
to
lasting
deadly
white
.
  
<EOS>
"
Finally
,
I
resolved
to
come
here
alone
,
and
appeal
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
come
here
alone
,
and
entreat
you
to
retract
the
course
you
have
chosen
,
and
instead
of
confiding
in
a
mere
stranger
---
a
person
of
most
insolent
behaviour
to
your
brother
and
others
---
to
prefer
your
brother
and
your
brother
's
friend
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
Hexam
had
changed
colour
when
those
changes
came
over
him
,
and
her
face
now
expressed
some
anger
,
more
dislike
,
and
even
a
touch
of
fear
.
<EOS>
But
she
answered
him
very
steadily
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
doubt
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
that
your
visit
is
well
meant
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
so
good
a
friend
to
Charley
that
I
have
no
right
to
doubt
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
tell
Charley
,
but
that
I
accepted
the
help
to
which
he
so
much
objects
before
he
made
any
plans
for
me
;
or
certainly
before
I
knew
of
any
.
<EOS>
It
was
considerately
and
delicately
offered
,
and
there
were
reasons
that
had
weight
with
me
which
should
be
as
dear
to
Charley
as
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
to
say
to
Charley
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
lips
trembled
and
stood
apart
,
as
he
followed
this
repudiation
of
himself
,
and
limitation
of
her
words
to
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
told
Charley
,
if
he
had
come
to
me
,
"
she
resumed
,
as
though
it
were
an
after
-
thought
,
"
that
Jenny
and
I
find
our
teacher
very
able
and
very
patient
,
and
that
she
takes
great
pains
with
us
.
<EOS>
So
much
so
,
that
we
have
said
to
her
we
hope
in
a
very
little
while
to
be
able
to
go
on
by
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Charley
knows
about
teachers
,
and
I
should
also
have
told
him
,
for
his
satisfaction
,
that
ours
comes
from
an
institution
where
teachers
are
regularly
brought
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
ask
you
,
"
said
Bradley
Headstone
,
grinding
his
words
slowly
out
,
as
though
they
came
from
a
rusty
mill
;
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
ask
you
,
if
I
may
without
offence
,
whether
you
would
have
objected
 
---
no
<EOS>
;
rather
,
I
should
like
to
say
,
if
I
may
without
offence
,
that
I
wish
I
had
had
the
opportunity
of
coming
here
with
your
brother
and
devoting
my
poor
abilities
and
experience
to
your
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
fear
,
"
he
pursued
,
after
a
pause
,
furtively
wrenching
at
the
seat
of
his
chair
with
one
hand
,
as
if
he
would
have
wrenched
the
chair
to
pieces
,
and
gloomily
observing
her
while
her
eyes
were
cast
down
,
"
that
my
humble
services
would
not
have
found
much
favor
with
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
made
no
reply
,
and
the
poor
stricken
wretch
sat
contending
with
himself
in
a
heat
of
passion
and
torment
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
forehead
and
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
only
one
thing
more
I
had
to
say
,
but
it
is
the
most
important
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
reason
against
this
matter
,
there
is
a
personal
relation
concerned
in
this
matter
,
not
yet
explained
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
might
---
I
do
n't
say
it
would
---
it
might
---
induce
you
to
think
differently
.
<EOS>
To
proceed
under
the
present
circumstances
is
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Will
you
please
come
to
the
understanding
that
there
shall
be
another
interview
on
the
subject
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
Charley
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
With
---
well
,
"
he
answered
,
breaking
off
,
"
yes
!
<EOS>
Say
with
him
too
.
<EOS>
Will
you
please
come
to
the
understanding
that
there
must
be
another
interview
under
more
favorable
circumstances
,
before
the
whole
case
can
be
submitted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
shaking
her
head
,
"
understand
your
meaning
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Limit
my
meaning
for
the
present
,
"
he
interrupted
,
"
to
the
whole
case
being
submitted
to
you
in
another
interview
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
case
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
<EOS>
What
is
wanting
to
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
---
you
shall
be
informed
in
the
other
interview
.
"
<EOS>
Then
he
said
,
as
if
in
a
burst
of
irrepressible
despair
,
"
I
---
I
leave
it
all
incomplete
!
<EOS>
There
is
a
spell
upon
me
,
I
think
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
added
,
almost
as
if
he
asked
for
pity
,
"
Good
-
night
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
held
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
As
she
,
with
manifest
hesitation
,
not
to
say
reluctance
,
touched
it
,
a
strange
tremble
passed
over
him
,
and
his
face
,
so
deadly
white
,
was
moved
as
by
a
stroke
of
pain
.
<EOS>
Then
he
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
The
dolls
'
dressmaker
sat
with
her
attitude
unchanged
,
eyeing
the
door
by
which
he
had
departed
,
until
Lizzie
pushed
her
bench
aside
and
sat
down
near
her
.
<EOS>
Then
,
eyeing
Lizzie
as
she
had
previously
eyed
Bradley
and
the
door
,
Miss
Wren
chopped
that
very
sudden
and
keen
chop
in
which
her
jaws
sometimes
indulged
,
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
folded
arms
,
and
thus
expressed
herself
:
  
"
Humph
!
<EOS>
If
he
---
<EOS>
I
mean
,
of
course
,
my
dear
,
the
party
who
is
coming
to
court
me
when
the
time
comes
---
should
be
that
sort
of
man
,
he
may
spare
himself
the
trouble
.
<EOS>
He
would
n't
do
to
be
trotted
about
and
made
useful
.
<EOS>
He
'd
take
fire
and
blow
up
while
he
was
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
would
be
rid
of
him
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
humouring
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
easily
,
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
He
would
n't
blow
up
alone
.
<EOS>
He
'd
carry
me
up
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
his
tricks
and
his
manners
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Would
he
want
to
hurt
you
,
do
you
mean
?
"
asked
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
Might
n't
exactly
want
to
do
it
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
Miss
Wren
;
 
"
but
a
lot
of
gunpowder
among
lighted
lucifer
-
matches
in
the
next
room
might
almost
as
well
be
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
very
strange
man
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
thoughtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
was
so
very
strange
<EOS>
a
man
as
to
be
a
total
stranger
<EOS>
,
"
 
answered
the
sharp
little
thing
.
  
<EOS>
It
being
Lizzie
's
regular
occupation
when
they
were
alone
of
an
evening
to
brush
out
and
smooth
the
long
fair
hair
of
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
she
unfastened
a
ribbon
that
kept
it
back
while
the
little
creature
was
at
her
work
,
and
it
fell
in
a
beautiful
shower
over
the
poor
shoulders
that
were
much
in
need
of
such
adorning
rain
.
"
<EOS>
Not
now
,
Lizzie
,
dear
,
"
said
Jenny
;
"
let
us
have
a
talk
by
the
fire
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
she
in
her
turn
loosened
her
friend
's
dark
hair
,
and
it
dropped
of
its
own
weight
over
her
bosom
,
in
two
rich
masses
.
<EOS>
Pretending
to
compare
the
colours
and
admire
the
contrast
,
Jenny
so
managed
a
mere
touch
or
two
of
her
nimble
hands
,
as
that
she
herself
laying
a
cheek
on
one
of
the
dark
folds
,
seemed
blinded
by
her
own
clustering
curls
to
all
but
the
fire
,
while
the
fine
handsome
face
and
brow
of
Lizzie
were
revealed
without
obstruction
in
the
sober
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
have
a
talk
,
"
said
Jenny
,
"
about
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Something
sparkled
down
among
the
fair
hair
resting
on
the
dark
hair
;
and
if
it
were
not
a
star
---
which
it
could
n't
be
---
<EOS>
it
was
an
eye
;
and
if
it
were
an
eye
,
it
was
Jenny
Wren
's
eye
,
bright
and
watchful
as
the
bird
's
whose
name
she
had
taken
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
about
Mr.
Wrayburn
?
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
no
better
reason
than
because
I
'm
in
the
humour
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
he
's
rich
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
rich
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
,
for
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
To
be
sure
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
's
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Not
of
our
sort
;
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
shake
of
the
head
,
a
thoughtful
shake
of
the
head
,
and
the
answer
,
softly
spoken
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
oh
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
dolls
'
dressmaker
had
an
arm
round
her
friend
's
waist
.
<EOS>
Adjusting
the
arm
,
she
slyly
took
the
opportunity
of
blowing
at
her
own
hair
where
it
fell
over
her
face
;
then
the
eye
down
there
,
under
lighter
shadows
sparkled
more
brightly
and
appeared
more
watchful
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
He
turns
up
,
he
sha
n't
be
a
gentleman
;
I
'll
very
soon
send
him
packing
,
if
he
is
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
's
not
Mr.
Wrayburn
;
I
have
n't
captivated
him
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
anybody
has
,
Lizzie
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
likely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
very
likely
?
<EOS>
I
wonder
who
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
very
likely
that
some
lady
has
been
taken
by
him
,
and
that
he
may
love
her
dearly
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
think
of
him
,
Lizzie
,
if
you
were
a
lady
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
a
lady
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
,
laughing
.
"
<EOS>
Such
a
fancy
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
say
:
just
as
a
fancy
,
and
for
instance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
a
lady
!
<EOS>
I
,
a
poor
girl
who
used
to
row
poor
father
on
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
had
rowed
poor
father
out
and
home
on
the
very
night
when
I
saw
him
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
was
made
so
timid
by
his
looking
at
me
,
that
I
got
up
and
went
out
!
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
He
did
look
at
you
,
even
that
night
,
though
you
were
not
a
lady
!
"
thought
Miss
Wren
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
a
lady
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
went
on
in
a
low
voice
,
with
her
eyes
upon
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
I
,
with
poor
father
's
grave
not
even
cleared
of
undeserved
stain
and
shame
,
and
he
trying
to
clear
it
for
me
!
<EOS>
I
a
lady
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
as
a
fancy
,
and
for
instance
,
"
urged
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
Too
much
,
Jenny
,
dear
,
too
much
!
<EOS>
My
fancy
is
not
able
to
get
that
far
.
"
<EOS>
As
the
low
fire
gleamed
upon
her
,
it
showed
her
smiling
,
mournfully
and
abstractedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
in
the
humour
,
and
I
must
be
humoured
,
Lizzie
,
because
after
all
I
am
a
poor
little
thing
,
and
have
had
a
hard
day
with
my
bad
child
.
<EOS>
Look
in
the
fire
,
as
I
like
to
hear
you
tell
how
you
used
to
do
when
you
lived
in
that
dreary
old
house
that
had
once
been
a
windmill
.
<EOS>
Look
in
the
---
what
was
its
name
when
you
told
fortunes
with
your
brother
that
I
do
n't
like
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
hollow
down
by
the
flare
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
That
's
the
name
!
<EOS>
You
can
find
a
lady
there
,
I
know

"
<EOS>
More
easily
than
I
can
make
one
of
such
material
as
myself
,
Jenny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
sparkling
eye
looked
stedfastly
up
,
as
the
musing
face
looked
thoughtfully
down
.
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
said
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
"
We
have
found
our
lady
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
nodded
,
and
asked
,
"
Shall
she
be
rich
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
had
better
be
,
as
he
's
poor
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
rich

<EOS>
Shall
she
be
handsome

<EOS>
"
Even
you
can
be
that

Lizzie

so
she
ought
to
be

"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
very
handsome
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
she
say
about
him
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Miss
Jenny
,
in
a
low
voice
:
<EOS>
watchful
,
through
an
intervening
silence
,
of
the
face
looking
down
at
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
glad
,
glad
,
to
be
rich
,
that
he
may
have
the
money
.
<EOS>
She
is
glad
,
glad
,
to
be
beautiful
,
that
he
may
be
proud
of
her
.
<EOS>
Her
poor
heart
---
"
  
"
Eh
?
<EOS>
Her
poor
heart
?
"
said
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
heart
---
is
given
him
,
with
all
its
love
and
truth
.
<EOS>
She
would
joyfully
die
with
him
,
or
,
better
than
that
,
die
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
knows
he
has
failings
,
but
she
thinks
they
have
grown
up
through
his
being
like
one
cast
away
,
for
the
want
of
something
to
trust
in
,
and
care
for
,
and
think
well
of
.
<EOS>
And
she
says
,
that
lady
rich
and
beautiful
<EOS>
that
I
can
never
come
near
,
`
<EOS>
`
Only
put
me
in
that
empty
place
,
only
try
how
little
I
mind
myself
,
only
prove
what
a
world
of
things
I
will
do
and
bear
for
you
,
and
I
hope
that
you
might
even
come
to
be
much
better
than
you
are
,
through
me
who
am
so
much
worse
,
and
hardly
worth
the
thinking
of
beside
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
As
the
face
looking
at
the
fire
had
become
exalted
and
forgetful
in
the
rapture
of
these
words
,
the
little
creature
,
openly
clearing
away
her
fair
hair
with
her
disengaged
hand
,
had
gazed
at
it
with
earnest
attention
and
something
like
alarm
.
<EOS>
Now
that
the
speaker
ceased
,
the
little
creature
laid
down
her
head
again
,
and
moaned
,
"
O
me
,
O
me
,
O
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
pain
,
dear
Jenny
?
"
asked
Lizzie
,
as
if
awakened
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
not
the
old
pain
.
<EOS>
Lay
me
down
,
lay
me
down
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
go
out
of
my
sight
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Lock
the
door
and
keep
close
to
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
Then
turning
away
her
face
,
she
said
in
a
whisper
to
herself
,
"
My
Lizzie
,
my
poor
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
O
my
blessed
children
,
come
back
in
the
long
bright
slanting
rows
,
and
come
for
her
,
not
me
.
<EOS>
She
wants
help
more
than
I
,
my
blessed
children
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
stretched
her
hands
up
with
that
higher
and
better
look
,
and
now
she
turned
again
,
and
folded
them
round
Lizzie
's
neck
,
and
rocked
herself
on
Lizzie
's
breast
.

MORE
BIRDS
OF
PREY
.
 
<EOS>
Rogue
Riderhood
dwelt
deep
and
dark
in
Limehouse
Hole
,
among
the
riggers
,
and
the
mast
,
oar
and
block
makers
,
and
the
boat
-
builders
,
and
the
sail
-
lofts
,
as
in
a
kind
of
ship
's
hold
stored
full
of
waterside
characters
,
some
no
better
than
himself
,
some
very
much
better
,
and
none
much
worse
.
<EOS>
The
Hole
,
albeit
in
a
general
way
not
over
nice
in
its
choice
of
company
,
was
rather
shy
in
reference
to
the
honor
of
cultivating
the
Rogue
's
acquaintance
;
more
frequently
giving
him
the
cold
shoulder
than
the
warm
hand
,
and
seldom
or
never
drinking
with
him
unless
at
his
own
expense
.
<EOS>
A
part
of
the
Hole
,
indeed
,
contained
so
much
public
spirit
and
private
virtue
that
not
even
this
strong
leverage
could
move
it
to
good
fellowship
with
a
tainted
accuser
.
<EOS>
But
,
there
may
have
been
the
drawback
on
this
magnanimous
morality
,
that
its
exponents
held
a
true
witness
before
Justice
to
be
the
next
unneighbourly
and
accursed
character
to
a
false
one
.
  
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
the
daughter
whom
he
often
mentioned
,
Mr.
Riderhood
might
have
found
the
Hole
a
mere
grave
as
to
any
means
it
would
yield
him
of
getting
a
living
.
<EOS>
But
Miss
Pleasant
Riderhood
had
some
little
position
and
connection
in
Limehouse
Hole
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
smallest
of
small
scales
,
she
was
an
unlicensed
pawnbroker
,
keeping
what
was
popularly
called
a
Leaving
Shop
,
by
lending
insignificant
sums
on
insignificant
articles
of
property
deposited
with
her
as
security
.
<EOS>
In
her
four
-
and
-
twentieth
year
of
life
,
Pleasant
was
already
in
her
fifth
year
of
this
way
of
trade
.
<EOS>
Her
deceased
mother
had
established
the
business
,
and
on
that
parent
's
demise
she
had
appropriated
a
secret
capital
of
fifteen
shillings
to
establishing
herself
in
it
;
the
existence
of
such
capital
in
a
pillow
being
the
last
intelligible
confidential
communication
made
to
her
by
the
departed
,
before
succumbing
to
dropsical
conditions
of
snuff
and
gin
,
incompatible
equally
with
coherence
and
existence
.
  
<EOS>
Why
christened
Pleasant
,
the
late
Mrs.
Riderhood
might
possibly
have
been
at
some
time
able
to
explain
,
and
possibly
not
.
<EOS>
Her
daughter
had
no
information
on
that
point
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
she
found
herself
,
and
she
could
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
consulted
on
the
question
,
any
more
than
on
the
question
of
her
coming
into
these
terrestrial
parts
,
to
want
a
name
.
<EOS>
Similarly
,
she
found
herself
possessed
of
what
is
colloquially
termed
a
swivel
eye
(
derived
from
her
father
)
,
which
she
might
perhaps
have
declined
if
her
sentiments
on
the
subject
had
been
taken
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
otherwise
positively
ill
-
looking
,
though
anxious
,
meagre
,
of
a
muddy
complexion
,
and
looking
as
old
again
as
she
really
was
.
  
<EOS>
As
some
dogs
have
it
in
the
blood
,
or
are
trained
,
to
worry
certain
creatures
to
a
certain
point
,
so
---
not
to
make
the
comparison
disrespectfully
---
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
Riderhood
had
it
in
the
blood
,
or
had
been
trained
,
to
regard
seamen
,
within
certain
limits
,
as
her
prey
.
<EOS>
Show
her
a
man
in
a
blue
jacket
,
and
,
figuratively
speaking
,
she
pinned
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
all
things
considered
,
she
was
not
of
an
evil
mind
or
an
unkindly
disposition
.
<EOS>
For
,
observe
how
many
things
were
to
be
considered
according
to
her
own
unfortunate
experience
.
<EOS>
Show
Pleasant
Riderhood
a
Wedding
in
the
street
,
and
she
only
saw
two
people
taking
out
a
regular
license
to
quarrel
and
fight
.
<EOS>
Show
her
a
Christening
,
and
she
saw
a
little
heathen
personage
having
a
quite
superfluous
name
bestowed
upon
it
,
inasmuch
as
it
would
be
commonly
addressed
by
some
abusive
epithet
:
which
little
personage
was
not
in
the
least
wanted
by
anybody
,
and
would
be
shoved
and
banged
out
of
everybody
's
way
,
until
it
should
grow
big
enough
to
shove
and
bang
.
<EOS>
Show
her
a
Funeral
,
and
she
saw
an
unremunerative
ceremony
in
the
nature
of
a
black
masquerade
,
conferring
a
temporary
gentility
on
the
performers
,
at
an
immense
expense
,
and
representing
the
only
formal
party
ever
given
by
the
deceased
.
<EOS>
Show
her
a
live
father
,
and
she
saw
but
a
duplicate
of
her
own
father
,
who
from
her
infancy
had
been
taken
with
fits
and
starts
of
discharging
his
duty
to
her
,
which
duty
was
always
incorporated
in
the
form
of
a
fist
or
a
leathern
strap
,
and
being
discharged
hurt
her
.
<EOS>
All
things
considered
,
therefore
,
Pleasant
Riderhood
was
not
so
very
,
very
bad
.
<EOS>
There
was
even
a
touch
of
romance
in
her
---
of
such
romance
as
could
creep
into
Limehouse
Hole
---
and
maybe
sometimes
of
a
summer
evening
,
when
she
stood
with
folded
arms
at
her
shopdoor
,
looking
from
the
reeking
street
to
the
sky
where
the
sun
was
setting
,
she
may
have
had
some
vaporous
visions
of
far
-
off
islands
in
the
southern
seas
or
elsewhere
(
not
being
geographically
particular
)
,
where
it
would
be
good
to
roam
with
a
congenial
partner
among
groves
of
bread
-
fruit
,
waiting
for
ships
to
be
wafted
from
the
hollow
ports
of
civilization
.
<EOS>
For
,
sailors
to
be
got
the
better
of
,
were
essential
to
Miss
Pleasant
's
Eden
.
  
<EOS>
Not
on
a
summer
evening
did
she
come
to
her
little
shop
-
door
,
when
a
certain
man
standing
over
against
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
took
notice
of
her
.
<EOS>
That
was
on
a
cold
shrewd
windy
evening
,
after
dark
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
Riderhood
shared
with
most
of
the
lady
inhabitants
of
the
Hole
,
the
peculiarity
that
her
hair
was
a
ragged
knot
,
constantly
coming
down
behind
,
and
that
she
never
could
enter
upon
any
undertaking
without
first
twisting
it
into
place
.
<EOS>
At
that
particular
moment
,
being
newly
come
to
the
threshold
to
take
a
look
out
of
doors
,
she
was
winding
herself
up
with
both
hands
after
this
fashion
.
<EOS>
And
so
prevalent
was
the
fashion
,
that
on
the
occasion
of
a
fight
or
other
disturbance
in
the
Hole
,
the
ladies
would
be
seen
flocking
from
all
quarters
universally
twisting
their
back
-
hair
as
they
came
along
,
and
many
of
them
,
in
the
hurry
of
the
moment
,
carrying
their
back
-
combs
in
their
mouths
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
wretched
little
shop
,
with
a
roof
that
any
man
standing
in
it
could
touch
with
his
hand
;
little
better
than
a
cellar
or
cave
,
down
three
steps
.
<EOS>
Yet
in
its
ill
-
lighted
window
,
among
a
flaring
handkerchief
or
two
,
an
old
peacoat
or
so
,
a
few
valueless
watches
and
compasses
,
a
jar
of
tobacco
and
two
crossed
pipes
,
a
bottle
of
walnut
ketchup
,
and
some
horrible
sweets
---
these
creature
discomforts
serving
as
a
blind
to
the
main
business
of
the
Leaving
Shop
---
was
displayed
the
inscription
Seaman
's
Boarding
-
House
.
  
<EOS>
Taking
notice
of
Pleasant
Riderhood
at
the
door
,
the
man
crossed
so
quickly
that
she
was
still
winding
herself
up
,
when
he
stood
close
before
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
your
father
at
home
?
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
,
"
returned
Pleasant
,
dropping
her
arms
;
"
come
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
tentative
reply
,
the
man
having
a
seafaring
appearance
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
not
at
home
,
and
Pleasant
knew
it
.
<EOS>
"
Take
a
seat
by
the
fire
,
"
were
her
hospitable
words
when
she
had
got
him
in
;
 
"
men
of
your
calling
are
always
welcome
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
His
manner
was
the
manner
of
a
sailor
,
and
his
hands
were
the
hands
of
a
sailor
,
except
that
they
were
smooth
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
had
an
eye
for
sailors
,
and
she
noticed
the
unused
colour
and
texture
of
the
hands
,
sunburnt
though
they
were
,
as
sharply
as
she
noticed
their
unmistakable
looseness
and
suppleness
,
as
he
sat
himself
down
with
his
left
arm
carelessly
thrown
across
his
left
leg
a
little
above
the
knee
,
and
the
right
arm
as
carelessly
thrown
over
the
elbow
of
the
wooden
chair
,
with
the
hand
curved
,
half
open
and
half
shut
,
as
if
it
had
just
let
go
a
rope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Might
you
be
looking
for
a
Boarding
-
House
?
"
<EOS>
Pleasant
inquired
,
taking
her
observant
stand
on
one
side
of
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
rightly
know
my
plans
yet
,
"
returned
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ai
n't
looking
for
a
Leaving
Shop
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
assented
Pleasant
,
"
you
've
got
too
much
of
an
outfit
on
you
for
that
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
should
want
either
,
this
is
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
"
said
the
man
,
glancing
round
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
here
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
Leave
anything
when
you
were
here
before
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Pleasant
,
with
a
view
to
principal
and
interest
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
The
man
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
pretty
sure
you
never
boarded
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
<EOS>
The
man
again
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
here
when
you
were
here
before
?
"
asked
Pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
For
I
do
n't
remember
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
at
all
likely
you
should
.
<EOS>
I
only
stood
at
the
door
,
one
night
---
on
the
lower
step
there
---
while
a
shipmate
of
mine
looked
in
to
speak
to
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
place
well
.
<EOS>
"
Looking
very
curiously
round
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Might
that
have
been
long
ago
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
a
goodish
bit
ago
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
off
my
last
voyage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
not
been
to
sea
lately
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
Been
in
the
sick
bay
since
then
,
and
been
employed
ashore
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
to
be
sure
,
that
accounts
for
your
hands
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
with
a
keen
look
,
a
quick
smile
,
and
a
change
of
manner
,
caught
her
up
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
good
observer
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
That
accounts
for
my
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
was
somewhat
disquieted
by
his
look
,
and
returned
it
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
his
change
of
manner
,
though
very
sudden
,
quite
collected
,
but
his
former
manner
,
which
he
resumed
,
had
a
certain
suppressed
confidence
and
sense
of
power
in
it
that
were
half
threatening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
your
father
be
long
?
"
he
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
supposed
he
was
at
home
,
it
would
seem
that
he
has
just
gone
out
?
<EOS>
How
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
supposed
he
had
come
home
,
"
Pleasant
explained
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
You
supposed
he
had
come
home
?
<EOS>
Then
he
has
been
some
time
out
?
<EOS>
How
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
deceive
you
.
<EOS>
Father
's
on
the
river
in
his
boat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
the
old
work
?
"
asked
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
"
said
Pleasant
,
shrinking
a
step
back
.
<EOS>
"
What
on
earth
d'ye
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
hurt
your
father
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
say
I
might
,
if
I
chose
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
Not
much
in
that
,
is
there
?
<EOS>
There
shall
be
no
secrets
from
you
;
you
shall
be
by
.
<EOS>
And
plainly
,
Miss
Riderhood
,
there
's
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
me
,
or
made
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
good
for
the
Leaving
Shop
,
I
am
not
good
for
the
Boarding
-
House
,
I
am
not
good
for
anything
in
your
way
to
the
extent
of
sixpenn'orth
of
halfpence
.
<EOS>
Put
the
idea
aside
,
and
we
shall
get
on
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
're
a
seafaring
man
?
"
argued
Pleasant
,
as
if
that
were
a
sufficient
reason
for
his
being
good
for
something
in
her
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
and
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
,
and
I
may
be
again
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
for
you
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
take
my
word
for
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
conversation
had
arrived
at
a
crisis
to
justify
Miss
Pleasant
's
hair
in
tumbling
down
.
<EOS>
It
tumbled
down
accordingly
,
and
she
twisted
it
up
,
looking
from
under
her
bent
forehead
at
the
man
.
<EOS>
In
taking
stock
of
his
familiarly
worn
rough
-
weather
nautical
clothes
,
piece
by
piece
,
she
took
stock
of
a
formidable
knife
in
a
sheath
at
his
waist
ready
to
his
hand
,
and
of
a
whistle
hanging
round
his
neck
,
and
of
a
short
jagged
knotted
club
with
a
loaded
head
that
peeped
out
of
a
pocket
of
his
loose
outer
jacket
or
frock
.
<EOS>
He
sat
quietly
looking
at
her
;
but
,
with
these
appendages
partially
revealing
themselves
,
and
with
a
quantity
of
bristling
oakum
-
colored
head
and
whisker
,
he
had
a
formidable
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
take
my
word
for
it
?
<EOS>
he
asked
again
.
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
answered
with
a
short
dumb
nod
.
<EOS>
He
rejoined
with
another
short
dumb
nod
.
<EOS>
Then
he
got
up
and
stood
with
his
arms
folded
,
in
front
of
the
fire
,
looking
down
into
it
occasionally
,
as
she
stood
with
her
arms
folded
,
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
chimney
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
wile
away
the
time
till
your
father
comes
,
"
he
said
,
---
<EOS>
"
pray
is
there
much
robbing
and
murdering
of
seamen
about
the
water
-
side
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Any
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Complaints
of
that
sort
are
sometimes
made
,
about
Rateliffe
and
Wapping
,
and
up
that
way
.
<EOS>
But
who
knows
how
many
are
true
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
.
<EOS>
And
it
do
n't
seem
necessary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
say
,
"
observed
Pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
the
reason
for
it
?
<EOS>
Bless
the
sailors
,
it
ai
n't
as
if
they
ever
could
keep
what
they
have
,
without
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
.
<EOS>
Their
money
may
be
soon
got
out
of
them
,
without
violence
,
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
may
,
"
said
Pleasant
;
"
and
then
they
ship
again
,
and
get
more
.
<EOS>
And
the
best
thing
for
'em
,
too
,
to
ship
again
as
soon
as
ever
they
can
be
brought
to
it
.
<EOS>
They
're
never
so
well
off
as
when
they
're
afloat
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
why
I
ask
,
"
pursued
the
visitor
,
looking
up
from
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
once
beset
that
way
myself
,
and
left
for
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
said
Pleasant
.
<EOS>
"
Where
did
it
happen
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
happened
,
"
returned
the
man
,
with
a
ruminative
air
,
as
he
drew
his
right
hand
across
his
chin
,
and
dipped
the
other
in
the
pocket
of
his
rough
outer
coat
,
"
it
happened
somewhere
about
here
as
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
it
can
have
been
a
mile
from
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
you
drunk
?
"
asked
Pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
muddled
,
but
not
with
fair
drinking
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
drinking
,
you
understand
.
<EOS>
A
mouthful
did
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
with
a
grave
look
shook
her
head
;
importing
that
she
understood
the
process
,
but
decidedly
disapproved
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fair
trade
is
one
thing
,
"
said
she
,
"
but
that
's
another
.
<EOS>
No
one
has
a
right
to
carry
on
with
Jack
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
sentiment
does
you
credit
,
"
returned
the
man
,
with
a
grim
smile
;
and
added
,
in
a
mutter
,
"
the
more
so
,
as
I
believe
it
's
not
your
father
's
.
<EOS>
---
Yes
,
I
had
a
bad
time
of
it
,
that
time
.
<EOS>
I
lost
everything
,
and
had
a
sharp
struggle
for
my
life
,
weak
as
I
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
get
the
parties
punished
?
"
asked
Pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
tremendous
punishment
followed
,
"
said
the
man
,
more
seriously
;
 
"
<EOS>
but
it
was
not
of
my
bringing
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Of
whose
,
then
?
"
asked
Pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
pointed
upward
with
his
forefinger
,
and
,
slowly
recovering
that
hand
,
settled
his
chin
in
it
again
as
he
looked
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Bringing
her
inherited
eye
to
bear
upon
him
,
Pleasant
Riderhood
felt
more
and
more
uncomfortable
,
his
manner
was
so
mysterious
,
so
stern
,
so
self
-
possessed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anyways
,
"
said
the
damsel
,
"
I
am
glad
punishment
followed
,
and
I
say
so
.
<EOS>
Fair
trade
with
seafaring
men
gets
a
bad
name
through
deeds
of
violence
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
much
against
deeds
of
violence
being
done
to
seafaring
men
,
as
seafaring
men
can
be
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
am
of
the
same
opinion
as
my
mother
was
,
when
she
was
living
.
<EOS>
Fair
trade
,
my
mother
used
to
say
,
but
no
robbery
and
no
blows
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
the
way
of
trade
Miss
Pleasant
would
have
taken
---
and
indeed
did
take
when
she
could
---
as
much
as
thirty
shillings
a
week
for
board
that
would
be
dear
at
five
,
and
likewise
conducted
the
Leaving
business
upon
correspondingly
equitable
principles
;
yet
she
had
that
tenderness
of
conscience
and
those
feelings
of
humanity
,
that
the
moment
her
ideas
of
trade
were
overstepped
,
she
became
the
seaman
's
champion
,
even
against
her
father
whom
she
seldom
otherwise
resisted
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
she
was
here
interrupted
by
her
father
's
voice
exclaiming
angrily
,
"
Now
,
Poll
Parrot
!
"
<EOS>
and
by
her
father
's
hat
being
heavily
flung
from
his
hand
and
strking
her
face
.
<EOS>
Accustomed
to
such
occasional
manifestations
of
his
sense
of
parental
duty
,
Pleasant
merely
wiped
her
face
on
her
hair
(
which
of
course
had
tumbled
down
)
before
she
twisted
it
up
.
<EOS>
This
was
another
common
procedure
on
the
part
of
the
ladies
of
the
Hole
,
when
heated
by
verbal
or
fistic
altercation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Blest
if
I
believe
such
a
Poll
Parrot
as
you
was
ever
learned
to
speak
!
"
growled
Mr.
Riderhood
,
stooping
to
pick
up
his
hat
,
and
making
a
feint
at
her
with
his
head
and
right
elbow
;
for
he
took
the
delicate
subject
of
robbing
seamen
in
extraordinary
dudgeon
,
and
was
out
of
humour
too
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
Poll
Parroting
at
now
?
<EOS>
Ai
n't
you
got
nothing
to
do
but
fold
your
arms
and
stand
a
Poll
Parroting
all
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Let
her
alone
,
"
urged
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
only
speaking
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
her
alone
too
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Mr.
Riderhood
,
eyeing
him
all
over
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
she
's
my
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
n't
you
know
that
I
wo
n't
have
no
Poll
Parroting
on
the
part
of
my
daughter
?
<EOS>
No
,
<EOS>
nor
yet
that
I
wo
n't
take
no
Poll
Parroting
from
no
man
?
<EOS>
And
who
may
you
be
,
and
what
may
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
tell
you
until
you
are
silent
?
"
returned
the
other
fiercely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Riderhood
,
quailing
a
little
,
"
I
am
willing
to
be
silent
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
Poll
Parrot
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
thirsty
,
you
?
"
<EOS>
the
man
asked
,
in
the
same
fierce
short
way
,
after
returning
his
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
nat'rally
,
"
said
Mr.
Riderhood
,
"
ai
n't
I
always
thirsty
!
"
 
<EOS>
(
Indignant
at
the
absurdity
of
the
question
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
you
drink
?
"
demanded
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sherry
wine
,
"
returned
Mr.
Riderhood
,
in
the
same
sharp
tone
,
"
if
you
're
capable
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
took
out
half
a
sovereign
,
and
begged
the
favour
of
Miss
Pleasant
that
she
would
fetch
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
the
cork
undrawn
,
"
he
added
,
emphatically
,
looking
at
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
my
Alfred
David
,
"
muttered
Mr.
Riderhood
,
slowly
relaxing
into
a
dark
smile
,
"
that
you
know
a
move
.
<EOS>
Do
I
know
you
?
<EOS>
N
---
<EOS>
n
---
<EOS>
no
,
I
do
n't
know
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
replied
,
"
No
,
you
do
n't
know
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
surlily
enough
,
until
Pleasant
came
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
small
glasses
on
the
shelf
,
"
said
Riderhood
to
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
the
one
without
a
foot
.
<EOS>
I
gets
my
living
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
,
and
it
's
good
enough
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
This
had
a
modest
self
-
denying
appearance
;
but
it
soon
turned
out
that
as
,
by
reason
of
the
impossibility
of
standing
the
glass
upright
while
there
was
anything
in
it
,
it
required
to
be
emptied
as
soon
as
filled
,
Mr.
Riderhood
managed
to
drink
in
the
proportion
of
three
to
one
.
  
<EOS>
With
his
Fortunatus
's
goblet
ready
in
his
hand
,
Mr.
Riderhood
sat
down
on
one
side
of
the
table
before
the
fire
,
and
the
strange
man
on
the
other
:
<EOS>
Pleasant
occupying
a
stool
between
the
latter
and
the
fireside
.
<EOS>
The
background
,
composed
of
handkerchiefs
,
coats
,
shirts
,
hats
,
and
other
old
articles
"
On
Leaving
,
"
had
a
general
dim
resemblance
to
human
listeners
;
especially
where
a
shiny
black
sou'wester
suit
and
hat
hung
,
looking
very
like
a
clumsy
mariner
with
his
back
to
the
company
,
who
was
so
curious
to
overhear
,
that
he
paused
for
the
purpose
with
his
coat
half
pulled
on
,
and
his
shoulders
up
to
his
ears
in
the
uncompleted
action
.
  
<EOS>
The
visitor
first
held
the
bottle
against
the
light
of
the
candle
,
and
next
examined
the
top
of
the
cork
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
it
had
not
been
tampered
with
,
he
slowly
took
from
his
breastpocket
a
rusty
clasp
-
knife
,
and
,
with
a
corkscrew
in
the
handle
,
opened
the
wine
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
looked
at
the
cork
,
unscrewed
it
from
the
corkscrew
,
laid
each
separately
on
the
table
,
and
,
with
the
end
of
the
sailor
's
knot
of
his
neckerchief
,
dusted
the
inside
of
the
neck
of
the
bottle
.
<EOS>
All
this
with
great
deliberation
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
Riderhood
had
sat
with
his
footless
glass
extended
at
arm
's
length
for
filling
,
while
the
very
deliberate
stranger
seemed
absorbed
in
his
preparations
.
<EOS>
But
,
gradually
his
arm
reverted
home
to
him
,
and
his
glass
was
lowered
and
lowered
until
he
rested
it
upside
down
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
By
the
same
degrees
his
attention
became
concentrated
on
the
knife
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
the
man
held
out
the
bottle
to
fill
all
round
,
Riderhood
stood
up
,
leaned
over
the
table
to
look
closer
at
the
knife
,
and
stared
from
it
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
?
"
asked
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
know
that
knife
!
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
dare
say
you
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
motioned
to
him
to
hold
up
his
glass
,
and
filled
it
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
emptied
it
to
the
last
drop
and
began
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
there
knife
---
"
  
"
Stop
,
"
said
the
man
,
composedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
drink
to
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
Your
health
,
Miss
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
knife
was
the
knife
of
a
seaman
named
George
Radfoot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
seaman
was
well
beknown
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
come
to
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Death
has
come
to
him
.
<EOS>
Death
came
to
him
in
an
ugly
shape
.
<EOS>
He
looked
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
very
horrible
after
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Arter
what
?
"
said
Riderhood
,
with
a
frowning
stare
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
he
was
killed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Killed
?
<EOS>
Who
killed
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Only
answering
with
a
shrug
,
the
man
filled
the
footless
glass
,
and
Riderhood
emptied
it
:
looking
amazedly
from
his
daughter
to
his
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
to
tell
a
honest
man
---
"
he
was
recommencing
with
his
empty
glass
in
his
hand
,
when
his
eye
became
fascinated
by
the
stranger
's
outer
coat
.
<EOS>
He
leaned
across
the
table
to
see
it
nearer
,
touched
the
sleeve
,
turned
the
cuff
to
look
at
the
sleevelining
(
the
man
,
in
his
perfect
composure
,
offering
not
the

,
and
exclaimed
,
"
It
's
my
belief
as
this
here
coat
was
George
Radfoot
's
too
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
.
<EOS>
He
wore
it
the
last
time
you
ever
saw
him
,
and
the
last
time
you
ever
will
see
him
---
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
belief
you
mean
to
tell
me
to
my
face
you
killed
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
exclaimed
Riderhood
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
allowing
his
glass
to
be
filled
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
only
answered
with
another
shrug
,
and
showed
no
symptom
of
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wish
<EOS>
I
may
die
if
I
know
what
to
be
up
to
with
this
chap
!
"
 
<EOS>
said
Riderhood
,
after
staring
at
him
,
and
tossing
his
last
glassful
down
his
throat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
's
know
what
to
make
of
you
.
<EOS>
Say
something
plain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
returned
the
other
,
leaning
forward
across
the
table
,
and
speaking
in
a
low
impressive
voice
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
liar
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
honest
witness
rose
,
and
made
as
though
he
would
fling
his
glass
in
the
man
's
face
.
<EOS>
The
man
not
wincing
,
and
merely
shaking
his
forefinger
half
knowingly
,
half
menacingly
,
the
piece
of
honesty
thought
better
of
it
and
sat
down
again
,
putting
the
glass
down
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
you
went
to
that
lawyer
yonder
in
the
Temple
with
that
invented
story
,
"
said
the
stranger
,
in
an
exasperatingly
comfortable
sort
of
confidence
,
"
You
might
have
had
your
strong
suspicions
of
a
friend
of
your
own
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
had
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Me
my
suspicions
?
<EOS>
Of
what
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
again
whose
knife
was
this
?
"
demanded
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
possessed
by
,
and
was
the
property
of
---
him
as
I
have
made
mention
on
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
stupidly
evading
the
actual
mention
of
the
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
again
whose
coat
was
this
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
That
there
article
of
clothing
likeways
belonged
to
,
and
was
wore
by
---
him
as
I
have
made
mention
on
,
"
was
again
the
dull
Old
Bailey
evasion
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
that
you
gave
him
the
credit
of
the
deed
,
and
of
keeping
cleverly
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
small
cleverness
in
his
keeping
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
The
cleverness
would
have
been
,
to
have
got
back
for
one
single
instant
to
the
light
of
the
sun
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Things
is
come
to
a
pretty
pass
,
"
growled
Mr.
Riderhood
,
rising
to
his
feet
,
goaded
to
stand
at
bay
,
"
when
bullyers
as
is
wearing
dead
men
's
clothes
,
and
bullyers
as
is
armed
with
dead
men
's
knives
,
is
to
come
into
the
houses
of
honest
live
men
,
getting
their
livings
by
the
sweats
of
their
brows
,
and
is
to
make
these
here
sort
of
charges
with
no
rhyme
and
no
reason
,
neither
the
one
nor
yet
the
other
!
<EOS>
Why
should
I
have
had
my
suspicions
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
knew
him
,
"
replied
the
man
;
"
because
you
had
been
one
with
him
,
and
knew
his
real
character
under
a
fair
outside
;
 
because
on
the
night
which
you
had
afterwards
reason
to
believe
to
be
the
very
night
of
the
murder
,
he
came
in
here
,
within
an
hour
of
his
having
left
his
ship
in
the
docks
,
and
asked
you
in
what
lodgings
he
could
find
room
.
<EOS>
Was
there
no
stranger
with
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
my
world
-
without
-
end
everlasting
Alfred
David
that
you
warn't
with
him
,
"
answered
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
You
talk
big
,
you
do
,
but
things
look
pretty
black
against
yourself
,
to
my
thinking
.
<EOS>
You
charge
again
'
me
that
George
Radfoot
got
lost
sight
of
,
and
was
no
more
thought
of

<EOS>
What
's
that
for
a
sailor
?
<EOS>
Why
there
's
fifty
such
,
out
of
sight
and
out
of
mind
,
ten
times
as
long
as
him

through
entering
in

re

shipping
when
the
out'ard
voyage
is
made

what
not
---
a
turning
up
to

every

about
here
,
and
no

made
of
it

<EOS>
Ask
my
daughter

<EOS>
You
could
go
on
Poll
Parroting
enough
with
her

little
with

What
are
my

you

You
tell
me
George
Radfoot
got
killed

<EOS>
I
ask
you
who
done
it

how
you
know
it

<EOS>
You
carry
his

you
wear
his
coat

<EOS>
I
ask
you
how
you
come
by
'em
?
<EOS>
Hand
over
that
there
bottle
!
"
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Riderhood
appeared
to
labour
under
a
virtuous
delusion
that
it
was
his
own
property
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
his
daughter
,
as
he
filled
the
footless
glass
,
"
if
it
warn't
wasting
good
sherry
wine
on
you

I
'd
chuck
this
at

<EOS>
It
's
along
of
Poll
Parroting

such

gets
their

I
gets
mine
by
argueyment

sweating
away
at

<EOS>
"
Here
he
filled
the
footless
goblet
again
,
and
stood
chewing
one
half
of
its
contents
and
looking
down
into
the
other
as
he
slowly
rolled
the
wine
about
in
the
glass
;
while
Pleasant
,
whose
sympathetic
hair
had
come
down
on
her
being
apostrophised
,
rearranged
it
,
much
in
the
style
of
the
tail
of
a
horse
when
proceeding
to
market
to
be
sold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
Have
you
finished

asked
the
strange
man

<EOS>
"
No

said
Riderhood
,
"
I

Far
from

Now

vociferated

said
Riderhood
,
with
a
threatening
action

<EOS>
"
I
alone
know

returned
the
man
,
sternly
shaking
his
head
,
"
the
mysteries

alone
know
that

I

false

that
you

know
it

be
altogether
false

I
come
here
to

night
to
tell
you
so
much
of
what
I
know

no
more

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Riderhood
,
with
his
crooked
eye
upon
his
visitor
,
meditated
for
some
moments
,
and
then
refilled
his
glass
,
and
tipped
the
contents
down
his
throat
in
three
tips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shut
the
shop
-
door
!
"
<EOS>
he
then
said
to
his
daughter
,
putting
the
glass
suddenly
down
.
"
<EOS>
And
turn
the
key
and
stand
by
it
!
<EOS>
If
you
know
all
this
,
you
sir
,
"
getting
,
as
he
spoke
,
between
the
visitor
and
the
door
,
"
Why
han't
you
gone
to
Lawyer
Lightwood
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
,
also
,
is
alone
known
to
myself
,
"
was
the
cool
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
that
,
if
you
did
n't
do
the
deed
,
what
you
say
you
could
tell
is
worth
from
five
to
ten
thousand
pound

"
asked
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
very
well
,
and
when
I
claim
the
money
you
shall
share
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
honest
man
paused
,
and
drew
a
little
nearer
to
the
visitor
,
and
a
little
further
from
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
repeated
the
man
,
quietly
,
"
as
well
as
I
know
that
you
and
George
Radfoot
were
one
together
in
more
than
one
dark
business
;
and
as
well
as
I
know
that
you
,
Roger
Riderhood
,
conspired
against
an
innocent
man
for
blood
-
money
;
and
as
well
as
I
know
that
I
can
---
and
that
I
swear
I
will
!
<EOS>
---
give
you
up
on
both
scores

be
the
proof

"
Father

cried
Pleasant
,
from
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Do

Give

Do

<EOS>
"
Will
you
leave
off
a
Poll
Parroting

I
ask
you

"
<EOS>
cried
Mr.
Riderhood
,
half
beside
himself
between
the
two
.
<EOS>
Then
,
propitiatingly
and
crawlingly
:
"
You
sir
!
<EOS>
You
han't
said
what
you
want
of
me
.
<EOS>
Is
it
fair
,
is
it
worthy
of
yourself
,
to
talk
of
my
defying
you
afore
<EOS>
ever
you
say
what
you
want
of
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
much

"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
accusation
of
yours
must
not
be
left
half
made
and
half
unmade
.
<EOS>
What
was
done
for
the
blood
-
money
must
be
thoroughly
undone
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
but
Shipmate
---
"
  
"
Do
nt
call
me
Shipmate
,
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
,
then
,
"
urged
Mr.
Riderhood
;
"
there
!
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
object
to
Captain

<EOS>
It
's
a
honorable
title
,
and
you
fully
look
it
.
<EOS>
Captain
!
<EOS>
Ai
n't
the
man
dead
?
<EOS>
Now
I
ask
you
fair
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
Gaffer
dead
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
the
other
,
with
impatience
,
"
yes
,
he
is
dead
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Can
words
hurt
a
dead
man
,
Captain
?
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
fair
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
can
hurt
the
memory
of
a
dead
man
,
and
they
can
hurt
his
living
children
.
<EOS>
How
many
children
had
this
man
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Meaning
Gaffer
,
Captain
?
"
  
"
Of
whom
else
are
we
speaking
?
"
returned
the
other
,
with
a
movement
of
his
foot
,
as
if
Rogue
Riderhood
were
beginning
to
sneak
before
him
in
the
body
as
well
as
the
spirit
,
and
he
spurned
him
off
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
of
a
daughter
,
and
a
son
.
<EOS>
I
ask
for
information
;
I
ask
your
daughter
;
I
prefer
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
What
children
did
Hexam
leave
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
,
looking
to
her
father
for
permission
to
reply
,
that
honest
man
exclaimed
with
great
bitterness
:
  
"
Why
the
devil
do
n't
you
answer
the
Captain
?
<EOS>
You
can
Poll
Parrot
enough
when
you
ai
n't
wanted
to
Poll
Parrot
,
you
perwerse
jade
!
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
encouraged
,
Pleasant
explained
that
there
were
only
Lizzie
,
the
daughter
in
question
,
and
the
youth
.
<EOS>
Both
very
respectable
,
she
added
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
dreadful
that
any
stigma
should
attach
to
them
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
whom
the
consideration
rendered
so
uneasy
that
he
rose
,
and
paced
to
and
fro
,
muttering
,
"
Dreadful
!
<EOS>
Unforeseen
?
<EOS>
How
could
it
be
foreseen
!
"
<EOS>
Then
he
stopped
,
and
asked
aloud
:
"
Where
do
they
live
?
"
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
further
explained
that
only
the
daughter
had
resided
with
the
father
at
the
time
of
his
accidental
death
,
and
that
she
had
immediately
afterwards
quitted
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
"
said
the
man
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
have
been
to
the
place
they
dwelt
in
,
at
the
time
of
the
inquest
.
<EOS>
Could
you
quietly
find
out
for
me
where
she
lives
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
had
no
doubt
she
could
do
that
.
<EOS>
Within
what
time
,
did
she
think
?
<EOS>
Within
a
day
.
<EOS>
The
visitor
said
that
was
well
,
and
he
would
return
for
the
information
,
relying
on
its
being
obtained
.
<EOS>
To
this
dialogue
Riderhood
had
attended
in
silence
,
and
he
now
obsequiously
bespake
the
Captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
!
<EOS>
Mentioning
them
unfort'net
words
of
mine
respecting
Gaffer
,
it
is
contrairily
to
be
bore
in
mind
that
Gaffer
always
were
a
precious
rascal
,
and
that
his
line
were
a
thieving
line
.
<EOS>
Likeways
<EOS>
when
I
went
to
them
two
Governors
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
and
the
t'other
Governor
,
with
my
information
,
I
may
have
been
a
little
over
-
eager
for
the
cause
of
justice
,
or
(
to
put
it
another
way
)
<EOS>
a
little
over
-
stimilated
by
them
feelings
which
rouses
a
man
up
,
when
a
pot
of
money
is
going
about
,
to
get
his
hand
into
that
pot
of
money
for
his
family
's
sake
.
<EOS>
Besides
which
,
I
think
the
wine
of
them
two
Governors
was
---
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
a
hocussed
wine
,
but
fur
from
a
wine
as
was
elthy
for
the
mind
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
another
thing
to
be
remembered
,
Captain

Did
I
stick
to
them
words
when
Gaffer
was
no
more

and
did
I
say
bold
to

two
Governors

No

"
<EOS>
"
And
so
far
as
I
know
,
"
concluded
Mr.
Riderhood
,
by
way
of
proof
and
evidence
to
character
,
"
I
have
actiwally
forfeited
the
good
opinions
of
several
persons

even
your
own
,
Captain

if
I
understand
your
words

I
'd
sooner
do

be
forswore

There

call
me
conspirator

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
sign
,
"
said
the
visitor
,
taking
very
little
heed
of
this
oration
,
"
a
statement
that
it
was
all
utterly
false
,
and
the
poor
girl
shall
have
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
bring
it
with
me
for
your
signature
,
when
I
come
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
might
you
be
expected
,
Captain
?
"
inquired
Riderhood
,
again
dubiously
getting
between
him
and
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
soon
enough
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
disappoint
you
;
do
n't
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Might
you
be
inclined
to
leave
any
name
,
Captain
?
"
  
"
No
,
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
such
intention
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
`
`
Shall
"
"
is
summ'at
of
a
hard
word
,
Captain
,
"
urged
Riderhood
,
still
feebly
dodging
between
him
and
the
door
,
as
he
advanced
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
say
a
man
`
`
shall
"
"
sign
this
and
that
and
t'other
,
Captain
,
you
order
him
about
in
a
grand
sort
of
a
way
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
it
seem
so
to
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
stood
still
,
and
angrily
fixed
him
with
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
father
!
<EOS>
"
entreated
Pleasant
,
from
the
door
,
with
her
disengaged
hand
nervously
trembling
at
her
lips
;
"
do
n't
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
get
into
trouble
any
more
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
out
,
Captain
,
hear
me
out
!
<EOS>
All
I
was
wishing
to
mention
,
Captain
,
afore
you
took
your
departer
,
"
said
the
sneaking
Mr.
Riderhood
,
falling
out
of
his
path
,
"
was
,
your
handsome
words
relating
to
the
reward
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
claim
it
,
"
said
the
man
,
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
leave
some
such
words
as
"
you
dog
,
"
very
distincly
understood
,
"
you
shall
share
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Looking
stedfastly
at
Riderhood
,
he
once
more
said
in
a
low
voice
,
this
time
with
a
grim
sort
of
admiration
of
him
as
a
perfect
piece
of
evil
,
"
What
a
liar
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
and
,
nodding
his
head
twice
or
thrice
over
the
compliment
,
passed
out
of
the
shop
.
<EOS>
But
,
to
Pleasant
he
said
good
-
night
kindly
.
  
<EOS>
The
honest
man
who
gained
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
remained
in
a
state
akin
to
stupefaction
,
until
the
footless
glass
and
the
unfinished
bottle
conveyed
themselves
into
his
mind
.
<EOS>
From
his
mind
he
conveyed
them
into
his
hands
,
and
so
conveyed
the
last
of
the
wine
into
his
stomach
.
<EOS>
When
that
was
done
,
he
awoke
to
a
clear
perception
that
Poll
Parroting
was
solely
chargeable
with
what
had
passed
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
not
to
be
remiss
in
his
duty
as
a
father
,
he
threw
a
pair
of
sea
-
boots
at
Pleasant
,
which
she
ducked
to
avoid
,
and
then
cried
,
poor
thing
,
using
her
hair
for
a
pocket
-
handkerchief
.
   
<EOS>
A
SOLO
AND
<EOS>
A
DUETT
.
 
<EOS>
The
wind
was
blowing
so
hard
when
the
visitor
came
out
at
the
shop
-
door
into
the
darkness
and
dirt
of
Limehouse
Hole
,
that
it
almost
blew
him
in
again
.
<EOS>
Doors
were
slamming
violently
,
lamps
were
flickering
or
blown
out
,
signs
were
rocking
in
their
frames
,
the
water
of
the
kennels
,
wind
-
dispersed
,
flew
about
in
drops
like
rain
.
<EOS>
Indifferent
to
the
weather
,
and
even
preferring
it
to
better
weather
for
its
clearance
of
the
streets
,
the
man
looked
about
him
with
a
scrutinizing
glance
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
much
I
know
,
"
he
murmured
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
been
here
since
that
night
,
and
never
was
here
before
that
night
,
but
thus
much
I
recognize
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
which
way
did
we
take
when
we
came
out
of
that
shop
.
<EOS>
We
turned
to
the
right
as
I
have
turned
,
but
I
can
recall
no
more
.
<EOS>
Did
we
go
by
this
alley
?
<EOS>
Or
down
that
little
lane
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
tried
both
,
but
both
confused
him
equally
,
and
he
came
straying
back
to
the
same
spot
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
there
were
poles
pushed
out
of
upper
windows
on
which
clothes
were
drying
,
and
I
remember
a
low
public
-
house
,
and
the
sound
flowing
down
a
narrow
passage
belonging
to
it
of
the
scraping
of
a
fiddle
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
.
<EOS>
But
here
are
all
these
things
in
the
lane
,
and
here
are
all
these
things
in
the
alley
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
nothing
else
in
my
mind
but
a
wall
,
a
dark
doorway
,
a
flight
of
stairs
,
and
a
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
tried
a
new
direction
,
but
made
nothing
of
it
;
walls
,
dark
doorways
,
flights
of
stairs
and
rooms
,
were
too
abundant
.
<EOS>
And
,
like
most
people
so
puzzled
,
he
again
and
again
described
a
circle
,
and
found
himself
at
the
point
from
which
he
had
begun
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
like
what
I
have
read
in
narratives
of
escape
from
prison
,
"
said
he
,
"
where
the
little
track
of
the
fugitives
in
the
night
always
seems
to
take
the
shape
of
the
great
round
world
,
on
which
they
wander
;
as
if
it
were
a
secret
law
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
he
ceased
to
be
the
oakum
-
headed
,
oakum
-
whiskered
man
on
whom
Miss
Pleasant
Riderhood
had
looked
,
and
,
allowing
for
his
being
still
wrapped
in
a
nautical
overcoat
,
became
as
like
that
same
lost
wanted
<EOS>
Mr.
Julius
Handford
,
as
never
man
was
like
another
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
In
the
breast
of
the
coat
he
stowed
the
bristling
hair
and
whisker
,
in
a
moment
,
as
the
favoring
wind
went
with
him
down
a
solitary
place
that
it
had
swept
clear
of
passengers
.
<EOS>
Yet
in
that
same
moment
he
was
the
Secretary
also
,
Mr.
Boffin
's
Secretary
.
<EOS>
For
John
Rokesmith
,
too
,
was
as
like
that
same
lost
wanted
Mr.
Julius
Handford
as
never
man
was
like
another
in
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
clue
to
the
scene
of
my
death
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Not
that
it
matters
now
.
<EOS>
But
having
risked
discovery
by
venturing
here
at
all
,
I
should
have
been
glad
to
track
some
part
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
With
which
singular
words
he
abandoned
his
search
,
came
up
out
of
Limehouse
Hole
,
and
took
the
way
past
Limehouse
Church
.
<EOS>
At
the
great
iron
gate
of
the
churchyard
he
stopped
and
looked
in
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
at
the
high
tower
spectrally
resisting
the
wind
,
and
he
looked
round
at
the
white
tombstones
,
like
enough
to
the
dead
in
their
winding
-
sheets
,
and
he
counted
the
nine
tolls
of
the
clock
-
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
sensation
not
experienced
by
many
mortals
,
"
said
he
,
"
to
be
looking
into
a
churchyard
on
a
wild
windy
night
,
and
to
feel
that
I
no
more
hold
a
place
among
the
living
than
these
dead
do
,
and
even
to
know
that
I
lie
buried
somewhere
else
,
as
they
lie
buried
here
.
<EOS>
Nothing
uses
me
to
it
.
<EOS>
A
spirit
that
was
once
a
man
could
hardly
feel
stranger
or
lonelier
,
going
unrecognized
among
mankind
,
than
I
feel
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
the
fanciful
side
of
the
situation
.
<EOS>
It
has
a
real
side
,
so
difficult
that
,
though
I
think
of
it
every
day
,
I
never
thoroughly
think
it
out
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
me
determine
to
think
it
out
as
I
walk
home
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
evade
it
,
as
many
men
---
perhaps
most
men
---
do
evade
thinking
their
way
through
their
greatest
perplexity
.
<EOS>
I
will
try
to
pin
myself
to
mine
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
evade
it
,
John
Harmon
;
do
n't
evade
it
;
 
think
it
out
!

"
When
I
came
back
to
England
,
attracted
to
the
country
with
which
I
had
none
but
<EOS>
most
miserable
associations
,
by
the
accounts
of
my
fine
inheritance
that
found
me
abroad
,
I
came
back
,
shrinking
from
my
father
's
money
,
shrinking
from
my
father
's
memory
,
mistrustful
of
being
forced
on
a
mercenary
wife
,
mistrustful
of
my
father
's
intention
in
thrusting
that
marriage
on
me
,
mistrustful
that
I
was
already
growing
avaricious
,
mistrustful
that
I
was
slackening
in
gratitude
to
the
two
dear
noble
honest
friends
who
had
made
the
only
sunlight
in
my
childish
life
or
that
of
my
heartbroken
sister
.
<EOS>
I
came
back
,
timid
,
divided
in
my
mind
,
afraid
of
myself
and
everybody
here
,
knowing
of
nothing
but
wretchedness
that
my
father
's
wealth
had
ever
brought
about
.
<EOS>
Now
,
stop
,
and
so
far
think
it
out
,
John
Harmon
.
<EOS>
Is
that
so
?
<EOS>
That
is
exactly
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
board
serving
as
third
mate
was
George
Radfoot
.
<EOS>
I
knew
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
His
name
first
became
known
to
me
about
a
week
before
we
sailed
,
through
my
being
accosted
by
one
of
the
ship
-
agent
's
clerks
as
`
`
Mr
.
Radfoot
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
was
one
day
when
I
had
gone
aboard
to
look
to
my
preparations
,
and
the
clerk
,
coming
behind
me
as
I
stood
on
deck
,
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said
,
`
`
<EOS>
Mr
.
Radfoot
;
look
here
,
"
"
 
referring
to
some
papers
that
he
had
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
And
my
name
first
became
known
to
Radfoot
,
through
another
clerk
within
a
day
or
two
,
and
while
the
ship
was
yet
in
port
,
coming
up
behind
him
,
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
and
beginning
,
`
`
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Harmon
---
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
believe
we
were
alike
in
bulk
and
stature
but
not
otherwise
,
and
that
we
were
not
strikingly
alike
,
even
in
those
respects
,
when
we
were
together
and
could
be
compared
.
  
<EOS>
"
However
,
a
sociable
word
or
two
on
these
mistakes
became
an
easy
introduction
between
us
,
and
the
weather
was
hot
,
and
he
helped
me
to
a
cool
cabin
on
deck
alongside
his
own
,
and
his
first
school
had
been
at
Brussels
as
mine
had
been
,
and
he
had
learnt
French
as
I
had
learnt
it
,
and
he
had
a
little
history
of
himself
to
relate
<EOS>
---
God
only
knows
how
much
of
it
true
,
and
how
much
of
it
false
---
that
had
its
likeness
to
mine
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
a
seaman
too
.
<EOS>
So
we
got
to
be
confidential
together
,
and
the
more
easily
yet
,
because
he
and
every
one
on
board
had
known
by
general
rumour
what
I
was
making
the
voyage
to
England
for
.
<EOS>
By
such
degrees
and
means
,
he
came
to
the
knowledge
of
my
uneasiness
of
mind
,
and
of
its
setting
at
that
time
in
the
direction
of
desiring
to
see
and
form
some
judgment
of
my
alloted
wife
,
before
she
could
possibly
know
me
for
myself
;
also
to
try
Mrs.
Boffin
and
give
her
a
glad
surprise
.
<EOS>
So
the
plot
was
made
out
of
our
getting
common
sailors
'
dresses
(
as
he
was
able
to
guide
me
about
London
)
,
and
throwing
ourselves
in
Bella
Wilfer
's
neighbourhood
,
and
trying
to
put
ourselves
in
her
way
,
and
doing
whatever
chance
might
favour
on
the
spot
,
and
seeing
what
came
of
it
.
<EOS>
If
nothing
came
of
it
,
I
should
be
no
worse
off
,
and
there
would
merely
be
a
short
delay
in
my
presenting
myself
to
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
I
have
all
these
facts
right
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
They
are
all
accurately
right
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
advantage
in
all
this
was
,
that
for
a
time
I
was
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
for
a
day
or
for
two
days
,
but
I
must
be
lost
sight
of
on
landing
,
or
there
would
be
recognition
,
anticipation
,
and
failure
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
I
disembarked
with
my
valise
in
my
hand
---
as
Potterson
the
steward
and
Mr.
Jacob
Kibble
<EOS>
my
fellow
-
passenger
afterwards
remembered
---
and
waited
for
him
in
the
dark
by
that
very
Limehouse
Church
which
is
now
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
had
always
shunned
the
port
of
London
,
I
only
knew
the
church
through
his
pointing
out
its
spire
from
on
board
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
might
recall
,
if
it
were
any
good
to
try
,
the
way
by
which
I
went
to
it
alone
from
the
river
;
but
how
we
two
went
from
it
to
Riderhood
's
shop
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
---
<EOS>
any
more
than
I
know
what
turns
we
took
and
doubles
we
made
,
after
we
left
it
.
<EOS>
The
way
was
purposely
confused
,
no
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
let
me
go
on
thinking
the
facts
out
,
and
avoid
confusing
them
with
my
speculations
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
took
me
by
a
straight
way
or
a
crooked
way
,
what
is
that
to
the
purpose
now
?
<EOS>
Steady
,
John
Harmon
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
we
stopped
at
Riderhood
's
,
and
he
asked
that
scoundrel
a
question
or
two
,
purporting
to
refer
only
to
the
lodging
-
houses
in
which
there
was
accommodation
for
us
,
had
I
the
least
suspicion
of
him
?
<EOS>
None
.
<EOS>
Certainly
none
until
afterwards
when
I
held
the
clue
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
must
have
got
from
Riderhood
in
a
paper
,
the
drug
,
or
whatever
it
was
,
that
afterwards
stupefied
me
,
but
I
am
far
from
sure
.
<EOS>
All
I
felt
safe
in
charging
on
him
to
-
night
,
was
old
companionship
in
villainy
between
them
.
<EOS>
Their
undisguised
intimacy
,
and
the
character
I
now
know
Riderhood
to
bear
,
made
that
not
at
all
adventurous
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
clear
about
the
drug
.
<EOS>
Thinking
out
the
circumstances
on
which
I
found
my
suspicion
,
they
are
only
two
.
<EOS>
One
<EOS>
:
I
remember
his
changing
a
small
folded
paper
from
one
pocket
to
another
,
after
we
came
out
,
which
he
had
not
touched
before
.
<EOS>
Two
:
I
now
know
Riderhood
to
have
been
previously
taken
up
for
being
concerned
in
the
robbery
of
an
unlucky
seaman
,
to
whom
some
such
poison
had
been
given
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
conviction
that
we
can
not
have
gone
a
mile
from
that
shop
,
before
we
came
to
the
wall
,
the
dark
doorway
,
the
flight
of
stairs
,
and
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
particularly
dark
and
it
rained
hard
.
<EOS>
As
I
think
the
circumstances
back
,
I
hear
the
rain
splashing
on
the
stone
pavement
of
the
passage
,
which
was
not
under
cover
.
<EOS>
The
room
overlooked
the
river
,
or
a
dock
,
or
a
creek
,
and
the
tide
was
out
.
<EOS>
Being
possessed
of
the
time
down
to
that
point
,
I
know
by
the
hour
that
it
must
have
been
about
low
water
;
but
while
the
coffee
was
getting
ready
,
I
drew
back
the
curtain
(
a
dark
-
brown
curtain
)
,
and
,
looking
out
,
knew
by
the
kind
of
reflection
below
,
of
the
few
neighbouring
lights
,
that
they
were
reflected
in
tidal
mud
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
had
carried
under
his
arm
a
canvas
bag
,
containing
a
suit
of
his
clothes
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
change
of
outer
clothes
with
me
,
as
I
was
to
buy
slops
.
<EOS>
`
`
You
are
very
wet
,
Mr.
Harmon
,
"
"
<EOS>
---
I
can
hear
him
saying
---
`
`
and
I
am
quite
dry
under
this
good
waterproof
coat
.
<EOS>
Put
on
these
clothes
of
mine
.
<EOS>
You
may
find
on
trying
them
that
they
will
answer
your
purpose
to
-
morrow
,
as
well
as
the
slops
you
mean
to
buy
,
or
better
.
<EOS>
While
you
change
,
I
'll
hurry
the
hot
coffee
.
"
<EOS>
"
When
he
came
back
,
I
had
his
clothes
on
,
and
there
was
a
black
man
with
him
,
wearing
a
linen
jacket
,
like
a
steward
,
who
put
the
smoking
coffee
on
the
table
in
a
tray
and
never
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
far
literal
and
exact
?
<EOS>
Literal
and
exact
,
I
am
certain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
pass
to
sick
and
deranged
impressions
;
they
are
so
strong
,
that
I
rely
upon
them
;
but
there
are
spaces
between
them
that
I
know
nothing
about
,
and
they
are
not
pervaded
by
any
idea
of
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
drank
some
coffee
,
when
to
my
sense
of
sight
he
began
to
swell
immensely
,
and
something
urged
me
to
rush
at
him
.
<EOS>
We
had
a
struggle
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
got
from
me
,
through
my
not
knowing
where
to
strike
,
in
the
whirling
round
of
the
room
,
and
the
flashing
of
flames
of
fire
between
us
.
<EOS>
I
dropped
down
.
<EOS>
Lying
helpless
on
the
ground
,
I
was
turned
over
by
a
foot
.
<EOS>
I
was
dragged
by
the
neck
into
a
corner
.
<EOS>
I
heard
men
speak
together
.
<EOS>
I
was
turned
over
by
other
feet
.
<EOS>
I
saw
a
figure
like
myself
lying
dressed
in
my
clothes
on
a
bed
.
<EOS>
What
might
have
been
,
for
anything
I
knew
,
a
silence
of
days
,
weeks
,
months
,
years
,
was
broken
by
a
violent
wrestling
of
men
all
over
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
figure
like
myself
was
assailed
,
and
my
valise
was
in
its
hand
.
<EOS>
I
was
trodden
upon
and
fallen
over
.
<EOS>
I
heard
a
noise
of
blows
,
and
thought
it
was
a
wood
-
cutter
cutting
down
a
tree
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
said
that
my
name
was
John
Harmon
<EOS>
---
I
could
not
have
thought
it
---
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
it
 
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
when
I
heard
the
blows
,
I
thought
of
the
wood
-
cutter
and
his
axe
,
and
had
some
dead
idea
that
I
was
lying
in
a
forest
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
still
correct
?
<EOS>
Still
correct
,
with
the
exception
that
I
can
not
possibly
express
it
to
myself
without
using
the
word
I.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
I.
<EOS>
There
was
no
such
thing
as
I
,
within
my
knowledge
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
after
a
downward
slide
through
something
like
a
tube
,
and
then
a
great
noise
and
a
sparkling
and
crackling
as
of
fires
,
that
the
consciousness
came
upon
me
,
`
`
This
is
John
Harmon
drowning
!
<EOS>
John
Harmon
,
struggle
for
your
life
.
<EOS>
John
Harmon
,
call
on
Heaven
and
save
yourself
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
cried
it
out
aloud
in
a
great
agony
,
and
then
a
heavy
horrid
unintelligible
something
vanished
,
and
it
was
I
who
was
struggling
there
alone
in
the
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
very
weak
and
faint
,
frightfully
oppressed
with
drowsiness
,
and
driving
fast
with
the
tide
.
<EOS>
Looking
over
the
black
water
,
I
saw
the
lights
racing
past
me
on
the
two
banks
of
the
river
,
as
if
they
were
eager
to
be
gone
and
leave
me
dying
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
The
tide
was
running
down
,
but
I
knew
nothing
of
up
or
down
then
.
<EOS>
When
,
guiding
myself
safely
with
Heaven
's
assistance
before
the
fierce
set
of
the
water
,
I
at
last
caught
at
a
boat
moored
,
one
of
a
tier
of
boats
at
a
causeway
,
I
was
sucked
under
her
,
and
came
up
,
only
just
alive
,
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
I
long
in
the
water
?
<EOS>
Long
enough
to
be
chilled
to
the
heart
,
but
I
do
n't
know
how
long
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
cold
was
merciful
,
for
it
was
the
cold
night
air
and
the
rain
that
restored
me
from
a
swoon
on
the
stones
of
the
causeway
.
<EOS>
They
naturally
supposed
me
to
have
toppled
in
,
drunk
,
when
I
crept
to
the
public
-
house
it
belonged
to
;
for
I
had
no
notion
where
I
was
,
and
could
not
articulate
---
through
the
poison
that
had
made
me
insensible
having
affected
my
speech
---
and
I
supposed
the
night
to
be
the
previous
night
,
as
it
was
still
dark
and
raining
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
lost
twenty
-
four
hours
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
checked
the
calculation
often
,
and
it
must
have
been
two
nights
that
I
lay
recovering
in
that
public
-
house
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
was
while
I
lay
in
that
bed
there
,
that
the
thought
entered
my
head
of
turning
the
danger
I
had
passed
through
,
to
the
account
of
being
for
some
time
supposed
to
have
disappeared
mysteriously
,
and
of
proving
Bella
.
<EOS>
The
dread
of
our
being
forced
on
one
another
,
and
perpetuating
the
fate
that
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
my
father
's
riches
---
the
fate
that
they
should
lead
to
nothing
but
evil
---
was
strong
upon
the
moral
timidity
that
dates
from
my
childhood
with
my
poor
sister
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
this
hour
I
can
not
understand
that
side
of
the
river
where
I
recovered
the
shore
,
being
the
opposite
side
to
that
on
which
I
was
ensnared
,
I
shall
never
understand
it
now
.
<EOS>
Even
at
this
moment
,
while
I
leave
the
river
behind
me
,
going
home
,
I
can
not
conceive
that
it
rolls
between
me
and
that
spot
,
or
that
the
sea
is
where
it
is
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
thinking
it
out
;
this
is
making
a
leap
to
the
present
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
have
done
it
,
but
for
the
fortune
in
the
waterproof
belt
round
my
body
.
<EOS>
Not
a
great
fortune
,
forty
and
odd
pounds
for
the
inheritor
of
a
hundred
and
odd
thousand
!
<EOS>
But
it
was
enough
.
<EOS>
Without
it
I
must
have
disclosed
myself
.
<EOS>
Without
it
,
I
could
never
have
gone
to
that
Exchequer
Coffee
House
,
or
taken
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
lodgings
.
  
<EOS>
"
Some
twelve
days
I
lived
at
that
hotel
,
before
the
night
when
I
saw
the
corpse
of
Radfoot
at
the
Police
Station
.
<EOS>
The
inexpressible
mental
horror
that
I
laboured
under
,
as
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
poison
,
makes
the
interval
seem
greatly
longer
,
but
I
know
it
can
not
have
been
longer
.
<EOS>
That
suffering
has
gradually
weakened
and
weakened
since
,
and
has
only
come
upon
me
by
starts
,
and
I
hope
I
am
free
from
it
now
;
but
even
now
,
I
have
sometimes
to
think
,
constrain
myself
,
and
stop
before
speaking
,
or
I
could
not
say
the
words
I
want
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
Again
I
ramble
away
from
thinking
it
out
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
so
far
to
the
end
that
I
need
be
tempted
to
break
off
.
<EOS>
Now
,
on
straight
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
examined
the
newspapers
every
day
for
tidings
that
I
was
missing
,
but
saw
none
.
<EOS>
Going
out
that
night
to
walk
(
for
I
kept
retired
while
it
was
light
)
,
I
found
a
crowd
assembled
round
a
placard
posted
at
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
It
described
myself
,
John
Harmon
,
as
found
dead
and
mutilated
in
the
river
under
circumstances
of
strong
suspicion
,
described
my
dress
,
described
the
papers
in
my
pockets
,
and
stated
where
I
was
lying
for
recognition
.
<EOS>
In
a
wild
incautious
way
I
hurried
there
,
and
there
---
with
the
horror
of
the
death
I
had
escaped
,
before
my
eyes
in
its
most
appalling
shape
,
added
to
the
inconceivable
horror
tormenting
me
at
that
time
when
the
poisonous
stuff
was
strongest
on
me
---
I
perceived
that
Radfoot
had
been
murdered
by
some
unknown
hands
for
the
money
for
which
he
would
have
murdered
me
,
and
that
probably
we
had
both
been
shot
into
the
river
from
the
same
dark
place
into
the
same
dark
tide
,
when
the
stream
ran
deep
and
strong
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
night
I
almost
gave
up
my
mystery
,
though
I
suspected
no
one
,
could
offer
no
information
,
knew
absolutely
nothing
save
that
the
murdered
man
was
not
I
,
but
Radfoot
.
<EOS>
Next
day
while
I
hesitated
,
and
next
day
while
I
hesitated
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
country
were
determined
to
have
me
dead
.
<EOS>
The
Inquest
declared
me
dead
,
the
Government
proclaimed
me
dead
;
I
could
not
listen
at
my
fireside
for
five
minutes
to
the
outer
noises
,
but
it
was
borne
into
my
ears
that
I
was
dead
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
John
Harmon
died
,
and
Julius
Handford
disappeared
,
and
John
Rokesmith
was
born
.
<EOS>
John
Rokesmith
's
intent
to
-
night
has
been
to
repair
a
wrong
that
he
could
never
have
imagined
possible
,
coming
to
his
ears
through
the
Lightwood
talk
related
to
him
,
and
which
he
is
bound
by
every
consideration
to
remedy
.
<EOS>
In
that
intent
John
Rokesmith
will
persevere
,
as
his
duty
is

Now
,
is
it
all
thought
out

All
to
this
time
?
<EOS>
Nothing
omitted

<EOS>
No

nothing

<EOS>
But
beyond
this
time
?
<EOS>
To
think
it
out
through
the
future

is
a
harder
though
a
much
shorter
task

to
think
it
out
through

is
dead

come

<EOS>
If
no

why
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
<EOS>
yes
,
first
.
<EOS>
To
enlighten
human
Justice
concerning
the
offence
of
one
far
beyond
it
who
may
have
a
living
mother
.
<EOS>
To
enlighten
it
with
the
lights
of
a
stone
passage
,
a
flight
of
stairs
,
a
brown
window
-
curtain
,
and
a
black
man
.
<EOS>
To
come
into
possession
of
my
father
's
money
,
and
with
it
sordidly
to
buy
a
beautiful
creature
whom
I
love
---
I
can
not
help
it
;
reason
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
;
I
love
her
against
reason

but
who
would
as
soon
love
me
for
my
own
sake
,
as
she
would
love
the
beggar
at
the
corner
.
<EOS>
What
a
use
for
the
money
,
and
how
worthy
of
its
old
misuses
!
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
take
no
.
<EOS>
The
reasons
why
John
Harmon
should
not
come
to
life
.
<EOS>
Because
he
has
passively
allowed
these
dear
old
faithful
friends
to
pass
into
possession
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
Because
he
sees
them
happy
with
it
,
making
a
good
use
of
it
,
effacing
the
old
rust
and
tarnish
on
the
money
.
<EOS>
Because
they
have
virtually
adopted
Bella
,
and
will
provide
for
her
.
<EOS>
Because
there
is
affection
enough
in
her
nature
,
and
warmth
enough
in
her
heart
,
to
develop
into
something
enduringly
good
,
under
favorable
conditions
.
<EOS>
Because
her
faults
have
been
intensified
by
her
place
in
my
father
's
will
,
and
she
is
already
growing
better
.
<EOS>
Because
her
marriage
with
John
Harmon
,
after
what
I
have
heard
from
her
own
lips
,
would
be
a
shocking
mockery
,
of
which
both
she
and
I
must
always
be
conscious
,
and
which
would
degrade
her
in
her
mind
,
and
me
in
mine
,
and
each
of
us
in
the
other
's
.
<EOS>
Because
if
John
Harmon
comes
to
life
and
does
not
marry
her
,

What
would
I
have
?
<EOS>
Dead
,
I
have
found
the
true
friends
of
my
lifetime
still
as
true
as
tender
and
as
faithful
as
when
I
was
alive
,
and
making
my
memory
an
incentive
to
good
actions
done
in
my
name
.
<EOS>
Dead
,
I
have
found
them
when
they
might
have
slighted
my
name
,
and
passed
greedily
over
my
grave
to
ease
and
wealth
,
lingering
by
the
way
,
like
single
-
hearted
children
,
to
recall
their
love
for
me
when
I
was
a
poor
frightened
child
.
<EOS>
Dead
,
I
have
heard
from
the
woman
who
would
have
been
my
wife
if
I
had
lived
,
the
revolting
truth
that
I
should
have
purchased
her
,
caring
nothing
for
me
,
as
a
Sultan
buys
a
slave
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
I
have
?
<EOS>
If
the
dead
could
know
,
or
do
know
,
how
the
living
use
them
,
who
among
the
hosts
of
dead
has
found
a
more
disinterested
fidelity
on
earth
than
I
?
<EOS>
Is
not
that
enough
for
me
?
<EOS>
If
I
had
come
back
,
these
noble
creatures
would
have
welcomed
me
,
wept
over
me
,
<EOS>
given
up
everything
to
me
with
joy
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
come
back
,
and
they
have
passed
unspoiled
into
my
place
.
<EOS>
Let
them
rest
in
it
,
and
let
Bella
rest
in
hers
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
course
for
me
then
?
<EOS>
This
.
<EOS>
To
live
the
same
quiet
Secretary
life
,
carefully
avoiding
chances
of
recognition
,
until
they
shall
have
become
more
accustomed
to
their
altered
state
,
and
until
the
great
swarm
of
swindlers
under
many
names
shall
have
found
newer
prey
.
<EOS>
By
that
time
,
the
method
I
am
establishing
through
all
the
affairs
,
and
with
which
I
will
every
day
take
new
pains
to
make
them
both
familiar
,
will
be
,
I
may
hope
,
a
machine
in
such
working
order
as
that
they
can
keep
it
going
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
need
but
ask
of
their
generosity
,
to
have
.
<EOS>
When
the
right
time
comes
,
I
will
ask
no
more
than
will
replace
me
in
my
former
path
of
life
,
and
John
Rokesmith
shall
tread
it
as
contentedly
as
he
may
.
<EOS>
But
John
Harmon
shall
come
back
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
may
never
,
in
the
days
to
come
afar
off
,
have
any
weak
misgiving
that
Bella
might
,
in
any
contingency
,
have
taken
me
for
my
own
sake
if
I
had
plainly
asked
her
,
I
will
plainly
ask
her
:
proving
beyond
all
question
what
I
already
know
too
well
.
<EOS>
And
now
it
is
all
thought
out
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
,
and
my
mind
is
easier
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
deeply
engaged
had
the
living
-
dead
man
been
,
in
thus
communing
with
himself
,
that
he
had
regarded
neither
the
wind
nor
the
way
,
and
had
resisted
the
former
as
instinctively
as
he
had
pursued
the
latter
.
<EOS>
But
being
now
come
into
the
City
,
where
there
was
a
coach
-
stand
,
he
stood
irresolute
whether
to
go
to
his
lodgings
,
or
to
go
first
to
Mr.
Boffin
's
house
.
<EOS>
He
decided
to
go
round
by
the
house
,
arguing
,
as
he
carried
his
overcoat
upon
his
arm
,
that
it
was
less
likely
to
attract
notice
if
left
there
,
than
if
taken
to
Holloway
:
both
Mrs.
Wilfer
and
Miss
Lavinia
being
ravenously
curious
touching
every
article
of
which
the
lodger
stood
possessed
.
  
<EOS>
Arriving
at
the
house
,
he
found
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
were
out
,
but
that
Miss
Wilfer
was
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Miss
Wilfer
had
remained
at
home
,
in
consequence
of
not
feeling
very
well
,
and
had
inquired
in
the
evening
if
Mr.
Rokesmith
were
in
his
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Make
my
compliments
to
Miss
Wilfer
,
and
say
I
am
here
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wilfer
's
compliments
came
down
in
return
,
and
,
if
it
were
not
too
much
trouble
,
would
Mr.
Rokesmith
be
so
kind
as
to
come
up
before
he
went
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
too
much
trouble
,
and
Mr.
Rokesmith
came
up
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
she
looked
very
pretty
,
she
looked
very
,
very
pretty
!
<EOS>
If
the
father
of
the
late
John
Harmon
had
but
left
his
money
unconditionally
to
his
son
,
and
if
his
son
had
but
lighted
on
this
loveable
girl
for
himself
,
and
had
the
happiness
to
make
her
loving
as
well
as
loveable
!
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
Are
you
not
well
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
quite
well
.
<EOS>
I
was
sorry
to
hear
,
when
I
came
in
,
that
you
were
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
mere
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
headache
---
gone
now
---
and
was
not
quite
fit
for
a
hot
theatre
,
so
I
stayed
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
asked
you
if
you
were
not
well
,
because
you
look
so
white
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
?
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
busy
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
on
a
low
ottoman
before
the
fire
,
with
a
little
shining
jewel
of
a
table
,
and
her
book
and
her
work
,
beside
her
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
a
different
life
the
late
John
Harmon
's
,
if
it
had
been
his
happy
privilege
to
take
his
place
upon
that
ottoman
,
and
draw
his
arm
about
that
waist
,
and
say
,
"
I
hope
the
time
has
been
long
without
me
?
<EOS>
What
a
Home
Goddess
you
look
,
my
darling
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
present
John
Rokesmith
,
far
removed
from
the
late
John
Harmon
,
remained
standing
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
A
little
distance
in
respect
of
space
,
but
a
great
distance
in
respect
of
separation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Bella
,
taking
up
her
work
,
and
inspecting
it
all
round
the
corners
,
"
I
wanted
to
say
something
to
you
when
I
could
have
the
opportunity
,
as
an
explanation
why
I
was
rude
to
you
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
right
to
think
ill
of
me
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
sharp
little
way
in
which
she
darted
a
look
at
him
,
half
sensitively
injured
,
and
half
pettishly
,
would
have
been
very
much
admired
by
the
late
John
Harmon
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
how
well
I
think
of
you
,
Miss
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
you
must
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
me
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
when
you
believe
that
in
prosperity
I
neglect
and
forget
my
old
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
believe
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
,
sir
,
at
any
rate
,
"
returned
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
the
liberty
of
reminding
you
of
a
little
omission
into
which
you
had
fallen
---
insensibly
and
naturally
fallen
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
more
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
beg
leave
to
ask
you
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
why
you
took
that
liberty
?
<EOS>

I
hope
there
is
no
offence
in
the
phrase
;
it
is
your
own

remember

<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
truly
,
deeply
,
profoundly
interested
in
you

Miss

<EOS>
Because
I
wish
to
see
you
always
at
your

Because
I

shall
I
go
on
?
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
No

Sir
,

returned
Bella
,
with
a
burning
face
,
"
you
have
said
more
than
enough
.
<EOS>
I
beg
that
you
will
not
go
on
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
generosity
,
any
honor
,
you
will
say
no
more

"
  
<EOS>
The
late
John
Harmon
,
looking
at
the
proud
face
with
the
downcast
eyes
,
and
at
the
quick
breathing
as
it
stirred
the
fall
of
bright
brown
hair
over
the
beautiful
neck
,
would
probably
have
remained
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
speak
to
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
once
for
all
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
sat
here
all
this
evening
,
wishing
to
speak
to
you
,
and
determining
to
speak
to
you
,
and
feeling
that
I
must

<EOS>
I
beg
for
a
moment
's
time

"
  
<EOS>
He
remained
silent
,
and
she
remained
with
her
face
averted
,
sometimes
making
a
slight
movement
as
if
she
would
turn
and
speak
.
<EOS>
At
length
she
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
I
am
situated
here
,
sir
,
and
you
know
how
I
am
situated
at
home

<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
you
for
myself
,
since
there
is
no
one
about
me
whom
I
could
ask
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
generous
in
you
,
it
is
not
honorable
in
you
,
to
conduct
yourself
towards
me
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
ungenerous
or
dishonorable
to
be
devoted
to
you
;
fascinated
by
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Preposterous
!
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
The
late
John
Harmon
might
have
thought
it
rather
a
contemptuous
and
lofty
word
of
repudiation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
feel
obliged
to
go
on
,
"
pursued
the
Secretary
,
"
though
it
were
only
in
self
-
explanation
and
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Miss
Wilfer
,
that
it
is
not
unpardonable
---
even
in
me
---
to
make
an
honest
declaration
of
an
honest
devotion
to
you

"
  
<EOS>
"
An
honest
declaration
!

<EOS>
repeated
Bella
,
with
emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
otherwise
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
request
,
sir

"
said
Bella
,
taking
refuge
in
a
touch
of
timely
resentment
,
"
that
I
may
not
be
questioned

<EOS>
You
must
excuse
me
if
I
decline
to
be
cross
-
examined

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Miss
Wilfer
,
this
is
hardly
charitable
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
your
own
emphasis
suggests
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
waive
even
that
question
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
have
declared
,
I
take
my
stand
by
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
recall
the
avowal
of
my
earnest
and
deep
attachment
to
you
,
and
I
do
not
recall
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
reject
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
blind
and
deaf
if
I
were
not
prepared
for
the
reply

<EOS>
Forgive
my
offence
,
for
it
carries
its
punishment
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
punishment
?
"
asked
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
my
present
endurance
none
?
<EOS>
But
excuse
me
;
I
did
not
mean
to
cross
-
examine
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
take
advantage
of
a
hasty
word
of
mine
,
"
said
Bella
with
a
little
sting
of
self
-
reproach
,
"
to
make
me
seem
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
know
what
.
<EOS>
I
spoke
without
consideration
when
I
used
it
.
<EOS>
If
that
was
bad
,
I
am
sorry
;
but
you
repeat
it
after
consideration
,
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
at
least
no
better
.
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
I
beg
it
may
be
understood
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
that
there
is
an
end

this

now

Now

repeated

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

I
appeal
to
you

proceeded
Bella
with
increasing
spirit
,
"
not
to
pursue
me

<EOS>
I
appeal
to
you
not
to
take
advantage
of
your
position
in
this
house

make
my
position
in
it
distressing

disagreeable

I
appeal
to
you
to
discontinue
your
habit

making
your
misplaced
attentions

plain
to
Mrs.
Boffin

to
me

<EOS>
"
Have
I
done
so
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
you
have

Bella

In

have
not

I
hope

are
wrong

should
be
very
sorry

have
justified
it

I
think
I
have
not

For

no
apprehension

all
over

<EOS>
"
I
am
much
relieved
to
hear
it
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
far
other
views
in
life

why
should
you
waste
your
own
?

"
  
<EOS>
"
Mine

said
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
My
life

<EOS>
His
curious
tone
caused
Bella
to
glance
at
the
curious
smile
with
which
he
said
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
gone
as
he
glanced
back
.
"
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
Miss
Wilfer

he
proceeded
,
when
their
eyes
met
;
"
you
have
used
some
hard
words

for
which
I
do
not
doubt
you
have
a
justification
in
your
mind

that
I
do
not
understand

Ungenerous

dishonorable

In
what
?

<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
be
asked

Bella

haughtily
looking
down

I
would
rather
not
ask
,

the
question

imposed

Kindly
explain

not
kindly

justly

Oh

sir

said
Bella
,
raising
her
eyes
to
his
,
after
a
little
struggle
to
forbear
,
"
is
it
generous
and
honorable
to
use
the
power
here

your
favor
with

ability

Against

Is
it
generous
and
honorable
to
form
a
plan

gradually
bringing
their
influence

bear

have
shown
you

I
tell
you

reject

<EOS>
The
late
John
Harmon
could
have
borne
a
good
deal
,
but
he
would
have
been
cut
to
the
heart

such
a
suspicion

this

Would
it
be
generous
and
honorable
to
step
into
your
place
---
if
you
did
so
,
for
I
do
n't
know
that
you
did
,
and
I
hope
you
did
not
---
  
anticipating
,
or
knowing
beforehand
,
that
I
should
come
here
,
and
designing
to
take
me
at
this
disadvantage
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
This
mean
and
cruel
disadvantage
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
assented
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
kept
silence
for
a
little
while
;
then
merely
said
,
"
You
are
wholly
mistaken
,
Miss
Wilfer
;
wonderfully
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
however
,
that
it
is
your
fault
.
<EOS>
If
I
deserve
better
things
of
you
,
you
do
not
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Bella
,
with
her
old
indignation
rising
,
"
you
know
the
history
of
my
being
here
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
Mr.
Boffin
say
that
you
are
master
of
every
line
and
word
of
that
<EOS>
will
,
as
you
are
master
of
all
his
affairs
.
<EOS>
And
was
it
not
enough
that
I
should
have
been
willed
away
,
like
a
horse
,
or
a
dog
,
or
a
bird
;
but
must
you
too
begin
to
dispose
of
me
in
your
mind
,
and
speculate
in
me
,
as
soon
as
I
had
ceased
to
be
the
talk
and
the
laugh
of
the
town
?
<EOS>
Am
I
for
ever
to
be
made
the
property
of
strangers
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Believe
me
,
"
returned
the
Secretary
,
"
you
are
wonderfully
mistaken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
glad
to
know
it
,
"
answered
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
if
you
ever
will
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
shall
be
careful
to
conceal
any
traces
of
this
interview
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
as
long
as
I
remain
here
.
<EOS>
Trust
me
,
what
you
have
complained
of
is
at
an
end
for
ever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
I
have
spoken
,
then
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
painful
and
difficult
,
but
it
is
done
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
hurt
you
,
I
hope
you
will
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
inexperienced
and
impetuous
,
and
I
have
been
a
little
spoilt
;
but
I
really
am
not
so
bad
as
I
dare
say
I
appear
,
or
as
you
think
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
quitted
the
room
when
Bella
had
said
this
,
relenting
in
her
wilful
inconsistent
way
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
she
threw
herself
back
on
her
ottoman
,
and
said
,
"
I
did
n't
know
the
lovely
woman
was
such
a
Dragon
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
she
got
up
and
looked
in
the
glass
,
and
said
to
her
image
,
"
You
have
been
positively
swelling
your
features
,
you
little
fool
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
she
took
an
impatient
walk
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
back
,
and
said
,
"
I
wish
Pa
was
here
to
have
a
talk
about
an
avaricious
marriage
;
but
he
is
better
away
,
poor
dear
,
for
I
know
I
should
pull
his
hair
if
he
was
here
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
she
threw
her
work
away
,
and
threw
her
book
after
it
,
and
sat
down
and
hummed
a
tune
,
and
hummed
it
out
of
tune
,
and
quarrelled
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
John
Rokesmith
,
what
did
he
?
  
<EOS>
He
went
down
to
his
room
,
and
buried
John
Harmon
many
additional
fathoms
deep
.
<EOS>
He
took
his
hat
,
and
walked
out
,
and
,
as
he
went
to
Holloway
or
anywhere
else
---
not
at
all
minding
where
---
  
heaped
mounds
upon
mounds
of
earth
over
John
Harmon
's
grave
.
<EOS>
His
walking
did
not
bring
him
home
until
the
dawn
of
day
.
<EOS>
And
so
busy
had
he
been
all
night
,
piling
and
piling
weights
upon
weights
of
earth
above
John
Harmon
's
grave
,
that
by
that
time
John
Harmon
lay
buried
under
a
whole
Alpine
range
;
and
still
the
Sexton
Rokesmith
accumulated
mountains
over
him
,
lightening
his
labour
with
the
dirge
,
"
Cover
him
,
crush
him
,
keep
him
down
!
"
   
<EOS>
STRONG
OF
PURPOSE
.
 
<EOS>
The
sexton
-
task
of
piling
earth
above
John
Harmon
all
night
long
,
was
not
conducive
to
sound
sleep
;
but
Rokesmith
had
some
broken
morning
rest
,
and
rose
strengthened
in
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
over
now
.
<EOS>
No
ghost
should
trouble
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
's
peace
;
invisible
and
voiceless
,
the
ghost
should
look
on
for
a
little
while
longer
at
the
state
of
existence
out
of
which
it
had
departed
,
and
then
should
for
ever
cease
to
haunt
the
scenes
in
which
it
had
no
place
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
over
it
all
again
.
<EOS>
He
had
lapsed
into
the
condition
in
which
he
found
himself
,
as
many
a
man
lapses
into
many
a
condition
,
without
perceiving
the
accumulative
power
of
its
separate
circumstances
.
<EOS>
When
in
the
distrust
engendered
by
his
wretched
childhood
and
the
action
for
evil
---
never
yet
for
good
within
his
knowledge
then
---
  
of
his
father
and
his
father
's
wealth
on
all
within
their
influence
,
he
conceived
the
idea
of
his
first
deception
,
it
was
meant
to
be
harmless
,
it
was
to
last
but
<EOS>
a
few
hours
or
days
,
it
was
to
involve
in
it
only
the
girl
so
capriciously
forced
upon
him
,
and
upon
whom
he
was
so
capriciously
forced
,
and
it
was
honestly
meant
well
towards
her
.
<EOS>
For
,
if
he
had
found
her
unhappy
in
the
prospect
of
that
marriage
(
through
her
heart
inclining
to
another
man
or
for
any
other
cause
)
,
he
would
seriously
have
said
:
"
This
is
another
of
the
old
perverted
uses
of
the
misery
-
making
money
.
<EOS>
I
will
let
it
go
to
my
and
my
sister
's
only
protectors
and
friends
.
<EOS>
"
When
the
snare
into
which
he
fell
so
outstripped
his
first
intention
as
that
he
found
himself
placarded
by
the
police
authorities
upon
the
London
walls
for
dead
,
he
confusedly
accepted
the
aid
that
fell
upon
him
,
without
considering
how
firmly
it
must
seem
to
fix
the
Boffins
in
their
accession
to
the
fortune
.
<EOS>
When
he
saw
them
,
and
knew
them
,
and
even
from
his
vantage
-
ground
of
inspection
could
find
no
flaw
in
them
,
he
asked
himself
,
"
<EOS>
And
shall
I
come
to
life
to
dispossess
such
people
as
these
?
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
good
to
set
against
the
putting
of
them
to
that
hard
proof
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
from
Bella
's
own
lips
when
he
stood
tapping
at
the
door
on
that
night
of
his
taking
the
lodgings
,
that
the
marriage
would
have
been
on
her
part
thoroughly
mercenary
.
<EOS>
He
had
since
tried
her
,
in
his
own
unknown
person
and
supposed
station
,
and
she
not
only
rejected
his
advances
but
resented
them
.
<EOS>
Was
it
for
him
to
have
the
shame
of
buying
her
,
or
the
meanness
of
punishing
her
?
<EOS>
Yet
,
by
coming
to
life
and
accepting
the
condition
of
the
inheritance
,
he
must
 
do
the
former
;
and
by
coming
to
life
and
rejecting
it
,
he
must
do
the
latter
.
  
<EOS>
Another
consequence
that
he
had
never
foreshadowed
,
was
the
implication
of
an
innocent
man
in
his
supposed
murder
.
<EOS>
He
would
obtain
complete
retractation
from
the
accuser
,
and
set
the
wrong
right
;
but
clearly
the
wrong
could
never
have
been
done
if
he
had
never
planned
a
deception
.
<EOS>
Then
,
whatever
inconvenience
or
distress
of
mind
the
deception
cost
him
,
it
was
manful
repentantly
to
accept
as
among
its
consequences
,
and
make
no
complaint
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
John
Rokesmith
in
the
morning
,
and
it
buried
John
Harmon
<EOS>
still
many
fathoms
deeper
than
he
had
been
buried
in
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
Going
out
earlier
than
he
was
accustomed
to
do
,
he
encountered
the
cherub
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
cherub
's
way
was
for
a
certain
space
his
way
,
and
they
walked
together
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
not
to
notice
the
change
in
the
cherub
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
cherub
felt
very
conscious
of
it
,
and
modestly
remarked
:
"
A
present
from
my
daughter
Bella
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
word
gave
the
Secretary
a
stroke
of
pleasure
,
for
he
remembered
the
fifty
pounds
,
and
he
still
loved
the
girl
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
it
was
very
weak
---
it
always
is
very
weak
,
some
authorities
hold
---
  
<EOS>
but
he
loved
the
girl
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
happen
to
have
read
many
books
of
African
Travel
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
"
said
R.
W.
  
"
I
have
read
several
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
know
,
there
's
usually
a
King
George
,
or
a
King
Boy
,
or
a
King
Sambo
,
or
a
King
Bill
,
or
Bull
,
or
Rum
,
or
Junk
,
or
whatever
name
the
sailors
<EOS>
may
have
happened
to
give
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
asked
Rokesmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anywhere
.
<EOS>
Anywhere
in
Africa
,
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Pretty
well
everywhere
,
I
may
say
;
for
black
kings
are
cheap
---
and
<EOS>
I
think
"
---
said
R.
W.
,
with
an
apologetic
air
,
"
nasty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
of
your
opinion
,
Mr.
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
You
were
going
to
say
---
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
say
,
the
king
is
generally
dressed
in
a
London
hat
only
,
or
a
Manchester
pair
of
braces
,
or
one
epaulette
,
or
an
uniform
coat
with
his
legs
in
the
sleeves
,
or
something
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Just
so
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
confidence
,
I
assure
you
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
observed
the
cheerful
cherub
,
"
that
when
more
of
my
family
were
at
home
and
to
be
provided
for
,
I
used
to
remind
myself
immensely
of
that
king
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
idea
,
as
a
single
man
,
of
the
difficulty
I
have
had
in
wearing
more
than
one
good
article
at
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
believe
it
,
Mr.
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
mention
it
,
"
said
R.
W.
in
the
warmth
of
his
heart
,
"
as
a
proof
of
the
amiable
,
delicate
,
and
considerate
affection
of
my
daughter
Bella
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
been
a
little
spoilt
,
I
could
n't
have
thought
so
very
much
of
it
,
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
But
no
,
not
a
bit
.
<EOS>
And
she
is
so
very
pretty
!
<EOS>
I
hope
you
agree
with
me
in
finding
her
very
pretty
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
do
.
<EOS>
Every
one
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
said
the
cherub
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
have
no
doubt
of
it
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
great
advancement
for
her
in
life
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
A
great
opening
of
her
prospects
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Wilfer
could
have
no
better
friends
than
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
said
the
gratified
cherub
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
I
begin
to
think
things
are
very
well
as
they
are
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
John
Harmon
had
lived
---
"
  
"
He
is
better
dead
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
wo
n't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
,
"
urged
the
cherub
,
a
little
remonstrant
against
the
very
decisive
and
unpitying
tone
;
 
"
<EOS>
but
he
might
n't
have
suited
Bella
,
or
Bella
might
n't
have
suited
him
,
or
fifty
things
,
whereas
now
I
hope
she
can
choose
for
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
she
---
as
you
place
the
confidence
in
me
of
speaking
on
the
subject
,
you
will
excuse
my
asking
---
has
she
---
perhaps
---
chosen
?
"
 
<EOS>
faltered
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
!
"
returned
R.
W.
  
"
Young
ladies
sometimes
,
"
Rokesmith
hinted
,
"
choose
without
mentioning
their
choice
to
their
fathers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
this
case
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
Between
my
daughter
Bella
and
me
there
is
a
regular
league
and
covenant
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
It
was
ratified
only
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
The
ratification
dates
from
---
these
,
"
 
said
the
cherub
,
giving
a
little
pull
at
the
lappels
of
his
coat
and
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
she
has
not
chosen
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
young
George
Sampson
,
in
the
days
when
Mr.
John
Harmon
---
"
  
"
Who
I
wish
had
never
been
born
!
"
said
the
Secretary
,
with
a
gloomy
brow
.
  
<EOS>
R.
W.
looked
at
him
with
surprise
,
as
thinking
he
had
contracted
an
unaccountable
spite
against
the
poor
deceased
,
and
continued
:
"
In
the
days
when
Mr.
John
Harmon
was
being
sought
out
,
young
George
Sampson
certainly
was
hovering
about
Bella
,
and
Bella
let
him
hover
.
<EOS>
But
it
never
was
seriously
thought
of
,
and
it
's
still
less
than
ever
to
be
thought
of
now
.
<EOS>
For
Bella
is
ambitious
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
and
I
think
I
may
predict
will
marry
fortune
.
<EOS>
This
time
,
you
see
,
she
will
have
the
person
and
the
property
before
her
together
,
and
will
be
able
to
make
her
choice
with
her
eyes
open
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
road
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
to
part
company
so
soon
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
,
sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
pursued
his
way
,
not
very
much
elevated
in
spirits
by
this
conversation
,
and
,
arriving
at
the
Boffin
mansion
,
found
Betty
Higden
waiting
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
thank
you
kindly
,
sir
,
"
said
Betty
,
"
if
I
might
make
so
bold
as
have
a
word
or
two
<EOS>
wi
'
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
should
have
as
many
words
as
she
liked
,
he
told
her
;
and
took
her
into
his
room
,
and
made
her
sit
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
concerning
Sloppy
,
sir
,
"
said
Betty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
's
how
I
come
here
by
myself
.
<EOS>
Not
wishing
him
to
know
what
I
'm
a
-
going
to
say
to
you
,
I
got
the
start
of
him
early
and
walked
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
wonderful
energy
,
"
returned
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
young
as
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
Betty
Higden
gravely
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
strong
for
my
time
of
life
,
sir
,
but
not
young
,
thank
the
Lord
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
thankful
for
not
being
young
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
young
,
it
would
all
have
to
be
gone
through
again
,
and
the
end
would
be
a
weary
way
off
,
do
n't
you
see
?
<EOS>
But
never
mind
me
;
'
tis
concerning
Sloppy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
about
him
,
Betty
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
'
Tis
just
this
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
reasoned
out
of
his
head
by
any
powers
of
mine
but
what
that
he
can
do
right
by
your
kind
lady
and
gentleman
and
do
his
work
for
me
,
both
together
.
<EOS>
Now
he
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
To
give
himself
up
to
being
put
in
the
way
of
arning
a
good
living
and
getting
on
,
he
must
give
me
up
.
<EOS>
Well
;
he
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
respect
him
for
it
,
"
said
Rokesmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
ye
,
sir
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
but
what
I
do
myself
.
<EOS>
Still
that
do
n't
make
it
right
to
let
him
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
So
as
he
wo
n't
give
me
up
,
I
'm
a
-
going
to
give
him
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
,
Betty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
-
going
to
run
away
from
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
an
astonished
look
at
the
indomitable
old
face
and
the
bright
eyes
,
the
Secretary
repeated
,
"
Run
away
from
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Betty
,
with
one
nod
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
nod
and
in
the
firm
set
of
her
mouth
,
there
was
a
vigour
of
purpose
not
to
be
doubted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
"
said
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
talk
about
this
.
<EOS>
Let
us
take
our
time
over
it
,
and
try
to
get
at
the
true
sense
of
the
case
and
the
true
course
,
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Now
,
lookee
here
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
old
Betty
---
"
asking
your
excuse
for
being
so
familiar
,
but
being
of
a
time
of
life
a'most
to
be
your
grandmother
twice
over
.
<EOS>
Now
,
lookee
,
here
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
poor
living
and
a
hard
as
is
to
be
got
out
of
this
work
<EOS>
that
I
'm
a
doing
now
,
and
but
for
Sloppy
I
do
n't
know
as
I
should
have
held
to
it
this
long
.
<EOS>
But
it
did
just
keep
us
on
,
the
two
together
.
<EOS>
Now
that
I
'm
alone
---
with
even
Johnny
gone
---
I
'd
far
sooner
be
upon
my
feet
and
tiring
of
myself
out
,
than
a
sitting
folding
and
folding
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
And
I
'll
tell
you
why
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
deadness
steals
over
me
at
times
,
that
the
kind
of
life
favours
<EOS>
and
I
do
n't
like
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
seem
to
have
Johnny
in
my
arms
---
now
,
his
mother
---
now
,
his
mother
's
mother
---
now
,
I
seem
to
be
a
child
myself
,
a
lying
once
again
in
the
arms
of
my
own
mother
---
then
I
get
numbed
,
thought
and
senses
,
till
I
start
out
of
my
seat
,
afeerd
that
I
'm
a
growing
like
the
poor
old
people
that
they
brick
up
in
the
Unions
,
as
you
may
sometimes
see
when
they
let
'em
out
of
the
four
walls
to
have
a
warm
in
the
sun
,
crawling
quite
scared
about
the
streets
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
nimble
girl
,
and
have
always
been
a
active
body
,
as
I
told
your
lady
,
first
time
ever
I
see
her
good
face
.
<EOS>
I
can
still
walk
twenty
mile
if
I
am
put
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
'd
far
better
be
a
walking
than
a
getting
numbed
and
dreary
.
<EOS>
I
'm
a
good
fair
knitter
,
and
can
make
many
little
things
to
sell
.
<EOS>
The
loan
from
your
lady
and
gentleman
of
twenty
shillings
to
fit
out
a
basket
with
,
would
be
a
fortune
for
me
.
<EOS>
Trudging
round
the
country
and
tiring
of
myself
out
,
I
shall
keep
the
deadness
off
,
and
get
my
own
bread
by
my
own
labour
.
<EOS>
And
what
more
can
I
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
is
your
plan
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
"
for
running
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Show
me
a
better
!
<EOS>
My
deary
,
show
me
a
better
!
<EOS>
Why
,
I
know
very
well
,
"
said
old
Betty
Higden
,
"
and
you
know
very
well
,
that
your
lady
and
gentleman
would
set
me
up
like
a
queen
for
the
rest
of
my
life
,
if
so
be
that
we
could
make
it
right
among
us
to
have
it
so
.
<EOS>
But
we
ca
n't
make
it
right
among
us
to
have
it
so
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
took
charity
yet
,
nor
yet
has
any
one
belonging
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
it
would
be
forsaking
of
myself
indeed
,
and
forsaking
of
my
children
dead
and
gone
,
and
forsaking
of
their
children
dead
and
gone
,
to
set
up
a
contradiction
now
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
might
come
to
be
justifiable
and
unavoidable
at
last
,
"
the
Secretary
gently
hinted
,
with
a
slight
stress
on
the
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
never
will
!
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
that
I
mean
to
give
offence
by
being
anyways
proud
,
"
said
the
old
creature
simply
,
"
but
that
I
want
to
be
of
a
piece
like
,
and
helpful
of
myself
right
through
to
my
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
to
be
sure
,
"
added
the
Secretary
,
as
a
comfort
for
her
,
"
Sloppy
will
be
eagerly
looking
forward
to
his
opportunity
of
being
to
you
what
you
have
been
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Trust
him
for
that
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
said
Betty
,
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
"
Though
he
had
need
to
be
something
quick
about
it
,
for
I
'm
a
getting
to
be
an
old
one
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
a
strong
one
too
,
and
travel
and
weather
never
hurt
me
yet
!
<EOS>
Now
,
be
so
kind
as
speak
for
me
to
your
lady
and
gentleman
,
and
tell
'em
what
I
ask
of
their
good
friendliness
to
let
me
do
,
and
why
I
ask
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
felt
that
there
was
no
gainsaying
what
was
urged
by
this
brave
old
heroine
,
and
he
presently
repaired
to
Mrs.
Boffin
and
recommended
her
to
let
Betty
Higden
have
her
way
,
at
all
events
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
far
more
satisfactory
to
your
kind
heart
,
I
know
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
provide
for
her
,
but
it
may
be
a
duty
to
respect
this
independent
spirit
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
was
not
proof
against
the
consideration
set
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
husband
had
worked
too
,
and
had
brought
their
simple
faith
and
honour
clean
out
of
dustheaps
.
<EOS>
If
they
owed
a
duty
to
Betty
Higden
,
of
a
surety
that
duty
must
be
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Betty
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
when
she
accompanied
John
Rokesmith
back
to
his
room
,
and
shone
upon
her
with
the
light
of
her
radiant
face
,
"
granted
all
else
,
I
think
I
would
n't
run
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
'
Twould
come
easier
to
Sloppy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Higden
,
shaking
her
head
.
"
<EOS>
'
Twould
come
easier
to
me
too
.
<EOS>
But
'
tis
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
would
you
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
was
the
bright
and
ready
answer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
my
deary
,
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Bless
ye
,
I
am
used
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
many
parts
of
the
country
well
.
<EOS>
When
nothing
else
was
to
be
done
,
I
have
worked
in
many
a
market
-
garden
afore
now
,
and
in
many
a
hop
-
garden
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
give
my
consent
to
your
going
,
Betty
---
which
Mr.
Rokesmith
thinks
I
ought
to
do
---
"
  
Betty
thanked
him
with
a
grateful
curtsey
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
We
must
not
lose
sight
of
you
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
let
you
pass
out
of
our
knowledge
.
<EOS>
We
must
know
all
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
deary
,
but
not
through
letter
-
writing
,
because
letter
-
writing
 
---
indeed
,
writing
of
most
sorts
---
had
n't
much
come
up
for
such
as
me
when
I
was
young
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
be
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
No
fear
of
my
missing
a
chance
of
giving
myself
a
sight
of
your
reviving
face
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
"
said
Betty
,
with
logical
good
faith
,
"
I
shall
have
a
debt
to
pay
off
,
by
littles
,
and
naturally
that
would
bring
me
back
,
if
nothing
else
would
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Must
it
be
done
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Boffin
,
still
reluctant
,
of
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
must
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
more
discussion
it
was
agreed
that
it
should
be
done
,
and
Mrs.
Boffin
summoned
Bella
to
note
down
the
little
purchases
that
were
necessary
to
set
Betty
up
in
trade
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
ye
be
timorous
for
me
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
stanch
old
heart
,
observant
of
Bella
's
face
:
"
when
I
take
my
seat
with
my
work
,
clean
and
busy
and
fresh
,
in
a
country
market
-
place
,
I
shall
turn
a
sixpence
as
sure
as
ever
a
farmer
's
wife
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
took
that
opportunity
of
touching
on
the
practical
question
of
Mr.
Sloppy
's
capabilities
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
made
a
wonderful
cabinet
-
maker
,
said
Mrs.
Higden
,
"
if
there
had
been
the
money
to
put
him
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
had
seen
him
handle
tools
that
he
had
borrowed
to
mend
the
mangle
,
or
to
knock
a
broken
piece
of
furniture
together
,
in
a
surprising
manner
.
<EOS>
As
to
constructing
toys
for
the
Minders
,
out
of
nothing
,
he
had
done
that
daily
.
<EOS>
And
once
as
many
as
a
dozen
people
had
got
together
in
the
lane
to
see
the
neatness
with
which
he
fitted
the
broken
pieces
of
a
foreign
monkey
's
musical
instrument
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
well
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
hard
to
find
a
trade
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
Harmon
being
buried
under
mountains
now
,
the
Secretary
that
very
same
day
set
himself
to
finish
his
affairs
and
have
done
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
drew
up
an
ample
declaration
,
to
be
signed
by
Rogue
Riderhood
(
knowing
he
could
get
his
signature
to
it
,
by
making
him
another
and
much
shorter
evening
call
)
,
and
then
considered
to
whom
should
he
give
the
document
?
<EOS>
To
Hexam
's
son
,
or
daughter
?
<EOS>
Resolved
speedily
,
to
the
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
be
safer
to
avoid
seeing
the
daughter
,
because
the
son
had
seen
Julius
Handford
,
and
---
he
could
not
be
too
careful
---
there
might
possibly
be
some
comparison
of
notes
between
the
son
and
daughter
,
which
would
awaken
slumbering
suspicion
,
and
lead
to
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
I
might
even
,
"
he
reflected
,
"
be
apprehended
as
having
been
concerned
in
my
own
murder
!
"
<EOS>
Therefore
,
best
to
send
it
to
the
daughter
under
cover
by
the
post
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
Riderhood
had
undertaken
to
find
out
where
she
lived
,
and
it
was
not
necessary
that
it
should
be
attended
by
a
single
word
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
So
far
,
straight
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
all
that
he
knew
of
the
daughter
he
derived
from
Mrs.
Boffin
's
accounts
of
what
she
heard
from
Mr.
Lightwood
,
who
seemed
to
have
a
reputation
for
his
manner
of
relating
a
story
,
and
to
have
made
this
story
quite
his
own
.
<EOS>
It
interested
him
,
and
he
would
like
to
have
the
means
of
knowing
more
---
as
,
for
instance
,
that
she
received
the
exonerating
paper
,
and
that
it
satisfied
her
---
by
opening
some
channel
altogether
independent
of
Lightwood
:
who
likewise
had
seen
Julius
Handford
,
who
had
publicly
advertised
for
Julius
Handford
,
and
whom
of
all
men
he
,
the
Secretary
,
most
avoided
.
"
<EOS>
But
with
whom
the
common
course
of
things
might
bring
me
in
a
moment
face
to
face
,
any
day
in
the
week
or
any
hour
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
to
cast
about
for
some
likely
means
of
opening
such
a
channel
.
<EOS>
The
boy
,
Hexam
,
was
training
for
and
with
a
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
The
Secretary
knew
it
,
because
his
sister
's
share
in
that
disposal
of
him
seemed
to
be
the
best
part
of
Lightwood
's
account
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
This
young
fellow
,
Sloppy
,
stood
in
need
of
some
instruction
.
<EOS>
If
he
,
the
Secretary
,
engaged
that
schoolmaster
to
impart
it
to
him
,
the
channel
might
be
opened
.
<EOS>
The
next
point
was
,
did
Mrs.
Boffin
know
the
schoolmaster
's
name
?
<EOS>
No
,
but
she
knew
where
the
school
was
.
<EOS>
Quite
enough
.
<EOS>
Promptly
the
Secretary
wrote
to
the
master
of
that
school
,
and
that
very
evening
Bradley
Headstone
answered
in
person
.
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
stated
to
the
schoolmaster
how
the
object
was
,
to
send
to
him
for
certain
occasional
evening
instruction
,
a
youth
whom
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
wished
to
help
to
an
industrious
and
useful
place
in
life
.
<EOS>
The
schoolmaster
was
willing
to
undertake
the
charge
of
such
a
pupil
.
<EOS>
The
Secretary
inquired
on
what
terms
?
<EOS>
The
schoolmaster
stated
on
what
terms
.
<EOS>
Agreed
and
disposed
of
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
sir
,
"
said
Bradley
Headstone
,
"
to
whose
good
opinion
<EOS>
I
owe
a
recommendation
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
know
that
I
am
not
the
principal
here
.
<EOS>
I
am
Mr.
Boffin
's
Secretary
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
is
a
gentleman
who
inherited
a
property
of
which
you
may
have
heard
some
public
mention
;
the
Harmon
property
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Harmon
,
"
said
Bradley
:
who
would
have
been
a
great
deal
more
at
a
loss
than
he
was
,
if
he
had
known
to
whom
he
spoke
:
"
was
murdered
,
and
found
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Was
murdered
and
found
in
the
river
.
"
  
"
It
was
not
---
"
  
"
No
,
"
interposed
the
Secretary
,
smiling
,
"
it
was
not
he
who
recommended
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
heard
of
you
through
a
certain
Mr.
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
know
Mr.
Lightwood
,
or
know
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
as
much
of
him
as
I
wish
to
know
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Lightwood
,
and
I
desire
none
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
objection
to
Mr.
Lightwood
,
but
I
have
a
particular
objection
to
some
of
Mr.
Lightwood
's
friends
---
in
short
,
to
one
of
Mr.
Lightwood
's
friends
.
<EOS>
His
great
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
could
hardly
get
the
words
out
,
even
then
and
there
,
so
fierce
<EOS>
did
he
grow
(
though
keeping
himself
down
with
infinite
pains
of
repression
)
,
when
the
careless
and
contemptuous
bearing
of
Eugene
Wrayburn
rose
before
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
saw
there
was
a
strong
feeling
here
on
some
sore
point
,
and
he
would
have
made
a
diversion
from
it
,
but
for
Bradley
's
holding
to
it
in
his
cumbersome
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
to
mention
the
friend
by
name
,
"
he
said
,
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"
The
person
I
object
to
,
is
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
remembered
him
.
<EOS>
In
his
disturbed
recollection
of
that
night
when
he
was
striving
against
the
drugged
drink
,
there
was
but
a
dim
image
of
Eugene
's
person
;
but
he
remembered
his
name
,
and
his
manner
of
speaking
,
and
how
he
had
gone
with
them
to
view
the
body
,
and
where
he
had
stood
,
and
what
he
had
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
what
is
the
name
,
"
he
asked
,
again
trying
to
make
a
diversion
,
"
of
young
Hexam
's
sister
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Her
name
is
Lizzie
,
"
said
the
schoolmaster
,
with
a
strong
contraction
of
his
whole
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
a
young
woman
of
a
remarkable
character
;
is
she
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
sufficiently
remarkable
to
be
very
superior
to
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
---
though
an
ordinary
person
might
be
that
.
"
said
the
schoolmaster
;
"
and
I
hope
you
will
not
think
it
impertinent
in
me
,
sir
,
to
ask
why
you
put
the
two
names
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
By
mere
accident
,
"
returned
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
Observing
that
Mr.
Wrayburn
was
a
disagreeable
subject
with
you
,
I
tried
to
get
away
from
it
:
though
not
very
successfully
,
it
would
appear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
know
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
perhaps
the
names
can
not
be
put
together
on
the
authority
of
any
representation
of
his
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
took
the
liberty
to
ask
,
"
said
Bradley
,
after
casting
his
eyes
on
the
ground
,
"
because
he
is
capable
of
making
any
representation
,
in
the
swaggering
levity
of
his
insolence
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
hope
you
will
not
misunderstand
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
am
much
interested
in
this
brother
and
sister
,
and
the
subject
awakens
very
strong
feelings
within
me
.
<EOS>
Very
,
very
,
strong
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
a
shaking
hand
,
Bradley
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
wiped
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
thought
,
as
he
glanced
at
the
schoolmaster
's
face
,
that
he
had
opened
a
channel
here
indeed
,
and
that
it
was
an
unexpectedly
dark
and
deep
and
stormy
one
,
and
difficult
to
sound
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
in
the
midst
of
his
turbulent
emotions
,
Bradley
stopped
and
seemed
to
challenge
his
look
.
<EOS>
Much
as
though
he
suddenly
asked
him
,
"
What
do
you
see
in
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
brother
,
young
Hexam
,
was
your
real
recommendation
here
,
"
 
said
the
Secretary
,
quietly
going
back
to
the
point
;
"
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
happening
to
know
,
through
Mr.
Lightwood
,
that
he
was
your
pupil
.
<EOS>
Anything
that
I
ask
respecting
the
brother
and
sister
,
or
either
of
them
,
I
ask
for
myself
,
out
of
my
own
interest
in
the
subject
,
and
not
in
my
official
character
,
or
on
Mr.
Boffin
's
behalf
.
<EOS>
How
I
come
to
be
interested
,
I
need
not
explain
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
father
's
connection
with
the
discovery
of
Mr.
Harmon
's
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
replied
Bradley
,
very
restlessly
indeed
,
"
<EOS>
I
know
all
the
circumstances
of
that
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
tell
me
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
Does
the
sister
suffer
under
any
stigma
because
of
the
impossible
accusation
---
  
<EOS>
groundless
would
be
a
better
word
---
that
was
made
against
the
father
,
and
substantially
withdrawn
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
sir
,
"
returned
Bradley
,
with
a
kind
of
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
sister
,
"
said
Bradley
,
separating
his
words
over
-
carefully
,
and
speaking
as
if
he
were
repeating
them
from
a
book
,
"
suffers
under
no
reproach
that
repels
a
man
of
unimpeachable
character
who
has
made
for
himself
every
step
of
his
way
in
life
,
from
placing
her
in
his
own
station
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
,
raising
her
to
his
own
station
;
 
I
say
,
placing
her
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
sister
labours
under
no
reproach
,
unless
she
should
unfortunately
make
it
for
herself
.
<EOS>
When
such
a
man
is
not
deterred
from
regarding
her
as
his
equal
,
and
when
he
has
convinced
himself
that
there
is
no
blemish
on
her
,
I
think
the
fact
must
be
taken
to
be
pretty
expressive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
is
such
a
man
?
"
said
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
knotted
his
brows
,
and
squared
his
large
lower
jaw
,
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
ground
with
an
air
of
determination
that
seemed
unnecessary
to
the
occasion
,
as
he
replied
:
"
<EOS>
And
there
is
such
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
had
no
reason
or
excuse
for
prolonging
the
conversation
,
and
it
ended
here
.
<EOS>
Within
three
hours
the
oakum
-
headed
apparition
once
more
dived
into
the
Leaving
Shop
,
and
that
night
Rogue
Riderhood
's
recantation
lay
in
the
post
office
,
addressed
under
cover
to
Lizzie
Hexam
at
her
right
address
.
  
<EOS>
All
these
proceedings
occupied
John
Rokesmith
so
much
,
that
it
was
not
until
the
following
day
that
he
saw
Bella
again
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
then
to
be
tacitly
understood
between
them
that
they
were
to
be
as
distantly
easy
as
they
could
,
without
attracting
the
attention
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
to
any
marked
change
in
their
manner
.
<EOS>
The
fitting
out
of
old
Betty
Higden
was
favourable
to
this
,
as
keeping
Bella
engaged
and
interested
,
and
as
occupying
the
general
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Rokesmith
,
when
they
all
stood
about
her
,
while
she
packed
her
tidy
basket
---
except
Bella
,
who
was
busily
helping
on
her
knees
at
the
chair
on
which
it
stood
;
"
that
at
least
you
might
keep
a
letter
in
your
pocket
,
Mrs.
Higden
,
which
I
would
write
for
you
and
date
from
here
,
merely
stating
,
in
the
names
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
that
they
are
your
friends
;
---
I
wo
n't
say
patrons
,
because
they
would
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
;
"
no
patronizing
!
<EOS>
Let
's
keep
out
of
that
,
whatever
we
come
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
more
than
enough
of
that
about
,
without
us
;
ai
n't

Noddy
?
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
,
old
lady
!
"
returned
the
Golden
Dustman
.
<EOS>
"
Over
-
much
indeed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
people
sometimes
like
to
be
patronized
;
do
n't
they
,
sir
?
"
 
asked
Bella
,
looking
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
And
if
they
do
,
my
dear
,
they
ought
to
learn
better

"
Mrs.
Boffin
urged
.
  
<EOS>
"
Warm
!
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
enough
to
make
a
man
smoking
hot

<EOS>
I
ca
n't
go
anywhere
without
being
Patronized
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
be
Patronized

<EOS>
If
I
buy
a
ticket
for
a
Flower

or
a
Music

any
sort
of

why

I

If

it
be
done

<EOS>
If
there
's
a
bad
thing
to
be
done
,
can
it
ever
be
Patroned
and
Patronessed
right
?
<EOS>
Yet
when
a
new
Institution
's
going
to
be
built

it
seems
to
me
that

bricks

made

so
much
consequence

Patrons

no

objects

<EOS>
I
wish
somebody
would
tell
me
whether
other
countries
get
Patronized
to
anything
like
the
extent
of
this
one
!
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
Patrons

themselves

I
wonder
they
're
not

<EOS>
Having
delivered
himself
of
these
remarks
,
Mr.
Boffin
took
a
trot
,
according
to
his
usual
custom
,
and
trotted
back
to
the
spot
from
which
he
had
started

"
As

Mr.

,
"

Old
Betty
laughed

and
said
that
she
would
take
the
letter
and
be
thankful

<EOS>
"
That

said
Mr.

The

was
written

read
to

given
to

the

Do

urged
Mr.
Boffin
;

ways

A

be
acceptable

Would

see

man

name
of
Wegg
that
lives
there
---
with
a
wooden
leg

<EOS>
Old
Betty
was
proof
even
against
this
temptation

and
fell
to
adjusting
her
black
bonnet
and
shawl
.
  
<EOS>

I
would

let
you
go
,
now
it
comes
to
this
,
after
all
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
if
I
did
n't
hope
that
it
may
make
a
man
and
a
workman
of
Sloppy
,
in
as
short
a
time
as
ever
a
man
and
a
workman
was
made
yet
.
<EOS>
Why
,
what
have
you
got
there
,
Betty
?
<EOS>
Not
a
doll
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
man
in
the
Guards
who
had
been
on
duty
over
Johnny
's
bed
.
<EOS>
The
solitary
old
woman
showed
what
it
was
,
and
put
it
up
quietly
in
her
dress
.
<EOS>
Then
,
she
gratefully
took
leave
of
Mrs.
Boffin
,
and
of
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
of
Rokesmith
,
and
then
put
her
old
withered
arms
round
Bella
's
young
and
blooming
neck
,
and
said
,
repeating
Johnny
's
words
:
"
A
kiss
for
the
boofer
lady
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
looked
on
from
a
doorway
at
the
boofer
lady
thus
encircled
,
and
still
looked
on
at
the
boofer
lady
standing
alone
there
,
when
the
determined
old
figure
with
its
steady
bright
eyes
was
trudging
through
the
streets
,
away
from
paralysis
and
pauperism
.
   
<EOS>
THE
WHOLE
CASE
SO
FAR
.
 
<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
held
fast
by
that
other
interview
<EOS>
he
was
to
have
with
Lizzie
Hexam
.
<EOS>
In
stipulating
for
it
,
he
had
been
impelled
by
a
feeling
little
short
of
desperation
,
and
the
feeling
abided
by
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
soon
after
his
interview
with
the
Secretary
,
that
he
and
Charley
Hexam
set
out
one
leaden
evening
,
not
unnoticed
by
Miss
Peecher
,
to
have
this
desperate
interview
accomplished
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
"
said
Bradley
,
"
is
favourable
neither
to
me
nor
to
you
,
Hexam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
pert
crooked
little
chit
,
Mr.
Headstone
!
<EOS>
I
knew
she
would
put
herself
in
the
way
,
if
she
could
,
and
would
be
sure
to
strike
in
with
something
impertinent
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
that
account
that
I
proposed
our
going
to
the
City
to
-
night
and
meeting
my
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
supposed
,
"
said
Bradley
,
getting
his
gloves
on
his
nervous
hands
as
he
walked
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
supposed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nobody
but
my
sister
,
"
pursued
Charley
,
"
would
have
found
out
such
an
extraordinary
companion
.
<EOS>
She
has
done
it
in
a
ridiculous
fancy
of
giving
herself
up
to
another
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
so
,
that
night
when
we
went
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
she
give
herself
up
to
the
dressmaker
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
the
boy
,
colouring
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
her
romantic
ideas
!
<EOS>
I
tried
to
convince
her
so
,
but
I
did
n't
succeed
.
<EOS>
However
,
what
we
have
got
to
do
,
is
,
to
succeed
to
-
night
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
and
then
all
the
rest
follows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
still
sanguine
,
Hexam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
am
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Why
,
we
have
everything
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Except
your
sister
,
perhaps
,
"
thought
Bradley
.
<EOS>
But
he
only
gloomily
thought
it
,
and
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
on
our
side
,
"
repeated
the
boy
with
boyish
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
Respectability
,
an
excellent
connexion
for
me
,
common
sense
,
everything
!
"
  
"
To
be
sure
,
your
sister
has
always
shown
herself
a
devoted
sister
,
"
 
said
Bradley
,
willing
to
sustain
himself
on
even
that
low
ground
of
hope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Naturally
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
I
have
a
good
deal
of
influence
with
her
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
you
have
honoured
me
with
your
confidence
and
spoken
to
me
first
,
I
say
again
,
we
have
everything
on
our
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
Bradley
thought
again
,
"
Except
your
sister
,
perhaps
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
grey
dusty
withered
evening
in
London
city
has
not
a
hopeful
aspect
.
<EOS>
The
closed
warehouses
and
offices
have
an
air
of
death
about
them
,
and
the
national
dread
of
colour
has
an
air
of
mourning
.
<EOS>
The
towers
and
steeples
of
the
many
house
-
encompassed
churches
,
dark
and
dingy
as
the
sky
that
seems
descending
on
them
,
are
no
relief
to
the
general
gloom
;
a
sun
-
dial
on
a
church
-
wall
has
the
look
,
in
its
useless
black
shade
,
of
having
failed
in
its
business
enterprise
and
stopped
payment
for
ever
;
melancholy
waifs
and
strays
of
housekeepers
and
porters
sweep
melancholy
waifs
and
strays
of
papers
and
pins
into
the
kennels
,
and
other
more
melancholy
waifs
and
strays
explore
them
,
searching
and
stooping
and
poking
for
anything
to
sell
.
<EOS>
The
set
of
humanity
outward
from
the
City
is
as
a
set
of
prisoners
departing
from
gaol
,
and
dismal
Newgate
seems
quite
as
fit
a
stronghold
for
the
mighty
Lord
Mayor
as
his
own
state
-
dwelling
.
  
<EOS>
On
such
an
evening
,
when
the
city
grit
gets
into
the
hair
and
eyes
and
skin
,
and
when
the
fallen
leaves
of
the
few
unhappy
city
trees
grind
down
in
corners
under
wheels
of
wind
,
the
schoolmaster
and
the
pupil
emerged
upon
the
Leadenhall
Street
region
,
spying
eastward
for
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Being
something
too
soon
in
their
arrival
,
they
lurked
at
a
corner
,
waiting
for
her
to
appear
.
<EOS>
The
best
-
looking
among
us
will
not
look
very
well
,
lurking
at
a
corner
,
and
Bradley
came
out
of
that
disadvantage
very
poorly
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
she
comes
,
Mr.
Headstone
!
<EOS>
Let
us
go
forward
and
meet
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
they
advanced
,
she
saw
them
coming
,
and
seemed
rather
troubled
.
<EOS>
But
she
greeted
her
brother
with
the
usual
warmth
,
and
touched
the
extended
hand
of
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
where
are
you
going
,
Charley
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
him
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nowhere
.
<EOS>
We
came
on
purpose
to
meet
you
.
"
  
"
To
meet
me
,
Charley
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
We
are
going
to
walk
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
let
us
take
the
great
leading
streets
where
every
one
walks
,
and
we
ca
n't
hear
ourselves
speak
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
by
the
quiet
backways
.
<EOS>
Here
's
a
large
paved
court
by
this
church
,
and
quiet
,
too
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
up
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
not
in
the
way
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
it
is
,
"
said
the
boy
,
petulantly
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
in
my
way
,
and
my
way
is
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
not
released
his
hand
,
and
,
still
holding
it
,
looked
at
him
with
a
kind
of
appeal
.
<EOS>
He
avoided
her
eyes
,
under
pretence
of
saying
,
"
Come
along
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
"
<EOS>
Bradley
walked
at
his
side
 
---
not
at
hers
---
and
the
brother
and
sister
walked
hand
in
hand
.
<EOS>
The
court
brought
them
to
a
churchyard
;
a
paved
square
court
,
with
a
raised
bank
of
earth
about
breast
high
,
in
the
middle
,
enclosed
by
iron
rails
.
<EOS>
Here
,
conveniently
and
healthfully
elevated
above
the
level
of
the
living
,
were
the
dead
,
and
the
tombstones
,
some
of
the
latter
droopingly
inclined
from
the
perpendicular
,
as
if
they
were
ashamed
of
the
lies
they
told
.
  
<EOS>
They
paced
the
whole
of
this
place
once
,
in
a
constrained
and
uncomfortable
manner
,
when
the
boy
stopped
and
said
:
  
"
Lizzie
,
Mr.
Headstone
has
something
to
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
an
interruption
either
to
him
or
to
you
,
and
so
I
'll
go
and
take
a
little
stroll
and
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
know
in
a
general
way
what
Mr.
Headstone
intends
to
say
,
and
I
very
highly
approve
of
it
,
as
I
hope
---
and
indeed
I
do
not
doubt
---
you
will
.
<EOS>
I
need
n't
tell
you
,
Lizzie
,
that
I
am
under
great
obligations
to
Mr.
Headstone
,
and
that
I
am
very
anxious
for
Mr.
Headstone
to
succeed
in
all
he
undertakes
.
<EOS>
As
I
hope
---
and
as
,
indeed
,
I
do
n't
doubt
---
you
must
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
,
"
returned
his
sister
,
detaining
his
hand
as
he
withdrew
it
,
"
I
think
you
had
better
stay
.
<EOS>
I
think
Mr.
Headstone
had
better
not
say
what
he
thinks
of
saying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
do
you
know
what
it
is
?
"
returned
the
boy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
do
n't
,
but
---
"
  
"
Perhaps
you
do
n't
?
<EOS>
No
,
Liz
,
I
should
think
not
.
<EOS>
If
you
knew
what
it
was
,
you
would
give
me
a
very
different
answer
.
<EOS>
There
;
 
let
go
;
be
sensible
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
you
do
n't
remember
that
Mr.
Headstone
is
looking
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
allowed
him
to
separate
himself
from
her
,
and
he
,
after
saying
,
"
Now
,
Liz
,
be
a
rational
girl
and
a
good
sister
,
"
walked
away
.
<EOS>
She
remained
standing
alone
with
Bradley
Headstone
,
and
it
was
not
until
she
raised
her
eyes
,
that
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
"
he
began
,
"
when
I
saw
you
last
,
that
there
was
something
unexplained
,
which
might
perhaps
influence
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
this
evening
to
explain
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
not
judge
of
me
by
my
hesitating
manner
when
I
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
You
see
me
at
my
greatest
disadvantage
.
<EOS>
It
is
most
unfortunate
for
me
that
I
wish
you
to
see
me
at
my
best
,
and
that
I
know
you
see
me
at
my
worst
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
moved
slowly
on
when
he
paused
,
and
he
moved
slowly
on
beside
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
egotistical
to
begin
by
saying
so
much
about
myself
,
"
 
he
resumed
,
"
but
whatever
I
say
to
you
seems
,
even
in
my
own
ears
,
below
what
I
want
to
say
,
and
different
from
what
I
want
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
So
it
is
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
ruin
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
started
at
the
passionate
sound
of
the
last
words
,
and
at
the
passionate
action
of
his
hands
,
with
which
they
were
accompanied
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
you
are
the
ruin
---
the
ruin
---
the
ruin
---
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
resources
in
myself
,
I
have
no
confidence
in
myself
<EOS>
,
I
have
no
government
of
myself
when
you
are
near
me
or
in
my
thoughts
.
<EOS>
And
you
are
always
in
my
thoughts
now
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
been
quit
of
you
since
I
first
saw
you
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
was
a
wretched
day
for
me
!
<EOS>
That
was
a
wretched
,
miserable
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
touch
of
pity
for
him
mingled
with
her
dislike
of
him
,
and
she
said
:
"
Mr.
Headstone
,
I
am
grieved
to
have
done
you
any
harm
,
but
I
have
never
meant
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
he
cried
,
despairingly
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
I
seem
to
have
reproached
you
,
instead
of
revealing
to
you
the
state
of
my
own
mind
!
<EOS>
Bear
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
wrong
when
you
are
in
question
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
doom
.
"
  
<EOS>
Struggling
with
himself
,
and
by
times
looking
up
at
the
deserted
windows
of
the
houses
as
if
there
could
be
anything
written
in
their
grimy
panes
that
would
help
him
,
he
paced
the
whole
pavement
at
her
side
,
before
he
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
try
to
give
expression
to
what
is
in
my
mind
;
it
shall
and
must
be
spoken
.
<EOS>
Though
you
see
me
so
confounded
---
though
you
strike
me
so
helpless
---
I
ask
you
to
believe
that
there
are
many
people
who
think
well
of
me
;
that
there
are
some
people
who
highly
esteem
me
;
that
I
have
in
my
way
won
a
station
which
is
considered
worth
winning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
I
do
believe
it
.
<EOS>
Surely
I
have
always
known
it
from
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
to
believe
that
if
I
were
to
offer
my
home
such
as
it
is
,
my
station
such
as
it
is
,
my
affections
such
as
they
are
,
to
any
one
of
the
best
considered
,
and
best
qualified
,
and
most
distinguished
,
among
the
young
women
engaged
in
my
calling
,
they
would
probably
be
accepted
.
<EOS>
Even
readily
accepted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
doubt
it
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
sometimes
had
it
in
my
thoughts
to
make
that
offer
and
to
settle
down
<EOS>
as
many
men
of
my
class
do
:
I
on
the
one
side
of
a
school
,
my
wife
on
the
other
,
both
of
us
interested
in
the
same
work
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
have
you
not
done
so
?
"
asked
Lizzie
Hexam
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
not
do
so
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Far
better
that
I
never
did
!
<EOS>
The
only
one
grain
of
comfort
I
have
had
these
many
weeks
,
"
he
said
,
always
speaking
passionately
,
and
,
when
most
emphatic
,
repeating
that
former
action
of
his
hands
,
which
was
like
flinging
his
heart
's
blood
down
before
her
in
drops
upon
the
pavement
-
stones
;
"
the
only
one
grain
of
comfort
I
have
had
these
many
weeks
is
,
that
I
never
did
.
<EOS>
For
if
I
had
,
and
if
the
same
spell
had
come
upon
me
for
my
ruin
,
I
know
I
should
have
broken
that
tie
asunder
as
if
it
had
been
thread
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
glanced
at
him
with
a
glance
of
fear
,
and
a
shrinking
gesture
.
<EOS>
He
answered
,
as
if
she
had
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
been
voluntary
on
my
part
,
any
more
than
it
is
voluntary
in
me
to
be
here
now
.
<EOS>
You
draw
me
to
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
shut
up
in
a
strong
prison
,
you
would
draw
me
out
.
<EOS>
I
should
break
through
the
wall
to
come
to
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
lying
on
a
sick
bed
,
you
would
draw
me
up
---
to
stagger
to
your
feet
and
fall
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
wild
energy
of
the
man
,
now
quite
let
loose
,
was
absolutely
terrible
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
and
laid
his
hand
upon
a
piece
of
the
coping
of
the
burial
-
ground
enclosure
,
as
if
he
would
have
dislodged
the
stone
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
man
knows
till
the
time
comes
,
what
depths
are
within
him
.
<EOS>
To
some
men
it
never
comes
;
let
them
rest
and
be
thankful
!
<EOS>
To
me
,
you
brought
it
;
on
me
,
you
forced
it
;
and
the
bottom
of
this
raging
sea
,
"
striking
himself
upon
the
breast
,
"
has
been
heaved
up
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Headstone
,
I
have
heard
enough
.
<EOS>
Let
me
stop
you
here
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
better
for
you
and
better
for
me
.
<EOS>
Let
us
find
my
brother
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Not
yet
.
<EOS>
It
shall
and
must
be
spoken
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
in
torments
ever
since
I
stopped
short
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
You
are
alarmed
.
<EOS>
It
is
another
of
my
miseries
that
I
can
not
speak
to
you
or
speak
of
you
without
stumbling
at
every
syllable
,
unless
I
let
the
check
go
altogether
and
run
mad
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
man
lighting
the
lamps
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
gone
directly
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
of
you
<EOS>
let
us
walk
round
this
place
again
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
reason
to
look
alarmed
;
I
can
restrain
myself
,
and
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
yielded
to
the
entreaty
---
how
could
she
do
otherwise
!
<EOS>
---
and
they
paced
the
stones
in
silence
.
<EOS>
One
by
one
the
lights
leaped
up
making
the
cold
grey
church
tower
more
remote
,
and
they
were
alone
again
.
<EOS>
He
said
no
more
until
they
had
regained
the
spot
where
he
had
broken
off
;
there
,
he
again
stood
still
,
and
again
grasped
the
stone
.
<EOS>
In
saying
what
he
said
then
,
he
never
looked
at
her
;
but
looked
at
it
and
wrenched
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
am
going
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
.
<EOS>
What
other
men
may
mean
when
they
use
that
expression
,
I
can
not
tell
;
what
I
mean
is
,
that
I
am
under
the
influence
of
some
tremendous
attraction
which
I
have
resisted
in
vain
,
and
which
overmasters
me
.
<EOS>
You
could
draw
me
to
fire
,
you
could
draw
me
to
water
,
you
could
draw
me
to
the
gallows
,
you
could
draw
me
to
any
death
,
you
could
draw
me
to
anything
I
have
most
avoided
,
you
could
draw
me
to
any
exposure
and
disgrace
.
<EOS>
This
and
the
confusion
of
my
thoughts
,
so
that
I
am
fit
for
nothing
,
is
what
I
mean
by
your
being
the
ruin
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
would
return
a
favourable
answer
to
my
offer
of
myself
in
marriage
,
you
could
draw
me
to
any
good
---
  
<EOS>
every
good
---
with
equal
force
.
<EOS>
My
circumstances
are
quite
easy
,
and
you
would
want
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
My
reputation
stands
quite
high
,
and
would
be
a
shield
for
yours
.
<EOS>
If
you
saw
me
at
my
work
,
able
to
do
it
well
and
respected
in
it
,
you
might
even
come
to
take
a
sort
of
pride
in
me
;
---
I
would
try
hard
that
you
should
.
<EOS>
Whatever
considerations
I
may
have
thought
of
against
this
offer
,
I
have
conquered
,
and
I
make
it
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Your
brother
favors
me
to
the
utmost
,
and
it
is
likely
that
we
might
live
and
work
together
;
anyhow
,
it
is
certain
that
he
would
have
my
best
influence
and
support
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
that
I
could
say
more
if
I
tried
.
<EOS>
I
might
only
weaken
what
is
ill
enough
said
as
it
is
.
<EOS>
I
only
add
that
if
it
is
any
claim
on
you
to
be
in
earnest
,
I
am
in
thorough
earnest
,
dreadful
earnest
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
powdered
mortar
from
under
the
stone
at
which
he
wrenched
,
rattled
on
the
pavement
to
confirm
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Headstone
---
"
  
"
Stop
!
<EOS>
I
implore
you
,
before
you
answer
me
,
to
walk
round
this
place
once
more
.
<EOS>
It
will
give
you
a
minute
's
time
to
think
,
and
me
a
minute
's
time
to
get
some
fortitude
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
she
yielded
,
to
the
entreaty
,
and
again
they
came
back
to
the
same
place
,
and
again
he
worked
at
the
stone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
,
"
he
said
,
with
his
attention
apparently
engrossed
by
it
,
"
yes
,
or
no
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Headstone
,
I
thank
you
sincerely
,
I
thank
you
gratefully
,
and
hope
you
may
find
a
worthy
wife
before
long
and
be
very
happy
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
no
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
no
short
time
necessary
for
reflection
;
no
weeks
or
days
?
"
he
asked
,
in
the
same
half
-
suffocated
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Are
you
quite
decided
,
and
is
there
no
chance
of
any
change
in
my
favor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
decided
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
and
I
am
bound
to
answer
<EOS>
I
am
certain
there
is
none
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
he
,
suddenly
changing
his
tone
and
turning
to
her
,
and
bringing
his
clenched
hand
down
upon
the
stone
with
a
force
that
laid
the
knuckles
raw
and
bleeding
;
"
then
I
hope
that
I
may
never
kill
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
dark
look
of
hatred
and
revenge
with
which
the
words
broke
from
his
livid
lips
,
and
with
which
he
stood
holding
out
his
smeared
hand
as
if
it
held
some
weapon
and
had
just
struck
a
mortal
blow
,
made
her
so
afraid
of
him
that
she
turned
to
run
away
.
<EOS>
But
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Headstone
,
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Headstone
,
I
must
call
for
help
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
I
who
should
call
for
help
,
"
he
said
;
"
you
do
n't
know
yet
how
much
I
need
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
working
of
his
face
as
she
shrank
from
it
,
glancing
round
for
her
brother
and
uncertain
what
to
do
,
might
have
extorted
a
cry
from
her
in
another
instant
;
but
all
at
once
he
sternly
stopped
it
and
fixed
it
,
as
if
Death
itself
had
done
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
<EOS>
You
see
I
have
recovered
myself
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
much
of
the
dignity
of
courage
,
as
she
recalled
her
self
-
reliant
life
and
her
right
to
be
free
from
accountability
to
this
man
,
she
released
her
arm
from
his
grasp
and
stood
looking
full
at
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
so
handsome
,
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
A
shade
came
over
them
while
he
looked
back
at
her
,
as
if
she
drew
the
very
light
out
of
them
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
time
,
at
least
,
I
will
leave
nothing
unsaid
,
"
he
went
on
,
folding
his
hands
before
him
,
clearly
to
prevent
his
being
betrayed
into
any
impetuous
gesture
;
"
this
last
time
at
least
I
will
not
be
tortured
with
after
-
thoughts
of
a
lost
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
of
him
you
spoke
in
your
ungovernable
rage
and
violence
?
"
 
<EOS>
Lizzie
Hexam
demanded
with
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
He
bit
his
lip
,
and
looked
at
her
,
and
said
never
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
Mr.
Wrayburn
that
you
threatened
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
bit
his
lip
again
,
and
looked
at
her
,
and
said
never
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
asked
me
to
hear
you
out
,
and
you
will
not
speak
.
<EOS>
Let
me
find
my
brother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
!
<EOS>
I
threatened
no
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
look
dropped
for
an
instant
to
his
bleeding
hand
.
<EOS>
He
lifted
it
to
his
mouth
,
wiped
it
on
his
sleeve
,
and
again
folded
it
over
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
"
he
repeated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
mention
that
name
again
and
again
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Because
it
is
the
text
of
the
little
I
have
left
to
say
.
<EOS>
Observe
!
<EOS>
There
are
no
threats
in
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
utter
a
threat
,
stop
me
,
and
fasten
it
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
worse
threat
than
was
conveyed
in
his
manner
of
uttering
the
name
,
could
hardly
have
escaped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
haunts
you
.
<EOS>
You
accept
favors
from
him
.
<EOS>
You
are
willing
enough
to
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
,
as
well
as
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Wrayburn
has
been
considerate
and
good
to
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
proudly
,
"
in
connexion
with
the
death
and
with
the
memory
of
my
poor
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
.
<EOS>
He
is
of
course
a
very
considerate
and
a
very
good
man
,
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
nothing
to
you
,
I
think
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
an
indignation
she
could
not
repress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
he
is
.
<EOS>
There
you
mistake
.
<EOS>
He
is
much
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
he
be
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
can
be
a
rival
to
me
among
other
things
,
"
said
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Headstone
,
"
returned
Lizzie
,
with
a
burning
face
,
"
it
is
cowardly
in
you
to
speak
to
me
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
But
it
makes
me
able
to
tell
you
that
I
do
not
like
you
,
and
that
I
never
have
liked
you
from
the
first
,
and
that
no
other
living
creature
has
anything
to
do
with
the
effect
you
have
produced
upon
me
for
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
head
bent
for
a
moment
,
as
if
under
a
weight
,
and
he
then
looked
up
again
,
moistening
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
on
with
the
little
I
had
left
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
knew
all
this
about
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
all
the
while
you
were
drawing
me
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
strove
against
the
knowledge
,
but
quite
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
made
no
difference
in
me
.
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
in
my
mind
,
I
went
on
.
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
in
my
mind
,
I
spoke
to
you
just
now
.
<EOS>
With
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
in
my
mind
,
I
have
been
set
aside
and
I
have
been
cast
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
give
those
names
to
my
thanking
you
for
your
proposal
and
declining
it
,
is
it
my
fault
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
"
said
Lizzie
,
compassionating
the
bitter
struggle
he
could
not
conceal
,
almost
as
much
as
she
was
repelled
and
alarmed
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
complaining
,
"
he
returned
,
"
I
am
only
stating
the
case
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
wrestle
with
my
self
-
respect
when
I
submitted
to
be
drawn
to
you
in
spite
of
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
how
low
my
self
-
respect
lies
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
hurt
and
angry
;
but
repressed
herself
in
consideration
of
his
suffering
,
and
of
his
being
her
brother
's
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
lies
under
his
feet
,
"
said
Bradley
,
unfolding
his
hands
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
fiercely
motioning
with
them
both
towards
the
stones
of
the
pavement
.
<EOS>
"
Remember
that
!
<EOS>
It
lies
under
that
fellow
's
feet
,
and
he
treads
upon
it
and
exults
above
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
not
!
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
does
!
"
said
Bradley
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
stood
before
him
face
to
face
,
and
he
crushed
me
down
in
the
dirt
of
his
contempt
,
and
walked
over
me
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
Because
he
knew
with
triumph
what
was
in
store
for
me
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
you
talk
quite
wildly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Quite
collectedly
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
I
say
too
well
.
<EOS>
Now
I
have
said
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
used
no
threat
,
remember
;
I
have
done
no
more
than
show
you
how
the
case
stands
;
---
how
the
case
stands
,
so
far
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
her
brother
sauntered
into
view
close
by
.
<EOS>
She
darted
to
him
,
and
caught
him
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
Bradley
followed
,
and
laid
his
heavy
hand
on
the
boy
's
opposite
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
Hexam
,
I
am
going
home
.
<EOS>
I
must
walk
home
by
myself
to
-
night
,
and
get
shut
up
in
my
room
without
being
spoken
to
.
<EOS>
Give
me
half
an
hour
's
start
,
and
let
me
be
,
till
you
find
me
at
my
work
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
my
work
in
the
morning
just
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Clasping
his
hands
,
he
uttered
a
short
unearthly
broken
cry
,
and
went
his
way
.
<EOS>
The
brother
and
sister
were
left
looking
at
one
another
near
a
lamp
in
the
solitary
churchyard
,
and
the
boy
's
face
clouded
and
darkened
,
as
he
said
in
a
rough
tone
:
"
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
<EOS>
What
have
you
done
to
my
best
friend
?
<EOS>
Out
with
the
truth
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Charley
!
"
said
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Speak
a
little
more
considerately
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
in
the
humour
for
consideration
,
or
for
nonsense
of
any
sort
,
"
replied
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
been
doing
?
<EOS>
Why
has
Mr.
Headstone
gone
from
us
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
asked
me
---
<EOS>
you
know
he
asked
me
---
to
be
his
wife
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
said
the
boy
,
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
was
obliged
to
tell
him
that
I
could
not
be
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
obliged
to
tell
him
,
"
repeated
the
boy
angrily
,
between
his
teeth
,
and
rudely
pushing
her
away
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
obliged
to
tell
him
!
<EOS>
Do
you
know
that
he
is
worth
fifty
of
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
easily
be
so
,
Charley
,
but
I
can
not
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
you
are
conscious
that
you
ca
n't
appreciate
him
,
and
do
n't
deserve
him
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
do
not
like
him
,
Charley
,
and
that
I
will
never
marry
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
,
"
exclaimed
the
boy
,
"
you
are
a
nice
picture
of
a
sister
!
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
,
you
are
a
pretty
piece
of
disinterestedness
!
<EOS>
And
so
all
my
endeavours
to
cancel
the
past
and
to
raise
myself
in
the
world
,
and
to
raise
you
with
me
,
are
to
be
beaten
down
by
your
low
whims
;
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
reproach
you
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
her
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
boy
,
looking
round
at
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
"
She
wo
n't
reproach
me
!
<EOS>
She
does
her
best
to
destroy
my
fortunes
and
her
own
,
and
she
wo
n't
reproach
me
!
<EOS>
Why
,
you
'll
tell
me
,
next
,
that
you
wo
n't
reproach
Mr.
Headstone
for
coming
out
of
the
sphere
to
which
he
is
an
ornament
,
and
putting
himself
at
your
feet
,
to
be
rejected
by
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Charley
;
I
will
only
tell
you
,
as
I
told
himself
,
that
I
thank
him
for
doing
so
,
that
I
am
sorry
he
did
so
,
and
that
I
hope
he
will
do
much
better
,
and
be
happy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Some
touch
of
compunction
smote
the
boy
's
hardening
heart
as
he
looked
upon
her
,
his
patient
little
nurse
in
infancy
,
his
patient
friend
,
adviser
,
and
reclaimer
in
boyhood
,
the
self
-
forgetting
sister
who
had
done
everything
for
him
.
<EOS>
His
tone
relented
,
and
he
drew
her
arm
through
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
come
,
Liz
;
do
n't
let
us
quarrel
:
let
us
be
reasonable
and
talk
this
over
like
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
Will
you
listen
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Charley
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
replied
through
her
starting
tears
;
"
do
I
not
listen
to
you
,
and
hear
many
hard
things
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
am
sorry
.
<EOS>
There
,
Liz
!
<EOS>
I
am
unfeignedly
sorry
.
<EOS>
Only
you
do
put
me
out
so
.
<EOS>
Now
see
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Headstone
is
perfectly
devoted
to
you
.
<EOS>
He
has
told
me
in
the
strongest
manner
that
he
has
never
been
his
old
self
for
one
single
minute
since
I
first
brought
him
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
Miss
Peecher
,
our
schoolmistress
---
pretty
and
young
,
and
all
that
---
is
known
to
be
very
much
attached
to
him
,
and
he
wo
n't
so
much
as
look
at
her
or
hear
of
her
.
<EOS>
Now
,
his
devotion
to
you
must
be
a
disinterested
one
;
must
n't
it
?
<EOS>
If
he
married
Miss
Peecher
,
he
would
be
a
great
deal
better
off
in
all
worldly
respects
,
than
in
marrying
you
.
<EOS>
Well
then
;
he
has
nothing
to
get
by
it
,
has
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
Heaven
knows
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
then
,
"
said
the
boy
;
"
that
's
something
in
his
favour
,
and
a
great
thing
.
<EOS>
Then
I
come
in
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Headstone
has
always
got
me
on
,
and
he
has
a
good
deal
in
his
power
,
and
of
course
if
he
was
my
brother
-
in
-
law
he
would
n't
get
me
on
less
,
but
would
get
me
on
more
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Headstone
comes
and
confides
in
me
,
in
a
very
delicate
way
,
and
says
,
`
`
I
hope
my
marrying
your
sister
would
be
agreeable
to
you
,
Hexam
,
and
useful
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
`
`
There
's
nothing
in
the
world
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
that
I
could
be
better
pleased
with
.
"
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Headstone
says
,
`
`
Then
I
may
rely
upon
your
intimate
knowledge
of
me
for
your
good
word
with
your
sister
,
Hexam
?
"
<EOS>
"
And
I
say
,
`
`
Certainly
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
and
naturally
I
have
a
good
deal
of
influence
with
her
.
"
<EOS>
"
So
I
have
;
have
n't
I
,
Liz
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Charley
.
"
  
"
Well
said
!
<EOS>
Now
,
you
see
,
we
begin
to
get
on
,
the
moment
we
begin
to
be
really
talking
it
over
,
like
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Then
you
come
in
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Headstone
's
wife
you
would
be
occupying
a
most
respectable
station
,
and
you
would
be
holding
a
far
better
place
in
society
than
you
hold
now
,
and
you
would
at
length
get
quit
of
the
river
-
side
and
the
old
disagreeables
belonging
to
it
,
and
you
would
be
rid
for
good
of
dolls
'
dressmakers
and
their
drunken
fathers
,
and
the
like
of
that
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
want
to
disparage
Miss
Jenny
Wren
:
I
dare
say
she
is
all
very
well
in
her
way
;
but
her
way
is
not
your
way
as
Mr.
Headstone
's
wife
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
see
,
Liz
,
on
all
three
accounts
---
on
Mr.
Headstone
's
,
on
mine
,
on
yours
---
nothing
could
be
better
or
more
desirable
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
walking
slowly
as
the
boy
spoke
,
and
here
he
stood
still
,
to
see
what
effect
he
had
made
.
<EOS>
His
sister
's
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
;
but
as
they
showed
no
yielding
,
and
as
she
remained
silent
,
he
walked
her
on
again
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
discomfiture
in
his
tone
as
he
resumed
,
though
he
tried
to
conceal
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Having
so
much
influence
with
you
,
Liz
,
as
I
have
,
perhaps
I
should
have
done
better
to
have
had
a
little
chat
with
you
in
the
first
instance
,
before
Mr.
Headstone
spoke
for
himself
.
<EOS>
But
really
all
this
in
his
favour
seemed
so
plain
and
undeniable
,
and
I
knew
you
to
have
always
been
so
reasonable
and
sensible
,
that
I
did
n't
consider
it
worth
while
.
<EOS>
Very
likely
that
was
a
mistake
of
mine
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
's
soon
set
right
.
<EOS>
All
that
need
be
done
to
set
it
right
,
is
for
you
to
tell
me
at
once
that
I
may
go
home
and
tell
Mr.
Headstone
that
what
has
taken
place
is
not
final
,
and
that
it
will
all
come
round
by
-
and
-
by
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
again
.
<EOS>
The
pale
face
looked
anxiously
and
lovingly
at
him
,
but
she
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
speak
?
"
said
the
boy
sharply
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
unwilling
to
speak
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
If
I
must
,
I
must
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
authorize
you
to
say
any
such
thing
to
Mr.
Headstone
:
I
can
not
allow
you
to
say
any
such
thing
to
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
Nothing
remains
to
be
said
to
him
from
me
,
after
what
I
have
said
for
good
and
all
,
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
this
girl
,
"
cried
the
boy
,
contemptuously
throwing
her
off
again
,
"
calls
herself
a
sister
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
,
dear
,
that
is
the
second
time
that
you
have
almost
struck
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
hurt
by
my
words
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
---
Heaven
forbid
!
---
<EOS>
that
you
intended
it
;
but
you
hardly
know
with
what
a
sudden
swing
you
removed
yourself
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
However
!
"
said
the
boy
,
taking
no
heed
of
the
remonstrance
,
and
pursuing
his
own
mortified
disappointment
,
"
I
know
what
this
means
,
and
you
shall
not
disgrace
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
means
what
I
have
told
you
,
Charley
,
and
nothing
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
true
,
"
said
the
boy
in
a
violent
tone
,
"
and
<EOS>
you
know
it
's
not
.
<EOS>
It
means
your
precious
Mr.
Wrayburn
;
that
's
what
it
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
!
<EOS>
If
you
remember
any
old
days
of
ours
together
,
forbear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
shall
not
disgrace
me
,
"
doggedly
pursued
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
determined
that
after
I
have
climbed
up
out
of
the
mire
,
you
shall
not
pull
me
down
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
disgrace
me
if
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
,
and
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charley
!
<EOS>
On
many
a
night
like
this
,
and
many
a
worse
night
,
I
have
sat
on
the
stones
of
the
street
,
hushing
you
in
my
arms
.
<EOS>
Unsay
those
words
without
even
saying
you
are
sorry
for
them
,
and
my
arms
are
open
to
you
still
,
and
so
is
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
unsay
them
.
<EOS>
I
'll
say
them
again
.
<EOS>
You
are
an
inveterately
bad
girl
,
and
a
false
sister
,
and
I
have
done
with
you
.
<EOS>
For
ever
,
I
have
done
with
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
threw
up
his
ungrateful
and
ungracious
hand
as
if
it
set
up
a
barrier
between
them
,
and
flung
himself
upon
his
heel
and
left
her
.
<EOS>
She
remained
impassive
on
the
same
spot
,
silent
and
motionless
,
until
the
striking
of
the
church
clock
roused
her
,
and
she
turned
away
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
with
the
breaking
up
of
her
immobility
came
the
breaking
up
of
the
waters
that
the
cold
heart
of
the
selfish
boy
had
frozen
.
<EOS>
And
"
O
that
I
were
lying
here
with
the
dead
!
"
<EOS>
and
"
O
Charley
,
Charley
,
that
this
should
be
the
end
of
our
pictures
in
the
fire
!
<EOS>
"
were
all
the
words
she
said
,
as
she
laid
her
face
in
her
hands
on
the
stone
coping
.
  
<EOS>
A
figure
passed
by
,
and
passed
on
,
but
stopped
and
looked
round
at
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
figure
of
an
old
man
with
a
bowed
head
,
wearing
a
large
brimmed
low
-
crowned
hat
,
and
a
long
-
skirted
coat
.
<EOS>
After
hesitating
a
little
,
the
figure
turned
back
,
and
,
advancing
with
an
air
of
gentleness
and
compassion
,
said
:
  
"
Pardon
me
,
young
woman
,
for
speaking
to
you
,
but
you
are
under
some
distress
of
mind
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
pass
upon
my
way
and
leave
you
weeping
here
alone
,
as
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
Can
I
help
you
?
<EOS>
Can
I
do
anything
to
give
you
comfort
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
raised
her
head
at
the
sound
of
these
kind
words
,
and
answered
gladly
,
"
O
,
Mr.
Riah
,
is
it
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
daughter
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
I
stand
amazed
!
<EOS>
I
spoke
as
to
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Take
my
arm
,
take
my
arm
.
<EOS>
What
grieves
you
?
<EOS>
Who
has
done
this
?
<EOS>
Poor
girl
,
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
has
quarrelled
with
me
,
"
sobbed
Lizzie
,
"
and
renounced
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
thankless
dog
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
go
.
<EOS>
Shake
the
dust
from
thy
feet
and
let
him
go
.
<EOS>
Come
,
daughter
!
<EOS>
Come
home
with
me
---
<EOS>
it
is
but
across
the
road
---
and
take
a
little
time
to
recover
your
peace
and
to
make
your
eyes
seemly
,
and
then
I
will
bear
you
company
through
the
streets
.
<EOS>
For
it
is
past
your
usual
time
,
and
will
soon
be
late
,
and
the
way
is
long
,
and
there
is
much
company
out
of
doors
to
-
night
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
accepted
the
support
he
offered
her
,
and
they
slowly
passed
out
of
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
the
act
of
emerging
into
the
main
thoroughfare
,
when
another
figure
loitering
discontentedly
by
,
and
looking
up
the
street
and
down
it
,
and
all
about
,
started
and
exclaimed
,
"
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
why
,
where
have
you
been
?
<EOS>
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
Eugene
Wrayburn
thus
addressed
her
,
she
drew
closer
to
the
Jew
,
and
bent
her
head
.
<EOS>
The
Jew
having
taken
in
the
whole
of
Eugene
at
one
sharp
glance
,
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
,
and
stood
mute
,
  
"
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
what
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
I
can
not
tell
you
now
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
tell
you
tonight
,
if
I
ever
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Pray
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Lizzie
,
I
came
expressly
to
join
you
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
walk
home
with
you
,
having
dined
at
a
coffee
-
house
in
this
neighbourhood
and
knowing
your
hour
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
been
lingering
about
,
"
added
Eugene
,
"
like
a
bailiff
;
or
,
"
with
a
look
at
Riah
,
"
an
old
clothesman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Jew
lifted
up
his
eyes
,
and
took
in
Eugene
once
more
,
at
another
glance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
pray
,
pray
,
leave
me
with
this
protector
.
<EOS>
And
one
thing
more
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
be
careful
of
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mysteries
of
Udolpho
!
"
said
Eugene
,
with
a
look
of
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
be
excused
for
asking
,
in
the
elderly
gentleman
's
presence
,
who
is
this
kind
protector
?
"
  
"
A
trustworthy
friend
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
relieve
him
of
his
trust
,
"
returned
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
tell
me
,
Lizzie
,
what
is
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
brother
is
the
matter
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
lifting
up
his
eyes
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
brother
the
matter
?
"
returned
Eugene
,
with
airy
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
Our
brother
is
not
worth
a
thought
,
far
less
a
tear
.
<EOS>
What
has
our
brother
done
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
lifted
up
his
eyes
again
,
with
one
grave
look
at
Wrayburn
,
and
one
grave
glance
at
Lizzie
,
as
she
stood
looking
down
.
<EOS>
Both
were
so
full
of
meaning
that
even
Eugene
was
checked
in
his
light
career
,
and
subsided
into
a
thoughtful
"
Humph
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
an
air
of
perfect
patience
<EOS>
the
old
man
,
remaining
mute
and
keeping
his
eyes
cast
down
,
stood
,
retaining
Lizzie
's
arm
,
as
though
,
in
his
habit
of
passive
endurance
,
it
would
be
all
one
to
him
if
he
had
stood
there
motionless
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
Mr.
Aaron
,
"
said
Eugene
,
who
soon
found
this
fatiguing
,
"
will
be
good
enough
to
relinquish
his
charge
to
me
<EOS>
,
he
will
be
quite
free
for
any
engagement
he
may
have
at
the
Synagogue
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Aaron
,
will
you
have
the
kindness
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
old
man
stood
stock
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
evening
,
Mr.
Aaron
,
"
said
Eugene
,
politely
;
"
we
need
not
detain
you
.
"
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Lizzie
,
"
Is
our
friend
Mr.
Aaron
a
little
deaf
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
hearing
is
very
good
,
Christian
gentleman
,
"
replied
the
old
man
,
calmly
;
"
but
I
will
hear
only
one
voice
to
-
night
,
desiring
me
to
leave
this
damsel
before
I
have
conveyed
her
to
her
home
.
<EOS>
If
she
requests
it
,
I
will
do
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
it
for
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
why
so
,
Mr.
Aaron
?
"
said
Eugene
,
quite
undisturbed
in
his
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
.
<EOS>
If
she
asks
me
,
I
will
tell
her
,
"
replied
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
no
one
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
ask
you
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
and
I
beg
you
to
take
me
home
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
I
have
had
a
bitter
trial
to
-
night
,
and
I
hope
you
will
not
think
me
ungrateful
,
or
mysterious
,
or
changeable
.
<EOS>
I
am
neither
;
I
am
wretched
.
<EOS>
Pray
remember
what
I
said
to
you
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
,
take
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Lizzie
,
"
he
returned
,
in
a
low
voice
,
bending
over
her
on
the
other
side
;
"
of
what
?
<EOS>
Of
whom
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
any
one
you
have
lately
seen
and
made
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
snapped
his
fingers
and
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
said
he
,
"
since
no
better
may
be
,
Mr.
Aaron
and
I
will
divide
this
trust
,
and
see
you
home
together
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Aaron
on
that
side
;
I
on
this
.
<EOS>
If
perfectly
agreeable
to
Mr.
Aaron
,
the
escort
will
now
proceed
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
knew
his
power
over
her
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
she
would
not
insist
upon
his
leaving
her
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
,
her
fears
for
him
being
aroused
,
she
would
be
uneasy
if
he
were
out
of
her
sight
.
<EOS>
For
all
his
seeming
levity
and
carelessness
,
he
knew
whatever
he
chose
to
know
of
the
thoughts
of
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
And
going
on
at
her
side
,
so
gaily
,
regardless
of
all
that
had
been
urged
against
him
;
so
superior
in
his
sallies
and
self
-
possession
to
the
gloomy
constraint
of
her
suitor
and
the
selfish
petulance
of
her
brother
;
so
faithful
to
her
,
as
it
seemed
,
when
her
own
stock
was
faithless
;
what
an
immense
advantage
,
what
an
overpowering
influence
,
were
his
that
night
!
<EOS>
Add
to
the
rest
,
poor
girl
,
that
she
had
heard
him
vilified
for
her
sake
,
and
that
she
had
suffered
for
his
,
and
where
the
wonder
that
his
occasional
tones
of
serious
interest
(
setting
off
his
carelessness
,
as
if
it
were
assumed
to
calm
her
)
,
that
his
lightest
touch
,
his
lightest
look
,
his
very
presence
beside
her
in
the
dark
common
street
,
were
like
glimpses
of
an
enchanted
world
,
which
it
was
natural
for
jealousy
and
malice
and
all
meanness
to
be
unable
to
bear
the
brightness
of
,
and
to
gird
at
as
bad
spirits
might
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
more
being
said
of
repairing
to
Riah
's
,
they
went
direct
to
Lizzie
's
lodging
.
<EOS>
A
little
short
of
the
house
-
door
she
parted
from
them
,
and
went
in
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Aaron
,
"
said
Eugene
,
when
they
were
left
together
in
the
street
,
"
with
many
thanks
for
your
company
,
it
remains
for
me
unwillingly
to
say
Farewell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
<EOS>
I
give
you
good
night
,
and
I
wish
that
you
were
not
so
thoughtless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Aaron
,
"
returned
Eugene
,
"
I
give
you
good
night
,
and
I
wish
(
for
you
are
a
little
dull
)
that
you
were
not
so
thoughtful
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
now
,
that
his
part
was
played
out
for
the
evening
,
and
when
in
turning
his
back
upon
the
Jew
he
came
off
the
stage
,
he
was
thoughtful
himself
.
<EOS>
"
How
did
Lightwood
's
catechism
run
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
murmured
,
as
he
stopped
to
light
his
cigar
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
What
are
you
doing
?
<EOS>
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
We
shall
soon
know
now
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
with
a
heavy
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
The
heavy
sigh
was
repeated
as
if
by
an
echo
,
an
hour
afterwards
,
when
Riah
,
who
had
been
sitting
on
some
dark
steps
in
a
corner
over
against
the
house
,
arose
and
went
his
patient
way
;
stealing
through
the
streets
in
his
ancient
dress
,
like
the
ghost
of
a
departed
Time
.
   
<EOS>
AN
ANNIVERSARY
OCCASION
.
 
<EOS>
The
estimable
Twemlow
,
dressing
himself
in
his
lodgings
over
the
stable
-
yard
in
Duke
Street
,
Saint
James
's
,
and
hearing
the
horses
at
their
toilette
below
,
finds
himself
on
the
whole
in
a
disadvantageous
position
as
compared
with
the
noble
animals
at
livery
.
<EOS>
For
whereas
,
on
the
one
hand
,
he
has
no
attendant
to
slap
him
soundingly
and
require
him
in
gruff
accents
to
come
up
and
come
over
,
still
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
has
no
attendant
at
all
;
and
the
mild
gentleman
's
finger
-
joints
and
other
joints
working
rustily
in
the
morning
,
he
could
deem
it
agreeable
even
to
be
tied
up
by
the
countenance
at
his
chamberdoor
,
so
he
were
there
skilfully
rubbed
down
and
slushed
and
sluiced
and
polished
and
clothed
,
while
himself
taking
merely
a
passive
part
in
these
trying
transactions
.
  
<EOS>
How
the
fascinating
Tippins
gets
on
when
arraying
herself
for
the
bewilderment
of
the
senses
of
men
,
is
known
only
to
the
Graces
and
her
maid
;
but
perhaps
even
that
engaging
creature
,
though
not
reduced
to
the
self
-
dependence
of
Twemlow
,
could
dispense
with
a
good
deal
of
the
trouble
attendant
on
the
daily
restoration
of
her
charms
,
seeing
that
as
to
her
face
and
neck
this
adorable
divinity
is
,
as
it
were
,
a
diurnal
species
of
lobster
---
throwing
off
a
shell
every
forenoon
,
and
needing
to
keep
in
a
retired
spot
until
the
new
crust
hardens
.
  
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
Twemlow
doth
at
length
invest
himself
with
collar
and
cravat
and
wristbands
to
his
knuckles
,
and
goeth
forth
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
And
to
breakfast
with
whom
but
his
near
neighbours
,
the
Lammles
of
Sackville
Street
,
who
have
imparted
to
him
that
he
will
meet
his
distant
kinsman
,
Mr.
Fledgely
.
<EOS>
The
awful
Snigsworth
might
taboo
and
prohibit
Fledgely
,
but
the
peaceable
Twemlow
reasons
,
"
If
he
is
my
kinsman
I
did
n't
make
him
so
,
and
to
meet
a
man
is
not
to
know
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
first
anniversary
of
the
happy
marriage
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
,
and
the
celebration
is
a
breakfast
,
because
a
dinner
on
the
desired
scale
of
sumptuosity
can
not
be
achieved
within
less
limits
than
those
of
the
non
-
existent
palatial
residence
of
which
so
many
people
are
madly
envious
.
<EOS>
So
,
Twemlow
trips
with
not
a
little
stiffness
across
Piccadilly
,
sensible
of
having
once
been
more
upright
in
figure
and
less
in
danger
of
being
knocked
down
by
swift
vehicles
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
that
was
in
the
days
when
he
hoped
for
leave
from
the
dread
Snigs
-
worth
to
do
something
,
or
be
something
,
in
life
,
and
before
that
magnificent
Tartar
issued
the
ukase
,
"
As
he
will
never
distinguish
himself
,
he
must
be
a
poor
gentleman
-
pensioner
of
mine
,
and
let
him
hereby
consider
himself
pensioned
.
"
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
Twemlow
!
<EOS>
Say
,
little
feeble
grey
personage
,
what
thoughts
are
in
thy
breast
to
-
day
,
of
the
Fancy
---
<EOS>
so
still
to
call
her
who
bruised
thy
heart
when
it
was
green
and
<EOS>
thy
head
brown
---
and
whether
it
be
better
or
worse
,
more
painful
or
less
,
to
believe
in
the
Fancy
to
this
hour
,
than
to
know
her
for
a
greedy
armour
-
plated
crocodile
,
with
no
more
capacity
of
imagining
the
delicate
and
sensitive
and
tender
spot
behind
thy
waistcoat
,
than
of
going
straight
at
it
with
a
knitting
-
needle
.
<EOS>
Say
likewise
,
my
Twemlow
,
whether
it
be
the
happier
lot
to
be
a
poor
relation
of
the
great
,
or
to
stand
in
the
wintry
slush
giving
the
hack
horses
to
drink
out
of
the
shallow
tub
at
the
coach
-
stand
,
into
which
thou
hast
so
nearly
set
thy
uncertain
foot
.
<EOS>
Twemlow
says
nothing
,
and
goes
on
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
approaches
the
Lammles
'
door
,
drives
up
a
little
one
-
horse
carriage
,
containing
Tippins
the
divine
.
<EOS>
Tippins
,
letting
down
the
window
,
playfully
extols
the
vigilance
of
her
cavalier
in
being
in
waiting
there
to
hand
her
out
.
<EOS>
Twemlow
hands
her
out
with
as
much
polite
gravity
as
if
she
were
anything
real
,
and
they
proceed
upstairs
:
<EOS>
Tippins
all
abroad
about
the
legs
,
and
seeking
to
express
that
those
unsteady
articles
are
only
skipping
in
their
native
buoyancy
.
  
<EOS>
And
dear
Mrs.
Lammle
and
dear
Mr.
Lammle
<EOS>
,
how
do
you
do

<EOS>
And
Mortimer

blotted
out
from

wretch

<EOS>
And
Mr.
Wrayburn

you
here

<EOS>
What

come
for

because
we

all
very
sure

that
you
are
not
going

<EOS>
And
Veneering

M.P.

how

going
on
down

those
terrible

<EOS>
And
Mrs.
Veneering

can
it
positively
be
true

you
go
down
to
that
stifling
place
night

to
hear
those

prose

<EOS>
Talking

Veneering

why
do
n't
you
prose

for
you
have

Thus
Tippins

and
surveys
Fledgeby
and
outsiders
through
golden

<EOS>
murmuring
as

turns
about

Mr.

as
dying

<EOS>
Fledgeby

has
the
air

,
and
of
desolation
,
backs
on
Brewer
,
makes
the
tour
of
Boots
,
and
fades
into
the
extreme
background
,
feeling
for
his
whisker
,
as
if
it
might
have
turned
up
since
he
was
there
five
minutes
ago
.
  
<EOS>
But
Lammle
has
him
out
again
before
he
has
so
much
as
completely
ascertained
the
bareness
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
He
would
seem
to
be
in
a
bad
way
,
Fledgeby
;
for
Lammle
represents
him
as
dying
again
.
<EOS>
He
is
dying
now
,
of
want
of
presentation
to
Twemlow
.
  
<EOS>
Twemlow
offers
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Glad
to
see
him
.
"
<EOS>
Your
mother
,
sir
,
was
a
connexion
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
so
,
"
says
Fledgeby
,
"
but
my
mother
and
her
family
were
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
staying
in
town
?
"
asks
Twemlow
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
always
am
,
"
says
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
like
town
,
"
says
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
But
is
felled
flat
by
Fledgeby
's
taking
it
quite
ill
,
and
replying
,
<EOS>
No
,
he
do
n't
like
town
.
<EOS>
Lammle
tries
to
break
the
force
of
the
fall
,
by
remarking
that
some
people
do
not
like
town
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
retorting
that
he
never
heard
of
any
such
case
but
his
own
,
Twemlow
goes
down
again
heavily
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
new
this
morning
,
I
suppose
?
"
says
Twemlow
,
returning
to
the
mark
with
great
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
Fledgeby
has
not
heard
of
anything
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
there
's
not
a
word
of
news
,
"
says
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
particle
,
"
adds
Boots
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
an
atom
,
"
chimes
in
Brewer
.
  
<EOS>
Somehow
the
execution
of
this
little
concerted
piece
appears
to
raise
the
general
spirits
as
with
a
sense
of
duty
done
,
and
sets
the
company
a
going
.
<EOS>
Everybody
seems
more
equal
than
before
,
to
the
calamity
of
being
in
the
society
of
everybody
else
.
<EOS>
Even
Eugene
standing
in
a
window
,
moodily
swinging
the
tassel
of
a
blind
,
gives
it
a
smarter
jerk
now
,
as
if
he
found
himself
in
better
case
.
  
<EOS>
Breakfast
announced
.
<EOS>
Everything
on
table
showy
and
gaudy
,
but
with
a
self
-
assertingly
temporary
and
nomadic
air
on
the
decorations
,
as
boasting
that
they
will
be
much
more
showy
and
gaudy
in
the
palatial
residence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
's
own
particular
servant
behind
his
chair
;
the
Analytical
behind
Veneering
's
chair
;
instances
in
point
that
such
servants
fall
into
two
classes
:
<EOS>
one
mistrusting
the
master
's
acquaintances
,
and
the
other
mistrusting
the
master
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
's
servant
,
of
the
second
class
.
<EOS>
Appearing
to
be
lost
in
wonder
and
low
spirits
because
the
police
are
so
long
in
coming
to
take
his
master
up
on
some
charge
of
the
first
magnitude
.
  
<EOS>
Veneering
,
M.P.
,
on
the
right
of
Mrs.
Lammle
;
Twemlow
on
her
left
;
Mrs.
Veneering
,
W.M.P.
(
wife
of
Member
of
Parliament
)
,
and
Lady
Tippins
on
Mr.
Lammle
's
right
and
left
.
<EOS>
But
be
sure
that
well
within
the
fascination
of
Mr.
Lammle
's
eye
and
smile
sits
little
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
And
be
sure
that
close
to
little
Georgiana
,
also
under
inspection
by
the
same
gingerous
gentleman
,
sits
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
Oftener
than
twice
or
thrice
while
breakfast
is
in
progress
,
Mr.
Twemlow
gives
a
little
sudden
turn
towards
Mrs.
Lammle
,
and
then
says
to
her
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
not
being
Twemlow
's
usual
way
,
why
is
it
his
way
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
Why
,
the
truth
is
,
Twemlow
repeatedly
labours
under
the
impression
that
Mrs.
Lammle
is
going
to
speak
to
him
,
and
turning
finds
that
it
is
not
so
,
and
mostly
that
she
has
her
eyes
upon
Veneering
.
<EOS>
Strange
that
this
impression
so
abides
by
Twemlow
after
being
corrected
,
yet
<EOS>
so
it
is
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Tippins
partaking
plentifully
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
(
including
grape
-
juice
in
the
category
)
becomes
livelier
,
and
applies
herself
to
elicit
sparks
from
Mortimer
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
It
is
always
understood
among
the
initiated
,
that
that
faithless
lover
must
be
planted
at
table
opposite
to
Lady
Tippins
,
who
will
then
strike
conversational
fire
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
In
a
pause
of
mastication
and
deglutition
,
Lady
Tippins
,
contemplating
Mortimer
,
recalls
that
it
was
at
our
dear
Veneerings
,
and
in
the
presence
of
a
party
who
are
surely
all
here
,
that
he
told
them
his
story
of
the
man
from
somewhere
,
which
afterwards
became
so
horribly
interesting
and
vulgarly
popular
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Lady
Tippins
,
"
assents
Mortimer
;
"
as
they
say
on
the
stage
,
Even
so
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
expect
you
,
"
retorts
the
charmer
,
"
to
sustain
your
reputation
,
and
tell
us
something
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lady
Tippins
,
I
exhausted
myself
for
life
that
day
,
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
got
out
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
parries
thus
,
with
a
sense
upon
him
that
elsewhere
it
is
Eugene
and
not
he
who
is
the
jester
,
and
that
in
these
circles
where
Eugene
persists
in
being
speechless
,
he
,
Mortimer
,
is
but
the
double
of
the
friend
on
whom
he
has
founded
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
quoth
the
fascinating
Tippins
<EOS>
,
"
I
am
resolved
on
getting
something
more
out
of
you
.
<EOS>
Traitor
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
I
hear
about
another
disappearance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
it
is
you
who
have
heard
it
,
"
returns
Lightwood
,
"
perhaps
you
'll
tell
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Monster
,
away
!
<EOS>
"
retorts
Lady
Tippins
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
own
Golden
Dustman
referred
me
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
,
striking
in
here
,
proclaims
aloud
that
there
is
a
sequel
to
the
story
of
the
man
from
somewhere
.
<EOS>
Silence
ensues
upon
the
proclamation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
"
says
Lightwood
,
glancing
round
the
table
,
"
I
have
nothing
to
tell
.
"
<EOS>
But
Eugene
adding
in
a
low
voice
,
"
There
,
tell
it
,
tell
it
!
"
<EOS>
he
corrects
himself
with
the
addition
,
"
Nothing
worth
mentioning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Boots
and
Brewer
immediately
perceive
that
it
is
immensely
worth
mentioning
,
and
become
politely
clamorous
.
<EOS>
Veneering
is
also
visited
by
a
perception
to
the
same
effect
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
understood
that
his
attention
is
now
rather
used
up
,
and
difficult
to
hold
,
that
being
the
tone
of
the
House
of
Commons
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
n't
be
at
the
trouble
of
composing
yourselves
to
listen
,
"
 
says
Mortimer
Lightwood
,
"
because
I
shall
have
finished
long
before
you
have
fallen
into
comfortable
attitudes
.
<EOS>
It
's
like
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
,
"
impatiently
interrupts
Eugene
,
"
the
children
's
narrative
:
   
"
<EOS>
`
`
I
'll
tell
you
a
story
  
<EOS>
Of
Jack
<EOS>
a
Manory
,
  
<EOS>
And
now
my
story
's
begun
;
  
I
'll
tell
you
another
  
Of
Jack
and
his
brother
,
  
<EOS>
And
now
my
story
is
done
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
---
Get
on
,
and
get
it
over
!
"
  
<EOS>
Eugene
says
this
with
a
sound
of
vexation
in
his
voice
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
balefully
at
Lady
Tippins
,
who
nods
to
him
as
her
dear
Bear
,
and
playfully
insinuates
that
she
(
a
self
-
evident
proposition
)
is
Beauty
,
and
he
Beast
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
reference
,
"
proceeds
Mortimer
,
"
which
I
suppose
to
be
made
by
my
honorable
and
fair
enslaver
opposite
,
is
to
the
following
circumstance
.
<EOS>
Very
lately
,
the
young
woman
,
Lizzie
Hexam
,
daughter
of
the
late
Jesse
Hexam
,
otherwise
Gaffer
,
who
will
be
remembered
to
have
found
the
body
of
the
man
from
somewhere
,
mysteriously
received
,
she
knew
not
from
whom
,
an
explicit
retractation
of
the
charges
made
against
her
father
,
by
another
water
-
side
character
of
the
name
of
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
Nobody
believed
them
,
because
little
Rogue
Riderhood
---
I
am
tempted
into
the
paraphrase
by
remembering
the
charming
wolf
who
would
have
rendered
society
a
great
service
if
he
had
devoured
Mr.
Riderhood
's
father
and
mother
in
their
infancy
---
had
previously
played
fast
and
loose
with
the
said
charges
,
and
,
in
fact
,
abandoned
them
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
retractation
I
have
mentioned
found
its
way
into
Lizzie
Hexam
's
hands
,
with
a
general
flavour
on
it
of
having
been
favoured
by
some
anonymous
messenger
in
a
dark
cloak
and
slouched
hat
,
and
was
by
her
forwarded
,
in
her
father
's
vindication
,
to
Mr.
Boffin
,
my
client
.
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
the
phraseology
of
the
shop
,
but
as
I
never
had
another
client
,
and
in
all
likelihood
never
shall
have
,
I
am
rather
proud
of
him
as
a
natural
curiosity
probably
unique
.
"
  
<EOS>
Although
as
easy
as
usual
on
the
surface
,
Lightwood
is
not
quite
as
easy
as
usual
below
it
.
<EOS>
With
an
air
of
not
minding
Eugene
at
all
,
he
feels
that
the
subject
is
not
altogether
a
safe
one
in
that
connexion
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
natural
curiosity
which
forms
the
sole
ornament
of
my
professional
museum
,
"
he
resumes
,
"
hereupon
desires
his
Secretary
---
  
an
individual
of
the
hermit
-
crab
or
oyster
species
,
and
whose
name
,
I
think
,
is
Chokesmith
---
but
it
does
n't
in
the
least
matter
<EOS>
---
say
Artichoke
---
to
put
himself
in
communication
with
Lizzie
Hexam
.
<EOS>
Artichoke
professes
his
readiness
so
to
do
,
endeavours
to
do
so
,
but
fails
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
fails
?
"
asks
Boots
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
fails
?
"
asks
Brewer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
"
returns
Lightwood
,
"
I
must
postpone
the
reply
for
one
moment
,
or
we
shall
have
an
anti
-
climax
.
<EOS>
Artichoke
failing
signally
,
my
client
refers
the
task
to
me
:
his
purpose
being
to
advance
the
interests
of
the
object
of
his
search
.
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
put
myself
in
communication
with
her
;
I
even
happen
to
possess
some
special
means
,
"
with
a
glance
at
Eugene
,
"
of
putting
myself
in
communication
with
her
;
but
I
fail
too
,
because
she
has
vanished
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Vanished
!
<EOS>
"
is
the
general
echo
.
  
<EOS>
"
Disappeared
,
"
says
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
knows
how
,
nobody
knows
when
,
nobody
knows
where
.
<EOS>
And
so
ends
the
story
to
which
my
honorable
and
fair
enslaver
opposite
referred
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tippins
,
with
a
bewitching
little
scream
,
opines
that
we
shall
<EOS>
every
one
of
us
be
murdered
in
our
beds
.
<EOS>
Eugene
eyes
her
as
if
some
of
us
would
be
enough
for
him
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
,
W.M.P.
,
remarks
that
these
social
mysteries
make
one
afraid
of
leaving
Baby
.
<EOS>
Veneering
,
M.P.
,
wishes
to
be
informed
(
with
something
of
a
second
-
hand
air
of
seeing
the
Right
Honorable
Gentleman
at
the
head
of
the
Home
Department
in
his
place
)
whether
it
is
intended
to
be
conveyed
that
the
vanished
person
has
been
spirited
away
or
otherwise
harmed
?
<EOS>
Instead
of
Lightwood
's
answering
,
Eugene
answers
,
and
answers
hastily
and
vexedly
:
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
;
he
does
n't
mean
that
;
 
he
means
voluntarily
vanished
---
but
utterly
---
completely
.
"
  
<EOS>
However
,
the
great
subject
of
the
happiness
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
must
not
be
allowed
to
vanish
with
the
other
vanishments
 
---
with
the
vanishing
of
the
murderer
,
the
vanishing
of
Julius
Handford
,
the
vanishing
of
Lizzie
Hexam
,
---
and
therefore
Veneering
must
recal
the
present
sheep
to
the
pen
from
which
they
have
strayed
.
<EOS>
Who
so
fit
to
discourse
of
the
happiness
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
,
they
being
the
dearest
and
oldest
friends
he
has
in
the
world
;
or
what
audience
so
fit
for
him
to
take
into
his
confidence
as
that
audience
,
a
noun
of
multitude
or
signifying
many
,
who
are
all
the
oldest
and
dearest
friends
he
has
in
the
world
?
<EOS>
So
Veneering
,
without
the
formality
of
rising
,
launches
into
a
familiar
oration
,
gradually
toning
into
the
Parliamentary
sing
-
song
,
in
which
he
sees
at
that
board
his
dear
friend
Twemlow
who
on
that
day
twelvemonth
bestowed
on
his
dear
friend
Lammle
the
fair
hand
of
his
dear
friend
Sophronia
,
and
in
which
he
also
sees
at
that
board
his
dear
friends
Boots
and
Brewer
whose
rallying
round
him
at
a
period
when
his
dear
friend
Lady
Tippins
likewise
rallied
round
him
 
---
ay
,
and
in
the
foremost
rank
---
he
can
never
forget
while
memory
holds
her
seat
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
free
to
confess
that
he
misses
from
that
board
his
dear
old
friend
Podsnap
,
though
he
is
well
represented
by
his
dear
young
friend
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
And
he
further
sees
at
that
board
(
this
he
announces
with
pomp
,
as
if
exulting
in
the
powers
of
an
extraordinary
telescope
)
<EOS>
his
friend
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
if
he
will
permit
him
to
call
him
so
.
<EOS>
For
all
of
these
reasons
,
and
many
more
which
he
right
well
knows
will
have
occurred
to
persons
of
your
exceptional
acuteness
,
he
is
here
to
submit
to
you
that
the
time
has
arrived
when
,
with
our
hearts
in
our
glasses
,
with
tears
in
our
eyes
,
with
blessings
on
our
lips
,
and
in
a
general
way
with
a
profusion
of
gammon
and
spinach
in
our
emotional
larders
,
we
should
one
and
all
drink
to
our
dear
friends
the
Lammles
,
wishing
them
many
many
years
as
happy
as
the
last
,
and
many
many
friends
as
congenially
 
united
as
themselves
.
<EOS>
And
this
he
will
add
;
that
Anastatia
Veneering
(
who
is
instantly
heard
to
weep
)
is
formed
on
the
same
model
as
her
old
and
chosen
friend
Sophronia
Lammle
,
in
respect
that
she
is
devoted
to
the
man
who
wooed
and
won
her
,
and
nobly
discharges
the
duties
of
a
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Seeing
no
better
way
out
of
it
,
Veneering
here
pulls
up
his
oratorical
Pegasus
extremely
short
,
and
plumps
down
,
clean
over
his
head
,
with
:
"
Lammle
,
God
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Lammle
.
<EOS>
Too
much
of
him
every
way
;
pervadingly
too
much
nose
of
a
coarse
wrong
shape
,
and
his
nose
in
his
mind
and
his
manners
;
too
much
smile
to
be
real
;
too
much
frown
to
be
false
;
 
too
many
large
teeth
to
be
visible
at
once
without
suggesting
a
bite
.
<EOS>
He
thanks
you
,
dear
friends
,
for
your
kindly
greeting
,
and
hopes
to
receive
you
---
it
may
be
on
the
next
of
these
delightful
occasions
---
in
a
residence
better
suited
to
your
claims
on
the
rites
of
hospitality
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
forget
that
at
Veneering
's
he
first
saw
Sophronia
.
<EOS>
Sophronia
will
never
forget
that
at
Veneering
's
she
first
saw
him
.
<EOS>
They
spoke
of
it
soon
after
they
were
married
,
and
agreed
that
they
would
never
forget
it
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
to
Veneering
they
owe
their
union
.
<EOS>
They
hope
to
show
their
sense
of
this
some
day
(
"
No
,
no
,
"
from
Veneering
)
---
<EOS>
oh
yes
,
yes
,
and
let
him
rely
upon
it
,
they
will
if
they
can
!
<EOS>
His
marriage
with
Sophronia
was
not
a
marriage
of
interest
on
either
side
:
she
had
her
little
fortune
,
he
had
his
little
fortune
:
they
joined
their
little
fortunes
:
it
was
a
marriage
of
pure
inclination
and
suitability
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
!
<EOS>
Sophronia
and
<EOS>
he
are
fond
of
the
society
of
young
people
;
but
he
is
not
sure
that
their
house
would
be
a
good
house
for
young
people
proposing
to
remain
single
,
since
the
contemplation
of
its
domestic
bliss
might
induce
them
to
change
their
minds
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
apply
this
to
any
one
present
;
certainly
not
to
their
darling
little
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
Again
thank
you
!
<EOS>
Neither
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
will
he
apply
it
to
his
friend
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
He
thanks
Veneering
for
the
feeling
manner
in
which
he
referred
to
their
common
friend
Fledgeby
,
for
he
holds
that
gentleman
in
the
highest
estimation
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
In
fact
(
returning
uexpectedly
to
Fledgeby
)
,
the
better
you
know
him
,
the
more
you
find
in
him
that
you
desire
to
know
.
<EOS>
Again
thank
you
!
<EOS>
In
his
dear
Sophronia
's
name
and
in
his
own
,
thank
you
!
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
has
sat
quite
still
,
with
her
eyes
cast
down
upon
the
table
-
cloth
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Lammle
's
address
ends
,
Twemlow
once
more
turns
to
her
involuntarily
,
not
cured
yet
of
that
often
recurring
impression
that
she
is
going
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
This
time
she
really
is
going
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
Veneering
is
talking
with
his
other
next
neighbour
,
and
she
speaks
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Twemlow
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
answers
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
?
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
<EOS>
Still
a
little
doubtful
,
because
of
her
not
looking
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
soul
of
a
gentleman
,
and
I
know
I
may
trust
you
.
<EOS>
Will
you
give
me
the
opportunity
of
saying
a
few
words
to
you
when
you
come
up
stairs
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Assuredly
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
honored
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
seem
to
do
so
,
if
you
please
,
and
do
n't
think
it
inconsistent
if
my
manner
should
be
more
careless
than
my
words
.
<EOS>
I
may
be
watched
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Intensely
astonished
,
Twemlow
puts
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
and
sinks
back
in
his
chair
meditating
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
rises
.
<EOS>
All
rise
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
go
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
soon
saunter
after
them
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
has
devoted
the
interval
to
taking
an
observation
of
Boots
's
whiskers
,
Brewer
's
whiskers
,
and
Lammle
's
whiskers
,
and
considering
which
pattern
of
whisker
he
would
prefer
to
produce
out
of
himself
by
friction
,
if
the
Genie
of
the
cheek
would
only
answer
to
his
rubbing
.

In

flutter
like

around

Mrs.
Lammle
,
on
a
sofa
by
a

,
invites
Mr.
Twemlow
's
attention
to
a
book
of
portraits
in
her
hand

<EOS>
Mr.
Twemlow
takes
his
station
on
a
settee
before
her
,
and
Mrs.
Lammle
shows
him
a
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
reason
to
be
surprised

"
she
says
softly
,
"
but
I
wish
you
would
n't
look
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Disturbed
Twemlow
,
making
an
effort
not
to
look
so
,
looks
much
more
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
Mr.
Twemlow
,
you
never
saw
that
distant
connexion
of
yours
before
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
never
.
"
  
"
Now
that
you
do
see
him
,
you
see
what
he
is
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
proud
of
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
say
the
truth
,
Mrs.
Lammle
,
no
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
more
of
him
,
you
would
be
less
inclined
to
acknowledge
him
.
<EOS>
Here
is
another
portrait
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Twemlow
has
just
presence
of
mind
enough
to
say
aloud
:
"
Very
like
!
<EOS>
Uncommonly
like
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
noticed
,
perhaps
,
whom
he
favours
with
his
attentions
?
<EOS>
You
notice
where
he
is
now
,
and
how
engaged
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Lammle
---
"
  
She
darts
a
look
at
him
which
he
can
not
comprehend
,
and
shows
him
another
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
;
is
it
not

"
  
"
<EOS>
Charming
!

says
Twemlow
.
  
<EOS>

So
like
as
to
be
almost
a
caricature
?

<EOS>
Mr.
Twemlow
,
it
is
impossible
to
tell
you
what
the
struggle
in
my
mind
has
been
,
before
I
could
bring
myself
to
speak
to
you
as
I
do
now
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
in
the
conviction
that
I
may
trust
you
never
to
betray
me
,
that
I
can
proceed
.
<EOS>
Sincerely
promise
me
that
you
never
will
betray
my
confidence
 
---
that
you
will
respect
it
,
even
though
you
may
no
longer
respect
me

and
I
shall
be
as
satisfied
as

it

<EOS>
Mr.

I

<EOS>
That
child

<EOS>

Georgiana

<EOS>
She
will
be
sacrificed

<EOS>
She
will
be
inveigled
and
married
to
that
connexion
of
yours
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
partnership
affair
,
a
money
-
speculation
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
strength
of
will
or
character
to
help
herself
,
and
she
is
on
the
brink
of
being
sold
into
wretchedness
for

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Amazing
!
<EOS>
But
what
can
I
do
to
prevent
it

demands
Twemlow
,
shocked
and
bewildered
to
the
last
degree

<EOS>
"
Here
is
another
portrait

<EOS>
And
not

it

Aghast
at
the
light
manner
of
her
throwing
her
head
back
to
look
at
it
critically
<EOS>
,
Twemlow
still
dimly
perceives
the
expediency
of
throwing
his
own
head
back
,
and
does
so
.
<EOS>
Though
he
no
more
sees
the
portrait
than
if
it
were
in
China
.
  
<EOS>
"
Decidedly
not
good

"
says
Mrs.

.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Stiff

exaggerated

<EOS>
And
ex

But
Twemlow

in

can

trails
off
into

actly
so

<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
Twemlow
,
your
word
will
have
weight
with
her
pompous

self

blinded
father

You
know
how
much
he
makes
of
your

Lose

Warn
him

But
warn
him
against

Against
me

<EOS>
By
great
good
fortune
Twemlow
receives
a
stimulant
at
this
critical
instant
.
<EOS>
The
stimulant
is
Lammle
's
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sophronia

you

puts

takes

turns
the
leaves

presents
the

Twemlow

That
is
the
last
of
Mr.

Do
you
think
it
good

Warn
her
father
against
me

I
deserve
it

for
I
have
been
in
the

the
first

It
is
my
husband

scheme

your
connexion

mine

I
tell
you
this

only
to
show
you
the
necessity
of
the
poor
little
foolish
affectionate
creature
's
being
befriended
and
rescued

<EOS>
You
will
not
repeat
this
to
her
father

<EOS>
You
will
spare
me
so
far
,
and
spare
my
husband

<EOS>
For

though
this
celebration
of

all
a
mockery

he

Twemlow

in
a
stunned

feigns
to
compare
the
portrait
in

the
original
looking

Very

On

stammers

falters
over

his
glass
at
his
eye

<EOS>
How
warn
her
father

Tell

<EOS>
Tell

how
little

tell
him
you

Tell
him
any

You

up

Mr.

sudden
degradation

familiar

degradation

keenly
feel
the
change

must
have
come
upon

in
yours

in

last
few
moments

But
I
trust
to
your
good
faith
with
me

I
began

If
you
knew
how
often
I
have
tried

speak
to
you
to

you
would
almost
pity
me

<EOS>
I
want
no
new
promise
from
you
on
my
own
account

for
I
am
satisfied

and
I
always
shall
be
satisfied

with
the
promise
you
have
given
me

<EOS>
I
can
venture
to
say
no
more

for
I
see
that
I
am
watched

If
you
would
set
my
mind
at
rest
with
the
assurance
that
you
will
interpose
with
the
father
and
save
this
harmless
girl

close
that
book

you
return
it

looking

The

Twemlow
drops
his

at
its

rises

closes
the

an
emphasis

irritated
lungs
,
was
blinking
,
wheezing
,
and
choking
;
inanimate
London
was
a
sooty
spectre
,
divided
in
purpose
between
being
visible
and
invisible
,
and
so
being
wholly
neither
.
<EOS>
Gaslights
flared
in
the
shops
with
a
haggard
and
unblest
air
,
as
knowing
themselves
to
be
night
-
creatures
that
had
no
business
abroad
under
the
sun
;
while
the
sun
itself
,
when
it
was
for
a
few
moments
dimly
indicated
through
circling
eddies
of
fog
,
showed
as
if
it
had
gone
out
and
were
collapsing
flat
and
cold
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
surrounding
country
it
was
a
foggy
day
,
but
there
the
fog
was
grey
,
whereas
in
London
it
was
,
at
about
the
boundary
line
,
dark
yellow
,
and
a
little
within
it
brown
,
and
then
browner
,
and
then
browner
,
until
at
the
heart
of
the
City
 
---
which
call
Saint
Mary
Axe
---
it
was
rusty
-
black
.
<EOS>
From
any
point
of
the
high
ridge
of
land
northward
,
it
might
have
been
discerned
that
the
loftiest
buildings
made
an
occasional
struggle
to
get
their
heads
above
the
foggy
sea
,
and
especially
that
the
great
dome
of
Saint
Paul
's
seemed
to
die
hard
;
but
this
was
not
perceivable
in
the
streets
at
their
feet
,
where
the
whole
metropolis
was
a
heap
of
vapour
charged
with
muffled
sound
of
wheels
,
and
enfolding
a
gigantic
catarrh
.
  
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
on
such
a
morning
,
the
place
of
business
of
Pubsey
and
Co.
was
not
the
liveliest
object
even
in
Saint
Mary
Axe
---
which
is
not
a
very
lively
spot
---
with
a
sobbing
gaslight
in
the
countinghouse
window
,
and
a
burglarious
stream
of
fog
creeping
in
to
strangle
it
through
the
keyhole
of
the
main
door
.
<EOS>
But
the
light
went
out
,
and
the
main
door
opened
,
and
Riah
came
forth
with
a
bag
under
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Almost
in
the
act
of
coming
out
at
the
door
,
Riah
went
into
the
fog
,
and
lost
to
the
eyes
of
Saint
Mary
Axe
.
<EOS>
But
the
eyes
of
this
history
can
follow
him
westward
,
by
Cornhill
,
Cheapside
,
Fleet
Street
,
and
the
Strand
,
to
Piccadilly
and
the
Albany
.
<EOS>
Thither
he
went
at
his
grave
and
measured
pace
,
staff
in
hand
,
skirt
at
heel
;
 
and
more
than
one
head
,
turning
to
look
back
at
his
venerable
figure
already
lost
in
the
mist
,
supposed
it
to
be
some
ordinary
figure
indistinctly
seen
,
which
fancy
and
the
fog
<EOS>
had
worked
into
that
passing
likeness
.
  
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
house
in
which
his
master
's
chambers
were
on
the
second
floor
,
Riah
proceeded
up
the
stairs
,
and
paused
at
Fascination
Fledgeby
's
door
.
<EOS>
Making
free
with
neither
bell
nor
knocker
,
he
struck
upon
the
door
with
the
top
of
his
staff
,
and
,
having
listened
,
sat
down
on
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
It
was
characteristic
of
his
habitual
submission
,
that
he
sat
down
on
the
raw
dark
staircase
,
as
many
of
his
ancestors
had
probably
sat
down
in
dungeons
,
taking
what
befell
him
as
it
might
befall
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
when
he
had
grown
so
cold
as
to
be
fain
to
blow
upon
his
fingers
,
he
arose
and
knocked
with
his
staff
again
,
and
listened
again
,
and
again
sat
down
to
wait
.
<EOS>
Thrice
he
repeated
these
actions
before
his
listening
ears
were
greeted
by
the
voice
of
Fledgeby
,
calling
from
his
bed
,
"
Hold
your
row
!
<EOS>
---
I
'll
come
and
open
the
door
directly
!
"
<EOS>
But
,
in
lieu
of
coming
directly
,
he
fell
into
a
sweet
sleep
for
some
quarter
of
an
hour
more
,
during
which
added
interval
Riah
sat
upon
the
stairs
and
waited
with
perfect
patience
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
door
stood
open
,
and
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
retreating
drapery
plunged
into
bed
again
.
<EOS>
Following
it
at
a
respectful
distance
,
Riah
passed
into
the
bed
-
chamber
,
where
a
fire
had
been
sometime
lighted
,
and
was
burning
briskly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
time
of
night
do
you
mean
to
call
it
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Fledgeby
,
turning
away
beneath
the
clothes
,
and
presenting
a
comfortable
rampart
of
shoulder
to
the
chilled
figure
of
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
it
is
full
half
-
past
ten
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
deuce
it
is
!
<EOS>
Then
it
must
be
precious
foggy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
foggy
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
raw
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Chill
and
bitter
,
"
said
Riah
,
drawing
out
a
handkerchief
,
and
wiping
the
moisture
from
his
beard
and
long
grey
hair
as
he
stood
on
the
verge
of
the
rug
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
acceptable
fire
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
plunge
of
enjoyment
,
Fledgeby
settled
himself
afresh
.
  
<EOS>
"
Any
snow
,
or
sleet
,
or
slush
,
or
anything
of
that
sort
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
no
.
<EOS>
Not
quite
so
bad
as
that
.
<EOS>
The
streets
are
pretty
clean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
brag
about
it
,
"
returned
Fledgeby
,
disappointed
in
his
desire
to
heighten
the
contrast
between
his
bed
and
the
streets
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
're
always
bragging
about
something
.
<EOS>
Got
the
books
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
here
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
.
<EOS>
I
'll
turn
the
general
subject
over
in
my
mind
for
a
minute
or
two
,
and
while
I
'm
about
it
<EOS>
you
can
empty
your
bag
and
get
ready
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
another
comfortable
plunge
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
fell
asleep
again
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
having
obeyed
his
directions
,
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
,
and
folding
his
hands
before
him
,
gradually
yielded
to
the
influence
of
the
warmth
,
and
dozed
.
<EOS>
He
was
roused
by
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
appearing
erect
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
in
Turkish
slippers
,
rose
-
<EOS>
coloured
Turkish
trousers
(
got
cheap
from
somebody
who
had
cheated
some
other
somebody
out
of
them
)
,
and
a
gown
and
cap
to
correspond
.
<EOS>
In
that
costume
he
would
have
left
nothing
to
be
desired
,
if
he
had
been
further
fitted
out
with
a
bottomless
chair
,
a
lantern
,
and
a
bunch
of
matches
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
old
'
un
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fascination
,
in
his
light
raillery
,
"
what
dodgery
are
you
up
to
next
,
sitting
there
with
you
eyes
<EOS>
shut
?
<EOS>
You
ai
n't
asleep
.
<EOS>
Catch
a
weasel
at
it
,
and
catch
a
Jew
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
sir
,
I
fear
I
nodded
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
you
!
"
returned
Fledgeby
,
with
a
cunning
look
.
"
<EOS>
A
telling
move
with
a
good
many
,
I
dare
say
,
but
it
wo
n't
put
me
off
my
guard
.
<EOS>
Not
a
bad
notion
though
,
if
you
want
to
look
indifferent
in
driving
a
bargain
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
are
a
dodger
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
shook
his
head
,
gently
repudiating
the
imputation
,
and
suppressed
a
sigh
,
and
moved
to
the
table
at
which
Mr.
Fledgeby
was
now
pouring
out
for
himself
a
cup
of
steaming
and
fragrant
coffee
from
a
pot
that
had
stood
ready
on
the
hob
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
edifying
spectacle
,
the
young
man
in
his
easy
chair
taking
his
coffee
,
and
the
old
man
with
his
grey
head
bent
,
standing
awaiting
his
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
!
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
Fork
out
your
balance
in
hand
,
and
prove
by
figures
how
you
make
it
out
that
it
ai
n't
more
.
<EOS>
First
of
all
,
light
that
candle
.
"
  
<EOS>
Riah
obeyed
,
and
then
taking
a
bag
from
his
breast
,
and
referring
to
the
sum
in
the
accounts
for
which
they
made
him
responsible
,
told
it
out
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
told
it
again
with
great
care
,
and
rang
every
sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
he
said
,
taking
one
up
to
eye
it
closely
,
"
you
have
n't
been
lightening
any
of
these
;
but
it
's
a
trade
of
your
people
's
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
understand
what
sweating
a
pound
means
;
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
as
you
do
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
old
man
,
with
his
hands
under
opposite
cuffs
of
his
loose
sleeves
,
as
he
stood
at
the
table
,
deferentially
observant
of
the
master
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
take
the
liberty
to
say
something
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
,
"
Fledgeby
graciously
conceded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
,
sir
---
without
intending
it
---
of
a
surety
without
intending
it
---
sometimes
mingle
the
character
I
fairly
earn
in
your
employment
,
with
the
character
which
it
is
your
policy
that
I
should
bear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
find
it
worth
my
while
to
cut
things
so
fine
as
to
go
into
the
inquiry
,
"
Fascination
coolly
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
justice
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bother
justice
!
"
said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
in
generosity
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jews
and
generosity
!
<EOS>
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
good
connexion
!
<EOS>
Bring
out
your
vouchers
,
and
do
n't
talk
Jerusalem
palaver
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
vouchers
were
produced
,
and
for
the
next
half
-
hour
Mr.
Fledgeby
concentrated
his
sublime
attention
on
them
.
<EOS>
They
and
the
accounts
were
all
found
correct
,
and
the
books
and
the
papers
resumed
their
places
in
the
bag
.
  
<EOS>
"
Next
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
"
concerning
that
bill
-
broking
branch
of
the
business
;
the
branch
I
like
best
.
<EOS>
What
queer
bills
are
to
be
bought
,
and
at
what
prices
?
<EOS>
You
have
got
your
list
of
what
's
in
the
market
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
a
long
list
,
"
replied
Riah
,
taking
out
a
pocket
-
book
,
and
selecting
from
its
contents
a
folded
paper
,
which
,
being
unfolded
,
became
a
sheet
of
foolscap
covered
with
close
writing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whew
!
"
whistled
Fledgeby
,
as
he
took
it
in
his
hand
.
"
<EOS>
Queer
Street
is
full
of
lodgers
just
at
present
!
<EOS>
These
are
to
be
disposed
of
in
parcels
;
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
parcels
as
set
forth
,
"
returned
the
old
man
,
looking
over
his
master
's
shoulder
;
"
or
the
lump
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Half
the
lump
will
be
waste
-
paper
,
one
knows
beforehand
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
Can
you
get
it
at
waste
-
paper
price
?
<EOS>
That
's
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Riah
shook
his
head
,
and
Fledgeby
cast
his
small
eyes
down
the
list
.
<EOS>
They
presently
began
to
twinkle
,
and
he
no
sooner
became
conscious
of
their
twinkling
,
than
he
looked
up
over
his
shoulder
at
the
grave
face
above
him
,
and
moved
to
the
chimney
-
piece
.
<EOS>
Making
a
desk
of
it
,
he
stood
there
with
his
back
to
the
old
man
,
warming
his
knees
,
perusing
the
list
at
his
leisure
,
and
often
returning
to
some
lines
of
it
,
as
though
they
were
particularly
interesting
.
<EOS>
At
those
times
he
glanced
in
the
chimney
-
glass
to
see
what
note
the
old
man
took
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
took
none
that
could
be
detected
,
but
,
aware
of
his
employer
's
suspicions
,
stood
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
was
thus
amiably
engaged
when
a
step
was
heard
at
the
outer
door
,
and
the
door
was
heard
to
open
hastily
.
"
<EOS>
Hark
!
<EOS>
That
's
your
doing
,
you
Pump
of
Israel
,
"
said
Fledgeby
;
"
you
ca
n't
have
shut
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
the
step
was
heard
within
,
and
the
voice
of
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
called
aloud
,
<EOS>
"
Are
you
anywhere
here
,
Fledgeby
?
"
<EOS>
To
which
Fledgeby
,
after
cautioning
Riah
in
a
low
voice
to
take
his
cue
as
it
should
be
given
him
,
replied
,
"
Here
I
am
!
"
and
opened
his
bedroom
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
!
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
gentleman
is
only
Pubsey
and
Co.
of
Saint
Mary
Axe
,
that
I
am
trying
to
make
terms
for
an
unfortunate
friend
with
in
a
matter
of
some
dishonoured
bills
.
<EOS>
But
really
Pubsey
and
Co.
are
so
strict
with
their
debtors
,
and
so
hard
to
move
,
that
I
seem
to
be
wasting
my
time
.
<EOS>
Ca
n't
I
make
any
terms
with
you
on
my
friend

part

Mr.
Riah

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
but
the
representative
of
another

returned
the
Jew
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
as
I
am
bidden
by
my
principal

<EOS>
It
is
not
my
capital

It

"
<EOS>
Ha

laughed
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
Lammle
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha

laughed
Lammle

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
Of

We

"
  
<EOS>
"
Devilish
good

Lammle

said
Fledgeby
,
unspeakably
amused
by
his
hidden
joke
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Always
the

always

said
Lammle

Fledgeby
put
in

as
he
wiped
away
the
tears

trickled
from
his

so
rare
was
his
enjoyment

his
secret

Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
only
the
representative
of
another
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
Does
as
he
is
told
by
his
principal
!
<EOS>
Not
his
capital
that
's
invested
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
's
good
!
<EOS>
Ha
ha
ha
ha
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
joined
in
the
laugh
and
looked
knowing
;
and
the
more
he
did
both
,
the
more
exquisite
the
secret
joke
became
for
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
said
that
fascinating
gentleman
,
wiping
his
eyes
again
,
"
if
we
go
on
in
this
way
,
we
shall
seem
to
be
almost
making
game
of
Mr.
Riah
,
or
of
Pubsey
and
Co.
Saint
Mary
Axe
,
or
of
somebody
:
which
is
far
from
our
intention
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Riah
,
if
you
would
have
the
kindness
to
step
into
the
next
room
for
a
few
moments
while
I
speak
with
Mr.
Lammle
here
,
I
should
like
to
try
to
make
terms
with
you
once
again
before
you
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
who
had
never
raised
his
eyes
during
the
whole
transaction
of
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
joke
,
silently
bowed
and
passed
out
by
the
door
which
Fledgeby
opened
for
him
.
<EOS>
Having
closed
it
on
him
,
Fledgeby
returned
to
Lammle
,
standing
with
his
back
to
the
bedroom
fire
,
with
one
hand
under
his
coat
-
skirts
,
and
all
his
whiskers
in
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
wrong
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
it
?
"
demanded
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
show
it
,
"
replied
Fledgeby
in
unintentional
rhyme
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
then
;
there
is
,
"
said
Lammle
;
"
there
is
something
wrong
;
 
the
whole
thing
's
wrong
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
<EOS>
"
remonstrated
Fascination
very
slowly
,
and
sitting
down
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
to
stare
at
his
glowering
friend
with
his
back
to
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
Fledgeby
,
"
repeated
Lammle
,
with
a
sweep
of
his
right
arm
,
"
the
whole
thing
's
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
game
's
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
game
's
up
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Fledgeby
,
as
slowly
as
before
,
and
more
sternly
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
game
.
<EOS>
Our
game
.
<EOS>
Read
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fledgeby
took
a
note
from
his
extended
hand
and
read
it
aloud
.
"
<EOS>
Alfred
Lammle
,
Esquire
.
<EOS>
Sir
:
<EOS>
Allow
Mrs.
Podsnap
and
myself
to
express
our
united
sense
of
the
polite
attentions
of
Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle
and
yourself
towards
our
daughter
,
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
Allow
us
also
,
wholly
to
reject
them
for
the
future
,
and
to
communicate
our
final
desire
that
the
two
families
may
become
entire
strangers
.
<EOS>
I
have
the
honor
to
be
,
Sir
,
your
most
obedient
and
very
humble
servant
,
John
Podsnap
.
"
 
<EOS>
Fledgeby
looked
at
the
three
blank
sides
of
this
note
,
quite
as
long
and
earnestly
as
at
the
first
expressive
side
,
and
then
looked
at
Lammle
,
who
responded
with
another
extensive
sweep
of
his
right
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
doing
is
this
?
"
said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
to
imagine
,
"
said
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
suggested
Fledgeby
,
after
reflecting
with
a
very
discontented
brow
,
"
somebody
has
been
giving
you
a
bad
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Or
you
,
"
said
Lammle
,
with
a
deeper
frown
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
appeared
to
be
on
the
verge
of
some
mutinous
expressions
,
when
his
hand
happened
to
touch
his
nose
.
<EOS>
A
certain
remembrance
connected
with
that
feature
operating
as
a
timely
warning
,
he
took
it
thoughtfully
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
,
and
pondered
;
Lammle
meanwhile
eyeing
him
with
furtive
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
This
wo
n't
improve
with
talking
about
.
<EOS>
If
we
ever
find
out
who
did
it
,
we
'll
mark
that
person
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
more
to
be
said
,
except
that
you
undertook
to
do
what
circumstances
prevent
your
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
you
undertook
to
do
what
you
might
have
done
by
this
time
,
if
you
had
made
a
prompter
use
of
circumstances
,
"
snarled
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
<EOS>
That
,
"
remarked
Fledgeby
,
with
his
hands
in
the
Turkish
trousers
,
"
is
matter
of
opinion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
"
said
Lammle
,
in
a
bullying
tone
,
"
am
I
to
understand
that
you
in
any
way
reflect
upon
me
,
or
hint
dissatisfaction
with
me
,
in
this
affair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Fledgeby
;
"
provided
you
have
brought
my
promissory
note
in
your
pocket
,
and
now
hand
it
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lammle
produced
it
,
not
without
reluctance
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
looked
at
it
,
identified
it
,
twisted
it
up
,
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
.
<EOS>
They
both
looked
at
it
as
it
blazed
,
went
out
,
and
flew
in
feathery
ash
up
the
chimney
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
"
said
Lammle
,
as
before
;
"
am
I
to
understand
that
you
in
any
way
reflect
upon
me
,
or
hint
dissatisfaction
with
me
,
in
this
affair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Finally
and
unreservedly
no
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fledgeby
,
my
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
took
it
,
saying
,
"
<EOS>
And
if
we
ever
find
out
who
did
this
,
we
'll
mark
that
person
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
most
friendly
manner
,
let
me
mention
one
thing
more
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
your
circumstances
are
,
and
I
do
n't
ask
.
<EOS>
You
have
sustained
a
loss
here
.
<EOS>
Many
men
are
liable
to
be
involved
at
times
,
and
you
may
be
,
or
you
may
not
be
.
<EOS>
But
whatever
you
do
,
Lammle
,
do
n't
---
do
n't
---
do
n't
,
I
beg
of
you
---
ever
fall
into
the
hands
of
Pubsey
and
Co.
in
the
next
room
,
for
they
are
grinders
.
<EOS>
Regular
flayers
and
grinders
,
my
dear
Lammle
,
"
repeated
Fledgeby
with
a
peculiar
relish
,
"
and
they
'll
skin
you
by
the
inch
,
from
the
nape
of
your
neck
to
the
sole
of
your
foot
,
and
grind
every
inch
of
your
skin
to
tooth
-
powder
.
<EOS>
You
have
seen
what
Mr.
Riah
is
.
<EOS>
Never
fall
into
his
hands
,
Lammle
,
I
beg
of
you
as
a
friend
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
,
disclosing
some
alarm
at
the
solemnity
of
this
affectionate
adjuration
,
demanded
why
the
devil
he
ever
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
Pubsey
and
Co.
?
  
<EOS>
"
To
confess
the
fact
,
I
was
made
a
little
uneasy
,
"
said
the
candid
Fledgeby
,
"
by
the
manner
in
which
that
Jew
looked
at
you
when
he
heard
your
name
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
like
his
eye
.
<EOS>
But
it
may
have
been
the
heated
fancy
of
a
friend
.
<EOS>
Of
course
if
you
are
sure
that
you
have
no
personal
security
out
,
which
you
may
not
be
quite
equal
to
meeting
,
and
which
can
have
got
into
his
hands
,
it
must
have
been
fancy
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
did
n't
like
his
eye
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
brooding
Lammle
,
with
certain
white
dints
coming
and
going
in
his
palpitating
nose
,
looked
as
if
some
tormenting
imp
were
pinching
it
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
,
watching
him
with
a
twitch
in
his
mean
face
which
did
duty
there
for
a
smile
,
looked
very
like
the
tormentor
who
was
pinching
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
n't
keep
him
waiting
too
long
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
"
or
he
'll
revenge
it
on
my
unfortunate
friend
.
<EOS>
How
's
your
very
clever
and
agreeable
wife
?
<EOS>
She
knows
we
have
broken
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
showed
her
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
much
surprised
?
"
asked
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
would
have
been
more
so
,
"
answered
Lammle
,
"
if
there
had
been
more
go
in
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
---
She
lays
it
upon
me
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
I
will
not
have
my
words
misconstrued
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
break
out
,
Lammle
,
"
urged
Fledgeby
,
in
a
submissive
tone
,
"
because
there
's
no
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
only
asked
a
question
.
<EOS>
Then
she
do
n't
lay
it
upon
me
?
<EOS>
To
ask
another
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
plainly
seeing
that
she
did
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
compliments
to
her
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
shook
hands
,
and
Lammle
strode
out
pondering
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
saw
him
into
the
fog
,
and
,
returning
to
the
fire
and
musing
with
his
face
to
it
,
stretched
the
legs
of
the
rose
-
coloured
Turkish
trousers
wide
apart
,
and
meditatively
bent
his
knees
,
as
if
he
were
going
down
upon
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
pair
of
whiskers
,
Lammle
,
which
I
never
liked
,
"
murmured
Fledgeby
,
"
and
which
money
ca
n't
produce
;
you
are
boastful
of
your
manners
and
your
conversation
;
you
wanted
to
pull
my
nose
,
and
you
have
let
me
in
for
a
failure
,
and
your
wife
says
I
am
the
cause
of
it
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
I
'll
bowl
you
down
.
<EOS>
I
will
,
though
I
have
no
whiskers
,
"
 
here
he
rubbed
the
places
where
they
were
due
,
"
and
no
manners
,
and
no
conversation
!
"
  
<EOS>
Having
thus
relieved
his
noble
mind
,
he
collected
the
legs
of
the
Turkish
trousers
,
straightened
himself
on
his
knees
,
and
called
out
to
Riah
in
the
next
room
,
"
Halloa
,
you
sir
!
"
<EOS>
At
sight
of
the
old
man
re
-
entering
with
a
gentleness
monstrously
in
contrast
with
the
character
he
had
given
him
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
was
so
tickled
again
,
that
he
exclaimed
,
laughing
,
"
<EOS>
Good
!
<EOS>
Good
!
!
<EOS>
Upon
my
soul
it
is
uncommon
good
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
old
'
un
,
"
proceeded
Fledgeby
,
when
he
had
had
his
laugh
out
,
"
you
'll
buy
up
these
lots
that
I
mark
with
my
pencil
<EOS>
---
there
's
a
tick
there
,
and
a
tick
there
,
and
a
tick
there
---
<EOS>
and
I
wager
<EOS>
two
-
pence
you
'll
afterwards
go
on
squeezing
those
Christians
like
the
Jew
you
are
.
<EOS>
Now
,
next
you
'll
want
a
cheque
---
or
you
'll
say
you
want
it
,
though
you
've
capital
enough
somewhere
,
if
one
only
knew
where
,
but
you
'd
be
peppered
and
salted
and
grilled
on
a
gridiron
before
you
'd
own
to
it
---
and
that
cheque
<EOS>
I
'll
write
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
unlocked
a
drawer
and
taken
a
key
from
it
to
open
another
drawer
,
in
which
was
another
key
that
opened
another
drawer
,
in
which
was
another
key
that
opened
another
drawer
,
in
which
was
the
cheque
book
;
and
when
he
had
written
the
cheque
;
 
and
when
,
reversing
the
key
and
drawer
process
,
he
had
placed
his
cheque
book
in
safety
again
;
he
beckoned
the
old
man
,
with
the
folded
cheque
,
to
come
and
take
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Old
'
un
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
when
the
Jew
had
put
it
in
his
pocketbook
,
and
was
putting
that
in
the
breast
of
his
outer
garment
;
"
so
much
at
present
for
my
affairs
.
<EOS>
Now
a
word
about
affairs
that
are
not
exactly
mine
.
<EOS>
Where
is
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
With
his
hand
not
yet
withdrawn
from
the
breast
of
his
garment
,
Riah
started
and
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
<EOS>
"
said
Fledgeby
,
"
Did
n't
expect
it
!
<EOS>
Where
have
you
hidden
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Showing
that
he
was
taken
by
surprise
,
the
old
man
looked
at
his
master
with
some
passing
confusion
,
which
the
master
highly
enjoyed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
in
the
house
I
pay
rent
and
taxes
for
in
Saint
Mary
Axe
?
<EOS>
"
 
demanded
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
she
in
your
garden
up
atop
of
that
house
---
gone
up
to
be
dead
,
or
whatever
the
game
is
?
"
asked
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
she
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
Riah
bent
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
,
as
if
considering
whether
he
could
answer
the
question
without
breach
of
faith
,
and
then
silently
raised
them
to
Fledgeby
's
face
,
as
if
he
could
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
press
that
just
now
.
<EOS>
But
I
want
to
know
this
,
and
I
will
know
this
,
mind
you
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
up
to
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
with
an
apologetic
action
of
his
head
and
hands
,
as
not
comprehending
the
master
's
meaning
,
addressed
to
him
a
look
of
mute
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
a
gallivanting
dodger
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
For
you
're
a
`
`
regular
pity
<EOS>
the
sorrows

"
you
know

if
you

You

you

this
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
O
,
sir
!
"
expostulated
Riah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
,
sir
,
sir
,
sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
why
,
"
retorted
Fledgeby
,
with
some
slight
tinge
of
a
blush
,
"
do
n't
you
out
with
your
reason
for
having
your
spoon
in
the
soup
at
all
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
will
tell
you
the
truth
.
<EOS>
But
(
your
pardon
for
the
stipulation
)
<EOS>
it
is
in
sacred
confidence
;
it
is
strictly
upon
honor
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Honor
too
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fledgeby
,
with
a
mocking
lip
.
"
<EOS>
Honor
among
Jews
.
<EOS>
Well
.
<EOS>
Cut
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
upon
honor
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
the
other
still
stipulated
,
with
respectful
firmness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
Honor
bright
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
never
bidden
to
sit
down
,
stood
with
an
earnest
hand
laid
on
the
back
of
the
young
man
's
easy
chair
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
sat
looking
at
the
fire
with
a
face
of
listening
curiosity
,
ready
to
check
him
off
and
catch
him
tripping
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cut
away
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
Start
with
your
motive
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
have
no
motive
but
to
help
the
helpless
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
could
only
express
the
feelings
to
which
this
incredible
statement
gave
rise
in
his
breast
,
by
a
prodigiously
long
derisive
sniff
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
I
came
to
know
,
and
much
to
esteem
and
to
respect
,
this
damsel
,
I
mentioned
when
you
saw
her
in
my
poor
garden
on
the
house
-
top
,
"
said
the
Jew
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
?
"
said
Fledgeby
,
distrustfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Perhaps
you
did
,
though
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
better
I
knew
her
,
the
more
interest
I
felt
in
her
fortunes
.
<EOS>
They
gathered
to
a
crisis
.
<EOS>
I
found
her
beset
by
a
selfish
and
ungrateful
brother
,
beset
by
an
unacceptable
wooer
,
beset
by
the
snares
of
a
more
powerful
lover
,
beset
by
the
wiles
of
her
own
heart
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
took
to
one
of
the
chaps
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
incline
towards
him
,
for
he
had
many
and
great
advantages
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
of
her
station
,
and
to
marry
her
was
not
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Perils
were
closing
round
her
,
and
the
circle
was
fast
darkening
,
when
I
---
being
as
you
have
said
,
sir
,
too
old
and
broken
to
be
suspected
of
any
feeling
for
her
but
<EOS>
a
father
's
---
stepped
in
,
and
counselled
flight
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
`
`
My
daughter
,
there
are
times
of
moral
danger
when
the
hardest
virtuous
resolution
to
form
is
flight
,
and
when
the
most
heroic
bravery
is
flight
.
"
<EOS>
"
She
answered
,
she
had
had
this
in
her
thoughts
;
but
whither
to
fly
without
help
she
knew
not
,
and
there
were
none
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
I
showed
her
there
was
one
to
help
her
,
and
it
was
I.
<EOS>
And
she
is
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
with
her
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Fledgeby
,
feeling
his
cheek
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
placed
her
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
"
at
a
distance
;
"
with
a
grave
smooth
outward
sweep
from
one
another
of
his
two
open
hands
at
arm
's
length
;
"
at
a
distance
---
among
certain
of
our
people
,
where
her
industry
would
serve
her
,
and
where
she
could
hope
to
exercise
it
,
unassailed
from
any
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
  
Fledgeby
's
eyes
had
come
from
the
fire
to
notice
the
action
of
his
hands
when
he
said
"
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
"
Fledgeby
now
tried
(
very
unsuccessfully
)
to
imitate
that
action
,
as
he
shook
his
head
and
said
,
"
Placed
her
in
that
direction
,
did
you
?
<EOS>
Oh
you
circular
old
dodger
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
one
hand
across
his
breast
and
the
other
on
the
easy
chair
,
Riah
,
without
justifying
himself
,
waited
for
further
questioning
.
<EOS>
But
,
that
it
was
hopeless
to
question
him
on
that
one
reserved
point
,
Fledgeby
,
with
his
small
eyes
too
near
together
,
saw
full
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
looking
at
the
fire
again
,
and
then
looking
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Humph
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
You
did
n't
tell
me
the
other
name
in
your
garden
atop
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
more
communicative
with
you
.
<EOS>
The
other
name
's
Hexam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Riah
bent
his
head
in
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
you
sir
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
notion
<EOS>
I
know
something
of
the
inveigling
chap
,
the
powerful
one
.
<EOS>
Has
he
anything
to
do
with
the
law
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nominally
,
I
believe
it
his
calling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
.
<EOS>
Name
anything
like
Lightwood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
not
at
all
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
old
'
un
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
meeting
his
eyes
with
a
wink
,
"
say
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wrayburn
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
By
Jupiter
!
"
cried
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
That
one
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
I
thought
it
might
be
the
other
,
but
I
never
dreamt
of
that
one
!
<EOS>
I
should
n't
object
to
your
baulking
either
of
the
pair
,
dodger
,
for
they
are
both
conceited
enough
;
but
that
one
is
as
cool
a
customer
<EOS>
as
ever
I
met
with
.
<EOS>
Got
a
beard
besides
,
and
presumes
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Well
done
,
old
'
un
!
<EOS>
Go
on
and
prosper
!
"
  
<EOS>
Brightened
by
this
unexpected
commendation
,
Riah
asked
were
there
more
instructions
for
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
"
you
may
toddle
now
,
Judah
,
and
grope
about
on
the
orders
you
have
got
.
"
<EOS>
Dismissed
with
those
pleasing
words
,
the
old
man
took
his
broad
hat
and
staff
,
and
left
the
great
presence
:
more
as
if
he
were
some
superior
creature
benignantly
blessing
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
than
the
poor
dependent
on
whom
he
set
his
foot
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
locked
his
outer
door
,
and
came
back
to
his
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
done
you
!
"
<EOS>
said
Fascination
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Slow
,
you
may
be
;
sure
,
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
This
he
twice
or
thrice
repeated
with
much
complacency
,
as
he
again
dispersed
the
legs
of
the
Turkish
trousers
and
bent
the
knees
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
tidy
shot
that
,
I
flatter
myself
,
"
he
then
soliloquised
.
"
<EOS>
And
a
Jew
brought
down
with
it
!
<EOS>
Now
,
when
I
heard
the
story
told
at
Lammle
's
,
I
did
n't
make
a
jump
at
Riah
.
<EOS>
Not
a
bit
of
it
;
I
got
at
him
by
degrees
.
"
<EOS>
Herein
he
was
quite
accurate
;
it
being
his
habit
,
not
to
jump
,
or
leap
,
or
make
an
upward
spring
,
at
anything
in
life
,
but
to
crawl
at
everything
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
got
at
him
,
"
pursued
Fledgeby
,
feeling
for
his
whisker
,
"
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
If
your
Lammles
or
your
Lightwoods
had
got
at
him
anyhow
,
they
would
have
asked
him
the
question
whether
he
had
n't
something
to
do
with
that
gal
's
disappearance
.
<EOS>
I
knew
a
better
way
of
going
to
work
.
<EOS>
Having
got
behind
the
hedge
,
and
put
him
in
the
light
,
I
took
a
shot
at
him
and
brought
him
down
plump
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
It
do
n't
count
for
much
,
being
a
Jew
,
in
a
match
against
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Another
dry
twist
in
place
of
a
smile
,
made
his
face
crooked
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
Christians
,
"
proceeded
Fledgeby
,
"
look
out
,
fellow
-
Christians
,
particularly
you
that
lodge
in
Queer
Street
!
<EOS>
I
have
got
the
run
of
Queer
Street
now
,
and
you
shall
see
some
games
there
.
<EOS>
To
work
a
lot
of
power
over
you
and
you
not
know
it
,
knowing
as
you
think
yourselves
,
would
be
almost
worth
laying
out
money
upon
.
<EOS>
But
when
it
comes
to
squeezing
a
profit
out
of
you
into
the
bargain
,
it
's
something
like
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
apostrophe
Mr.
Fledgeby
appropriately
proceeded
to
divest
himself
of
his
Turkish
garments
,
and
invest
himself
with
Christian
attire
.
<EOS>
Pending
which
operation
,
and
his
morning
ablutions
,
and
his
anointing
of
himself
with
the
last
infallible
preparation
for
the
production
of
luxuriant
and
glossy
hair
upon
the
human
countenance
(
quacks
being
the
only
sages
he
believed
in
besides
usurers
)
,
the
murky
fog
closed
about
him
and
shut
him
up
in
its
sooty
embrace
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
never
let
him
out
any
more
,
the
world
would
have
had
no
irreparable
loss
,
but
could
have
easily
replaced
him
from
its
stock
on
hand
.
   
<EOS>
A
RESPECTED
FRIEND
IN
A
NEW
ASPECT
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
evening
of
this
same
foggy
day
when
the
yellow
windowblind
of
Pubsey
and
Co.
was
drawn
down
upon
the
day
's
work
,
Riah
the
Jew
once
more
came
forth
into
Saint
Mary
Axe
.
<EOS>
But
this
time
he
carried
no
bag
,
and
was
not
bound
on
his
master
's
affairs
.
<EOS>
He
passed
over
London
Bridge
,
and
returned
to
the
Middlesex
shore
by
that
of
Westminster
,
and
so
,
ever
wading
through
the
fog
,
waded
to
the
doorstep
of
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
expected
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
see
her
through
the
window
by
the
light
of
her
low
fire
---
carefully
banked
up
with
damp
cinders
that
it
might
last
the
longer
and
waste
the
loss
when
she
was
out
---
  
<EOS>
sitting
waiting
for
him
in
her
bonnet
.
<EOS>
His
tap
at
the
glass
roused
her
from
the
musing
solitude
in
which
she
sat
,
and
she
came
to
the
door
to
open
it
;
aiding
her
steps
with
a
little
crutch
-
stick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
evening
,
godmother
!
"
said
Miss
Jenny
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
laughed
,
and
gave
her
his
arm
to
lean
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
come
in
and
warm
yourself
,
godmother
?
"
asked
Miss
Jenny
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
you
are
ready
,
Cinderella
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Wren
,
delighted
.
"
<EOS>
Now
you
ARE
a
clever
old
boy
!
<EOS>
If
we
gave
prizes
at
this
establishment
(
but
we
only
keep
blanks
)
,
you
should
have
the
first
silver
medal
,
for
taking
me
up
so
quick
.
"
<EOS>
As
she
spake
thus
,
Miss
Wren
removed
the
key
of
the
house
-
door
from
the
keyhole
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
,
and
then
bustlingly
closed
the
door
,
and
tried
it
as
they
both
stood
on
the
step
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
that
her
dwelling
was
safe
<EOS>
,
she
drew
one
hand
through
the
old
man
's
arm
and
prepared
to
ply
her
crutch
-
stick
with
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
the
key
was
an
instrument
of
such
gigantic
proportions
,
that
before
they
started
Riah
proposed
to
carry
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
'll
carry
it
myself
,
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
awfully
lopsided
,
you
know
,
and
stowed
down
in
my
pocket
it
'll
trim
the
ship
.
<EOS>
To
let
you
into
a
secret
,
godmother
,
I
wear
my
pocket
on
my
high
side
,
o
'
purpose
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
they
began
their
plodding
through
the
fog
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
was
truly
sharp
of
you
,
godmother
,
"
resumed
Miss
Wren
with
great
approbation
,
"
to
understand
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
you
see
,
you
are
so
like
the
fairy
godmother
in
the
bright
little
books
!
<EOS>
You
look
so
unlike
the
rest
of
people
,
and
so
much
as
if
you
had
changed
yourself
into
that
shape
,
just
this
moment
,
with
some
benevolent
object
.
<EOS>
Boh
!
"
cried
Miss
Jenny
,
putting
her
face
close
to
the
old
man
's
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
your
features
,
godmother
,
behind
the
beard
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Does
the
fancy
go
to
my
changing
other
objects
too
,
Jenny
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
That
it
does
!
<EOS>
If
you
'd
only
borrow
my
stick
and
tap
this
piece
of
pavement
---
this
dirty
stone
that
my
foot
taps
---
it
would
start
up
a
coach
and
six
.
<EOS>
I
say
!
<EOS>
Let
's
believe
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
replied
the
good
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
must
ask
you
to
do
,
godmother
.
<EOS>
I
must
ask
you
to
be
so
kind
as
give
my
child
a
tap
,
and
change
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
O
my
child
has
been
such
a
bad
,
bad
child
of
late
!
<EOS>
It
worries
me
nearly
out
of
my
wits
.
<EOS>
Not
done
a
stroke
of
work
these
ten
days
.
<EOS>
Has
had
the
horrors
,
too
,
and
fancied
that
four
copper
-
coloured
men
in
red
wanted
to
throw
him
into
a
fiery
furnace
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
that
's
dangerous
,
Jenny
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dangerous
,
godmother
?
<EOS>
My
bad
child
is
always
dangerous
,
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
He
might
"
---
here
the
little
creature
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
at
the
sky
---
"
be
setting
the
house
on
fire
at
this
present
moment
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
who
would
have
a
child
,
for
my
part
!
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
shaking
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
shaken
him
till
I
have
made
myself
giddy
.
<EOS>
`
`
Why
do
n't
you
mind
your
Commandments
and
honor
your
parent
,
you
naughty
old
boy
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
said
to
him
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
But
he
only
whimpered
and
stared
at
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
shall
be
changed
,
after
him
?
"
asked
Riah
in
a
compassionately
playful
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
godmother
,
I
am
afraid
I
must
be
selfish
next
,
and
get
you
to
set
me
right
in
the
back
and
the
legs
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
little
thing
to
you
with
your
power
,
godmother
,
but
it
's
a
great
deal
to
poor
weak
aching
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
querulous
complaining
in
the
words
,
but
they
were
not
the
less
touching
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
and
then
---
you
know
,
godmother
.
<EOS>
We
'll
both
jump
up
into
the
coach
and
six
and
go
to
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
This
reminds
me
,
godmother
,
to
ask
you
a
serious
question
.
<EOS>
You
are
as
wise
as
wise
can
be
(
having
been
brought
up
by
the
fairies
)
,
and
you
can
tell
me
this
:
<EOS>
Is
it
better
to
have
had
a
good
thing
and
lost
it
,
or
never
to
have
had
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Explain
,
god
-
daughter
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
so
much
more
solitary
and
helpless
without
Lizzie
now
,
than
I
used
to
feel
before
I
knew
her
.
"
<EOS>
(
Tears
were
in
her
eyes
as
she
said
so
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Some
beloved
companionship
fades
out
of
most
lives
,
my
dear
,
"
 
said
the
Jew
,
---
"
that
of
a
wife
,
and
a
fair
daughter
,
and
a
son
of
promise
,
has
faded
out
of
my
own
life
---
but
the
happiness
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Wren
thoughtfully
,
by
no
means
convinced
,
and
chopping
the
exclamation
with
that
sharp
little
hatchet
of
hers
;
 
"
then
I
tell
you
what
change
<EOS>
I
think
you
had
better
begin
with
,
godmother
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
change
Is
into
Was
and
Was
into
Is
,
and
keep
them
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
that
suit
your
case
?
<EOS>
Would
you
not
be
always
in
pain
then
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
old
man
tenderly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Right
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Wren
with
another
chop
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
changed
me
wiser
,
godmother
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Not
,
"
she
added
with
the
quaint
hitch
of
her
chin
and
eyes
,
"
that
you
need
be
a
very
wonderful
godmother
to
do
that
deed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
conversing
,
and
having
crossed
Westminster
Bridge
,
they
traversed
the
ground
that
Riah
had
lately
traversed
,
and
new
ground
likewise
;
for
,
when
they
had
recrossed
the
Thames
by
way
of
London
Bridge
,
they
struck
down
by
the
river
and
held
their
still
foggier
course
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
But
previously
,
as
they
were
going
along
,
Jenny
twisted
her
venerable
friend
aside
to
a
brilliantly
-
lighted
toy
-
shop
window
,
and
said
:
"
Now
look
at
'em
!
<EOS>
All
my
work
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
referred
to
a
dazzling
semicircle
of
dolls
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
,
who
were
dressed
for
presentation
at
court
,
for
going
to
balls
,
for
going
out
driving
,
for
going
out
on
horseback
,
for
going
out
walking
,
for
going
to
get
married
,
for
going
to
help
other
dolls
to
get
married
,
for
all
the
gay
events
of
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
,
pretty
,
pretty
!
"
said
the
old
man
with
a
clap
of
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Most
elegant
taste
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glad
you
like
'
em
,
"
returned
Miss
Wren
,
loftily
.
<EOS>
"
But
the
fun
is
,
godmother
,
how
I
make
the
great
ladies
try
my
dresses
on
.
<EOS>
Though
it
's
the
hardest
part
of
my
business
,
and
would
be
,
even
if
my
back
were
not
bad
and
my
legs
queer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
as
not
understanding
what
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
,
godmother
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
"
I
have
to
scud
about
town
at
all
hours
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
only
sitting
at
my
bench
,
cutting
out
and
sewing
,
it
would
be
comparatively
easy
work
;
but
it
's
the
trying
-
on
by
the
great
ladies
that
takes
it
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
,
the
trying
-
on
?
"
asked
Riah
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
mooney
godmother
you
are
,
after
all
!
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
Look
here
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
Drawing
Room
,
or
a
grand
day
in
the
Park
,
or
a
Show
,
or
a
FÍte
,
or
what
you
like
.
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
squeeze
among
the
crowd
,
and
I
look
about
me
.
<EOS>
When
I
see
a
great
lady
very
suitable
for
my
business
,
I
say
`
`
You
'll
do
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
"
and
I
take
particular
notice
of
her
,
and
run
home
and
cut
her
out
and
baste
her
.
<EOS>
Then
another
day
,
I
come
scudding
back
again
to
try
on
,
and
then
I
take
particular
notice
of
her
again
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
plainly
seems
to
say
,
`
`
How
that
little
creature
is
staring
!
"
<EOS>
"
and
sometimes
likes
it
and
sometimes
do
n't
,
but
much
more
often
yes
than
no
.
<EOS>
All
the
time
I
am
only
saying
to
myself
,
`
`
I
must
hollow
out
a
bit
here
;
I
must
slope
away
there
;
"
"
and
I
am
making
a
perfect
slave
of
her
,
with
making
her
try
on
my
doll
's
dress
.
<EOS>
Evening
parties
are
severer
work
for
me
,
because
there
's
only
a
doorway
for
a
full
view
,
and
what
with
hobbling
among
the
wheels
of
the
carriages
and
the
legs
of
the
horses
,
I
fully
expect
to
be
run
over
some
night
.
<EOS>
However
,
there
I
have
'em
,
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
When
they
go
bobbing
into
the
hall
from
the
carriage
,
and
catch
a
glimpse
of
my
little
physiognomy
poked
out
from
behind
a
policeman
's
cape
in
the
rain
,
I
dare
say
they
think
I
am
wondering
and
admiring
with
all
my
eyes
and
heart
,
but
they
little
think
they
're
only
working
for
my
dolls
!
<EOS>
There
was
Lady
Belinda
Whitrose
.
<EOS>
I
made
her
do
double
duty
in
one
night
.
<EOS>
I
said
when
she
came
out
of
the
carriage
,
`
`
You
'll
do
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
"
and
I
ran
straight
home
and
cut
her
out
and
basted
her
.
<EOS>
Back
I
came
again
,
and
waited
behind
the
men
that
called
the
carriages
.
<EOS>
Very
bad
night
too
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
`
`
Lady
Belinda
Whitrose
's
carriage
!
<EOS>
Lady
Belinda
Whitrose
coming
down
!
"
<EOS>
"
And
I
made
her
try
on
---
oh
!
and
take
pains
about
it
too
---
before
she
got
seated
.
<EOS>
That
's
Lady
Belinda
hanging
up
by
the
waist
,
much
too
near
the
gas
-
light
for
a
wax
one
,
with
her
toes
turned
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
had
plodded
on
for
some
time
night
the
river
,
Riah
asked
the
way
to
a
certain
tavern
called
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
Porters
.
<EOS>
following
the
directions
he
received
,
they
arrived
,
after
two
or
three
puzzled
stoppages
for
consideration
,
and
some
uncertain
looking
about
them
,
at
the
door
of
Miss
Abbey
Potterson
's
dominions
.
<EOS>
A
peep
through
the
glass
portion
of
the
door
revealed
to
them
the
glories
of
the
bar
,
and
Miss
Abbey
herself
seated
in
state
on
her
snug
throne
,
reading
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
To
whom
,
with
deference
,
they
presented
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Taking
her
eyes
off
her
newspaper
,
and
pausing
with
a
suspended
expression
of
countenance
,
as
if
she
must
finish
the
paragraph
in
hand
before
undertaking
any
other
business
whatever
,
Miss
Abbey
demanded
,
with
some
slight
asperity
:
"
Now
then
,
what
's
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Could
we
see
Miss
Potterson
?
"
asked
the
old
man
,
uncovering
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
not
only
could
,
but
you
can
<EOS>
and
you
do
,
"
replied
the
hostess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Might
we
speak
with
you
,
madam
?
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
Miss
Abbey
's
eyes
had
possessed
themselves
of
the
small
figure
of
Miss
Jenny
Wren
.
<EOS>
For
the
closer
observation
of
which
,
Miss
Abbey
laid
aside
her
newspaper
,
rose
,
and
looked
over
the
half
-
door
of
the
bar
.
<EOS>
The
crutch
-
stick
seemed
to
entreat
for
its
owner
leave
to
come
in
and
rest
by
the
fire
;
so
,
Miss
Abbey
opened
the
half
-
door
,
and
said
,
as
though
replying
to
the
crutch
-
stick
:
"
Yes
,
come
in
and
rest
by
the
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Riah
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
with
courteous
action
,
"
and
my
avocation
is
in
London
city
.
<EOS>
This
,
my
young
companion
---
"
  
"
Stop
a
bit
,
"
interposed
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
the
lady
my
card
.
"
<EOS>
She
produced
it
from
her
pocket
with
an
air
,
after
struggling
with
the
gigantic
door
-
key
which
had
got
upon
the
top
of
it
and
kept
it
down
.
<EOS>
Miss
Abbey
,
with
manifest
tokens
of
astonishment
,
took
the
diminutive
document
,
and
found
it
to
run
concisely
thus
:
---
   
Miss
JENNY
WREN
,
  
DOLLS
'
DRESSMAKER
.
  
<EOS>
Dolls
attended
at
their
own
residences
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lud
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Potterson
,
staring
.
<EOS>
And
dropped
the
card
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
take
the
liberty
of
coming
,
my
young
companion
and
I
,
madam
,
"
said
Riah
,
"
on
behalf
of
Lizzie
Hexam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Potterson
was
stooping
to
loosen
the
bonnet
-
strings
of
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
.
<EOS>
She
looked
round
rather
angrily
,
and
said
;
 
"
Lizzie
Hexam
is
a
very
proud
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
be
so
proud
,
"
returned
Riah
,
dexterously
,
"
to
stand
well
in
your
good
opinion
,
that
before
she
quitted
London
for
---
"
  
"
For
where
,
in
the
name
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
?
"
asked
Miss
Potterson
,
as
though
supposing
her
to
have
emigrated
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
country
,
"
was
the
cautious
answer
,
---
"
she
made
us
promise
to
come
and
show
you
a
paper
,
which
she
left
in
our
hands
for
that
special
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
am
an
unserviceable
friend
of
hers
,
who
began
to
know
her
after
her
departure
from
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
for
some
time
living
with
my
young
companion
,
and
has
been
a
helpful
and
a
comfortable
friend
to
her
.
<EOS>
Much
needed
,
madam
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
lower
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Believe
me
;
if
you
knew
all
,
much
needed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
believe
that
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
,
with
a
softening
glance
at
the
little
creature
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
it
's
proud
to
have
a
heart
that
never
hardens
,
and
a
temper
that
never
tires
,
and
a
touch
that
never
hurts
,
"
Miss
Jenny
struck
in
,
flushed
,
"
she
is
proud
.
<EOS>
And
if
it
's
not
,
she
is
   
NOT
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
set
purpose
of
contradicting
Miss
Abbey
point
blank
,
was
so
far
from
offending
that
dread
authority
,
as
to
elicit
a
gracious
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
right
,
child
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
,
"
to
speak
well
of
those
who
deserve
well
of
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Right
or
wrong
,
"
muttered
Miss
Wren
,
inaudibly
,
with
a
visible
hitch
of
her
chin
,
"
I
mean
to
do
it
,
and
you
may
make
up
your
mind
to
that
,
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
the
paper
,
madam
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
delivering
into
Miss
Potterson
's
hands
the
original
document
drawn
up
by
Rokesmith
,
and
signed
by
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
please
to
read
it
?
"
  
"
But
first
of
all
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
,
"
---
<EOS>
did
you
ever
taste
shrub
,
child
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
you
like
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Should
if
it
's
good
,
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
try
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
you
find
it
good
,
I
'll
mix
some
for
you
with
hot
water
.
<EOS>
Put
your
poor
little
feet
on
the
fender
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
cold
,
cold
night
,
and
the
fog
clings
so
.
"
<EOS>
As
Miss
Abbey
helped
her
to
turn
her
chair
,
her
loosened
bonnet
dropped
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
what
lovely
hair
!
"
cried
Miss
Abbey
.
"
<EOS>
And
enough
to
make
wigs
for
all
the
dolls
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
What
a
quantity
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Call
that
a
quantity
?
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
Poof
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
the
rest
of
it
?
"
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
she
united
a
band
,
and
the
golden
stream
fell
over
herself
and
over
the
chair
,
and
flowed
down
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Miss
Abbey
's
admiration
seemed
to
increase
her
perplexity
.
<EOS>
She
beckoned
the
Jew
towards
her
,
as
she
reached
down
the
shrub
-
bottle
from
its
niche
,
and
whispered
:
  
"
Child
,
or
woman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Child
in
years
,
"
was
the
answer
;

"
You
are
talking
about
Me
,
good
people
,
"
thought
Miss
Jenny
,
sitting
in
her
golden
bower
,
warming
her
feet
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
hear
what
you

I
know
your

your

<EOS>
The
shrub
,
when
tasted
from
a
spoon
,
perfectly
harmonizing
with
Miss
Jenny
's
palate
,
a
judicious
amount
was
mixed
by
Miss
Potterson
's
skilful
hands
,
whereof
Riah
too
partook
.
<EOS>
After
this
preliminary
,
Miss
Abbey
read
the
document
;
and
,
as
often
as
she
raised
her
eyebrows
in
so
doing
,
the
watchful
Miss
Jenny
accompanied
the
action
with
an
expressive
and
emphatic
sip
of
the
shrub
and
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
this
goes
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
Potterson
,
when
she
had
read
it
several
times
,
and
thought
about
it
,
"
it
proves
(
what
did
n't
much
need
proving
)
that
Rogue
Riderhood
is
a
villain
.
<EOS>
I
have
my
doubts
whether
he
is
not
the
villain
who
solely
did
the
deed
;
but
I
have
no
expectation
of
those
doubts
ever
being
cleared
up
now
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
did
Lizzie
's
father
wrong
,
but
never
Lizzie
's
self
;
because
when
things
were
at
the
worst
I
trusted
her
,
had
perfect
confidence
in
her
,
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
come
to
me
for
a
refuge
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
to
have
done
a
man
wrong
,
particularly
when
it
ca
n't
be
undone
.
<EOS>
Be
kind
enough
to
let
Lizzie
know
what
I
say
;
not
forgetting
that
if
she
will
come
to
the
Porters
,
after
all
,
bygones
being
bygones
,
she
will
find
a
home
at
the
Porters
,
and
a
friend
at
the
Porters
.
<EOS>
She
knows
Miss
Abbey
of
old
,
remind
her
,
and
she
knows
what
-
like
the
home
,
and
what
-
like
the
friend
,
is
likely
to
turn
out
.
<EOS>
I
am
generally
short
and
sweet
---
or
short
and
sour
,
according
as
it
may
be
and
as
opinions
vary
---
"
remarked
Miss
Abbey
,
"
and
that
's
about
all
I
have
got
to
say
,
and
enough
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
before
the
shrub
and
water
was
sipped
out
,
Miss
Abbey
bethought
herself
that
she
would
like
to
keep
a
copy
of
the
paper
by
her
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
long
,
sir
,
"
said
she
to
Riah
,
"
and
perhaps
you
would
n't
mind
just
jotting
it
down
.
<EOS>
"
The
old
man
willingly
put
on
his
spectacles
,
and
,
standing
at
the
little
desk
in
the
corner
where
Miss
Abbey
filed
her
receipts
and
kept
her
sample
phials
<EOS>
(
customers
'
scores
were
interdicted
by
the
strict
administration
of
the
Porters
)
,
wrote
out
the
copy
in
a
fair
round
character
.
<EOS>
As
he
stood
there
,
doing
his
methodical
penmanship
,
his
ancient
scribe
-
like
figure
intent
upon
the
work
,
and
the
little
dolls
'
dressmaker
sitting
in
her
golden
bower
before
the
fire
,
Miss
Abbey
had
her
doubts
whether
she
had
not
dreamed
those
two
rare
figures
into
the
bar
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowships
,
and
might
not
wake
with
a
nod
next
moment
and
find
them
gone
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Abbey
had
twice
made
the
experiment
of
shutting
her
eyes
and
opening
them
again
,
still
finding
the
figures
there
,
when
,
dream
-
like
,
a
confused
hubbub
arose
in
the
public
room
.
<EOS>
As
she
started
up
,
and
they
all
three
looked
at
one
another
,
it
became
a
noise
of
clamouring
voices
and
of
the
stir
of
feet
;
then
all
the
windows
were
heard
to
be
hastily
thrown
up
,
and
shouts
and
cries
came
floating
into
the
house
from
the
river
.
<EOS>
A
moment
more
,
and
Bob
Gliddery
came
clattering
along
the
passage
,
with
the
noise
of
all
the
nails
in
his
boots
condensed
into
every
separate
nail
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
asked
Miss
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
summut
run
down
in
the
fog
,
ma'am
,
"
answered
Bob
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
ever
so
many
people
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
'em
to
put
on
all
the
kettles
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Abbey
.
<EOS>
"
See
that
the
boiler
's
full
.
<EOS>
Get
a
bath
out

<EOS>
Hang
some
blankets

Heat

Have

about

down

"
  
<EOS>
While
Miss
Abbey
partly
delivered
these
directions
to
Bob
---
  
whom
she
seized
by
the
hair
,
and
whose
head
she
knocked
against
the
wall
,
as
a
general
injunction
to
vigilance
and
presence
of
mind
---
  
and
partly
hailed
the
kitchen
with
them
---
<EOS>
the
company
in
the
public
room
,
jostling
one
another
,
rushed
out
to
the
causeway
,
and
the
outer
noise
increased
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
look
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
to
her
visitors
.
<EOS>
They
all
three
hurried
to
the
vacated
public
room
,
and
passed
by
one
of
the
windows
into
the
wooden
verandah
overhanging
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
anybody
down
there
know
what
has
happened
?
"
demanded
Miss
Abbey
,
in
her
voice
of
authority
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
steamer
,
Miss
Abbey
,
"
cried
one
blurred
figure
in
the
fog
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
always
is
a
steamer
,
Miss
Abbey
,
"
cried
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Them
's
her
lights
,
Miss
Abbey
,
wot
<EOS>
you
see
a
-
blinking
yonder
,
"
 
cried
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
-
blowing
off
her
steam
,
Miss
Abbey
,
and
that
's
what
makes
the
fog
and
the
noise
worse
,
do
n't
you
see
?
"
explained
another
.
  
<EOS>
Boats
were
putting
off
,
torches
were
lighting
up
,
people
were
rushing
tumultuously
to
the
water
's
edge
.
<EOS>
Some
man
fell
in
with
a
splash
,
and
was
pulled
out
again
with
a
roar
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
The
drags
were
called
for
.
<EOS>
A
cry
for
the
life
-
buoy
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
was
going
on
upon
the
river
,
for
every
boat
that
put
off
sculled
into
the
fog
and
was
lost
to
view
at
a
boat
's
length
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
clear
but
that
the
unpopular
steamer
was
assailed
with
reproaches
on
all
sides
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
Murderer
,
bound
for
Gallows
Bay
;
she
was
the
Manslaughterer
,
bound
for
Penal
Settlement
;
her
captain
ought
to
be
tried
for
his
life
;
her
crew
ran
down
men
in
row
-
boats
with
a
relish
;
she
mashed
up
Thames
lightermen
with
her
paddles
;
she
fired
property
with
her
funnels
;
she
always
was
,
and
she
always
would
be
,
wreaking
destruction
upon
somebody
or
something
,
after
the
manner
of
all
her
kind
.
<EOS>
The
whole
bulk
of
the
fog
teemed
with
such
taunts
,
uttered
in
tones
of
universal
hoarseness
.
<EOS>
All
the
while
,
the
steamer
's
lights
moved
spectrally
a
very
little
,
as
she
lay
-
to
,
waiting
the
upshot
of
whatever
accident
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Now
,
she
began
burning
bluelights
.
<EOS>
These
made
a
luminous
patch
about
her
,
as
if
she
had
set
the
fog
on
fire
,
and
in
the
patch
---
the
cries
changing
their
note
,
and
becoming
more
fitful
and
more
excited
---
shadows
of
men
and
boats
could
be
seen
moving
,
while
voices
shouted
:
"
There
!
"
<EOS>
"
There
again
!
"
<EOS>
"
A
couple
more
strokes
a
-
head
!
"
<EOS>
"
Hurrah
!
"
<EOS>
"
Look
out
!
"
<EOS>
"
Hold
on
!
"
<EOS>
"
Haul
in
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
with
a
few
tumbling
clots
of
blue
fire
,
the
night
closed
in
dark
again
,
the
wheels
of
the
steamer
were
heard
revolving
,
and
her
lights
glided
smoothly
away
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
.
  
<EOS>
It
appeared
to
Miss
Abbey
and
her
two
companions
that
a
considerable
time
had
been
thus
occupied
.
<EOS>
There
was
now
as
eager
a
set
towards
the
shore
beneath
the
house
as
there
had
been
from
it
;
and
it
was
only
on
the
first
boat
of
the
rush
coming
in
that
it
was
known
what
had
occurred
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
that
's
Tom
Tootle
,
"
Miss
Abbey
made
proclamation
,
in
her
most
commanding
tones
,
"
let
him
instantly
come
underneath
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
submissive
Tom
complied
,
attended
by
a
crowd
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
,
Tootle
?
"
demanded
Miss
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
foreign
steamer
,
miss
,
run
down
a
wherry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
many
in
the
wherry
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
man
,
Miss
Abbey
.
"
  
"
Found
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
under
water
a
long
time
,
Miss

but
they
've
grappled
up
the
body

"
  
<EOS>
"
Let

bring
it
here

<EOS>
You

Bob
Gliddery

shut
the

stand
by
it
on
the
inside

you
open

I
tell
you

<EOS>
Any
police
down
there

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Miss
Abbey
,
"
was
official
rejoinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
they
have
brought
the
body
in
,
keep
the
crowd
out
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
And
help
Bob
Gliddery
to
shut
'em
out

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
Miss
Abbey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
autocratic
landlady
withdrew
into
the
house
with
Riah
and
Miss
Jenny
,
and
disposed
those
forces
,
one
on
either
side
of
her
,
within
the
half
-
door
of
the
bar
,
as
behind
a
breastwork
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
two
stand
close
here

"
said
Miss
Abbey
,
"
and
<EOS>
you
'll
come
to
no
hurt

and
see
it
brought
in

<EOS>
Bob
,
you
stand
by
the
door

"
  
<EOS>
That
sentinel
,
smartly
giving
his
rolled
shirt
-
sleeves
an
extra
and
a
final
tuck
on
his
shoulders
,
obeyed
.
  
<EOS>
Sound
of
advancing
voices
,
sound
of
advancing
steps
.
<EOS>
Shuffle
and
talk
without

<EOS>
Momentary
pause
.
<EOS>
Two
peculiarly
blunt
knocks
or
pokes
at
the
door
,
as
if
the
dead
man
arriving
on
his
back
were
striking
at
it
with
the
soles
of
his
motionless
feet
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
stretcher
,
or
the
shutter

<EOS>
whichever
of
the
two

said
Miss

,
with
experienced
ear

<EOS>
"
Open

Door
opened

<EOS>
Heavy

A

A

Stoppage

Baffled

"
Come

"
said
Miss
Abbey
;
for
so
potent
was
she
with
her
subjects
that
even
then
the
bearers
awaited
her
permission
.
"
<EOS>
First
floor

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
entry
being
low
,
and
the
staircase
being
low
,
they
so
took
up
the
burden
they
had
set
down
,
as
to
carry
that
low
.
<EOS>
The
recumbent
figure
,
in
passing
,
lay
hardly
as
high
as
the
half
door
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Abbey
started
back
at
sight
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
good
God
!
"
said
she
,
turning
to
her
two
companions
,
"
that
's
the
very
man
who
made
the
declaration
we
have
just
had
in
our
hands
.
<EOS>
That
's
Riderhood
!
"
   
<EOS>
THE
SAME
RESPECTED
FRIEND
IN
MORE
ASPECTS
THAN
ONE
.
 
<EOS>
In
sooth
,
it
is
Riderhood
and
no
other
,
or
it
is
the
outer
husk
and
shell
of
Riderhood
and
no
other
,
that
is
borne
into
Miss
Abbey
's
first
-
floor
bedroom
.
<EOS>
Supple
to
twist
and
turn
as
the
Rogue
has
ever
been
,
he
is
sufficiently
rigid
now
;
and
not
without
much
shuffling
of
attendant
feet
,
and
tilting
of
his
bier
this
way
and
that
way
,
and
peril
even
of
his
sliding
off
it
and
being
tumbled
in
a
heap
over
the
balustrades
,
can
he
be
got
up
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fetch
a
doctor
,
"
quoth
Miss
Abbey
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
"
Fetch
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
On
both
of
which
errands
,
quick
messengers
depart
.
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
-
seeking
messenger
meets
the
doctor
halfway
,
coming
under
convoy
of
police
.
<EOS>
Doctor
examines
the
dank
carcase
,
and
pronounces
,
not
hopefully
,
that
it
is
worth
while
trying
to
reanimate
the
same
.
<EOS>
All
the
best
means
are
at
once
in
action
,
and
everybody
present
lends
a
hand
,
and
a
heart
and
soul
.
<EOS>
No
one
has
the
least
regard
for
the
man
;
with
them
all
,
he
has
been
an
object
of
avoidance
,
suspicion
,
and
aversion
;
but
the
spark
of
life
within
him
is
curiously
separable
from
himself
now
,
and
they
have
a
deep
interest
in
it
,
probably
because
it
is
life
,
and
they
are
living
and
must
die
.
  
<EOS>
In
answer
to
the
doctor
's
inquiry
how
did
it
happen
,
and
was
anyone
to
blame
,
Tom
Tootle
gives
in
his
verdict
,
unavoidable
accident
and
no
one
to
blame
but
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
"
He
was
slinking
about
in
his
boat
,
"
says
Tom
,
"
which
slinking
were
,
not
to
speak
ill
of
the
dead
,
the
manner
of
the
man
,
when
he
come
right
athwart
the
steamer
's
bows
<EOS>
and
she
cut
him
in
two
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Tootle
is
so
far
figurative
,
touching
the
dismemberment
,
as
that
he
means
the
boat
,
and
not
the
man
.
<EOS>
For
,
the
man
lies
whole
before
them

Captain

should
be
hung
up
by
the
heels
,
"
sim'lar
,
"
says
Captain
Joey
,
"
to
mutton
in
a
butcher
's
shop
,
"
and
should
then
,
as
a
particularly
choice
manoeuvre
for
promoting
easy
respiration
,
be
rolled
upon
casks
.
<EOS>
These
scraps
of
the
wisdom
of
the
captain
's
ancestors
are
received
with
such
speechless
indignation
by
Miss
Abbey
,
that
she
instantly
seizes
the
Captain
by
the
collar
,
and
without
a
single
word
ejects
him
,
not
presuming
to
remonstrate
,
from
the
scene
.
  
<EOS>
There
then
remain
,
to
assist
the
doctor
and
Tom
,
only
those
three
other
regular
customers
,
Bob
Glamour
,
William
Williams
,
and
Jonathan
(
family
name
of
the
latter
,
if
any
,
unknown
to
mankind
)
,
who
are
quite
enough
.
<EOS>
Miss
Abbey
having
looked
in
to
make
sure
that
nothing
is
wanted
,
descends
to
the
bar
,
and
there
awaits
the
result
,
with
the
gentle
Jew
and
Miss
Jenny
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
are
not
gone
for
good
,
Mr.
Riderhood
,
it
would
be
something
to
know
where
you
are
hiding
at
present
.
<EOS>
This
flabby
lump
of
mortality
that
we
work
so
hard
at
with
such
patient
perseverance
,
yields
no
sign
of
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
gone
for
good
,
Rogue
,
it
is
very
solemn
,
and
if
you
are
coming
back
,
it
is
hardly
less
so
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
in
the
suspense
and
mystery
of
the
latter
question
,
involving
that
of
where
you
may
be
now
,
there
is
a
solemnity
even
added
to
that
of
death
,
making
us
who
are
in
attendance
alike
afraid
to
look
on
you
and
to
look
off
you
,
and
making
those
below
start
at
the
least
sound
of
a
creaking
plank
in
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
Did
that
eyelid
tremble
?
<EOS>
So
the
doctor
,
breathing
low
,
and
closely
watching
,
asks
himself
.
  
<EOS>
No
.
  
<EOS>
Did
that
nostril
twitch
?
  
<EOS>
No
.
  
<EOS>
This
artificial
respiration
ceasing
,
do
I
feel
any
faint
flutter
under
my
hand
upon
the
chest
?
  
<EOS>
No
.
  
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
But
try
over
and
over
again
,
nevertheless
.
  
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
A
token
of
life
!
<EOS>
An
indubitable
token
of
life
!
<EOS>
The
spark
may
smoulder
and
go
out
,
or
it
may
glow
and
expand
,
but
see
!
<EOS>
The
four
rough
fellows
,
seeing
,
shed
tears
.
<EOS>
Neither
Riderhood
in
this
world
,
nor
Riderhood
in
the
other
,
could
draw
tears
from
them
;
but
a
striving
human
soul
between
the
two
can
do
it
easily
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
struggling
to
come
back
.
<EOS>
Now
,
he
is
almost
here
,
now
he
is
far
away
again
.
<EOS>
Now
he
is
struggling
harder
to
get
back
.
<EOS>
And
yet
 
---
like
us
all
,
when
we
swoon
---
like
us
all
,
every
day
of
our
lives
when
we
wake
---
he
is
instinctively
unwilling
to
be
restored
to
the
consciousness
of
this
existence
,
and
would
be
left
dormant
,
if
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
Bob
Gliddery
returns
with
Pleasant
Riderhood
,
who
was
out
when
sought
for
,
and
hard
to
find
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
shawl
over
her
head
,
and
her
first
action
,
when
she
takes
it
off
weeping
,
and
curtseys
to
Miss
Abbey
,
is
to
wind
her
hair
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Miss
Abbey
,
for
having
father
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
bound
to
say
,
girl
,
I
did
n't
know
who
it
was
,
"
returns
Miss
Abbey
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
hope
it
would
have
been
pretty
much
the
same
if
I
had
known
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Pleasant
,
fortified
with
a
sip
of
brandy
,
is
ushered
into
the
first
-
floor
chamber
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
express
much
sentiment
about
her
father
if
she
were
called
upon
to
pronounce
his
funeral
oration
,
but
she
has
a
greater
tenderness
for
him
than
he
ever
had
for
her
,
and
crying
bitterly
when
she
sees
him
stretched
unconscious
,
asks
the
doctor
,
with
clasped
hands
:
<EOS>
"
Is
there
no
hope
,
sir
?
<EOS>
O
poor
father
!
<EOS>
Is
poor
father
dead
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
which
the
doctor
,
on
one
knee
beside
the
body
,
busy
and
watchful
,
only
rejoins
without
looking
round
:
"
<EOS>
Now
,
my
girl
,
unless
you
have
the
self
-
command
to
be
perfectly
quiet
,
I
can
not
allow
you
to
remain
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
,
consequently
,
wipes
her
eyes
with
her
back
-
hair
,
which
is
in
fresh
need
of
being
wound
up
,
and
having
got
it
out
of
the
way
,
watches
with
terrified
interest
all
that
goes
on
.
<EOS>
Her
natural
woman
's
aptitude
soon
renders
her
able
to
give
a
little
help
.
<EOS>
Anticipating
the
doctor
's
want
of
this
or
that
,
she
quietly
has
it
ready
for
him
,
and
so
by
degrees
is
intrusted
with
the
charge
of
supporting
her
father
's
head
upon
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
something
so
new
to
Pleasant
to
see
her
father
an
object
of
sympathy
and
interest
,
to
find
any
one
very
willing
to
tolerate
his
society
in
this
world
,
not
to
say
pressingly
and
soothingly
entreating
him
to
belong
to
it
,
that
it
gives
her
a
sensation
she
never
experienced
before
.
<EOS>
Some
hazy
idea
that
if
affairs
could
remain
thus
for
a
long
time
it
would
be
a
respectable
change
,
floats
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Also
some
vague
idea
that
the
old
evil
is
drowned
out
of
him
,
and
that
if
he
should
happily
come
back
to
resume
his
occupation
of
the
empty
form
that
lies
upon
the
bed
,
his
spirit
will
be
altered
.
<EOS>
In
which
state
of
mind
<EOS>
she
kisses
the
stony
lips
,
and
quite
believes
that
the
impassive
hand
she
chafes
will
revive
a
tender
hand
,
if
it
revive
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Sweet
delusion
for
Pleasant
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
But
they
minister
to
him
with
such
extraordinary
interest
,
their
anxiety
is
so
keen
,
their
vigilance
is
so
great
,
their
excited
joy
grows
so
intense
as
the
signs
of
life
strengthen
,
<EOS>
that
how
can
she
resist
it
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
And
now
he
begins
to
breathe
naturally
,
and
he
stirs
,
and
the
doctor
declares
him
to
have
come
back
from
that
inexplicable
journey
where
he
stopped
on
the
dark
road
,
and
to
be
here
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
Tootle
,
who
is
nearest
to
the
doctor
when
he
says
this
,
grasps
the
doctor
fervently
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
Bob
Glamour
,
William
Williams
,
and
Jonathan
of
the
no
surname
,
all
shake
hands
with
one
another
round
,
and
with
the
doctor
too
.
<EOS>
Bob
Glamour
blows
his
nose
,
and
Jonathan
of
the
no
surname
is
moved
to
do
likewise
,
but
lacking
a
pocket
handkerchief
abandons
that
outlet
for
his
emotion
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
sheds
tears
deserving
her
own
name
,
and
her
sweet
delusion
is
at
its
height
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
intelligence
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
wants
to
ask
a
question
.
<EOS>
He
wonders
where
he
is
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
,
you
were
run
down
on
the
river
,
and
are
at
Miss
Abbey
Potterson
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stares
at
his
daughter
,
stares
all
around
him
,
closes
his
eyes
,
and
lies
slumbering
on
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
The
short
-
lived
delusion
begins
to
fade
.
<EOS>
The
low
,
bad
,
unimpressible
face
is
coming
up
from
the
depths
of
the
river
,
or
what
other
depths
,
to
the
surface
again
.
<EOS>
As
he
grows
warm
,
the
doctor
and
the
four
men
cool
.
<EOS>
As
his
lineaments
soften
with
life
,
their
faces
and
their
hearts
harden
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
do
now
,
"
says
the
doctor
,
washing
his
hands
,
and
looking
at
the
patient
with
growing
disfavour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Many
a
better
man
,
"
moralizes
Tom
Tootle
with
a
gloomy
shake
of
the
head
,
"
ai
n't
had
his
luck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
to
be
hoped
he
'll
make
a
better
use
of
his
life
,
"
says
Bob
Glamour
,
"
than
I
expect
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Or
than
he
done
afore
,
"
adds
William
Williams
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
no
,
not
he
!
"
says
Jonathan
of
the
no
surname
,
clinching
the
quartette
.
  
<EOS>
They
speak
in
a
low
tone
because
of
his
daughter
,
but
she
sees
that
they
have
all
drawn
off
,
and
that
they
stand
in
a
group
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
shunning
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
much
to
suspect
them
of
being
sorry
that
he
did
n't
die
when
he
had
done
so
much
towards
it
,
but
they
clearly
wish
that
they
had
had
a
better
subject
to
bestow
their
pains
on
.
<EOS>
Intelligence
is
conveyed
to
Miss
Abbey
in
the
bar
,
who
reappears
on
the
scene
,
and
contemplates
from
a
distance
,
holding
whispered
discourse
with
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
The
spark
of
life
was
deeply
interesting
while
it
was
in
abeyance
,
but
now
that
it
has
got
established
in
Mr.
Riderhood
,
there
appears
to
be
a
general
desire
that
circumstances
had
admitted
of
its
being
developed
in
anybody
else
,
rather
than
that
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
says
Miss
Abbey
,
cheering
them
up
,
"
you
have
done
your
duty
like
good
and
true
men
,
and
you
had
better
come
down
and
take
something
at
the
expense
of
the
Porters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
they
all
do
,
leaving
the
daughter
watching
the
father
.
<EOS>
To
whom
,
in
their
absence
,
Bob
Gliddery
presents
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
gills
looks
rum
;
do
n't
they
?
"
says
Bob
,
after
inspecting
the
patient
.
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
faintly
nods
.
  
<EOS>
"
His
gills
'll
look
rummer
when
he
wakes
;
wo
n't
they
?
"
says
Bob
.
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
hopes
not
.
<EOS>
Why
?
  
<EOS>
"
When
he
finds
himself
here
,
you
know
,
"
Bob
explains
.
"
<EOS>
Cause
Miss
Abbey
forbid
him
the
house
and
ordered
him
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
what
you
may
call
the
Fates
ordered
him
into
it
again
.
<EOS>
Which
is
rumness
;
ai
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
would
n't
have
come
here
of
his
own
accord
,
"
returns
poor
Pleasant
,
with
an
effort
at
a
little
pride
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
retorts
Bob
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
he
would
n't
have
been
let
in
,
if
he
had
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
short
delusion
is
quite
dispelled
now
.
<EOS>
As
plainly
as
she
sees
on
her
arm
the
old
father
,
unimproved
,
Pleasant
sees
that
everybody
there
will
cut
him
when
he
recovers
consciousness
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
him
away
ever
so
soon
as
I
can
,
"
thinks
Pleasant
with
a
sigh
;
"
he
's
best
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Presently
they
all
return
,
and
wait
for
him
to
become
conscious
that
they
will
all
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
Some
clothes
are
got
together
for
him
to
wear
,
his
own
being
saturated
with
water
,
and
his
present
dress
being
composed
of
blankets
.
  
<EOS>
Becoming
more
and
more
uncomfortable
,
as
though
the
prevalent
dislike
were
finding
him
out
somewhere
in
his
sleep
and
expressing
itself
to
him
,
the
patient
at
last
opens
his
eyes
wide
,
and
is
assisted
by
his
daughter
to
sit
up
in
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Riderhood
,
"
says
the
doctor
,
"
how
do
you
feel
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
replies
gruffly
,
"
Nothing
to
boast
on
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Having
,
in
fact
,
returned
to
life
in
an
uncommonly
sulky
state
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
preach
;
but
I
hope
,
"
says
the
doctor
,
gravely
shaking
his
head
,
"
that
this
escape
may
have
a
good
effect
upon
you
,
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
patient
's
discontented
growl
of
a
reply
is
not
intelligible
;
his
daughter
,
however
,
could
interpret
,
if
she
would
,
that
what
he
says
is
,
he
"
do
n't
want
no
Poll
-
Parroting
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Riderhood
next
demands
his
shirt
;
and
draws
it
on
over
his
head
(
with
his
daughter
's
help
)
exactly
as
if
he
had
just
had
a
Fight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Warn't
it
a
steamer
?
"
he
pauses
to
ask
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
have
the
law
on
her
,
bust
her
!
<EOS>
and
make
her
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
buttons
his
linen
very
moodily
,
twice
or
thrice
stopping
to
examine
his
arms
and
hands
,
as
if
to
see
what
punishment
he
has
received
in
the
Fight
.
<EOS>
He
then
doggedly
demands
his
other
garments
,
and
slowly
gets
them
on
,
with
an
appearance
of
great
malevolence
towards
his
late
opponent
and
all
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
He
has
an
impression
that
his
nose
is
bleeding
,
and
several
times
draws
the
back
of
his
hand
across
it
,
and
looks
for
the
result
,
in
a
pugilistic
manner
,
greatly
strengthening
that
incongruous
resemblance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
's
my
fur
cap
?
"
he
asks
in
a
surly
voice
,
when
he
has
shuffled
his
clothes
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
river
,
"
somebody
rejoins
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
warn't
there
no
honest
man
to
pick
it
up
?
<EOS>
O
'
course
there
was
though
,
and
to
cut
off
with
it
arterwards
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
rare
lot
,
all
on
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
Mr.
Riderhood
:
taking
from
the
hands
of
his
daughter
,
with
special
ill
-
will
,
a
lent
cap
,
and
grumbling
as
he
pulls
it
down
over
his
ears
.
<EOS>
Then
,
getting
on
his
unsteady
legs
,
leaning
heavily
upon
her
,
and
growling
"
Hold
still
,
ca
n't
you
?
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
You
must
be
a
staggering
next
,
must
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
takes
his
departure
out
of

A
HAPPY
RETURN
OF
THE
DAY
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Wilfer
had
seen
a
full
quarter
of
a
hundred
more
anniversaries
of
their
wedding
day
than
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
had
seen
of
theirs
,
but
they
still
celebrated
the
occasion
in
the
bosom
of
their
family
.
<EOS>
Not
that
these
celebrations
ever
resulted
in
anything
particularly
agreeable
,
or
that
the
family
was
ever
disappointed
by
that
circumstance
on
account
of
having
looked
forward
to
the
return
of
the
auspicious
day
with
sanguine
anticipations
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
It
was
kept
morally
,
rather
as
a
Fast
than
a
Feast
,
enabling
Mrs.
Wilfer
to
hold
a
sombre
darkling
state
,
which
exhibited
that
impressive
woman
in
her
choicest
colours
.
  
<EOS>
The
noble
lady
's
condition
on
these
delightful
occasions
was
one
compounded
of
heroic
endurance
and
heroic
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
Lurid
indications
of
the
better
marriages
she
might
have
made
,
shone
athwart
the
awful
gloom
of
her
composure
,
and
fitfully
revealed
the
cherub
as
a
little
monster
unaccountably
favoured
by
Heaven
,
who
had
possessed
himself
of
a
blessing
for
which
many
of
his
superiors
had
sued
and
contended
in
vain
.
<EOS>
So
firmly
had
this
his
position
towards
his
treasure
become
established
,
that
when
the
anniversary
arrived
,
it
always
found
him
in
an
apologetic
state
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
impossible
that
his
modest
penitence
may
have
even
gone
the
length
of
sometimes
severely
reproving
him
for
that
he
ever
took
the
liberty
of
making
so
exalted
a
character
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
children
of
the
union
,
their
experience
of
these
festivals
had
been
sufficiently
uncomfortable
to
lead
them
annually
to
wish
,
when
out
of
their
tenderest
years
,
either
that
Ma
had
married
somebody
else
instead
of
much
-
teased
Pa
,
or
that
Pa
had
married
somebody
else
instead
of
Ma
.
<EOS>
When
there
came
to
be
but
two
sisters
left
at
home
,
the
daring
mind
of
Bella
on
the
next
of
these
occasions
scaled
the
height
of
wondering
with
droll
vexation
<EOS>
"
what
on
earth
Pa
ever
could
have
seen
in
Ma
,
to
induce
him
to
make
such
a
little
fool
of
himself
as
to
ask
her
to
have
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
revolving
year
now
bringing
the
day
round
in
its
orderly
sequence
,
Bella
arrived
in
the
Boffin
chariot
to
assist
at
the
celebration
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
family
custom
when
the
day
recurred
,
to
sacrifice
a
pair
of
fowls
on
the
altar
of
Hymen
;
and
Bella
had
sent
a
note
beforehand
,
to
intimate
that
she
would
bring
the
votive
offering
with
her
.
<EOS>
So
,
Bella
and
the
fowls
,
by
the
united
energies
of
two
horses
,
two
men
,
four
wheels
,
and
a
plum
-
pudding
carriage
dog
with
as
uncomfortable
a
collar
on
as
if
he
had
been
George
the
Fourth
,
were
deposited
at
the
door
of
the
parental
dwelling
.
<EOS>
They
were
there
received
by
Mrs.
Wilfer
in
person
,
whose
dignity
on
this
,
as
on
most
special
occasions
,
was
heightened
by
a
mysterious
toothache
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
require
the
carriage
at
night
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
walk
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
male
domestic
of
Mrs.
Boffin
touched
his
hat
,
and
in
the
act
of
departure
had
an
awful
glare
bestowed
upon
him
by
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
intended
to
carry
deep
into
his
audacious
soul
the
assurance
that
,
whatever
his
private
suspicions
might
be
,
male
domestics
in
livery
were
no
rarity
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
dear
Ma
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
and
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
well
,
Bella
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
as
can
be
expected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
Ma
,
"
said
Bella
;
"
you
talk
as
if
one
was
just
born
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
exactly
what
Ma
has
been
doing
,
"
interposed
Lavvy
,
over
the
maternal
shoulder
,
"
ever
since
we
got
up
this
morning
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
very
well
to
laugh
,
Bella
,
but
anything
more
exasperating
<EOS>
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
a
look
too
full
of
majesty
to
be
accompanied
by
any
words
,
attended
both
her
daughters
to
the
kitchen
,
where
the
sacrifice
was
to
be
prepared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
said
she
,
resignedly
,
"
has
been
so
polite
as
to
place
his
sitting
-
room
at
our
disposal
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
You
will
therefore
,
Bella
,
be
entertained
in
the
humble
abode
of
your
parents
,
so
far
in
accordance
with
your
present
style
of
living
,
that
there
will
be
a
drawing
-
room
for
your
reception
as
well
as
a
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
Your
papa
invited
Mr.
Rokesmith
to
partake
of
our
lowly
fare
.
<EOS>
In
excusing
himself
on
account
of
a
particular
engagement
,
he
offered
the
use
of
his
apartment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
happened
to
know
that
he
had
no
engagement
out
of
his
own
room
at
Mr.
Boffin
's
,
but
she
approved
of
his
staying
away
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
only
have
put
one
another
out
of
countenance
,
"
she
thought
,
"
and
we
do
that
quite
often
enough
as
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
Yet
she
had
sufficient
curiosity
about
his
room
,
to
run
up
to
it
with
the
least
possible
delay
,
and
make
a
close
inspection
of
its
contents
.
<EOS>
It
was
tastefully
though
economically
furnished
,
and
very
neatly
arranged
.
<EOS>
There
were
shelves
and
stands
of
books
,
English
.
<EOS>
French
,
and
Italian
;
and
in
a
portfolio
on
the
writing
-
table
there
were
sheets
upon
sheets
of
memoranda
and
calculations
in
figures
,
evidently
referring
to
the
Boffin
property
.
<EOS>
On
that
table
also
,
carefully
backed
with
canvas
,
varnished
,
mounted
,
and
rolled
like
a
map
,
was
the
placard
descriptive
of
the
murdered
man
who
had
come
from
afar
to
be
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
shrank
from
this
ghostly
surprise
,
and
felt
quite
frightened
as
she
rolled
and
tied
it
up
again
.
<EOS>
Peeping
about
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
she
came
upon
a
print
,
a
graceful
head
of
a
pretty
woman
,
elegantly
framed
,
hanging
in
the
corner
by
the
easy
chair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
,
sir
!
"
said
Bella
,
after
stopping
to
ruminate
before
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
can
guess
whom
you
think
that
's
like
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
's
much
more
like
---
your
impudence
!
"
 
<EOS>
Having
said
which
she
decamped
:
not
solely
because
she
was
offended
,
but
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
look
at
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Ma
,
"
said
Bella
,
reappearing
in
the
kitchen
with
some
remains
of
a
blush
,
"
you
and
Lavvy
think
magnificent
me
fit
for
nothing
,
but
I
intend
to
prove
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
be
Cook
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
!
"
rejoined
her
majestic
mother
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
permit
it
.
<EOS>
Cook
,
in
that
dress
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
my
dress
,
Ma
,
"
returned
Bella
,
merrily
searching
in
a
dresser
-
drawer
,
"
I
mean
to
apron
it
and
towel
it
all
over
the
front
;
 
and
as
to
permission
,
I
mean
to
do
without
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
cook
?
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
who
never
cooked
when
you
were
at
home
?
"
  
"
Yes
,
Ma
,
"
returned
Bella
;
"
that
is
precisely
the
state
of
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
girded
herself
with
a
white
apron
,
and
busily
with
knots
and
pins
contrived
a
bib
to
it
,
coming
close
and
tight
under
her
chin
,
as
if
it
had
caught
her
round
the
neck
to
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
Over
this
bib
her
dimples
looked
delightful
,
and
under
it
her
pretty
figure
not
less
so
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Ma
,
"
said
Bella
,
pushing
back
her
hair
from
her
temples
with
both
hands
,
<EOS>
"
what
's
first
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
First
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
solemnly
,
"
if
you
persist
in
what
I
can
not
but
regard
as
conduct
utterly
incompatible
with
the
equipage
in
which
you
arrived
---
"
  
(
"
Which
I
do
,
Ma
.
"
)
  
<EOS>
"
First
,
then
,
you
put
the
fowls
down
to
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
---
be
---
sure
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
;
"
and
flour
them
,
and
twirl
them
round
,
and
there
they
go
!
"
<EOS>
sending
them
spinning
at
a
great
rate
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
next
,
Ma
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Next
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
with
a
wave
of
her
gloves
,
expressive
of
abdication
under
protest
from
the
culinary
throne
,
"
I
would
recommend
examination
of
the
bacon
in
the
saucepan
on
the
fire
,
and
also
of
the
potatoes
by
the
application
of
a
fork
.
<EOS>
Preparation
of
the
greens
will
further
become
necessary
if
you
persist
in
this
unseemly
demeanour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
of
course
I
do
,
Ma
.
"
  
<EOS>
Persisting
,
Bella
gave
her
attention
to
one
thing
and
forgot
the
other
,
and
gave
her
attention
to
the
other
and
forgot
the
third
,
and
remembering
the
third
was
distracted
by
the
fourth
,
and
made
amends
whenever
she
went
wrong
by
giving
the
unfortunate
fowls
an
extra
spin
,
which
made
their
chance
of
ever
getting
cooked
exceedingly
doubtful
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
pleasant
cookery
too
.
<EOS>
Meantime
Miss
Lavinia
,
oscillating
between
the
kitchen
and
the
opposite
room
,
prepared
the
dining
-
table
in
the
latter
chamber
.
<EOS>
This
office
she
(
always
doing
her
household
spiriting
with
unwillingness
)
performed
in
a
startling
series
of
whisks
and
bumps
;
laying
the
table
-
cloth
as
if
she
were
raising
the
wind
,
putting
down
the
glasses
and
salt
-
cellars
as
if
she
were
knocking
at
the
door
,
and
clashing
the
knives
and
forks
in
a
skirmishing
manner
suggestive
of
hand
-
to
-
hand
conflict
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
Ma
,
"
whispered
Lavinia
to
Bella
when
this
was
done
,
and
they
stood
over
the
roasting
fowls
.
<EOS>
"
If
one
was
the
most
dutiful
child
in
existence
(
of
course
on
the
whole
one
hopes
one
is
)
,
is
n't
she
enough
to
make
one
want
to
poke
her
with
something
wooden
,
sitting
there
bolt
upright
in
a
corner
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
suppose
,
"
returned
Bella
,
"
that
poor
Pa
was
to
sit
bolt
upright
in
another
corner
.
"
  
"
My
dear
,
he
could
n't
do
it
,
"
said
Lavvy
.
<EOS>
"
Pa
would
loll
directly
.
<EOS>
But
indeed
I
do
not
believe
there
ever
was
any
human
creature
who
could
keep
so
bolt
upright
as
Ma
,
or
put
such
an
amount
of
aggravation
into
one
back
!
<EOS>
What
's
the
matter
,
Ma
?
<EOS>
Ai
n't
you
well
,
Ma
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Doubtless
I
am
very
well
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
turning
her
eyes
upon
her
youngest
born
,
with
scornful
fortitude
.
<EOS>
"
What
should
be
the
matter
with
Me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
seem
very
brisk
,
Ma
,
"
retorted
Lavvy
the
bold
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brisk
?
"
repeated
her
parent
,
"
Brisk
?
<EOS>
Whence
the
low
expression
,
Lavinia
?
<EOS>
If
I
am
uncomplaining
,
if
I
am
silently
contented
with
my
lot
,
let
that
suffice
for
my
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Ma
,
"
returned
Lavvy
,
"
since
you
will
force
it
out
of
me
,
I
must
respectfully
take
leave
to
say
that
your
family
are
no
doubt
under
the
greatest
obligations
to
you
for
having
an
annual
toothache
on
your
wedding
day
,
and
that
it
's
very
disinterested
in
you
,
and
an
immense
blessing
to
them
.
<EOS>
Still
,
on
the
whole
,
it
is
possible
to
be
too
boastful
even
of
that
boon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
incarnation
of
sauciness
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
do
you
speak
like
that
to
me
?
<EOS>
On
this
day
,
of
all
days
in
the
year
?
<EOS>
Pray
<EOS>
do
you
know
what
would
have
become
of
you
,
if
I
had
not
bestowed
my
hand
upon
R.
W.
,
your
father
,
on
this
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Ma
,
"
replied
Lavvy
,
"
I
really
do
not
;
and
,
with
the
greatest
respect
for
your
abilities
and
information
,
I
very
much
doubt
if
you
do
either
.
"
  
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
the
sharp
vigour
of
this
sally
on
a
weak
point
of
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
entrenchments
might
have
routed
that
heroine
for
the
time
,
is
rendered
uncertain
by
the
arrival
of
a
flag
of
truce
in
the
person
of
Mr.
George
Sampson
:
<EOS>
bidden
to
the
feast
as
a
friend
of
the
family
,
whose
affections
were
now
understood
to
be
in
course
of
transference
from
Bella
to
Lavinia
,
and
whom
Lavinia
kept
---
possibly
in
remembrance
of
his
bad
taste
in
having
overlooked
her
in
the
first
instance
---
under
a
course
of
stinging
discipline
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
congratulate
you
,
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
said
Mr.
George
Sampson
,
who
had
meditated
this
neat
address
while
coming
along
,
"
on
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
thanked
him
with
a
magnanimous
sigh
,
and
again
became
an
unresisting
prey
to
that
inscrutable
toothache
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
surprised
,
"
said
Mr.
Sampson
feebly
,
"
that
Miss
Bella
condescends
to
cook
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Miss
Lavinia
descended
on
the
ill
-
starred
young
gentleman
with
a
crushing
supposition
that
at
all
events
it
was
no
business
of
his
.
<EOS>
This
disposed
of
Mr.
Sampson
in
a
melancholy
retirement
of
spirit
,
until
the
cherub
arrived
,
whose
amazement
at
the
lovely
woman
's
occupation
was
great
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
she
persisted
in
dishing
the
dinner
as
well
as
cooking
it
,
and
then
sat
down
,
bibless
and
apronless
,
to
partake
of
it
as
an
illustrious
guest
:
Mrs.
Wilfer
first
responding
to
her
husband
's
cheerful
"
<EOS>
For
what
we
are
about
to
receive
---
"
with
a
sepulchral
Amen
,
calculated
to
cast
a
damp
upon
the
stoutest
appetite
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
,
"
said
Bella
,
as
she
watched
the
carving
of
the
fowls
,
"
makes
them
pink
inside
,
I
wonder
,
Pa
!
<EOS>
Is
it
the
breed
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
think
it
's
the
breed
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
Pa.
<EOS>
"
I
rather
think
it
is
because
they
are
not
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
ought
to
be
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
aware
they
ought
to
be
,
my
dear
,
"
rejoined
her
father
,
"
but
they
---
ai
n't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
the
gridiron
was
put
in
requisition
,
and
the
good
-
tempered
cherub
,
who
was
often
as
un
-
cherubically
employed
in
his
own
family
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
employment
of
some
of
the
Old
Masters
,
undertook
to
grill
the
fowls
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
except
in
respect
of
staring
about
him
(
a
branch
of
the
public
service
to
which
the
pictorial
cherub
is
much
addicted
)
,
this
domestic
cherub
discharged
as
many
odd
functions
as
his
prototype
;
with
the
difference
,
say
,
that
he
performed
with
a
blacking
-
brush
on
the
family
's
boots
,
instead
of
performing
on
enormous
wind
instruments
and
double
-
basses
,
and
that
he
conducted
himself
with
cheerful
alacrity
to
much
useful
purpose
,
instead
of
foreshortening
himself
in
the
air
with
the
vaguest
intentions
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
helped
him
with
his
supplemental
cookery
,
and
made
him
very
happy
,
but
put
him
in
mortal
terror
too
by
asking
him
when
they
sat
down
at
table
again
,
how
he
supposed
they
cooked
fowls
at
the
Greenwich
dinners
,
and
whether
he
believed
they
really
were
such
pleasant
dinners
as
people
said
?
<EOS>
His
secret
winks
and
nods
of
remonstrance
,
in
reply
,
made
the
mischievous
Bella
laugh
until
she
choked
,
and
then
Lavinia
was
obliged
to
slap
her
on
the
back
,
and
then
she
laughed
the
more
.
  
<EOS>
But
her
mother
was
a
fine
corrective
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
;
 
to
whom
her
father
,
in
the
innocence
of
his
good
-
fellowship
,
at
intervals
appealed
with
:
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
am
afraid
you
are
not
enjoying
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
so
,
R.
W.
?
<EOS>
"
she
would
sonorously
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
my
dear
,
you
seem
a
little
out
of
sorts
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
,
"
would
be
the
rejoinder
,
in
exactly
the
same
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
take
a
merry
-
thought
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
whatever
you
please
,
R.
W.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
my
dear
,
do
you
like
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
it
as
well
as
I
like
anything
,
R.
W.
"
<EOS>
The
stately
woman
would
then
,
with
a
meritorious
appearance
of
devoting
herself
to
the
general
good
,
pursue
her
dinner
as
if
she
were
feeding
somebody
else
on
high
public
grounds
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
had
brought
dessert
and
two
bottles
of
wine
,
thus
shedding
unprecedented
splendour
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
did
the
honors
of
the
first
glass
by
proclaiming
:
"
R.
W.
I
drink
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
And
I
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pa
and
Ma
!
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
,
"
Mrs.
Wilfer
interposed
,
with
outstretched
glove
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
I
drank
to
your
papa
.
<EOS>
If
,
however
,
you
insist
on
including
me
,
I
can
in
gratitude
offer
no
objection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Lor
,
Ma
,
"
interposed
Lavvy
the
bold
,
"
is
n't
it
the
day
that
made
you
and
Pa
one
and
the
same
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
patience
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
whatever
other
circumstance
the
day
may
be
marked
,
it
is
not
the
day
,
Lavinia
,
on
which
I
will
allow
a
child
of
mine
to
pounce
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
beg
---
nay
,
command
!
---
that
you
will
not
pounce
.
<EOS>
R.
W.
,
it
is
appropriate
to
recall
that
it
is
for
you
to
command
and
for
me
to
obey
.
<EOS>
It
is
your
house
,
and
you
are
master
at
your
own
table
.
<EOS>
Both
our
healths
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Drinking
the
toast
with
tremendous
stiffness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
am
a
little
afraid
,
my
dear
,
"
hinted
the
cherub
meekly
,
"
that
you
are
not
enjoying
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
quite
so
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
my
dear
,
that
perhaps
your
face
might
---
"
  
"
My
face
might
be
a
martyrdom
,
but
what
would
that
import
,
or
who
should
know
it
,
if
I
smiled
?
"
  
<EOS>
And
she
did
smile
;
manifestly
freezing
the
blood
of
Mr.
George
Sampson
by
so
doing
.
<EOS>
For
that
young
gentleman
,
catching
her
smiling
eye
,
was
so
very
much
appalled
by
its
expression
as
to
cast
about
in
his
thoughts
concerning
what
he
had
done
to
bring
it
down
upon
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
mind
naturally
falls
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
"
shall
I
say
into
a
reverie
,
or
shall
I
say
into
a
retrospect
?
<EOS>
on
a
day
like
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lavvy
,
sitting
with
defiantly
folded
arms
,
replied
(
but
not
audibly
)
,
"
For
goodness
'
sake
say
whichever
of
the
two
you
like
best
,
Ma
,
and
get
it
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
mind
,
"
pursued
Mrs.
Wilfer
in
an
oratorical
manner
,
"
naturally
reverts
to
Papa
and
Mamma
<EOS>
---
I
here
allude
to
my
parents
---
at
a
period
before
the
earliest
dawn
of
this
day
.
<EOS>
I
was
considered
tall
;
perhaps
I
was
.
<EOS>
Papa
and
Mamma
were
unquestionably
tall
.
<EOS>
I
have
rarely
seen
a
finer
woman
than
my
mother
;
never
than
my
father
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
irrepressible
Lavvy
remarked
aloud
,
"
Whatever
grandpapa
was
,
he
was
n't
a
female
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
grandpapa
,
"
retorted
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
an
awful
look
,
and
in
an
awful
tone
,
"
was
what
I
describe
him
to
have
been
,
and
would
have
struck
any
of
his
grandchildren
to
the
earth
who
presumed
to
question
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
mamma
's
cherished
hopes
that
I
should
become
united
to
a
tall
member
of
society
.
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
a
weakness
,
but
if
so
,
it
was
equally
the
weakness
,
I
believe
,
of
King
Frederick
of
Prussia
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
remarks
being
offered
to
Mr.
George
Sampson
,
who
had
not
the
courage
to
come
out
for
single
combat
,
but
lurked
with
his
chest
under
the
table
and
his
eyes
cast
down
,
Mrs.
Wilfer
proceeded
,
in
a
voice
of
increasing
sternness
and
impressiveness
,
until
she
should
force
that
skulker
to
give
himself
up
.
"
<EOS>
Mamma
would
appear
to
have
had
an
indefinable
foreboding
of
what
afterwards
happened
,
for
she
would
frequently
urge
upon
me
,
`
`
Not
a
little
man
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
,
my
child
,
not
a
little
man
.
<EOS>
Never
,
never
,
never
,
marry
a
little
man
!
"
<EOS>
"
Papa
also
would
remark
to
me
(
he
possessed
extraordinary
humour
)
,
`
`
that
a
family
of
whales
must
not
ally
themselves
with
sprats
.
"
<EOS>
"
His
company
was
eagerly
sought
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
by
the
wits
of
the
day
,
and
our
house
was
their
continual
resort
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
as
many
as
three
copper
-
plate
engravers
exchanging
the
most
exquisite
sallies
and
retorts
there
,
at
one
time
.
"
<EOS>
(
Here
Mr.
Sampson
delivered
himself
captive
,
and
said
,
with
an
uneasy
movement
on
his
chair
,
that
three
was
a
large
number
,
and
it
must
have
been
highly
entertaining
.
)
<EOS>
"
Among
the
most
prominent
members
of
that
distinguished
circle
,
was
a
gentleman
measuring
six
feet
four
in
height
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
an
engraver
.
"
<EOS>
(
Here
Mr.
Sampson
said
,
with
no
reason
whatever
,
Of
course
not
.
)
<EOS>
"
This
gentleman
was
so
obliging
as
to
honor
me
with
attentions
which
I
could
not
fail
to
understand
.
"
<EOS>
(
Here
Mr.
Sampson
murmured
that
when
it
came
to
that
,
you
could
always
tell
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
immediately
announced
to
both
my
parents
that
those
attentions
were
misplaced
,
and
that
I
could
not
favour
his
suit
.
<EOS>
The
inquired
was
he
too
tall
?
<EOS>
I
replied
it
was
not
the
stature
,
but
the
intellect
was
too
lofty
.
<EOS>
At
our
house
,
I
said
,
the
tone
was
too
brilliant
,
the
pressure
was
too
high
,
to
be
maintained
by
me
,
a
mere
woman
,
in
every
-
day
domestic
life
.
<EOS>
I
well
remember
mamma
's
clasping
her
hands
,
and
exclaiming
`
`
This
will
end
in
a
little
man
!
"
<EOS>
"
"
(
Here
Mr.
Sampson
glanced
at
his
host
and
shook
his
head
with
despondency
.
)
<EOS>
"
She
afterwards
went
so
far
as
to
predict
that
it
would
end
in
a
little
man
whose
mind
would
be
below
the
average
,
but
that
was
in
what
I
may
denominate
a
paroxysm
of
maternal
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Within
a
month
,
"
 
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
deepening
her
voice
,
as
if
she
were
relating
a
terrible
ghost
story
,
"
within
a
month
,
I
first
saw
R.
W.
my
husband
.
<EOS>
Within
a
year
,
I
married
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
natural
for
the
mind
to
recall
these
dark
coincidences
on
the
present
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sampson
at
length
released
from
the
custody
of
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
eye
,
now
drew
a
long
breath
,
and
made
the
original
and
striking
remark
that
there
was
no
accounting
for
these
sort
of
presentiments
.
<EOS>
R.
W.
scratched
his
head
and
looked
apologetically
all
round
the
table
until
he
came
to
his
wife
,
when
observing
her
as
it
were
shrouded
in
a
more
sombre
veil
than
before
,
he
once
more
hinted
,
"
My
dear
,
I
am
really
afraid
you
are
not
altogether
enjoying
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
To
which
she
once
more
replied
,
"
On
the
contrary
,
R.
W.
Quite
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
wretched
Mr.
Sampson
's
position
at
this
agreeable
entertainment
was
truly
pitiable
.
<EOS>
For
,
not
only
was
he
exposed
defenceless
to
the
harangues
of
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
but
he
received
the
utmost
contumely
at
the
hands
of
Lavinia
;
who
,
partly
to
show
Bella
that
she
(
Lavinia
)
could
do
what
she
liked
with
him
,
and
partly
to
pay
him
off
for
still
obviously
admiring
Bella
's
beauty
,
led
him
the
life
of
a
dog
.
<EOS>
Illuminated
on
the
one
hand
by
the
stately
graces
of
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
oratory
,
and
shadowed
on
the
other
by
the
checks
and
frowns
of
the
young
lady
to
whom
he
had
devoted
himself
in
his
destitution
,
the
sufferings
of
this
young
gentleman
were
distressing
to
witness
.
<EOS>
If
his
mind
for
the
moment
reeled
under
them
,
it
may
be
urged
,
in
extenuation
of
its
weakness
,
that
it
was
constitutionally
a
knock
-
knee'd
mind
and
never
very
strong
upon
its
legs
.
  
<EOS>
The
rosy
hours
were
thus
beguiled
until
it
was
time
for
Bella
to
have
Pa
's
escort
back
.
<EOS>
The
dimples
duly
tied
up
in
the
bonnet
-
strings
and
the
leave
-
taking
done
,
they
got
out
into
the
air
,
and
the
cherub
drew
a
long
breath
as
if
he
found
it
refreshing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
dear
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
the
anniversary
may
be
considered
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
the
cherub
,
"
there
's
another
of
'em
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
drew
his
arm
closer
through
hers
as
they
walked
along
,
and
gave
it
a
number
of
consolatory
pats
.
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
,
as
if
she
had
spoken
;
"
I
am
all
right
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Well
,
and
how
do
you
get
on
,
Bella
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
at
all
improved
,
Pa.
"
  
"
Ai
n't
you
really
though
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
<EOS>
Pa.
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lor
!
"
said
the
cherub
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
worse
,
Pa.
<EOS>
I
make
so
many
calculations
how
much
a
year
I
must
have
when
I
marry
,
and
what
is
the
least
I
can
manage
to
do
with
,
that
I
am
beginning
to
get
wrinkles
over
my
nose
.
<EOS>
Did
you
notice
any
wrinkles
over
my
nose
this
evening
,
Pa
?
"
  
<EOS>
Pa
laughing
at
this
,
Bella
gave
him
two
or
three
shakes
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
laugh
,
sir
,
when
you
see
your
lovely
woman
turning
haggard
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
be
prepared
in
time
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
able
to
keep
my
greediness
for
money
out
of
my
eyes
long
,
and
when
you
see
it
there
you
'll
be
sorry
,
and
serve
you
right
for
not
being
warned
in
time
.
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
we
entered
into
a
bond
of
confidence
.
<EOS>
Have
you
anything
to
impart
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
you
who
was
to
impart
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
did
you
indeed
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Then
why
did
n't
you
ask
me
,
the
moment
we
came
out
?
<EOS>
The
confidences
of
lovely
women
are
not
to
be
slighted
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
forgive
you
this
once
,

here

<EOS>

Bella
laid
the
little
forefinger
of
her
right
glove
on
her
lip
,
and
then
laid
it
on
her
father
's
lip
---
"
that
's
a
kiss
for
you
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
am
going
seriously
to
tell
you
---
let
me
see
how
many
---
four
secrets
.
<EOS>
Mind
!
<EOS>
Serious
,
grave
,
weighty
secrets
.
<EOS>
Strictly
between
ourselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Number
one
,
my
dear
?
"
said
her
father
,
settling
her
arm
comfortably
and
confidentially
.
  
<EOS>
"
Number
one
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
will
electrify
you
,
Pa.
<EOS>
Who
do
you
think
has
"
---
she
was
confused
here
in
spite
of
her
merry
way
of
beginning
---
"
has
made
an
offer
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Pa
looked
in
her
face
,
and
looked
at
the
ground
,
and
looked
in
her
face
again
,
and
declared
he
could
never
guess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
tell
me
so
,
my
dear
!

<EOS>
"
Mis

Roke

smith
,
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
separating
the
syllables
for
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
to
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
Pa
answered
quietly
with
the
counter
-
question
,
"
What
did
you
say
to
that
,
my
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
No
,
"
returned
Bella
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
course
.
"
  
"
Yes
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
"
said
her
father
,
meditating
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
told
him
why
I
thought
it
a
betrayal
of
trust
on
his
part
,
and
an
affront
to
me
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
.
<EOS>
I
am
astonished
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
he
committed
himself
without
seeing
more
of
his
way
first
.
<EOS>
Now
I
think
of
it
<EOS>
,
I
suspect
he
always
has
admired
you
though
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
hackney
coachman
may
admire
me
,
"
remarked
Bella
,
with
a
touch
of
her
mother
's
loftiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
highly
probable
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
Number
two
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Number
two
,
Pa
,
is
much
to
the
same
purpose
,
though
not
so
preposterous
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
would
propose
to
me
,
if
I
would
let
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
understand
,
my
dear
,
that
you
do
n't
intend
to
let
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
again
saying
,
with
her
former
emphasis
,
"
Why
,
of
course
not
!
"
<EOS>
her
father
felt
himself
bound
to
echo
,
"
Of
course
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
care
for
him
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
enough
,
"
her
father
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Pa
,
it
's
not
enough
,
"
rejoined
Bella
,
giving
him
another
shake
or
two
.
"
<EOS>
Have
n't
I
told
you
what
a
mercenary
little
wretch
I
am
?
<EOS>
It
only
becomes
enough
when
he
has
no
money
,
and
no
clients
,
and
no
expectations
,
and
no
anything
but
debts
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hah
!
"
said
the
cherub
,
a
little
depressed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Number
three
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Number
three
,
Pa
,
is
a
better
thing
.
<EOS>
A
generous
thing
,
a
noble
thing
,
a
delightful
thing
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
has
herself
told
me
,
as
a
secret
,
with
her
own
kind
lips
---
and
truer
lips
never
opened
or
closed
in
this
life
,
I
am
sure
---
that
they
wish
to
see
me
well
married
;
and
that
when
I
marry
with
their
consent
they
will
portion
me
most
handsomely
.
"
<EOS>
Here
the
grateful
girl
burst
out
crying
very
heartily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
cry
,
my
darling
,
"
said
her
father
,
with
his
hand
to
his
eyes
;
"
it
's
excusable
in
me
to
be
a
little
overcome
when
I
find
that
my
dear
favourite
child
is
,
after
all
disappointments
,
to
be
so
provided
for
and
so
raised
in
the
world
;
but
do
n't
you
cry
,
do
n't
you
cry
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
thankful
<EOS>
I
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
good
soft
little
fellow
,
drying
his
eyes
,
here
,
Bella
put
her
arms
<EOS>
round
his
neck
and
tenderly
kissed
him
on
the
high
road
,
passionately
telling
him
he
was
the
best
of
fathers
and
the
best
of
friends
,
and
that
on
her
wedding
-
morning
she
would
go
down
on
her
knees
to
him
and
beg
his
pardon
for
having
ever
teased
him
or
seemed
insensible
to
the
worth
of
such
a
patient
,
sympathetic
,
genial
,
fresh
young
heart
.
<EOS>
At
every
one
of
her
adjectives
she
redoubled
her
kisses
,
and
finally
kissed
his
hat
off
,
and
then
laughed
immoderately
when
the
wind
took
it
<EOS>
and
he
ran
after
it
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
recovered
his
hat
and
his
breath
,
and
they
were
going
on
again
once
more
,
said
her
father
then
:
"
Number
four
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
's
countenance
fell
in
the
midst
of
her
mirth
.
"
<EOS>
After
all
,
perhaps
I
had
better
put
off
number
four
,
<EOS>
Pa.
Let
me
try
once
more
,
if
for
never
so
short
a
time
,
to
hope
that
it
may
not
really
be
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
change
in
her
,
strengthened
the
cherub
's
interest
in
number
four
,
and
he
said
quietly
:
"
May
not
be
so
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
May
not
be
how
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
looked
at
him
pensively
,
and
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
know
<EOS>
right
well
it
is
so
,
<EOS>
Pa.
<EOS>
I
know
it
only
too
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
returned
her
father
,
"
you
make
me
quite
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
Have
you
said
No
to
anybody
else
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
Pa.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
to
anybody
?
"
he
suggested
,
lifting
up
his
eyebrows
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Pa.
"
  
"
Is
there
anybody
else
who
would
take
his
chance
between
Yes
<EOS>
and
No
,
if
you
would
let
him
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
know
of
,
Pa.
"
  
"
There
ca
n't
be
somebody
who
wo
n't
take
his
chance
when
you
want
him
to
?
"
said
the
cherub
,
as
a
last
resource
.
  
<EOS>
Why
,
of
course
not
,
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
giving
him
another
shake
or
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
of
course
not
,
"
he
assented
.
<EOS>
"
Bella
,
my
dear
,
I
am
afraid
I
must
either
have
no
sleep
to
-
night
,
or
I
must
press
for
number
four
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Pa
,
there
is
no
good
in
number
four
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
sorry
for
it
<EOS>
,
I
am
so
unwilling
to
believe
it
,
I
have
tried
so
earnestly
not
to
see
it
,
that
it
is
very
hard
to
tell
,
even
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Boffin
is
being
spoilt
by
prosperity
,
and
is
changing
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Bella
,
I
hope
and
trust
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
hoped
and
trusted
not
too
,
Pa
;
but
every
day
he
changes
for
the
worse
,
and
for
the
worse
.
<EOS>
Not
to
me
---
he
is
always
much
the
same
to
me
---
but
to
others
about
him
.
<EOS>
Before
my
eyes
he
grows
suspicious
,
capricious
,
hard
,
tyrannical
,
unjust
.
<EOS>
If
ever
a
good
man
were
ruined
by
good
fortune
,
it
is
my
benefactor
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
Pa
,
think
how
terrible
the
fascination
of
money
is
!
<EOS>
I
see
this
,
and
hate
this
,
and
dread
this
,
and
do
n't
know
but
that
money
might
make
a
much
worse
change
in
me
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
have
money
always
in
my
thoughts
and
my
desires
;
and
the
whole
life
I
place
before
myself
is
money
,
money
,
money
,
and
what
money
can
make
of
life

THE
GOLDEN
DUSTMAN
FALLS
INTO
BAD
COMPANY
.
 
<EOS>
Were
Bella
Wilfer
's
bright
and
ready
little
wits
at
fault
,
or
was
the
Golden
Dustman
passing
through
the
furnace
of
proof
and
coming
out
dross
?
<EOS>
Ill
news
travels
fast
.
<EOS>
We
shall
know
full
soon
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
very
night
of
her
return
from
the
Happy
Return
,
something
chanced
which
Bella
closely
followed
with
her
eyes
and
ears
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
apartment
at
the
side
of
the
Boffin
mansion
,
known
as
Mr.
Boffin
's
room
.
<EOS>
Far
less
grand
than
the
rest
of
the
house
,
it
was
far
more
comfortable
,
being
pervaded
by
a
certain
air
of
homely
snugness
,
which
upholstering
despotism
had
banished
to
that
spot
when
it
inexorably
set
its
face
against
Mr.
Boffin
's
appeals
for
mercy
in
behalf
of
any
other
chamber
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
although
a
room
of
modest
situation
---
for
its
windows
gave
on
Silas
Wegg
's
old
corner
---
and
of
no
pretensions
to
velvet
,
satin
,
or
gilding
,
it
had
got
itself
established
in
a
domestic
position
analogous
to
that
of
an
easy
dressing
-
gown
or
pair
of
slippers
;
and
whenever
the
family
wanted
to
enjoy
a
particularly
pleasant
fireside
evening
,
they
enjoyed
it
,
as
an
institution
that
must
be
,
in
Mr.
Boffin
's
room
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
were
reported
sitting
in
this
room
,
when
Bella
got
back
.
<EOS>
Entering
it
,
she
found
the
Secretary
there
too
;
in
official
attendance
it
would
appear
,
for
he
was
standing
with
some
papers
in
his
hand
by
a
table
with
shaded
candles
on
it
,
at
which
Mr.
Boffin
was
seated
thrown
back
in
his
easy
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
busy
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
,
hesitating
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
my
dear
,
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
're
one
of
ourselves
.
<EOS>
We
never
make
company
of
you
.
<EOS>
Come
in
,
come
in
.
<EOS>
Here
's
the
old
lady
in
her
usual
place
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
adding
her
nod
and
smile
of
welcome
to
Mr.
Boffin
's
words
<EOS>
,
Bella
took
her
book
to
a
chair
in
the
fireside
corner
,
by
Mrs.
Boffin
's
work
-
table
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
's
station
was
on
the
opposite
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Rokesmith
,
"
said
the
Golden
Dustman
,
so
sharply
rapping
the
table
to
bespeak
his
attention
as
Bella
turned
the
leaves
of
her
book
,
that
she
started
;
"
where
were
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
saying
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
Secretary
,
with
an
air
of
some
reluctance
and
a
glance
towards
those
others
who
were
present
,
"
that
you
considered
the
time
had
come
for
fixing
my
salary
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
be
above
calling
it
wages
,
man
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
testily
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
the
deuce
!
<EOS>
I
never
talked
of
my
salary
when
I
was
in
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
wages
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
correcting
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rokesmith
,
you
are
not
proud
,
I
hope
?
"
observed
Mr.
Boffin
,
eyeing
him
askance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
never
was
,
when
I
was
poor
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Poverty
and
pride
do
n't
go
at
all
well
together
.
<EOS>
Mind
that
.
<EOS>
How
can
they
go
well
together
?
<EOS>
Why
it
stands
to
reason
.
<EOS>
A
man
,
being
poor
,
has
nothing
to
be
proud
of
.
<EOS>
It
's
nonsense
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
,
and
a
look
of
some
surprise
,
the
Secretary
seemed
to
assent
by
forming
the
syllables
of
the
word
"
nonsense
"
on
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
concerning
these
same
wages
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
n't
you
sit
down
before
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
distrustfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
that
was
n't
pride
?
<EOS>
But
about
these
wages
Now
,
I
've
gone
into
the
matter
,
and
<EOS>
I
say
tow
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
it
?
<EOS>
Do
you
think
it
's
enough
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
fair
proposal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
,
you
know
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
stipulated
,
"
but
what
it
may
be
more
than
enough
.
<EOS>
And
I
'll
tell
you
why
,
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
property
,
like
me
,
is
bound
to
consider
the
market
-
price
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
did
n't
enter
into
that
as
much
as
I
might
have
done
;
but
I
've
got
acquainted
with
other
men
of
property
since
,
and
I
've
got
acquainted
with
the
duties
of
property
.
<EOS>
I
must
n't
go
putting
the
market
-
price
up
,
because
money
may
happen
not
to
be
an
object
with
me
.
<EOS>
A
sheep
is
worth
so
much
in
the
market
,
and
I
ought
to
give
it
<EOS>
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
A
secretary
is
worth
so
much
in
the
market
,
and
I
ought
to
give
it
<EOS>
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
n't
mind
stretching
a
point
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Boffin
,
you
are
very
good
,
"
replied
the
Secretary
,
with
an
effort
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
put
the
figure
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
at
two
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
Then
the
figure
's
disposed
of
.
<EOS>
Now
,
there
must
be
no
misunderstanding
regarding
what
I
buy
for
two
hundred
a
year
.
<EOS>
If
I
pay
for
a
sheep
,
I
buy
it
out
and
out
.
<EOS>
Similarly
,
if
I
pay
for
a
secretary
,
I
buy
him
out
and
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
other
words
,
you
purchase
my
whole
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
do
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
it
ai
n't
that
I
want
to
occupy
your
whole
time
;
you
can
take
up
a
book
for
a
minute
or
two
when
you
've
nothing
better
to
do
,
though
I
think
you
'll
a'most
always
find
something
useful
to
do
.
<EOS>
But
I
want
to
keep
you
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
It
's
convenient
to
have
you
at
all
times
ready
on
the
premises
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
betwixt
your
breakfast
and
your
supper
,
---
on
the
premises
I
expect
to
find
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
bowed
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
bygone
days
,
when
I
was
in
service
myself
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
I
could
n't
go
cutting
about
at
my
will
and
pleasure
,
and
you
wo
n't
expect
to
go
cutting
about
at
your
will
and
pleasure
.
<EOS>
You
've
rather
got
into
a
habit
of
that
,
lately
;
but
perhaps
it
was
for
want
of
a
right
specification
betwixt
us
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
there
be
a
right
specification
betwixt
us
,
and
let
it
be
this
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
leave
,
ask
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
Secretary
bowed
.
<EOS>
His
manner
was
uneasy
and
astonished
,
and
showed
a
sense
of
humiliation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
have
a
bell
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
hung
from
this
room
to
yours
,
and
<EOS>
when
I
want
you
,
I
'll
touch
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
call
to
mind
that
I
have
anything
more
to
say
at
the
present
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
rose
,
gathered
up
his
papers
,
and
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Bella
's
eyes
followed
him
to
the
door
,
lighted
on
Mr.
Boffin
complacently
thrown
back
in
his
easy
chair
,
and
drooped
over
her
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
let
that
chap
,
that
young
man
of
mine
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
taking
a
trot
up
and
down
the
room
,
"
get
above
his
work
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
him
down
a
peg
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
property
owes
a
duty
to
other
men
of
property
,
and
must
look
sharp
after
his
inferiors
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
felt
that
Mrs.
Boffin
was
not
comfortable
,
and
that
the
eyes
of
that
good
creature
sought
to
discover
from
her
face
what
attention
she
had
given
to
this
discourse
,
and
what
impression
it
had
made
upon
her
.
<EOS>
For
which
reason
Bella
's
eyes
drooped
more
engrossedly
over
her
book
,
and
she
turned
the
page
with
an
air
of
profound
absorption
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Noddy
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
after
thoughtfully
pausing
in
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
returned
the
Golden
Dustman
,
stopping
short
in
his
trot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
my
putting
it
to
you
,
Noddy
,
but
now
really
!
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
been
a
little
strict
with
Mr.
Rokesmith
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
been
a
little
---
<EOS>
just
a
little
little
---
not
quite
like
your
old
self
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
old
woman
,
I
hope
so
,
"
returned
Mr.
Boffin
,
cheerfully
,
if
not
boastfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hope
so
,
deary
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
old
selves
would
n't
do
here
,
old
lady
.
<EOS>
Have
n't
you
found
that
out
yet
?
<EOS>
Our
old
selves
would
be
fit
for
nothing
here
but
to
be
robbed
and
imposed
upon
.
<EOS>
Our
old
selves
were
n't
people
of
fortune
;
 
our
new
selves
are
;
it
's
a
great
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
pausing
in
her
work
again
,
softly
to
draw
a
long
breath
and
to
look
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
great
difference
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
we
must
be
up
to
the
difference
,
"
pursued
her
husband
;
 
"
we
must
be
equal
to
the
change
;
that
's
what
we
must
be
.
<EOS>
We
've
got
to
hold
our
own
now
,
against
everybody
<EOS>
(
for
everybody
's
hand
is
stretched
out
to
be
dipped
into
our
pockets
)
,
and
we
have
got
to
recollect
that
money
makes
money
,
as
well
as
makes
everything
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mentioning
recollecting
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
with
her
work
abandoned
,
her
eyes
upon
the
fire
,
and
her
chin
upon
her
hand
,
"
do
you
recollect
,
<EOS>
Noddy
,
how
you
said
to
Mr.
Rokesmith
when
he
first
came
to
see
us
at
the
Bower
,
and
you
engaged
him
<EOS>
---
how
you
said
to
him
that
if
it
had
pleased
Heaven
to
send
John
Harmon
to
his
fortune
safe
,
we
could
have
been
content
with
the
one
Mound
which
was
our
legacy
,
and
should
never
have
wanted
the
rest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
I
remember
,
old
lady
.
<EOS>
But
we
had
n't
tried
what
it
was
to
have
the
rest
then
.
<EOS>
Our
new
shoes
had
come
home
,
but
we
had
n't
put
'em
on
.
<EOS>
We
're
wearing
'em
now
,
we
're
wearing
'em
,
and
must
step
out
accordingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
took
up
her
work
again
,
and
plied
her
needle
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
Rokesmith
,
that
young
man
of
mine
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
dropping
his
voice
and
glancing
towards
the
door
with
an
apprehension
of
being
overheard
by
some
eavesdropper
there
,
"
it
's
the
same
with
him
as
with
the
footmen
.
<EOS>
I
have
found
out
that
you
must
either
scrunch
them
,
or
let
them
scrunch
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
ai
n't
imperious
with
'em
,
they
wo
n't
believe
in
your
being
any
better
than
themselves
,
if
as
good
,
after
the
stories
(
lies
mostly
)
that
they
have
heard
of
your
beginnings
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
betwixt
stiffening
yourself
up
,
and
throwing
yourself
away
;
take
my
word
for
that
,
old
lady
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
ventured
for
a
moment
to
look
stealthily
towards
him
under
her
eyelashes
,
and
she
saw
a
dark
cloud
of
suspicion
,
covetousness
,
and
conceit
,
overshadowing
the
once
open
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hows'ever
,
"
said
he
,
"
this
is
n't
entertaining
to
Miss
Bella
.
<EOS>
Is
it
,
Bella
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
deceiving
Bella
<EOS>
she
was
,
to
look
at
him
with
that
pensively
abstracted
air
,
as
if
her
mind
were
full
of
her
book
,
and
she
had
not
heard
a
single
word
!
  
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
<EOS>
Better
employed
than
to
attend
to
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
that
's
right
.
<EOS>
Especially
as
you
have
no
call
to
be
told
how
to
value
yourself
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Colouring
a
little
under
this
compliment
,
Bella
returned
,
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
you
do
n't
think
me
vain
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
bit
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
think
it
's
very
creditable
in
you
,
at
your
age
,
to
be
so
well
up
with
the
pace
of
the
world
,
and
to
know
what
to
go
in
for
.
<EOS>
You
are
right
.
<EOS>
Go
in
for
money
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
Money
's
the
article
.
<EOS>
You
'll
make
money
of
your
good
looks
,
and
of
the
money
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
and
me
will
have
the
pleasure
of
settling
upon
you
,
and
you
'll
live
and
die
rich
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
state
to
live
and
die
in
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
an
unctuous
manner
.
<EOS>
"
R
---
r
---
rich
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
expression
of
distress
in
Mrs.
Boffin
's
face
,
as
,
after
watching
her
husband
's
,
she
turned
to
their
adopted
girl
,
and
said
:
"
Do
n't
mind
him
,
Bella
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
what
!
<EOS>
Not
mind
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
with
a
worried
look
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
mean
,
do
n't
believe
him
to
be
anything
but
good
and
generous
,
Bella
,
because
he
is
the
best
of
men
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
must
say
that
much
,
Noddy
.
<EOS>
You
are
always
the
best
of
men
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
made
the
declaration
as
if
he
were
objecting
to
it
:
which
assuredly
he
was
not
in
any
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
to
you
,
my
dear
Bella
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
still
with
that
distressed
expression
,
"
he
is
so
much
attached
to
you
,
whatever
he
says
,
that
your
own
father
has
not
a
truer
interest
in
you
and
can
hardly
like
you
better
than
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Says
too
!
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Whatever
he
says
!
<EOS>
Why
,
I
say
so
,
openly
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
kiss
,
by
dear
child
,
in
saying
Good
Night
,
and
let
me
confirm
what
my
old
lady
tells
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
fond
of
you
,
my
dear
,
and
I
am
entirely
of
your
mind
,
and
you
and
I
will
take
care
that
you
shall
be
rich
.
<EOS>
These
good
looks
of
yours
(
which
you
have
some
right
to
be
vain
of
,
my
dear
,
though
you
are
not

you
know

are
worth
money

and
you
shall
make
money
of
'em
.
<EOS>
The
money
you
will
have
,
will
be
worth
money
,
and
you
shall
make
money
of
that
too

<EOS>
There
's
a
golden
ball
at
your
feet
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Somehow
,
Bella
was
not
so
well
pleased
with
this
assurance
and
this
prospect
as
she
might
have
been
.
<EOS>
Somehow
,
when
she
put
her
arms
round
Mrs.
Boffin
's
neck
and
said
Good
Night
,
she
derived
a
sense
of
unworthiness
from
the
still
anxious
face
of
that
good
woman
and
her
obvious
wish
to
excuse
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
need
to
excuse
him
?
"
thought
Bella
,
sitting
down
in
her
own
room
.
<EOS>
"
What
he
said
was
very
sensible
,
I
am
sure
,
and
very
true
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
what
I
often
say
to
myself
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
like
it
then
?
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
like
it
,
and
,
though
he
is
my
liberal
benefactor
,
I
disparage
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
Then
pray
,
"
said
Bella
,
sternly
putting
the
question
to
herself
in
the
looking
-
glass
as
usual
,
"
what
do
you
mean
by
this
,
you
inconsistent
little
Beast
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
looking
-
glass
preserving
a
discreet
ministerial
silence
<EOS>
when
thus
called
upon
for
explanation
,
Bella
went
to
bed
with
a
weariness
upon
her
spirit
which
was
more
than
the
weariness
of
want
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
And
again
in
the
morning
,
she
looked
for
the
cloud
,
and
for
the
deepening
of
the
cloud
,
upon
the
Golden
Dustman
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
begun
by
this
time
to
be
his
frequent
companion
in
his
morning
strolls
about
the
streets
,
and
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
made
her
a
party
to
his
engaging
in
a
curious
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Having
been
hard
at
work
in
one
dull
enclosure
all
his
life
,
he
had
a
child
's
delight
in
looking
at
shops
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
one
of
the
first
novelties
and
pleasures
of
his
freedom
,
and
was
equally
the
delight
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
For
many
years
their
only
walks
in
London
had
been
taken
on
Sundays
when
the
shops
were
shut
;
and
when
every
day
in
the
week
became
their
holiday
,
they
derived
an
enjoyment
from
the
variety
and
fancy
and
beauty
of
the
display
in
the
windows
,
which
seemed
incapable
of
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
As
if
the
principal
streets
were
a
great
Theatre
and
the
play
were
childishly
new
to
them
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
from
the
beginning
of
Bella
's
intimacy
in
their
house
,
had
been
constantly
in
the
front
row
,
charmed
with
all
they
saw
and
applauding
vigorously
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
Mr.
Boffin
's
interest
began
to
centre
in
book
-
shops
;
and
more
than
that
---
for
that
of
itself
would
not
have
been
much
---
in
one
exceptional
kind
of
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
in
here
,
my
dear
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
would
say
,
checking
Bella
's
arm
at
a
bookseller
's
window
;
"
you
can
read
at
sight
,
and
your
eyes
are
as
sharp
as
they
're
bright
.
<EOS>
Now
,
look
well
about
you
,
my
dear
,
and
tell
me
if
you
see
any
book
about
a
Miser
.
"
  
<EOS>
If
Bella
saw
such
a
book
,
Mr.
Boffin
would
instantly
dart
in
and
buy
it
.
<EOS>
And
still
,
as
if
they
had
not
found
it
,
they
would
seek
out
another
book
-
shop
,
and
Mr.
Boffin
would
say
,
"
Now
,
look
well
all
round
,
my
dear
,
for
a
Life
of
a
Miser
,
or
any
book
of
that
sort
;
any
Lives
of
odd
characters
who
may
have
been
Misers
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
,
thus
directed
,
would
examine
the
window
with
the
greatest
attention
,
while
Mr.
Boffin
would
examine
her
face
.
<EOS>
The
moment
she
pointed
out
any
book
as
being
entitled
Lives
of
eccentric
personages
,
Anecdotes
of
strange
characters
,
Records
of
remarkable
individuals
,
or
anything
to
that
purpose
,
Mr.
Boffin
's
countenance
would
light
up
,
and
he
would
instantly
dart
in
and
buy
it
.
<EOS>
Size
,
price
,
quality
,
were
of
no
account
.
<EOS>
Any
book
that
seemed
to
promise
a
chance
of
miserly
biography
,
Mr.
Boffin
purchased
without
a
moment
's
delay
and
carried
home
.
<EOS>
Happening
to
be
informed
by
a
bookseller
that
a
portion
of
the
Annual
Register
was
devoted
to
"
Characters
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
at
once
bought
a
whole
set
of
that
ingenious
compilation
,
and
began
to
carry
it
home
piecemeal
,
confiding
a
volume
to
Bella
,
and
bearing
three
himself
.
<EOS>
The
completion
of
his
labour
occupied
them
about
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
When
the
task
was
done
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
his
appetite
for
Misers
whetted
instead
of
satiated
,
began
to
look
out
again
.
  
<EOS>
It
very
soon
became
unnecessary
to
tell
Bella
what
to
look
for
,
and
an
understanding
was
established
between
her
and
Mr.
Boffin
that
she
was
always
to
look
for
Lives
of
Misers
.
<EOS>
Morning
after
morning
they
roamed
about
the
town
together
,
pursuing
this
singular
research
.
<EOS>
Miserly
literature
not
being
abundant
,
the
proportion
of
failures
to
successes
may
have
been
as
a
hundred
to
one
;
still
Mr.
Boffin
,
never
wearied
,
remained
as
avaricious
for
misers
as
he
had
been
at
the
first
onset
.
<EOS>
It
was
curious
that
Bella
never
saw
the
books
about
the
house
,
nor
did
she
ever
hear
from
Mr.
Boffin
one
word
of
reference
to
their
contents
.
<EOS>
he
seemed
to
save
up
his
Misers
as
they
had
saved
up
their
money
.
<EOS>
As
they
had
been
greedy
for
it
,
and
secret
about
it
,
and
had
hidden
it
,
so
he
was
greedy
for
them
,
and
secret
about
them
,
and
hid
them
.
<EOS>
But
beyond
all
doubt
it
was
to
be
noticed
,
and
was
by
Bella
very
clearly
noticed
,
that
,
as
he
pursued
the
acquisition
of
those
dismal
records
with
the
ardour
of
Don
Quixote
for
his
books
of
chivalry
,
he
began
to
spend
his
money
with
a
more
sparing
hand
.
<EOS>
And
often
when
he
came
out
of
a
shop
with
some
new
account
of
one
of
those
wretched
lunatics
,
she
would
almost
shrink
from
the
sly
dry
chuckle
with
which
he
would
take
her
arm
again
and
trot
away
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
appear
that
Mrs.
Boffin
knew
of
this
taste
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
allusion
to
it
,
except
in
the
morning
walks
when
he
and
Bella
were
always
alone
;
and
Bella
,
partly
under
the
impression
that
he
took
her
into
his
confidence
by
implication
,
and
partly
in
remembrance
of
Mrs.
Boffin
's
anxious
face
that
night
,
held
the
same
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
While
these
occurrences
were
in
progress
,
Mrs.
Lammle
made
the
discovery
that
Bella
had
a
fascinating
influence
over
her
.
<EOS>
The
Lammles
,
originally
presented
by
the
dear
Veneerings
,
visited
the
Boffins
on
all
grand
occasions
,
and
Mrs.
Lammle
had
not
previously
found
this
out
;
but
now
the
knowledge
came
upon
her
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
most
extraordinary
thing
(
shed
said
to
Mrs.
Boffin
)
;
she
was
foolishly
susceptible
of
the
power
of
beauty
,
but
it
was
n't
altogether
that
;
she
never
had
been
able
to
resist
a
natural
grace
of
manner
,
but
it
was
n't
altogether
that
;
it
was
more
than
that
,
and
there
was
no
name
for
the
indescribable
extent
and
degree
to
which
she
was
captivated
by
this
charming
girl
.
  
<EOS>
This
charming
girl
having
the
words
repeated
to
her
by
Mrs.
Boffin
(
who
was
proud
of
her
being
admired
,
and
would
have
done
anything
to
give
her
pleasure
)
,
naturally
recognized
in
Mrs.
Lammle
a
woman
of
penetration
and
taste
.
<EOS>
Responding
to
the
sentiments
,
by
being
very
gracious
to
Mrs.
Lammle
,
she
gave
that
lady
the
means
of
so
improving
her
opportunity
,
as
that
the
captivation
became
reciprocal
,
though
always
wearing
an
appearance
of
greater
sobriety
on
Bella
's
part
than
on
the
enthusiastic
Sophronia
's
.
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
they
were
so
much
together
that
,
for
a
time
,
the
Boffin
chariot
held
Mrs.
Lammle
oftener
than
Mrs.
Boffin
:
a
preference
of
which
the
latter
worthy
soul
was
not
in
the
least
jealous
,
placidly
remarking
,
"
Mrs.
Lammle
is
a
younger
companion
for
her
than
I
am
,
and
<EOS>
Lor
!
<EOS>
she
's
more
fashionable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
between
Bella
Wilfer
and
Georgiana
Podsnap
there
was
this
one
difference
,
among
many
others
,
that
Bella
was
in
no
danger
of
being
captivated
by
Alfred
.
<EOS>
She
distrusted
and
disliked
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
her
perception
was
so
quick
,
and
her
observation
so
sharp
,
that
after
all
she
mistrusted
his
wife
too
,
though
with
her
giddy
vanity
and
wilfulness
she
squeezed
the
mistrust
away
into
a
corner
of
her
mind
,
and
blocked
it
up
there
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
took
the
friendliest
interest
in
Bella
's
making
a
good
match
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
said
,
in
a
sportive
way
,
she
really
must
show
her
beautiful
Bella
what
kind
of
wealthy
creatures
she
and
Alfred
had
on
hand
,
who
would
as
one
man
fall
at
her
feet
enslaved
.
<EOS>
Fitting
occasion
made
,
Mrs.
Lammle
accordingly
produced
the
most
passable
of
those
feverish
,
boastful
,
and
indefinably
loose
gentlemen
who
were
always
lounging
in
and
out
of
the
City
on
questions
of
the
Bourse
and
Greek
and
Spanish
and
India
and
Mexican
and
par
and
premium
and
discount
and
three
-
quarters
and
seven
-
eighths
.
<EOS>
Who
in
their
agreeable
manner
did
homage
to
Bella
as
if
she
were
a
compound
of
fine
girl
,
thorough
-
bred
horse
,
well
-
built
drag
,
and
remarkable
pipe
.
<EOS>
But
without
the
least
effect
,
though
even
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
attractions
were
cast
into
the
scale
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
fear
,
Bella
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
one
day
in
the
chariot
,
"
that
you
will
be
very
hard
to
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
expect
to
be
pleased
,
dear
,
"
said
Bella
,
with
a
languid
turn
of
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
my
love
,
"
returned
Sophronia
,
shaking
her
head
,
and
smiling
her
best
smile
,
"
it
would
not
be
very
easy
to
find
a
man
worthy
of
your
attractions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
question
is
not
a
man
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Bella
,
coolly
,
"
but
an
establishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
your
prudence
amazes
me
---
  
where
did
you
study
life
so
well
!
---
<EOS>
you
are
right
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
case
as
yours
,
the
object
is
a
fitting
establishment
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
descend
to
an
inadequate
one
from
Mr.
Boffin
's
house
,
and
even
if
your
beauty
alone
could
not
command
it
,
it
is
to
be
assumed
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
will
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
they
have
already
,
"
Bella
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
Have
they
really
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
vexed
by
a
suspicion
that
she
had
spoken
precipitately
,
and
withal
a
little
defiant
of
her
own
vexation
,
Bella
determined
not
to
retreat
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
to
say
,
"
she
explained
,
"
they
have
told
me
they
mean
to
portion
me
as
their
adopted
child
,
if
you
mean
that
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mention
it
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Mrs.
Lammle
,
as
if
she
were
full
of
awakened
feeling
at
the
suggestion
of
such
an
impossibility
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Men
-
tion
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
,
Mrs.
Lammle
---
"
Bella
began
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
say
Sophronia
,
or
I
must
not
say
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
a
little
short
,
petulant
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
<EOS>
Bella
complied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
---
  
<EOS>
Sophronia
then
---
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
,
Sophronia
,
that
I
am
convinced
I
have
no
heart
,
as
people
call
it
;
and
that
I
think
that
sort
of
thing
is
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Brave
girl
!
<EOS>
"
murmured
Mrs.
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
"
pursued
Bella
,
"
<EOS>
as
to
seeking
to
please
myself
,
I
do
n't
;
 
except
in
the
one
respect
I
have
mentioned
.
<EOS>
I
am
indifferent
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
ca
n't
help
pleasing
,
Bella
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
rallying
her
with
an
arch
look
and
her
best
smile
,
"
you
ca
n't
help
making
a
proud
and
an
admiring
husband
.
<EOS>
You
may
not
care
to
please
yourself
,
and
you
may
not
care
to
please
him
,
but
you
are
not
a
free
agent
as
to
pleasing
:
you
are
forced
to
do
that
,
in
spite
of
yourself
,
my
dear
;
 
so
it
may
be
a
question
whether
you
may
<EOS>
not
as
well
please
yourself
too
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
very
grossness
of
this
flattery
put
Bella
upon
proving
that
she
actually
did
please
in
spite
of
herself
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
misgiving
that
she
was
doing
wrong
---
though
she
had
an
indistinct
foreshadowing
that
some
harm
might
come
of
it
thereafter
,
she
little
thought
what
consequences
it
would
really
bring
about
---
but
she
went
on
with
her
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
of
pleasing
in
spite
of
one
's
self
,
dear
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
enough
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
?
"
cried
Mrs.
Lammle
.
"
<EOS>
Am
I
already
corroborated
,
Bella
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
Sophronia
<EOS>
,
we
will
not
speak
of
it
any
more
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
ask
me
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
plainly
meaning
Do
ask
me
about
it
,
Mrs.
Lammle
did
as
she
was
requested
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Bella
.
<EOS>
Come
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
What
provoking
burr
has
been
inconveniently
attracted
to
the
charming
skirts
,
and
with
difficulty
shaken
off
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Provoking
indeed
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
and
no
burr
to
boast
of
!
<EOS>
But
do
n't
ask
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
guess
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
never
guess
.
<EOS>
What
would
you
say
to
our
Secretary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
<EOS>
The
hermit
Secretary
,
who
creeps
up
and
down
the
back
stairs
,
and
is
never
seen
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
about
his
creeping
up
and
down
the
back
stairs
,
"
said
Bella
,
rather
contemptuously
,
"
further
than
knowing
that
he
does
no
such
thing
;
and
as
to
his
never
being
seen
,
I
should
be
content
never
to
have
seen
him
,
though
he
is
quite
as
visible
as
you
are
.
<EOS>
But
I
pleased
him
(
for
my
sins
)
and
he
had
the
presumption
to
tell
me
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
man
never
made
a
declaration
to
you
,
my
dear
Bella
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
of
that
,
Sophronia
?
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
am
sure
of
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
man
must
be
mad
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
with
a
kind
of
resignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
appeared
to
be
in
his
senses
,
"
returned
Bella
,
tossing
her
head
,
"
and
he
had
plenty
to
say
for
himself
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
my
opinion
of
his
declaration
and
his
conduct
,
and
dismissed
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
this
has
all
been
very
inconvenient
to
me
,
and
very
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
It
has
remained
a
secret
,
however
.
<EOS>
That
word
reminds
me
to
observe
,
Sophronia
,
that
I
have
glided
on
into
telling
you
the
secret
,
and
that
I
rely
upon
you
never
to
mention
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mention
it
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mrs.
Lammle
with
her
former
feeling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Men
-
tion
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
time
Sophronia
was
so
much
in
earnest
that
she
found
it
necessary
to
bend
forward
in
the
carriage
and
give
Bella
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
A
Judas
order
of
kiss
;
for
she
thought
,
while
she
yet
pressed
Bella
's
hand
after
giving
it
,
"
Upon
your
own
showing
,
you
vain
heartless
girl
,
puffed
up
by
the
doting
folly
of
a
dustman
<EOS>
,
I
need
have
no
relenting
towards
you
.
<EOS>
If
my
husband
,
who
sends
me
here
,
should
form
any
schemes
for
making
you
a
victim
,
I
should
certainly
not
cross
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
those
very
same
moments
,
Bella
was
thinking
,
"
Why
am
I
always
at
war
with
myself
?
<EOS>
Why
have
I
told
,
as
if
upon
compulsion
,
what
I
knew
all
along
I
ought
to
have
withheld
?
<EOS>
Why
am
I
making
a
friend
of
this
woman
beside
me
,
in
spite
of
the
whispers
against
her
that
I
hear
in
my
heart
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
usual
,
there
was
no
answer
in
the
looking
-
glass
when
she
got
home
and
referred
these
questions
to
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
if
she
had
consulted
some
better
oracle
,
the
result
might
have
been
more
satisfactory
;
but
she
did
not
,
and
all
things
consequent
marched
the
march
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
On
one
point
connected
with
the
watch
she
kept
on
Mr.
Boffin
,
she
felt
very
inquisitive
,
and
that
was
the
question
whether
the
Secretary
watched
him
too
,
and
followed
the
sure
and
steady
change
in
him
,
as
she
did
?
<EOS>
Her
very
limited
intercourse
with
Mr.
Rokesmith
rendered
this
hard
to
find
out
.
<EOS>
Their
communication
now
,
at
no
time
extended
beyond
the
preservation
of
commonplace
appearances
before
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
;
and
if
Bella
and
the
Secretary
were
ever
left
alone
together
by
any
chance
,
he
immediately
withdrew
.
<EOS>
She
consulted
his
face
when
she
could
do
so
covertly
,
as
she
worked
or
read
,
and
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
looked
subdued
;
but
he
had
acquired
a
strong
command
of
feature
,
and
,
whenever
Mr.
Boffin
spoke
to
him
in
Bella
's
presence
,
or
whatever
revelation
of
himself
Mr.
Boffin
made
,
the
Secretary
's
face
changed
no
more
than
a
wall
.
<EOS>
A
slightly
knitted
brow
,
that
expressed
nothing
but
an
almost
mechanical
attention
,
and
a
compression
of
the
mouth
,
that
might
have
been
a
guard
against
a
scornful
smile
---
these
she
saw
from
morning
to
night
,
from
day
to
day
,
from
week
to
week
,
monotonous
,
unvarying
,
set
,
as
in
a
piece
of
sculpture
.
  
<EOS>
The
worst
of
the
matter
was
,
that
it
thus
fell
out
insensibly
---
and
most
provokingly
,
as
Bella
complained
to
herself
,
in
her
impetuous
little
manner
---
that
her
observation
of
Mr.
Boffin
involved
a
continual
observation
of
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
"
<EOS>
Wo
n't
that
extract
a
look
from
him
?
"
<EOS>
---
"
Can
it
be
possible
that
makes
no
impression
on
him
?
"
 
<EOS>
Such
questions
Bella
would
propose
to
herself
,
often
as
many
times
in
a
day
as
there
were
hours
in
it
.
<EOS>
Impossible
to
know
.
<EOS>
Always
the
same
fixed
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
he
be
so
base
as
to
sell
his
very
nature
for
two
hundred
a
year
?
<EOS>
"
Bella
would
think
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
"
But
why
not
?
<EOS>
It
's
a
mere
question
of
price
with
others
besides
him
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
I
would
sell
mine
,
if
I
could
get
enough
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
she
would
come
round
again
to
the
war
with
herself
.
  
<EOS>
A
kind
of
illegibility
,
though
a
different
kind
,
stole
over
Mr.
Boffin
's
face
.
<EOS>
Its
old
simplicity
of
expression
got
masked
by
a
certain
craftiness
that
assimilated
even
his
good
-
humour
to
itself
.
<EOS>
His
very
smile
was
cunning
,
as
if
he
had
been
studying
smiles
among
the
portraits
of
his
misers
.
<EOS>
Saving
an
occasional
burst
of
impatience
,
or
coarse
assertion
of
his
mastery
,
his
good
-
humour
remained
to
him
,
but
it
had
now
a
sordid
alloy
of
distrust
;
and
though
his
eyes
should
twinkle
and
all
his
face
should
laugh
,
he
would
sit
holding
himself
in
his
own
arms
,
as
if
he
had
an
inclination
to
hoard
himself
up
,
and
must
always
grudgingly
stand
on
the
defensive
.
  
<EOS>
What
with
taking
heed
of
these
two
faces
,
and
what
with
feeling
conscious
that
the
stealthy
occupation
must
set
some
mark
on
her
own
,
Bella
soon
began
to
think
that
there
was
not
a
candid
or
a
natural
face
among
them
all
<EOS>
but
Mrs.
Boffin
's
.
<EOS>
None
the
less
because
it
was
far
less
radiant
than
of
yore
,
faithfully
reflecting
in
its
anxiety
and
regret
every
line
of
change
in
the
Golden
Dustman
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
one
evening
when
they
were
all
in
his
room
again
,
and
he
and
the
Secretary
had
been
going
over
some
accounts
,
"
I
am
spending
too
much
money
.
<EOS>
Or
leastways
,
you
are
spending
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
rich
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
The
sharpness
of
the
retort
was
next
to
telling
the
Secretary
that
he
lied
.
<EOS>
But
it
brought
no
change
of
expression
into
the
set
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
am
not
rich
,
"
repeated
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
and
I
wo
n't
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
rich
,
sir
?
"
repeated
the
Secretary
,
in
measured
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
returned
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
if
I
am
,
that
's
my
business
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
spend
at
this
rate
,
to
please
you
,
or
anybody
.
<EOS>
You
would
n't
like
it
,
if
it
was
your
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Even
in
that
impossible
case
,
sir
,
I
---
"
  
"
Hold
your
tongue
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
You
ought
n't
to
like
it
in
any
case
.
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
I
did
n't
mean
to
be
rude
,
but
you
put
me
out
so
,
and
after
all
I
'm
master
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
intend
to
tell
you
to
hold
your
tongue
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
hold
your
tongue
.
<EOS>
Only
,
do
n't
contradict
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
come
across
the
life
of
Mr.
Elwes
?
"
<EOS>
referring
to
his
favourite
subject
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
miser
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
people
called
him
a
miser
.
<EOS>
People
are
always
calling
other
people
something
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
read
about
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
never
owned
to
being
rich
,
and
yet
he
might
have
bought
me
twice
over
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
of
Daniel
Dancer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Another
miser
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
a
good
'
un
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
and
he
had
a
sister
worthy
of
him
.
<EOS>
They
never
called
themselves
rich
neither
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
called
themselves
rich
,
most
likely
they
would
n't
have
been
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
lived
and
died
very
miserably
.
<EOS>
Did
they
not
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
n't
know
that
they
did
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
curtly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
they
are
not
the
Misers
I
mean
.
<EOS>
Those
abject
wretches
---
"
  
"
Do
n't
call
names
,
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
That
exemplary
brother
and
sister
---
lived
and
died
in
the
foulest
and
filthiest
degradation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
pleased
themselves
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
and
I
suppose
they
could
have
done
no
more
if
they
had
spent
their
money

<EOS>
But
however
,
I
ai
n't
going

fling
mine

<EOS>
Keep

<EOS>
The
fact
is

you

enough
here

Rokesmith

<EOS>
It
wants
constant
attention
in
the
littlest
things

<EOS>
Some

be
dying
in

workhouse
next

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
the
persons
you
have
cited

quietly
remarked
the
Secretary
,
"
thought
they
would
,

I
remember
,

"
  
"
And
very
creditable
in

"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
independent
in
'em
!
<EOS>
But
never
mind
them
just
now

<EOS>
Have
you
given
notice
to
quit
your
lodgings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Under
your
direction
,
I
have
,
sir

"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
tell
you
what
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
;
"
pay
the
quarter
's
rent

pay
the
quarter
's
rent
<EOS>
,
it
'll
be
the
cheapest
thing

and
come
here
at
once
,
so
that
you
may
be
always
on
the
spot
,
day
and
night
,
and
keep
the
expenses
down
.
<EOS>
You
'll
charge
the
quarter
's
rent
to
me
,
and
we
must
try
and
save
it
somewhere
.
<EOS>
You
've
got
some
lovely
furniture
;
have
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
furniture
in
my
rooms
is
my
own

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
sha
n't
have
to
buy
any
for
you
.
<EOS>
In
case
you
was
to
think
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
look
of
peculiar
shrewdness
,
"
so
honourably
independent
in
you
as
to
make
it
a
relief
to
your
mind
,
to
make
that
furniture
over
to
me
in
the
light
of
a
set
-
off
against
the
quarter
's
rent
,
why
ease
your
mind
,
ease
your
mind
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
it
,
but
I
wo
n't
stand
in
your
way
if
you
should
consider
it
due
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
As
to
your
room
,
choose
any
empty
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
empty
room
will
do
for
me
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
take
your
pick
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
and
it
'll
be
as
good
as
eight
or
ten
shillings
<EOS>
a
week
added
to
your
income
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
deduct
for
it
;
I
look
to
you
to
make
it
up
handsomely
by
keeping
the
expenses
down
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
you
'll
show
a
light
,
I
'll
come
to
your
officeroom
and
dispose
of
a
letter

two

"
  
<EOS>
On
that
clear
,
generous
face
of
Mrs.
Boffin
's
,
Bella
had
seen
such
traces
of
a
pang
at
the
heart
while
this
dialogue
was
being
held
,
that
she
had
not
the
courage
to
turn
her
eyes
to
it
when
they
were
left
alone
.
<EOS>
Feigning
to
be
intent
on
her
embroidery
,
she
sat
plying
her
needle
-
until
her
busy
hand
was
stopped
by
Mrs.
Boffin
's
hand
being
lightly
laid
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Yielding
to
the
touch
,
she
felt
her
hand
carried
to
the
good
soul
's
lips
,
and
felt
a
tear
fall
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
loved
husband
!
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
hard
to
see
and
hear
.
<EOS>
But
my
dear
Bella
,
believe
me
that
in
spite
of
all
the
change
in
him
,
he
is
the
best
of
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
came
back
,
at
the
moment
when
Bella
had
taken
the
hand
comfortingly
between
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
said
he
,
mistrustfully
looking
in
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
she
telling
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
only
praising
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
Praising
me
?
<EOS>
You
are
sure
?
<EOS>
Not
blaming
me
for
standing
on
my
own
defence
against
a
crew
of
plunderers
,
who
would
suck
me
dry
by
driblets
?
<EOS>
Not
blaming
me
for
getting
a
little
hoard
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
came
up
to
them
,
and
his
wife
folded
her
hands
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
shook
her
head
as
she
laid
it
on
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
There

there

there

urged
Mr.
Boffin
,
not
unkindly
.

<EOS>
Do

But
I
ca

to

you

so

<EOS>
"
Nonsense

Recollect
we

Recollect

we

scrunch

scrunched

Recollect

Do

you
be
doubtful

<EOS>
The
more
I

you

have

"
  
<EOS>
Bella
thought
it
was
well
for
his
wife
that
she
was
musing
with
her
affectionate
face
on
his
shoulder
;
for
there
was
a
cunning
light
in
his
eyes
as
he
said
all
this
,
which
seemed
to
cast
a
disagreeable
illumination
on
the
change
in
him
,
and
make
it
morally
uglier
.

THE
GOLDEN
DUSTMAN
FALLS
INTO
WORSE
COMPANY
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
come
to
pass
that
Mr.
Silas
Wegg
now
rarely
attended
the
minion
of
fortune
and
the
worm
of
the
hour
,
at
his
(
the
worm
's
and
minion
's
)
own
house
,
but
lay
under
general
instructions
to
await
him
within
a
certain
margin
of
hours
at
the
Bower
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
took
this
arrangement
in
great
dudgeon
,
because
the
appointed
hours
were
evening
hours
,
and
those
he
considered
precious
to
the
progress
of
the
friendly
move
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
quite
in
character
,
he
bitterly
remarked
to
Mr.
Venus
,
that
the
upstart
who
had
trampled
on
those
eminent
creatures
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
Master
George
,
Aunt
Jane
,
and
Uncle
Parker
,
should
oppress
his
literary
man
.
  
<EOS>
The
Roman
Empire
having
worked
out
its
destruction
,
Mr.
Boffin
next
appeared
in
a
cab
with
Rollin
's
Ancient
History
,
which
valuable
work
being
found
to
possess
lethargic
properties
,
broke
down
,
at
about
the
period
when
the
whole
of
the
army
of
Alexander
the
Macedonian
(
at
that
time
about
forty
thousand
strong
)
burst
into
tears
simultaneously
,
on
his
being
taken
with
a
shivering
fit
after
bathing
.
<EOS>
The
Wars
of
the
Jews
,
likewise
languishing
under
Mr.
Wegg
's
generalship
,
Mr.
Boffin
arrived
in
another
cab
with
Plutarch
:
whose
Lives
he
found
in
the
sequel
extremely
entertaining
,
though
he
hoped
Plutarch
might
not
expect
him
to
believe
them
all
.
<EOS>
What
to
believe
,
in
the
course
of
his
reading
,
was
Mr.
Boffin
's
chief
literary
difficulty
indeed
;
for
some
time
he
was
divided
in
his
mind
between
half
,
all
,
or
none
;
at
length
,
when
he
decided
,
as
a
moderate
man
,
to
compound
with
half
,
the
question
still
remained
,
which
half
?
<EOS>
And
that
stumbling
-
block
he
never
got
over
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
,
when
Silas
Wegg
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
arrival
of
his
patron
in
a
cab
,
accompanied
by
some
profane
historian
charged
with
unutterable
names
of
incomprehensible
peoples
,
of
impossible
descent
,
waging
wars
any
number
of
years
and
syllables
long
,
and
carrying
illimitable
hosts
and
riches
about
,
with
the
greatest
ease
,
beyond
the
confines
of
geography
---
one
evening
the
usual
time
passed
by
,
and
no
patron
appeared
.
<EOS>
After
half
an
hour
's
grace
,
Mr.
Wegg
proceeded
to
the
outer
gate
,
and
there
executed
a
whistle
,
conveying
to
Mr.
Venus
,
if
perchance
within
hearing
,
the
tidings
of
his
being
at
home
and
disengaged
.
<EOS>
Forth
from
the
shelter
of
a
neighbouring
wall
,
Mr.
Venus
then
emerged
.
  
<EOS>
"

Mr.

in
excellent
spirits

In
return
,
Mr.
Venus
gave
him
a
rather
dry
good
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walk
in
,
brother
,
"
said
Silas
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
,
"
and
take
your
seat
in
my
chimley
corner

for
what
says
the

<EOS>
`
`
No
malice
to

sir
,
  
And
no
falsehood
to
fear
,
  
But
truth
to

me

Mr.

And
I

With
this
quotation
(
depending
for
its
neatness
rather
on
the
spirit
than
the
words
)
,
Mr.
Wegg
conducted
his
guest
to
his
hearth
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
come
,
brother
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
in
a
hospitable
glow
,
"
you
come
like
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
what
---
exactly
like
it
---
I
should
n't
know
you
from
it
---
shedding
a
halo
all
around
you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
kind
of
halo
?
"
asked
Mr.
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
'
Ope
sir
,
"
replied
Silas
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
your
halo

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
appeared
doubtful
on
the
point
,
and
looked
rather
discontentedly
at
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
devote
the
evening
,
brother
,
"
exclaimed
Wegg
,
"
to
prosecute
our
friendly
move
.
<EOS>
And
arterwards
,
crushing
a
flowing
wine
-
cup
---
which
I
allude
to
brewing
rum
and
water
---
we
'll
pledge
one
another
.
<EOS>
For
what
says
the
Poet
?
   
<EOS>
`
<EOS>
`
And
you
need
n't
Mr.
Venus
be
your
black
bottle
,
  
<EOS>
For
surely
I
'll
be
mine
,
  
<EOS>
And
we
'll
take
a
glass
with
a
slice
of
lemon
in
it
to
which
you
're
partial

<EOS>
For

"
"
This
flow
of
quotation
and
hospitality
in
Wegg
indicated
his
observation
of
some
little
querulousness
on
the
part
of
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
as
to
the
friendly
move
,
"
observed
the
last
-
named
gentleman
,
rubbing
his
knees
peevishly
,
"
one
of
my
objections
to
it
is
,
that
it
do
n't
move
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rome
,
brother
,
"
returned
Wegg
:
"
a
city
which
(
it
may
not
be
generally
known
)
originated
in
twins
and
a
wolf
,
and
ended
in
Imperial
marble
:
was
n't
built
in
a
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
say
it
was
?
"
asked
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
you
did
not
,
brother
.
<EOS>
Well
-
inquired
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
say
,
"
proceeded
Venus
,
"
that
I
am
taken
from
among
my
trophies
of
anatomy
,
am
called
upon
to
exchange
my
human
warious
for
more
coal
-
ashes
warious
,
and
nothing
comes
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
must
give
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
remonstrated
Wegg
,
enthusiastically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No

`

<EOS>
"
Never

<EOS>
A
man
of
your

"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
so
much
saying
it
that
I
object
to
,
"
returned
Mr.
Venus
,
"
as
doing
it
.
<EOS>
And
having
got
to
do
it
whether
or
no
,
I
ca
n't
afford
to
waste
my
time
on
groping
for
nothing
in
cinders
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
think
how
little
time
you
have
given
to
the
move
,
sir
,
after
all
,
"
urged
Wegg
.
"
<EOS>
Add
the
evenings
so
occupied
together
,
and
what
do
they
come
to
?
<EOS>
And
you
,
sir
,
harmonizer
with
myself
in
opinions

views
,
and
feelings

you
with
the
patience
to
fit
together
on
wires
the
whole
framework
of
society

I
allude
to
the
human
skelinton
---
<EOS>
you
to
give
in
so
soon
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
it
,
"
returned
Mr.
Venus
moodily
,
as
he
put
his
head
between
his
knees
and
stuck
up
his
dusty
hair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
's
no
encouragement
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
them
Mounds
without
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
extending
his
right
hand
with
an
air
of
solemn
reasoning
,
"
encouragement
?
<EOS>
Not
them
Mounds
now
looking
down
upon
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
too
big
,
"
grumbled
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
a
scratch
here
and
a
scrape
there
,
a
poke
in
this
place
and
a
dig
in
the
other
,
to
them
?
<EOS>
Besides
;
what
have
we
found
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
we
found
?
"
cried
Wegg
,
delighted
to
be
able
to
acquiesce
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
There
I
grant
you
,
comrade
.
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
contrary
,
comrade
,
what
may
we
find
?
<EOS>
There
you
'll
grant
me
.
<EOS>
Anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
it
,
"
pettishly
returned
Venus
as
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
into
it
without
enough
consideration
.
<EOS>
And
besides
again
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
your
own
Mr.
Boffin
well
acquainted
with
the
Mounds
?
<EOS>
And
was
n't
he
well
acquainted
with
the
deceased
and
his
ways
?
<EOS>
And
has
he
ever
showed
any
expectation
of
finding
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
moment
wheels
were
heard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
should
be
loth
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
with
an
air
of
patient
injury
,
"
to
think
so
ill
of
him
as
to
suppose
him
capable
of
coming
at
this
time
of
night
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
sounds
like
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
ring
at
the
yard
bell
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
him
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
and
he
is
capable
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
,
because
I
could
have
wished
to
keep
up
a
little
lingering
fragment
of
respect
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Boffin
was
heard
lustily
calling
at
the
yard
gate
,
"
Halloa
!
<EOS>
Wegg
!
<EOS>
Halloa
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
your
seat
,
Mr.
Venus
,
"
said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
He
may
not
stop
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
called
out
,
"
Halloa
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Halloa
!
<EOS>
I
'm
with
you
directly
,
sir
!
<EOS>
Half
a
minute
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Coming
,
sir
,
as
fast
as
my
leg
will
bring
me
!
"
<EOS>
And
so
with
a
show
of
much
cheerful
alacrity
stumped
out
to
the
gate
with
a
light
,
and
there
,
through
the
window
of
a
cab
,
descried
Mr.
Boffin
inside
,
blocked
up
with
books
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
!
lend
a
hand
,
Wegg
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
excitedly
,
"
I
ca
n't
get
out
till
the
way
<EOS>
is
cleared
for
me
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
Annual
Register
,
Wegg
,
in
a
cab
full
of
wollumes
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Know
the
Animal
Register
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
returned
the
Impostor
,
who
had
caught
the
name
imperfectly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
a
trifling
wager
,
I
think
I
could
find
any
Animal
in
him
,
blindfold
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
here
's
Kirby
's
Wonderful
Museum
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
and
<EOS>
Caulfield
's
Characters
,
and
Wilson
's
.
<EOS>
Such
Characters
,
Wegg
,
such
Characters
!
<EOS>
I
must
have
one
or
two
of
the
best
of
'em
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
It
's
amazing
what
places
they
used
to
put
the
guineas
in
,
wrapped
up
in
rags
.
<EOS>
Catch
hold
of
that
pile
of
wollumes
,
Wegg
,
or
<EOS>
it
'll
bulge
out
and
burst
into
the
mud
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anyone
about
,
to
help
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
friend
of
mine
,
sir
,
that
had
the
intention
of
spending
the
evening
with
me
when
I
gave
you
up
---
much
against
my
will
---
  
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Call
him
out
,
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
in
a
bustle
;
"
get
him
to
bear
a
hand
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
drop
that
one
under
your
arm
.
<EOS>
It
's
Dancer
.
<EOS>
Him
and
his
sister
made
pies
of
a
dead
sheep
they
found
when
they
were
out
a
walking
.
<EOS>
Where
's
your
friend
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
here
's
your
friend
.
<EOS>
Would
you
be
so
good
as
help
Wegg
and
myself
with
these
books
?
<EOS>
But
do
n't
take
Jemmy
Taylor
of
Southwark
,
nor
<EOS>
yet
Jemmy
Wood
of
Gloucester
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
two
Jemmys
.
<EOS>
I
'll
carry
them
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
ceasing
to
talk
and
bustle
,
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
,
Mr.
Boffin
directed
the
removal
and
arrangement
of
the
books
,
appearing
to
be
in
some
sort
beside
himself
until
they
were
all
deposited
on
the
floor
,
and
the
cab
was
dismissed
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
gloating
over
them
.
<EOS>
"
There
they
are
,
like
the
four
-
and
-
twenty
fiddlers
---
all
of
a
row
.
<EOS>
Get
on
your
spectacles
,
Wegg
;
I
know
where
to
find
the
best
of
'em
,
and
we
'll
have
a
taste
at
once
of
what
we
have
got
before
us
.
<EOS>
What
's
your
friend
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
presented
his
friend
as
Mr.
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
,
catching
at
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Of
Clerkenwell
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
Clerkenwell
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
've
heard
of
you
,
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
of
you
in
the
old
man
's
time
.
<EOS>
You
knew
him
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
buy
anything
of
him
?
"
<EOS>
With
piercing
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
returned
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
he
showed
you
things
;
did
n't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
with
a
glance
at
his
friend
,
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
show
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
putting
his
hands
behind
him
,
and
eagerly
advancing
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Did
he
show
you
boxes
,
little
cabinets
,
pocket
-
books
,
parcels
,
anything
locked
or
sealed
,
anything
tied
up
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
a
judge
of
china
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
again
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
if
he
had
ever
showed
you
a
teapot
,
I
should
be
glad
to
know
of
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
with
his
right
hand
at
his
lips
,
repeated
thoughtfully
,
"
a
Teapot
,
"
a
Teapot
,
"
and
glanced
over
the
books
on
the
floor
,
as
if
he
knew
there
was
something
interesting
connected
with
a
teapot
,
somewhere
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
and
Mr.
Venus
looked
at
one
another
wonderingly
:
and
Mr.
Wegg
,
in
fitting
on
his
spectacles
,
opened
his
eyes
wide
,
over
their
rims
,
and
tapped
the
side
of
his
nose
:
as
an
admonition
to
Venus
to
keep
himself
generally
wide
awake
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
Teapot
,
"
repeated
Mr.
Boffin
,
continuing
to
muse
and
survey
the
books
;
"
a
Teapot
,
a
Teapot
.
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
,
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
your
service
,
sir
,
"
replied
that
gentleman
,
taking
his
usual
seat
on
the
usual
settle
,
and
poking
his
wooden
leg
under
the
table
before
it
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
would
you
make
yourself
useful
,
and
take
a
seat
beside
me
,
sir
,
for
the
conveniency
of
snuffing
the
candles
?
"
  
<EOS>
Venus
complying
with
the
invitation
while
it
was
yet
being
given
,
Silas
pegged
at
him
with
his
wooden
leg
,
to
call
his
particular
attention
to
Mr.
Boffin
standing
musing
before
the
fire
,
in
the
space
between
the
two
settles
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
<EOS>
Ahem
!
<EOS>
"
coughed
Mr.
Wegg
to
attract
his
employer
's
attention
.
"
<EOS>
Would
you
wish
to
commence
with
an
Animal
,
sir
---
  
from
the
Register
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
no
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
With
that
,
producing
a
little
book
from
his
breast
-
pocket
,
he
handed
it
with
great
care
to
the
literary
gentlemen
,
and
inquired
,
"
What
do
you
call
that
,
Wegg
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
sir
,
"
replied
Silas
,
adjusting
his
spectacles
,
and
referring
to
the
title
-
page
,
"
is
Merryweather

Lives

Anecdotes

<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
would
you
make
yourself
useful
and
draw
the
candles
a
little
nearer

sir

<EOS>
"
This
to
have
a
special
opportunity
of
bestowing
a
stare
upon
his
comrade

<EOS>
"
Which
of

have
you
got

asked
Mr.
Boffin

"
<EOS>
Can
you

easy

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

replied
Silas
,
turning
to
the
table
of
contents

slowly
fluttering
the
leaves
of
the
book

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
drew
an
arm
-
chair
into
the
space
where
he
stood
,
and
said
,
seating
himself
and
slyly
rubbing
his
hands
:

Give

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
pursued
the
biography
of
that
eminent
man
through
its
various
phases
of
avarice
and
dirt
,
through
Miss
Dancer
's
death
on
a
sick
regimen
of
cold
dumpling
,
and
through
Mr.
Dancer
's
keeping
his
rags
together
with
a
hayband
,
and
warming
his
dinner
by
sitting
upon
it
,
down
to
the
consolatory
incident
of
his
dying
naked
in
a
sack
.
<EOS>
After
which
he
read
on
as
follows
:
  
"
`
`
The
house
,
or
rather
the
heap
of
ruins
,
in
which
Mr.
Dancer
lived
,
and
which
at
his
death
devolved
to
the
right
of
Captain
Holmes
,
was
a
most
miserable
,
decayed
building
,
for
it
had
not
been
repaired
for
more
than
half
a
century
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
(
Here
Mr.
Wegg
eyed
his
comrade
and
the
room
in
which
they
sat
:
which
had
not
been
repaired
for
a
long
time
.
)
  
"
`
`
But
though
poor
in
external
structure
,
the
ruinous
fabric
was
very
rich
in
the
interior
.
<EOS>
It
took
many
weeks
to
explore
its
whole
contents
;
and
Captain
Holmes
found
it
a
very
agreeable
task
to
dive
into
the
miser
's
secret
hoards
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
(
Here
Mr.
Wegg
repeated
`
`
secret
hoards
,
"
"
and
pegged
his
comrade
again
.
)
  
"
`
`
One
of
Mr.
Dancer
's
richest
escretoires
was
found
to
be
a
dungheap
in
the
cowhouse
;
a
sum
but
little
short
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
was
contained
in
this
rich
piece
of
manure
;
and
in
an
old
jacket
,
carefully
tied
,
and
strongly
nailed
down
to
the
manger
,
in
bank
notes
and
gold
were
found
five
hundred
pounds
more
.
"
"
"
  
(
Here
Mr.
Wegg
's
wooden
leg
started
forward
under
the
table
,
and
slowly
elevated
itself
as
he
read
on
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
`
`
Several
bowls
were
discovered
filled
with
guineas
and
half
-
guineas
;
 
and
at
different
times
on
searching
the
corners
of
the
house
they
found
various
parcels
of
bank
notes
.
<EOS>
Some
were
crammed
into
the
crevices
of
the
wall
;
"
"
"
  
(
Here
Mr.
Venus
looked
at
the
wall
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
`
`
Bundles
were
hid
under
the
cushions
and
covers
of
the
chairs
;
"
"
"
  
(
Here
Mr.
Venus
looked
under
himself
on
the
settle
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
`
`
Some
were
reposing
snugly
at
the
back
of
the
drawers
;
and
notes
amounting
to
six
hundred
pounds
were
found
neatly
doubled
up
in
the
inside
of
an
old
teapot
.
<EOS>
In
the
stable
the
Captain
found
jugs
full
of
old
dollars
and
shillings
.
<EOS>
The
chimney
was
not
left
unsearched
,
and
paid
very
well
for
the
trouble
;
for
in
nineteen
different
holes
,
all
filled
with
soot
,
were
found
various
sums
of
money
,
amounting
together
to
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
On
the
way
to
this
crisis
Mr.
Wegg
's
wooden
leg
had
gradually
elevated
itself
more
and
more
,
and
he
had
nudged
Mr.
Venus
with
his
opposite
elbow
deeper
and
deeper
,
until
at
length
the
preservation
of
his
balance
became
incompatible
with
the
two
actions
,
and
he
now
dropped
over
sideways
upon
that
gentleman
,
squeezing
him
against
the
settle
's
edge
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
either
of
the
two
,
for
some
few
seconds
,
make
any
effort
to
recover
himself
;
both
remaining
in
a
kind
of
pecuniary
swoon
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
sight
of
Mr.
Boffin
sitting
in
the
arm
-
chair
hugging
himself
,
with
his
eyes
upon
the
fire
,
acted
as
a
restorative
.
<EOS>
Counterfeiting
a
sneeze
to
cover
their
movements
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
with
a
spasmodic
"
Tish
-
ho
!
"
pulled
himself
and
Mr.
Venus
up
in
a
masterly
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
's
have
some
more
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
hungrily
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
Elwes
is
the
next
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Is
it
your
pleasure
to
take
John
Elwes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Let
's
hear
what
John
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
appear
to
have
hidden
anything
,
so
went
off
rather
flatly
.
<EOS>
But
an
exemplary
lady
named
Wilcocks
,
who
had
stowed
away
gold
and
silver
in
a
pickle
-
pot
in
a
clock
-
case
,
a
canister
-
full
of
treasure
in
a
hole
under
her
stairs
,
and
a
quantity
of
money
in
an
old
rat
-
trap
,
revived
the
interest
.
<EOS>
To
her
succeeded
another
lady
,
claiming
to
be
a
pauper
,
whose
wealth
was
found
wrapped
up
in
little
scraps
of
paper
and
old
rag
.
<EOS>
To
her
,
another
lady
,
apple
-
woman
by
trade
,
who
had
saved
a
fortune
of
ten
thousand
pounds
and
hidden
it
"
here
and
there
,
in
cracks
and
corners
,
behind
bricks
and
under
the
flooring
.
"
<EOS>
To
her
,
a
French
gentleman
,
who
had
crammed
up
his
chimney
,
rather
to
the
detriment
of
its
drawing
powers
,
"
a
leather
valise
,
containing
twenty
thousand
francs
,
gold
coins
,
and
a
large
quantity
of
precious
stones
,
"
as
discovered
by
a
chimneysweep
after
his
death
.
<EOS>
By
these
steps
Mr.
Wegg
arrived
at
a
concluding
instance
of
the
human
Magpie
:
  
"
"
Many
years
ago
,
there
lived
at
Cambridge
a
miserly
old
couple
of
the
name
of
Jardine
<EOS>
:
they
had
two
sons
:
the
father
was
a
perfect
miser
,
and
at
his
death
one
thousand
guineas
were
discovered
secreted
in
his
bed
.
<EOS>
The
two
sons
grew
up
as
parsimonious
as
their
sire
.
<EOS>
When
about
twenty
years
of
age
,
they
commenced
business
at
Cambridge
as
drapers
,
and
they
continued
there
until
their
death
.
<EOS>
The
establishment
of
the
Messrs.
Jardine
was
the
most
dirty
of
all
the
shops
in
Cambridge
.
<EOS>
Customers
seldom
went
in
to
purchase
,
except
perhaps
out
of
curiosity
.
<EOS>
The
brothers
were
most
disreputable
-
looking
beings
;
for
,
although
surrounded
with
gay
apparel
as
their
staple
in
trade
,
they
wore
the
most
filthy
rags
themselves
.
<EOS>
It
is
said
that
they
had
no
bed
,
and
,
to
save
the
expense
of
one
,
always
slept
on
a
bundle
of
packing
-
cloths
under
the
counter
.
<EOS>
In
their
housekeeping
they
were
penurious
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
A
joint
of
meat
did
not
grace
their
board
for
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
Yet
when
the
first
of
the
brothers
died
,
the
other
,
much
to
his
surprise
,
found
large
sums
of
money
which
had
been
secreted
even
from
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Even
from
him
,
you
see
!
<EOS>
There
was
only
two
of
'em
,
and
yet
one
of
'em
hid
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
who
since
his
introduction
to
the
French
gentleman
,
had
been
stooping
to
peer
up
the
chimney
,
had
his
attention
recalled
by
the
last
sentence
,
and
took
the
liberty
of
repeating
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
it
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
turning
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
like
what
Wegg
's
been
a
-
reading
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
answered
that
he
found
it
extremely
interesting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
come
again
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
and
hear
some
more
.
<EOS>
Come
when
you
like
;
come
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
,
half
an
hour
sooner
.
<EOS>
There
's
plenty
more
;
there
's
no
end
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
expressed
his
acknowledgments
and
accepted
the
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
wonderful
<EOS>
what
's
been
hid
,
at
one
time
and
another
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
ruminating
;
"
truly
wonderful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Meaning
sir
,
"
observed
Wegg
,
with
a
propitiatory
face
to
draw
him
out
,
and
with
another
peg
at
his
friend
and
brother
,
"
in
the
way
of
money
?
"
  
"
Money
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
And
papers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
in
a
languid
transport
,
again
dropped
over
on
Mr.
Venus
,
and
again
recovering
himself
,
masked
his
emotions
with
a
sneeze
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tish
-
ho
!
<EOS>
Did
you
say
papers
too
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Been
hidden
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hidden
and
forgot
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
the
bookseller
that
sold
me
the
Wonderful
Museum
---
where
's
the
Wonderful
Museum
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
on
his
knees
on
the
floor
in
a
moment
,
groping
eagerly
among
the
books
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
I
assist
you
,
sir
?
"
asked
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
have
got
it
;
here
it
is
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
dusting
it
with
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wollume
four
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
was
the
fourth
wollume
,

the
bookseller
read
it
to
me
out
of

<EOS>
Look

Wegg

Silas
took
the
book
and
turned

leaves

replied
Wegg
,
consulting

`

Singular

-

years

<EOS>
"
"
  
"
That
's
it
!
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Read
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
`
`
A
most
extraordinary
case
,
"
"
"
read
Silas
Wegg
aloud
,
"
`
`
was
tried
at
the
last
Maryborough
assizes
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
It
was
briefly
this
.
<EOS>
Robert
Baldwin
,
in
March
1782
,
made
his
will
,
in
which
he
devised
the
lands
now
in
question
,
to
the
children
of
his
youngest
son
;
soon
after
which
his
faculties
failed
him
,
and
he
became
altogether
childish
and
died
,
above
eighty
years
old
.
<EOS>
The
defendant
,
the
eldest
son
,
immediately
afterwards
gave
out
that
his
father
had
destroyed
the
will
;
and
no
will
being
found
,
he
entered
into
possession
of
the
lands
in
question
,
and
so
matters
remained
for
twenty
-
one
years
,
the
whole
family
during
all
that
time
believing
that
the
father
had
died
without
a
will
.
<EOS>
But
after
twenty
-
one
years
the
defendant
's
wife
died
,
and
he
very
soon
afterwards
,
at
the
age
of
seventy
-
eight
,
married
a
very
young
woman
:
which
caused
some
anxiety
to
his
two
sons
,
whose
poignant
expressions
of
this
feeling
so
exasperated
their
father
,
that
he
in
his
resentment
executed
a
will
to
disinherit
his
eldest
son
,
and
in
his
fit
of
anger
showed
it
to
his
second
son
,
who
instantly
determined
to
get
at
it
,
and
destroy
it
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
property
to
his
brother
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
broke
open
his
father
's
desk
,
where
he
found
---
not
his
father
's
will
which
he
sought
after
,
but
the
will
of
his
grandfather
,
which
was
then
altogether
forgotten
in
the
family
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
"
There
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
See
what
men
put
away
and
forget
,
or
mean
to
destroy
,
and
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
He
then
added
in
a
slow
tone
,
"
As
---
ton
---
ish
---
ing
!
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
rolled
his
eyes
all
round
the
room
,
<EOS>
Wegg
and
Venus
likewise
rolled
their
eyes
all
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
And
then
Wegg
,
singly
,
fixed
his
eyes
on
Mr.
Boffin
looking
at
the
fire
again
;
as
if
he
had
a
mind
to
spring
upon
him
and
demand
his
thoughts
or
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
However
,
time
's
up
for
to
-
night
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
waving
his
hand
after
a
silence
.
<EOS>
"
More
,
the
day
after
to
-
morrow

I
dare
say
Mr.
Venus
will
be
so
kind
as
help
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
speaking
,
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
breast
of
his
outer
coat
,
and
struggled
with
some
object
there
that
was
too
large
to
be
got
out
easily
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
stupefaction
of
the
friendly
movers
when
this
object
at
last
emerging
,
proved
to
be
a
much
-
dilapidated
dark
lantern
!
  
<EOS>
Without
at
all
noticing
the
effect
produced
by
this
little
instrument
,
Mr.
Boffin
stood
it
on
his
knee
,
and
,
producing
a
box
of
matches
,
deliberately
lighted
the
candle
in
the
lantern
,
blew
out
the
kindled
match
,
and
cast
the
end
into
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
,
Wegg
,
"
 
he
then
announced
,
"
to
take
a
turn
about
the
place
and
round
the
yard
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
you
.
<EOS>
Me
and
this
same
lantern
have
taken
hundreds
---
thousands
---
of
such
turns
in
our
time
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
could
n't
think
,
sir
---
not
on
any
account
,
I
could
n't
,
"
---
  
<EOS>
Wegg
was
politely
beginning
,
when
Mr.
Boffin
,
who
had
risen
and
was
going
towards
the
door
,
stopped
:
  
"
I
have
told
you
that
I
do
n't
want
you
,
Wegg
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wegg
looked
intelligently
thoughtful
,
as
if
that
had
not
occurred
to
his
mind
until
he
now
brought
it
to
bear
on
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
let
Mr.
Boffin
go
out
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
instant
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
it
,
Wegg
clutched
Venus
with
both
hands
,
and
said
in
a
choking
whisper
,
as
if
he
were
being
strangled
:
  
"
Mr.
Venus
,
he
must
be
followed
,
he
must
be
watched
,
he
must
n't
be
lost
sight
of
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
must
n't
he
?
"
asked
Venus
,
also
strangling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Comrade
,
you
might
have
noticed
I
was
a
little
elewated
in
spirits
when
you
come
in
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
've
found
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
found
?
"
asked
Venus
,
clutching
him
with
both
hands
,
so
that
they
stood
interlocked
like
a
couple
of
preposterous
gladiators
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
time
to
tell
you
now
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
must
have
gone
to
look
for
it
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
an
eye
upon
him
instantly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Releasing
each
other
,
they
crept
to
the
door
,
opened
it
softly
,
and
peeped
out
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
cloudy
night
,
and
the
black
shadow
of
the
Mounds
made
the
dark
yard
darker
.
<EOS>
"
If
not
a
double
swindler
,
"
 
whispered
Wegg
,
"
why
a
dark
lantern
?
<EOS>
We
could
have
seen
what
he
was
about
,
if
he
had
carried
a
light
one
.
<EOS>
Softly
,
this
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Cautiously
along
the
path
that
was
bordered
by
fragments
of
crockery
set
in
ashes
,
the
two
stole
after
him
.
<EOS>
They
could
hear
him
at
his
peculiar
trot
,
crushing
the
loose
cinders
as
he
went
.
"
<EOS>
He
knows
the
place
by
heart
,
"
muttered
Silas
,
"
and
do
n't
need
to
turn
his
lantern
on
,
confound
him
!
"
<EOS>
But
he
did
turn
it
on
,
almost
in
that
same
instant
,
and
flashed
its
light
upon
the
first
of
the
Mounds
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
spot
?
"
asked
Venus
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
warm
,
"
said
Silas
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
precious
warm
.
<EOS>
He
's
close
.
<EOS>
I
think
he
must
be
going
to
look
for
it
.
<EOS>
What
's
that
he
's
got
in
his
hand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
shovel
,
"
answered
Venus
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
knows
how
to
use
it
,
remember
,
fifty
times
as
well
as
either
of
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
he
looks
for
it
and
misses
it
,
partner
,
"
suggested
Wegg
,
"
what
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
First
of
all
,
wait
till
he
does
,
"
said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
Discreet
advice
too
,
for
he
darkened
his
lantern
again
,
and
the
mound
turned
black
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
seconds
,
he
turned
the
light
on
once
more
,
and
was
seen
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
second
mound
,
slowly
raising
the
lantern
little
by
little
until
he
held
it
up
at
arm
's
length
,
as
if
he
were
examining
the
condition
of
the
whole
surface
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
ca
n't
be
the
spot
too
?
"
said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Wegg
,
"
he
's
getting
cold
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
strikes
me
,
"
whispered
Venus
,
"
that
he
wants
to
find
out
whether
any
one
has
been
groping
about
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
returned
Wegg
,
"
he
's
getting
colder
and
colder
.
<EOS>
---
Now
he
's
freezing
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
exclamation
was
elicited
by
his
having
turned
the
lantern
off
again
,
and
on
again
,
and
being
visible
at
the
foot
of
the
third
mound
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
's
going
up
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shovel
and
all
!
"
said
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
At
a
nimbler
trot
,
as
if
the
shovel
over
his
shoulder
stimulated
him
by
reviving
old
associations
,
Mr.
Boffin
ascended
the
"
serpentining
walk
,
"
up
the
Mound
which
he
had
described
to
Silas
Wegg
on
the
occasion
of
their
beginning
to
decline
and
fall
.
<EOS>
On
striking
into
it
he
turned
his
lantern
off
.
<EOS>
The
two
followed
him
,
stooping
low
,
so
that
their
figures
might
make
no
mark
in
relief
against
the
sky
when
he
should
turn
his
lantern
on
again
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
took
the
lead
,
towing
Mr.
Wegg
,
in
order
that
his
refractory
leg
might
be
promptly
extricated
from
any
pitfalls
it
should
dig
for
itself
.
<EOS>
They
could
just
make
out
that
the
Golden
Dustman
stopped
to
breathe
.
<EOS>
Of
course
they
stopped
too
,
instantly
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
his
own
Mound
,
"
whispered
Wegg
,
as
he
recovered
his
wind
,
"
this
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
all
three
are
his
own
,
"
returned
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
he
thinks
;
but
he
's
used
to
call
this
his
own
,
because
it
's
the
one
first
left
to
him
;
the
one
that
was
his
legacy
when
it
was
all
he
took
under
the
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
he
shows
his
light
,
"
said
Venus
,
keeping
watch
upon
his
dusky
figure
all
the
time
,
"
drop
lower
and
keep
closer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
on
again
,
and
they
followed
again
.
<EOS>
Gaining
the
top
of
the
Mound
,
he
turned
on
his
light
---
but
only
partially
---
and
stood
it
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
A
bare
lopsided
weatherbeaten
pole
was
planted
in
the
ashes
there
,
and
had
been
there
many
a
year
.
<EOS>
Hard
by
this
pole
,
his
lantern
stood
:
lighting
a
few
feet
of
the
lower
part
of
it
and
a
little
of
the
ashy
surface
around
,
and
then
casting
off
a
purposeless
little
clear
trail
of
light
into
the
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
can
never
be
going
to
dig
up
the
pole
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Venus
as
they
dropped
low
and
kept
close
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
it
's
holler
and
full
of
something
,
"
whispered
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
dig
,
with
whatsoever
object
,
for
he
tucked
up
his
cuffs
and
spat
on
his
hands
,
and
then
went
at
it
like
an
old
digger
as
he
was
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
design
upon
the
pole
,
except
that
he
measured
a
shovel
's
length
from
it
before
beginning
,
nor
was
it
his
purpose
to
dig
deep
.
<EOS>
Some
dozen
or
so
of
expert
strokes
sufficed
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
stopped
,
looked
down
into
the
cavity
,
bent
over
it
,
and
took
out
what
appeared
to
be
an
ordinary
case
-
bottle
:
one
of
those
squat
,
high
-
shouldered
,
short
-
necked
glass
bottles
which
the
Dutchman
is
said
to
keep
his
Courage
in
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
done
this
,
he
turned
off
his
lantern
,
and
they
could
hear
that
he
was
filling
up
the
hole
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
The
ashes
being
easily
moved
by
a
skilful
hand
,
the
spies
took
this
as
a
hint
to
make
off
in
good
time
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
Mr.
Venus
slipped
past
Mr.
Wegg
and
towed
him
down
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Wegg
's
descent
was
not
accomplished
without
some
personal
inconvenience
,
for
his
self
-
willed
leg
sticking
into
the
ashes
about
half
way
down
,
and
time
pressing
,
Mr.
Venus
took
the
liberty
of
hauling
him
from
his
tether
by
the
collar
:
which
occasioned
him
to
make
the
rest
of
the
journey
on
his
back
,
with
his
head
enveloped
in
the
skirts
of
his
coat
,
and
his
wooden
leg
coming
last
,
like
a
drag
.
<EOS>
So
flustered
was
Mr.
Wegg
by
this
mode
of
travelling
,
that
when
he
was
set
on
the
level
ground
with
his
intellectual
developments
uppermost
,
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
his
bearings
,
and
had
not
the
least
idea
where
his
place
of
residence
was
to
be
found
,
until
Mr.
Venus
shoved
him
into
it
.
<EOS>
Even
then
he
staggered
round
and
round
,
weakly
staring
about
him
,
until
Mr.
Venus
with
a
hard
brush
brushed
his
senses
into
him
and
the
dust
out
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
came
down
leisurely
,
for
this
brushing
process
had
been
well
accomplished
,
and
Mr.
Venus
had
had
time
to
take
his
breath
,
before
he
reappeared
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
the
bottle
somewhere
about
him
could
not
be
doubted
;
where
,
was
not
so
clear
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
large
rough
coat
,
buttoned
over
,
and
it
might
be
in
any
one
of
half
a
dozen
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
Wegg
?
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
palo
as
a
candle
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
replied
,
with
literal
exactness
,
that
he
felt
as
if
he
had
had
a
turn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bile
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
blowing
out
the
light
in
the
lantern
,
shutting
it
up
,
and
stowing
it
away
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
as
before
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
subject
to
bile
,
Wegg
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
again
replied
,
with
strict
adherence
to
truth
,
that
he
did
n't
think
he
had
ever
had
a
similar
sensation
in
his
head
,
to
anything
like
the
same
extent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Physic
yourself
to
-
morrow
,
Wegg
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
to
be
in
order
for
next
night
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
by
,
this
neighbourhood
is
going
to
have
a
loss
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
loss
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Going
to
lose
the
Mounds
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
friendly
movers
made
such
an
obvious
effort
not
to
look
at
one
another
,
that
they
might
as
well
have
stared
at
one
another
with
all
their
might
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
parted
with
them
,
Mr.
Boffin
?
"
asked
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
they
're
going
.
<EOS>
Mine
's
as
good
as
gone
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
mean
the
little
one
of
the
three
,
with
the
pole
atop
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
rubbing
his
ear
in
his
old
way
,
with
that
new
touch
of
craftiness
added
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
fetched
a
penny
.
<EOS>
It
'll
begin
to
be
carted
off
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
been
out
to
take
leave
of
your
old
friend
,
sir
?
"
asked
Silas
,
jocosely
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
put
that
in
your
head
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
so
sudden
and
rough
,
that
Wegg
,
who
had
been
hovering
closer
and
closer
to
his
skirts
,
despatching
the
back
of
his
hand
on
exploring
expeditions
in
search
of
the
bottle
's
surface
,
retired
two
or
three
paces
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
offence
,
sir
,
"
said
Wegg
,
humbly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
offence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
eyed
him
as
a
dog
might
eye
another
dog
who
wanted
his
bone
;
and
actually
retorted
with
a
low
growl
,
as
the
dog
might
have
retorted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
"
he
said
,
after
having
sunk
into
a
moody
silence
,
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
,
and
his
eyes
suspiciously
wandering
about
Wegg
.
<EOS>
---
"
No
!
stop
there
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
way
out
,
and
I
want
no
light
.
"
  
<EOS>
Avarice
,
and
the
evening
's
legends
of
avarice
,
and
the
inflammatory
effect
of
what
he
had
seen
,
and
perhaps
the
rush
of
his
illconditioned
blood
to
his
brain
in
his
descent
,
wrought
Silas
Wegg
to
such
a
pitch
of
insatiable
appetite
,
that
when
the
door
closed
he
made
a
swoop
at
it
and
drew
Venus
along
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
must
n't
go
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
n't
let
him
go
?
<EOS>
He
has
got
that
bottle
about
him
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
that
bottle
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
would
n't
take
it
by
force
?
<EOS>
"
said
Venus
,
restraining
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
I
?
<EOS>
Yes
I
would
.
<EOS>
I
'd
take
it
by
any
force
,
I
'd
have
it
at
any
price
!
<EOS>
Are
you
so
afraid
of
one
old
man
as
to
let
him
go
,
you
coward
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
afraid
of
you
,
<EOS>
as
not
to
let
you
go
,
"
muttered
Venus
,
sturdily
,
clasping
him
in
his
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
him
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
you
hear
him
say
that
he
was
resolved
to
disappoint
us
?
<EOS>
Did
you
hear
him
say
,
you
cur
,
that
he
was
going
to
have
the
Mounds
cleared
off
,
when
no
doubt
the
whole
place
will
be
rummaged
?
<EOS>
If
you
have
n't
the
spirit
of
a
mouse
to
defend
your
rights
,
I
have
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
after
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
in
his
wildness
he
was
making
a
strong
struggle
for
it
,
Mr.
Venus
deemed
it
expedient
to
lift
him
,
throw
him
,
and
fall
with
him
;
well
knowing
that
,
once
down
,
he
would
not
be
up
again
easily
with
his
wooden
leg
.
<EOS>
So
they
both
rolled
on
the
floor
,
and
,
as
they
did
so
,
Mr.
Boffin
shut
the
gate
.
   
<EOS>
THE
FRIENDLY
MOVE
TAKES
UP
A
STRONG
POSITION
.
 
<EOS>
The
friendly
movers
sat
upright
on
the
floor
,
panting
and
eyeing
one
another
,
after
Mr.
Boffin
had
slammed
the
gate
and
gone
away
.
<EOS>
In
the
weak
eyes
of
Venus
,
and
in
every
reddish
dustcoloured
hair
in
his
shock
of
hair
,
there
was
a
marked
distrust
of
Wegg
and
an
alertness
to
fly
at
him
on
perceiving
the
smallest
occasion
.
<EOS>
In
the
hard
-
grained
face
of
Wegg
,
and
in
his
stiff
knotty
figure
(
he
looked
like
a
German
wooden
toy
)
,
there
was
expressed
a
politic
conciliation
,
which
had
no
spontaneity
in
it
.
<EOS>
Both
were
flushed
,
flustered
,
and
rumpled
,
by
the
late
scuffle
;
and
Wegg
,
in
coming
to
the
ground
,
had
received
a
humming
knock
on
the
back
of
his
devoted
head
,
which
caused
him
still
to
rub
it
with
an
air
of
having
been
highly
---
but
disagreeably
---
astonished
.
<EOS>
Each
was
silent
for
some
time
,
leaving
it
to
the
other
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
said
Wegg
,
at
length
breaking
the
silence
,
"
you
were
right
,
and
I
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
knowingly
cocked
his
shock
of
hair
,
as
rather
thinking
Mr.
Wegg
had
remembered
himself
,
in
respect
of
appearing
without
any
disguise
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
comrade
,
"
pursued
Wegg
,
"
it
was
never
your
lot
to
know
Miss
Elizabeth
,
Master
George
,
Aunt
Jane
,
nor
Uncle
Parker
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
admitted
that
he
had
never
known
those
distinguished
persons
,
and
added
,
in
effect
,
that
he
had
never
so
much
as
desired
the
honor
of
their
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
comrade
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Wegg
<EOS>
;
"
No
,
do
n't
say
that
!
<EOS>
Because
,
without
having
known
them
,
you
never
can
fully
know
what
it
is
to
be
stimilated
to
frenzy
by
the
sight
of
the
Usurper
.
"
  
<EOS>
Offering
these
excusatory
words
as
if
they
reflected
great
credit
on
himself
,
Mr.
Wegg
impelled
himself
with
his
hands
towards
a
chair
in
a
corner
of
the
room
,
and
there
,
after
a
variety
of
awkward
gambols
,
attained
a
perpendicular
position
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
also
rose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Comrade
,
"
said
Wegg
,
"
take
a
seat
,
Comrade
,
what
a
speaking
countenance
is
yours
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
involuntarily
smoothed
his
countenance
,
and
looked
at
his
hand
,
as
if
to
see
whether
any
of
its
speaking
properties
came
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
clearly
do
I
know
,
mark
you
,
"
pursued
Wegg
,
pointing
his
words
with
his
forefinger
,
"
clearly
do
I
know
what
question
your
expressive
features
puts
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
question
?
"
said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
question
,
"
returned
Wegg
,
with
a
sort
of
joyful
affability
,
"
why
I
did
n't
mention
sooner
,
that
I
had
found
something
.
<EOS>
Says
your
speaking
countenance
to
me
:
`
`
Why
did
n't
you
communicate
that
,
when
I
first
come
in
this
evening
?
<EOS>
Why
did
you
keep
it
back
till
you
thought
Mr.
Boffin
had
come
to
look
for
the
article
?
"
<EOS>
"
Your
speaking
countenance
,
"
said
Wegg
,
"
puts
it
plainer
than
language
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
ca
n't
read
in
my
face
<EOS>
what
answer
I
give
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
ca
n't
,
"
said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
!
<EOS>
And
why
not
?
"
returned
Wegg
,
with
the
same
joyful
candour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
I
lay
no
claims
to
a
speaking
countenance
.
<EOS>
Because
I
am
well
aware
of
my
deficiencies
.
<EOS>
All
men
are
not
gifted
alike
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
answer
in
words
.
<EOS>
And
in
what
words
?
<EOS>
These
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
to
give
you
a
delightful
sap
---
pur
---
   
IZE
!
"
  
<EOS>
Having
thus
elongated
and
emphasized
the
word
Surprise
,
Mr.
Wegg
shook
his
friend
and
brother
by
both
hands
,
and
then
clapped
him
on
both
knees
,
like
an
affectionate
patron
who
entreated
him
not
to
mention
so
small
a
service
as
that
which
it
had
been
his
happy
privilege
to
render
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
speaking
countenance
,
"
said
Wegg
,
"
being
answered
to
its
satisfaction
,
only
asks
then
,
`
`
What
have
you
found
?
"
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
hear
it
say
the
words
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
retorted
Venus
snappishly
,
after
waiting
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
hear
it
say
the
words
,
why
do
n't
you
answer
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
out

"
said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a

<EOS>
Man

I

box

<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
  
"
---
Hear
me
out

said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
(
He
tried
to
reserve
whatever
he
could
,
and
,
whenever
disclosure
was
forced
upon
him
,
broke
into
a
radiant
gush
of
Hear

)
<EOS>
"
On
a
certain
day

"
  
"
When

"
said
Venus
bluntly
.
  
<EOS>
"
N
---
<EOS>
no

"
returned
Wegg
,
shaking
his
head
at
once
observantly
,
thoughtfully
,
and
playfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
sir
!
<EOS>
That
's
not
your
expressive
countenance
which
asks
that
question

<EOS>
That
's
your
voice
;
merely
your
voice

<EOS>
To
proceed
.
<EOS>
On
a
certain
day
,
sir
,
I
happened
to
be
walking
in
the
yard
---
taking
my
lonely
round
---
for
in
the
words
of
a
friend
of
my
own
family
,
the
author
of
All
's
Well
arranged
as
a
duett
:
   
`
<EOS>
`
Deserted
,
as
you
will
remember
Mr.
Venus
,
by
the
waning
moon
,
  
When
stars
,
it
will
occur
to
you
before
I
mention
it
,
proclaim
night
's
cheerless
noon
,
  
<EOS>
On
tower
,
fort
,
or
tented
ground
,
  
The
sentry
walks
his
lonely
round
,
  
<EOS>
The
sentry
walks
:
"
"
 
---
under
those
circumstances
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
happened
to
be
walking
in
the
yard
early
one
afternoon
,
and
happened
to
have
an
iron
rod
in
my
hand
,
with
which
I
have
been
sometimes
accustomed
to
beguile
the
monotony
of
a
literary
life
,
when
I
struck
it
against
an
object
not
necessary
to
trouble
you
by
naming
---
"
  
"
It
is
necessary
.
<EOS>
What
object
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Venus
,
in
a
wrathful
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
Hear
me
out
!
"
said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Pump
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
When
I
struck
it
against
the
Pump
,
and
found
,
not
only
that
the
top
was
loose
and
opened
with
a
lid
,
but
that
something
in
it
rattled
.
<EOS>
That
something
,
comrade
,
I
discovered
to
be
a
small
flat
oblong
cash
-
box
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
say
it
was
disappintingly
light
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
were
papers
in
it
,
"
said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
your
expressive
countenance
speaks
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
paper
.
<EOS>
The
box
was
locked
,
tied
up
,
and
sealed
,
and
on
the
outside
was
a
parchment
label
,
with
the
writing
,
   
`
`
MY
WILL
,
JOHN
HARMON
,
TEMPORARILY
DEPOSITED
HERE

"
<EOS>
"
"
  
"
We
must
know
its
contents

said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
Hear
me
out

"
<EOS>
cried
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
so
,
and
I
broke
the
box
open
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Without
coming
to
me
!
"
exclaimed
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
so
,
sir
!
"
returned
Wegg
,
blandly
and
buoyantly
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
I
take
you
with
me
!
<EOS>
Hear
,
hear
,
hear
!
<EOS>
Resolved
,
as
your
discriminating
good
sense
perceives
,
that
if
you
was
to
have
a
sap
---
pur

<EOS>
IZE
,
it
should
be
a
complete
one
!
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
And
so
,
as
you
have
honored
me
by
anticipating
,
I
examined
the
document
.
<EOS>
Regularly
executed
,
regularly
witnessed
,
very
short
.
<EOS>
Inasmuch
as
he
has
never
made
friends
,
and
has
ever
had
a
rebellious
family
,
he
,
John
Harmon
,
gives
to
Nicodemus
Boffin
<EOS>
the
Little
Mound
,
which
is
quite
enough
for
him
,
and
gives
the
whole
rest
and
residue
of
his
property
to
the
Crown
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
date
of
the
will
that
has
been
proved
,
must
be
looked
to
,
"
 
remarked
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
later
than
this
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
---
Hear
me
out
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
so
.
<EOS>
I
paid
a
shilling
<EOS>
(
never
mind
your
sixpence
of
it
)
to
look
up
that
will
.
<EOS>
Brother
,
that
will
is
dated
months
before
this
will
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
a
fellow
-
man
,
and
as
a
partner
in
a
friendly
move
,
"
added
Wegg
,
benignantly
taking
him
by
both
hands
again
,
and
clapping
him
on
both
knees
again
,
"
say
have
I
completed
my
labour
of
love
to
your
perfect
satisfaction
,
and
are
you

IZED

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
contemplated
his
fellow
-
man
and
partner
with
doubting
eyes
,
and
then
rejoined
stiffly
:
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
great
news
indeed
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
denying
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
have
wished
you
had
told
it
me
before
you
got
your
fright
to
-
night
,
and
I
could
have
wished
you
had
ever
asked
me
as
your
partner
what
we
were
to
do
,
before
you
thought
you
were
dividing
a
responsibility
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
---
Hear
me
out
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
was
a
-
going
to
say
so
.
<EOS>
But
alone
I
bore
the
anxiety
,
and
alone
I
'll
bear
the
blame
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
with
an
air
of
great
magnanimity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
's
see
this
will
and
this
box
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
I
understand
,
brother
,
"
returned
Wegg
with
considerable
reluctance
,
"
that
it
is
your
wish
to
see
this
will
and
this
---
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
smote
the
table
with
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
Hear
me
out
!
"
said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
Hear
me
out
!
<EOS>
I
'll
go
and
fetch
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
being
some
time
absent
,
as
if
in
his
covetousness
he
could
hardly
make
up
his
mind
to
produce
the
treasure
to
his
partner
,
he
returned
with
an
old
leathern
hat
-
box
,
into
which
he
had
put
the
other
box
,
for
the
better
preservation
of
commonplace
appearances
,
and
for
the
disarming
of
suspicion
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
half
like
opening
it
here
,
"
said
Silas
in
a
low
voice
,
looking
around
:
"
he
might
come
back
,
he
may
not
be
gone
;
we
do
n't
know
what
he
may
be
up
to
,
after
what
we
've
seen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
something
in
that
,
"
assented
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
Come
to
my
place
.
"
  
<EOS>
Jealous
of
the
custody
of
the
box
,
and
yet
fearful
of
opening
it
under
the
existing
circumstances
,
Wegg
hesitated
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
I
tell
you
,
"
 
repeated
Venus
,
chafing
,
"
to
my
place
.
"
<EOS>
Not
very
well
seeing
his
way
to
a
refusal
,
Mr.
Wegg
then
rejoined
in
a
gush
,
"
---
Hear
me
out
!
 
<EOS>
---
Certainly
.
"
So
he
locked
up
the
Bower
and
they
set
forth
:
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
taking
his
arm
,
and
keeping
it
with
remarkable
tenacity
.
  
<EOS>
They
found
the
usual
dim
light
burning
in
the
window
of
Mr.
Venus
's
establishment
,
imperfectly
disclosing
to
the
public
the
usual
pair
of
preserved
frogs
,
sword
in
hand
,
with
their
point
of
honour
still
unsettled
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
had
closed
his
shop
door
on
coming
out
,
and
now
opened
it
with
the
key
and
shut
it
again
as
soon
as
they
were
within
;
but
not
before
he
had
put
up
and
barred
the
shutters
of
the
shop
window
.
<EOS>
"
No
one
can
get
in
without
being
let
in
,
"
said
he
then
,
"
and
we
could
n't
be
more
snug
than
here
.
<EOS>
"
So
he
raked
together
the
yet
warm
cinders
in
the
rusty
grate
,
and
made
a
fire
,
and
trimmed
the
candle
on
the
little
counter
.
<EOS>
As
the
fire
cast
its
flickering
gleams
here
and
there
upon
the
dark
greasy
walls
;
the
Hindoo
baby
,
the
African
baby
,
the
articulated
English
baby
,
the
assortment
of
skulls
,
and
the
rest
of
the
collection
,
came
starting
to
their
various
stations
as
if
they
had
all
been
out
,
like
their
master
,
and
were
punctual
in
a
general
rendezvous
to
assist
at
the
secret
.
<EOS>
The
French
gentleman
had
grown
considerably
since
Mr.
Wegg
last
saw
him
,
being
now
accommodated
with
a
pair
of
legs
and
a
head
,
though
his
arms
were
yet
in
abeyance
.
<EOS>
To
whomsoever
the
head
had
originally
belonged
,
Silas
Wegg
would
have
regarded
it
as
a
personal
favour
if
he
had
not
cut
quite
so
many
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
Silas
took
his
seat
in
silence
on
the
wooden
box
before
the
fire
,
and
Venus
dropping
into
his
low
chair
produced
from
among
his
skeleton
hands
,
his
tea
-
tray
and
tea
-
cups
,
and
put
the
kettle
on
.
<EOS>
Silas
inwardly
approved
of
these
preparations
,
trusting
they
might
end
in
Mr.
Venus
's
diluting
his
intellect
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
Venus
,
"
all
is
safe
and
quiet
.
<EOS>
Let
us
see
this
discovery
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
still
reluctant
hands
,
and
not
without
several
glances
towards
the
skeleton
hands
,
as
if
he
mistrusted
that
a
couple
of
them
might
spring
forth
and
clutch
the
document
,
Wegg
opened
the
hat
-
box
and
revealed
the
cash
-
box
,
opened
the
cash
-
box
and
revealed
the
will
.
<EOS>
He
held
a
corner
of
it
tight
,
while
Venus
,
taking
hold
of
another
corner
,
searchingly
and
attentively
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
I
correct
in
my
account
of
it
,
partner
?
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
at
length
.
  
<EOS>
"
Partner
,
you
were
,
"
said
Mr.
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
thereupon
made
an
easy
,
graceful
movement
,
as
though
he
would
fold
it
up
;
but
Mr.
Venus
held
on
by
his
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Venus
,
winking
his
weak
eyes
and
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
partner
.
<EOS>
The
question
is
now
brought
up
,
who
is
going
to
take
care
of
this
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
who
is
going
to
take
care
of
this
,
partner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
"
said
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
no
,
partner
,
"
retorted
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
I
am
.
<EOS>
Now
look
here
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
have
any
words
with
you
,
and
still
less
do
I
want
to
have
any
anatomical
pursuits
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
said
Wegg
,
quickly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
partner
,
"
replied
Venus
,
slowly
,
"
that
it
's
hardly
possible
for
a
man
to
feel
in
a
more
amiable
state
towards
another
man
than
I
do
towards
you
at
this
present
moment
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
on
my
own
ground
,
I
am
surrounded
by
the
trophies
of
my
art
,
and
my
tools
is
very
handy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Mr.
Venus
?
"
asked
Wegg
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
surrounded
,
as
I
have
observed
,
"
said
Mr.
Venus
,
placidly
,
"
by
the
trophies
of
my
art
.
<EOS>
They
are
numerous
,
my
stock
of
human
warious
is
large
,
the
shop
is
pretty
well
crammed
,
and
I
do
n't
just
now
want
any
more
trophies
of
my
art
.
<EOS>
But
I
like
my
art
,
and
I
know
how
to
exercise
my
art
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
man
better
,
"
assented
Mr.
Wegg
,
with
a
somewhat
staggered
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
Miscellanies
of
several
human
specimens
,
"
said
Venus
,
"
<EOS>
(
though
you
might
n't
think
it
)
in
the
box
on
which
you
're
sitting
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
Miscellanies
of
several
human
specimens
,
in
the
lovely
compo
-
one
behind
the
door
;
"
with
a
nod
towards
the
French
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
It
still
wants
a
pair
of
arms
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
that
I
'm
in
any
hurry
for
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
wandering
in
your
mind
,
partner
,
"
Silas
remonstrated
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
excuse
me
if
I
wander
,
"
returned
Venus
;
"
I
am
sometimes
rather
subject
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
like
my
art
,
and
I
know
how
to
exercise
my
art
,
and
I
mean
to
have
the
keeping
of
this
document
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
your
art
,
partner
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Wegg
,
in
an
insinuating
tone
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
winked
his
chronically
-
fatigued
eyes
both
at
once
,
and
adjusting
the
kettle
on
the
fire
,
remarked
to
himself
,
in
a
hollow
voice
,
"
She
'll
bile
in
a
couple
of
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
Wegg
glanced
at
the
kettle
,
glanced
at
the
shelves
,
glanced
at
the
French
gentleman
behind
the
door
,
and
shrank
a
little
as
he
glanced
at
Mr.
Venus
winking
his
red
eyes
,
and
feeling
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
---
as
for
a
lancet
,
say
---
with
his
unoccupied
hand
.
<EOS>
He
and
Venus
were
necessarily
seated
close
together
,
as
each
held
a
corner
of
the
document
,
which
was
but
a
common
sheet
of
paper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Partner
,
"
said
Wegg
,
even
more
insinuatingly
than
before
,
"
I
propose
that
we
cut
it
in
half
,
and
each
keep
a
half
.
"
  
<EOS>
Venus
shook
his
shock
of
hair
,
as
he
replied
,
"
It
would
n't
do
to
mutilate
it
,
partner
.
<EOS>
It
might
seem
to
be
cancelled
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Partner
,
"
said
Wegg
,
after
a
silence
,
during
which
they
had
contemplated
one
another
,
"
do
n't
your
speaking
countenance
say
that
you
're
a
-
going
to
suggest
a
middle
course
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Venus
shook
his
shock
of
hair
as
he
replied
,
"
Partner
,
you
have
kept
this
paper
from
me
once
.
<EOS>
You
shall
never
keep
it
from
me
again
.
<EOS>
I
offer
you
the
box
and
the
label
to
take
care
of
,
but
I
'll
take
care
of
the
paper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
hesitated
a
little
longer
,
and
then
suddenly
releasing
his
corner
,
and
resuming
his
buoyant
and
benignant
tone
,
exclaimed
,
"
What
's
life
without
trustfulness
!
<EOS>
What
's
a
fellow
-
man
without
honor
!
<EOS>
You
're
welcome
to
it
,
partner
,
in
a
spirit
of
trust
and
confidence
.
"
  
<EOS>
Continuing
to
wink
his
red
eyes
both
together
---
but
in
a
self
-
communing
way
,
and
without
any
show
of
triumph
---
Mr.
Venus
folded
the
paper
now
left
in
his
hand
,
and
locked
it
in
a
drawer
behind
him
,
and
pocketed
the
key
.
<EOS>
He
then
proposed
"
A
cup
of
tea
,
partner
?
"
<EOS>
To
which
Mr.
Wegg
returned
,
"
Thank'ee
,
partner
,
"
and
the
tea
was
made
and
poured
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Next
,
"
said
Venus
,
blowing
at
his
tea
in
his
saucer
,
and
looking
over
it
at
his
confidential
friend
,
"
comes
the
question
<EOS>
,
What
's
the
course
to
be
pursued
?
"
  
<EOS>
On
this
head
,
Silas
Wegg
had
much
to
say
.
<EOS>
Silas
had
to
say
That
,
he
would
beg
to
remind
his
comrade
,
brother
,
and
partner
,
of
the
impressive
passages
they
had
read
that
evening
;
of
the
evident
parallel
in
Mr.
Boffin
's
mind
between
them
and
the
late
owner
of
the
Bower
,
and
the
present
circumstances
of
the
Bower
;
of
the
bottle
;
 
and
of
the
box
.
<EOS>
That
,
the
fortunes
of
his
brother
and
comrade
,
and
of
himself
,
were
evidently
made
,
inasmuch
as
they
had
but
to
put
their
price
upon
this
document
,
and
get
that
price
from
the
minion
of
fortune
and
the
worm
of
the
hour
:
who
now
appeared
to
be
less
of
a
minion
and
more
of
a
worm
than
had
been
previously
supposed
.
<EOS>
That
,
he
considered
it
plain
that
such
price
was
stateable
in
a
single
expressive
word
,
and
that
the
word
was
,
"
Halves
!
"
<EOS>
That
,
the
question
then
arose
when
"
Halves
!
"
should
be
called
.
<EOS>
That
,
here
he
had
a
plan
of
action
to
recommend
,
with
a
conditional
clause
.
<EOS>
That
,
the
plan
of
action
was
that
they
should
lie
by
with
patience
;
 
that
,
they
should
allow
the
Mounds
to
be
gradually
levelled
and
cleared
away
,
while
retaining
to
themselves
their
present
opportunity
of
watching
the
process
---
which
would
be
,
he
conceived
,
to
put
the
trouble
and
cost
of
daily
digging
and
delving
upon
somebody
else
,
while
they
might
nightly
turn
such
complete
disturbance
of
the
dust
to
the
account
of
their
own
private
investigations
---
and
that
,
when
the
Mounds
were
gone
,
and
they
had
worked
those
chances
for
their
own
joint
benefit
solely
,
they
should
then
,
and
not
before
,
explode
on
the
minion
and
worm
.
<EOS>
But
here
came
the
conditional
clause
,
and
to
this
he
entreated
the
special
attention
of
his
comrade
,
brother
,
and
partner
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
borne
that
the
minion
and
worm
should
carry
off
any
of
that
property
which
was
now
to
be
regarded
as
their
own
property
.
<EOS>
When
he
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
had
seen
the
minion
surreptitiously
making
off
with
that
bottle
,
and
its
precious
contents
unknown
,
he
had
looked
upon
him
in
the
light
of
a
mere
robber
,
and
,
as
such
,
would
have
despoiled
him
of
his
ill
-
gotten
gain
,
but
for
the
judicious
interference
of
his
comrade
,
brother
,
and
partner
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
the
conditional
clause
he
proposed
was
,
that
,
if
the
minion
should
return
in
his
late
sneaking
manner
,
and
if
,
being
closely
watched
,
he
should
be
found
to
possess
himself
of
anything
,
no
matter
what
,
the
sharp
sword
impending
over
his
head
should
be
instantly
shown
him
,
he
should
be
strictly
examined
as
to
what
he
knew
or
suspected
,
should
be
severely
handled
by
them
his
masters
,
and
should
be
kept
in
a
state
of
abject
moral
bondage
and
slavery
until
the
time
when
they
should
see
fit
to
permit
him
to
purchase
his
freedom
at
the
price
of
half
his
possessions
.
<EOS>
If
said
Mr.
Wegg
by
way
of
peroration
,
he
had
erred
in
saying
only
"
Halves
!
"
<EOS>
he
trusted
to
his
comrade
,
brother
,
and
partner
not
to
hesitate
to
set
him
right
,
and
to
reprove
his
weakness
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
more
according
to
the
rights
of
things
,
to
say
Twothirds
;
 
it
might
be
more
according
to
the
rights
of
things
,
to
say
Three
-
fourths
.
<EOS>
On
those
points
he
was
ever
open
to
correction
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
having
wafted
his
attention
to
this
discourse
over
three
successive
saucers
of
tea
,
signified
his
concurrence
in
the
views
advanced
.
<EOS>
Inspirited
hereby
,
Mr.
Wegg
extended
his
right
hand
,
and
declared
it
to
be
a
hand
which
never
yet
.
<EOS>
Without
entering
into
more
minute
particulars
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
sticking
to
his
tea
,
briefly
professed
his
belief
,
as
polite
forms
required
of
him
,
that
it
was
a
hand
which
never
yet
.
<EOS>
But
contented
himself
with
looking
at
it
,
and
did
not
take
it
to
his
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
Brother
,
"
said
Wegg
,
when
this
happy
understanding
was
established
,
"
I
should
like
to
ask
you
something
.
<EOS>
You
remember
the
night
when
I
first
looked
in
here
,
and
found
you
floating
your
powerful
mind
in
tea
?
"
  
<EOS>
Still
swilling
tea
,
Mr.
Venus
nodded
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
you
sit
,
sir
,
"
pursued
Wegg
with
an
sir
of
thoughtful
admiration
,
"
as
if
you
had
never
left
off
!
<EOS>
There
you
sit
,
sir
,
as
if
you
had
an
unlimited
capacity
of
assimilating
the
flagrant
article
!
<EOS>
There
you
sit
,
sir
,
in
the
midst
of
your
works
,
looking
as
if
you
'd
been
called
upon
for
Home
,
Sweet
Home
,
and
was
obleeging
the
company
!
   
<EOS>
"
`
`
A
exile
from
home
splendour
dazzles
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
O
give
you
your
lowly
Preparations
again
,
  
The
birds
stuffed
so
sweetly
that
ca
n't
be
expected
to
come
at
your
call
,
  
Give
you
these
with
the
peace
of
mind
dearer

<EOS>
Home

Home

Home

sweet
Home
!
"
<EOS>
"
"
 
---
Be
it
ever
,
"
added
Mr.
Wegg
in
prose
as
he
glanced
about
the
shop
,
"
<EOS>
ever
so
ghastly
,
all
things
considered
there
's
no
place
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
you
'd
like
to
ask
something
;
but
you
have
n't
asked
it
,
"
 
remarked
Venus
,
very
unsympathetic
in
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
peace
of
mind
,
"
said
Wegg
,
offering
condolence
,
"
your
peace
of
mind
was
in
a
poor
way
that
night
.
<EOS>
How
's
it
going
on
?
<EOS>
Is
it
looking
up
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
does
not
wish
,
"
replied
Mr.
Venus
with
a
comical
mixture
of
indignant
obstinacy
and
tender
melancholy
,
"
to
regard
herself
,
nor
yet
to
be
regarded
,
in
that
particular
light
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
more
to
be
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
dear
me
,
dear
me
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Wegg
with
a
sigh
,
but
eyeing
him
while
pretending
to
keep
him
company
in
eyeing
the
fire
,
"
such
is
Woman
!
<EOS>
And
I
remember
you
said
that
night
,
sitting
there
as
I
sat
here
---
said
that
night
when
your
peace
of
mind
was
first
laid
low
,
that
you
had
taken
an
interest
in
these
very
affairs
.
<EOS>
Such
is
coincidence
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
father
,
"
rejoined
Venus
,
and
then
stopped
to
swallow
more
tea
,
"
her
father
was
mixed
up
in
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
mention
her
name
,
sir
,
I
think

observed
Wegg
,
pensively
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
you
did
n't
mention
her
name
that
night
.
<EOS>

Pleasant

<EOS>

In

cried
Wegg

"
<EOS>
Pleasant
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
There
's
some
thing
moving
in
the
name
.
<EOS>
Pleasant
.
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
Seems
to
express
what
she
might
have
been
,
if
she
had
n't
made
that
unpleasant
remark
---
and
what
she
ai
n't
,
in
consequence
of
having
made
it
.
<EOS>
Would
it
at
all
pour
balm
into
your
wounds
,
Mr.
Venus
,
to
inquire
how
you
came
acquainted
with
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
down
at
the
water
-
side
,
"
said
Venus
,
taking
another
gulp
of
tea
and
mournfully
winking
at
the
fire
---
"
looking
for
parrots
"
---
  
taking
another
gulp
and
stopping
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
hinted
,
to
jog
his
attention
:
"
You
could
hardly
have
been
out
parrot
-
shooting
,
in
the
British
climate
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
,
"
said
Venus
fretfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
down
at
the
waterside
,
looking
for
parrots
brought
home
by
sailors
,
to
buy
for
stuffing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
ay
,
sir
!
"
  
"
---
And
looking
for
a
nice
pair
of
rattlesnakes
,
to
articulate
for
a
Museum
---
when
I
was
doomed
to
fail
in
with
her
and
deal
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
at
the
time
of
that
discovery
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
Her
father
had
seen
the
discovery
being
towed
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
made
the
popularity
of
the
subject
a
reason
for
going
back
to
improve
the
acquaintance
,
and
I
have
never
since
been
the
man
I
was
.
<EOS>
My
very
bones
is
rendered
flabby
by
brooding
over
it
.
<EOS>
If
they
could
be
brought
to
me
loose
,
to
sort
,
I
should
hardly
have
the
face
to
claim
'em
as
mine
.
<EOS>
to
such
an
extent
have
I
fallen
off
under
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
less
interested
than
he
had
been
,
glanced
at
one
particular
shelf
in
the
dark
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
I
remember
,
Mr.
Venus
,
"
he
said
in
a
tone
of
friendly
commiseration
"
(
for
I
remember
every
word
that
falls
from
you
,
sir
)
,
<EOS>
I
remember
that
you
said
that
night
,
you
had
got
up
there
---
and
then
your
words
was
,
`
`
Never
mind
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
"
---
The
parrot
that
I
bought
of
her
,
"
said
Venus
,
with
a
despondent
rise
and
fall
of
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
there
it
lies
on
its
side
,
dried
up
;
 
except
for
its
plumage
,
very
like
myself
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
had
the
heart
to
prepare
it
,
and
I
never
shall
have
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
disappointed
face
,
Silas
mentally
consigned
this
parrot
to
regions
more
than
tropical
,
and
seeming
for
the
time
to
have
lost
his
power
of
assuming
an
interest
in
the
woes
of
Mr.
Venus
,
fell
to
tightening
his
wooden
leg
as
a
preparation
for
departure
;
its
gymnastic
performances
of
that
evening
having
severely
tried
its
constitution
.
  
<EOS>
After
Silas
had
left
the
shop
,
hat
-
box
in
hand
,
and
had
left
Mr.
Venus
to
lower
himself
to
oblivion
-
point
with
the
requisite
weight
of
tea
,
it
greatly
preyed
on
his
ingenuous
mind
that
he
had
taken
this
artist
into
partnership
at
all
.
<EOS>
He
bitterly
felt
that
he
had
overreached
himself
in
the
beginning
,
by
grasping
at
Mr.
Venus
's
mere
straws
of
hints
,
now
shown
to
be
worthless
for
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
Casting
about
for
ways
and
means
of
dissolving
the
connexion
without
loss
of
money
,
reproaching
himself
for
having
been
betrayed
into
an
avowal
of
his
secret
,
and
complimenting
himself
beyond
measure
on
his
purely
accidental
good
luck
,
he
beguiled
the
distance
between
Clerkenwell
and
the
mansion
of
the
Golden
Dustman
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
Silas
Wegg
felt
it
to
be
quite
out
of
the
question
that
he
could
lay
his
head
upon
his
pillow
in
peace
,
without
first
hovering
over
Mr.
Boffin
's
house
in
the
superior
character
of
its
Evil
Genius
.
<EOS>
Power
(
unless
it
be
the
power
of
intellect
or
virtue
)
has
ever
the
greatest
attraction
for
the
lowest
natures
;
and
the
mere
defiance
of
the
unconscious
house
-
front
,
with
his
power
to
strip
the
roof
off
the
inhabiting
family
like
the
roof
of
a
house
of
cards
,
was
a
treat
which
had
a
charm
for
Silas
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
hovered
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
exulting
,
the
carriage
drove
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
'll
shortly
be
an
end
of
you
,
"
said
Wegg
,
threatening
it
with
the
hat
-
box
.
<EOS>
"
Your
,
varnish
is
fading
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
descended
and
went
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
out
for
a
fall
,
my
Lady
Dustwoman
,
"
said
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
lightly
descended
,
and
ran
in
after
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
brisk
we
are
!
"
said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
run
so
gaily
to
your
old
shabby
home
,
my
girl
.
<EOS>
You
'll
have
to
go
there
,
though
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
while
,
and
the
Secretary
came
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
passed
over
for
you
,
"
said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
had
better
provide
yourself
with
another
situation
,
young
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
's
shadow
passed
upon
the
blinds
of
three
large
windows
as
he
trotted
down
the
room
,
and
passed
again
as
he
went
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yoop
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
there
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
Where
's
the
bottle
?
<EOS>
You
would
give
your
bottle
for
my
box
,
Dustman
!
"
  
<EOS>
Having
now
composed
his
mind
for
slumber
,
he
turned
homeward
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
greed
of
the
fellow
,
that
his
mind
had
shot
beyond
halves
,
two
-
thirds
,
three
-
fourths
,
and
gone
straight
to
spoliation
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
"
Though
that
would
n't
quite
do
,
"
he
considered
,
growing
cooler
as
he
got
away
.
"
That
's
what
would
happen
to
him
if
he
did
n't
buy
us
up
.
<EOS>
We
should
get
nothing
by
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
We
so
judge
others
by
ourselves
,
that
it
had
never
come
into
his
head
before
,
that
he
might
not
buy
us
up
,
and
might
prove
honest
,
and
prefer
to
be
poor
.
<EOS>
It
caused
him
a
slight
tremor
as
it
passed
;
 
but
a
very
slight
one
,
for
the
idle
thought
was
gone
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
grown
too
fond
of
money
for
that
,
"
said
Wegg
;
"
he
's
grown
too
fond
of
money
.
<EOS>
"
The
burden
fell
into
a
strain
or
tune
as
he
stumped
along
the
pavements
.
<EOS>
All
the
way
home
he
stumped
it
out
of
the
rattling
streets
,
piano
with
his
own
foot
,
and
forte
with
his
wooden
leg
,
"
He
's
GROWN
too
FOND
of
MONEY
for
THAT
,
he
's
GROWN
too
FOND
of
MONEY
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Even
next
day
Silas
soothed
himself
with
this
melodious
strain
,
when
he
was
called
out
of
bed
at
daybreak
,
to
set
open
the
yard
-
gate
and
admit
the
train
of
carts
and
horses
that
came
to
carry
off
the
little
Mound
.
<EOS>
And
all
day
long
,
as
he
kept
unwinking
watch
on
the
slow
process
which
promised
to
protract
itself
through
many
days
and
weeks
,
whenever
(
to
save
himself
from
being
choked
with
dust
)
<EOS>
he
patrolled
a
little
cinderous
beat
he
established
for
the
purpose
,
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
diggers
,
he
still
stumped
to
the
tune
:
"
He
's
GROWN
too
FOND
of
MONEY
for
THAT
,
he
's
GROWN
too
FOND
of
MONEY
.
   
<EOS>
THE
END
OF
A
LONG
JOURNEY
.
 
<EOS>
The
train
of
carts
and
horses
came
and
went
all
day
from
dawn
to
nightfall
,
making
little
or
no
daily
,
impression
on
the
heap
of
ashes
,
though
,
as
the
days
passed
on
,
the
heap
was
seen
to
be
slowly
melting
.
<EOS>
My
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honorable
boards
,
when
you
in
the
course
of
your
dust
-
shovelling
and
cinder
-
raking
have
piled
up
a
mountain
of
pretentious
failure
,
you
must
off
with
your
honorable
coats
for
the
removal
of
it
,
and
fall
to
the
work
with
the
power
of
all
the
queen
's
horses
and
all
the
queen
's
men
,
or
it
will
come
rushing
down
and
bury
us
alive
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
verily
,
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honorable
boards
,
adapting
your
Catechism
to
the
occasion
,
and
by
God
's
help
so
you
must
.
<EOS>
For
when
we
have
got
things
to
the
pass
that
with
an
enormous
treasure
at
disposal
to
relieve
the
poor
,
the
best
of
the
poor
detest
our
mercies
,
hide
their
heads
from
us
,
and
shame
us
by
starving
to
death
in
the
midst
of
us
,
it
is
a
pass
impossible
of
prosperity
,
impossible
of
continuance
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
so
written
in
the
Gospel
according
to
Podsnappery
;
you
may
not
"
find
these
words
"
for
the
text
of
a
sermon
,
in
the
Returns
of
the
Board
of
Trade
;
but
they
have
been
the
truth
since
the
foundations
of
the
universe
were
laid
,
and
they
will
be
the
truth
until
the
foundations
of
the
universe
are
shaken
by
the
Builder
.
<EOS>
This
boastful
handiwork
of
ours
,
which
fails
in
its
terrors
for
the
professional
pauper
,
the
sturdy
breaker
of
windows
and
the
rampant
tearer
of
clothes
,
strikes
with
a
cruel
and
a
wicked
stab
at
the
stricken
sufferer
,
and
is
a
horror
to
the
deserving
and
unfortunate
.
<EOS>
We
must
mend
it
,
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honorable
boards
,
or
in
its
own
evil
hour
it
will
mar
every
one
of

<EOS>
Old
Betty
Higden
fared
upon
her
pilgrimage
as
many
ruggedly
honest
creatures
,
women
and
men
,
fare
on
their
toiling
way
along
the
roads
of
life
.
<EOS>
Patiently
to
earn
a
spare
bare
living
,
and
quietly
to
die
,
untouched
by
workhouse
hands
---
this
was
her
highest
sublunary
hope
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
had
been
heard
of
her
at
Mr.
Boffin
's
house
since
she
trudged
off
.
<EOS>
The
weather
had
been
hard
and
the
roads
had
been
bad
,
and
her
spirit
was
up
.
<EOS>
A
less
stanch
spirit
might
have
been
subdued
by
such
adverse
influences
;
but
the
loan
for
her
little
outfit
was
in
no
part
repaid
,
and
it
had
gone
worse
with
her
than
she
had
foreseen
,
and
she
was
put
upon
proving
her
case
and
maintaining
her
independence
.
  
<EOS>
Faithful
soul
!
<EOS>
When
she
had
spoken
to
the
Secretary
of
that
"
deadness
that
steals
over
me
at
times
,
"
her
fortitude
had
made
too
little
of
it
.
<EOS>
Oftener
and
ever
oftener
<EOS>
,
it
came
stealing
over
her
;
 
darker
and
ever
darker
,
like
the
shadow
of
advancing
Death
.
<EOS>
That
the
shadow
should
be
deep
as
it
came
on
,
like
the
shadow
of
an
actual
presence
,
was
in
accordance
with
the
laws
o
the
physical
world
,
for
all
the
Light
that
shone
on
Betty
Higden
lay
beyond
Death
.
  
<EOS>
The
poor
old
creature
had
taken
the
upward
course
of
the
river
Thames
as
her
general
track
;
it
was
the
track
in
which
her
last
home
lay
,
and
of
which
she
had
last
had
local
love
and
knowledge
.
<EOS>
She
had
hovered
for
a
little
while
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
her
abandoned
dwelling
,
and
had
sold
,
and
knitted
and
sold
,
and
gone
on
.
<EOS>
In
the
pleasant
towns
of
Chertsey
,
Walton
,
Kingston
,
and
Staines
,
her
figure
came
to
be
quite
well
known
for
some
short
weeks
,
and
then
again
passed
on
.
  
<EOS>
She
would
take
her
stand
in
market
-
places
,
where
there
were
such
things
,
on
market
days
;
at
other
times
,
in
the
busiest
(
that
was
seldom
very
busy
)
portion
of
the
little
quiet
High
Street
;
at
still
other
times
she
would
explore
the
outlying
roads
for
great
houses
,
and
would
ask
leave
at
the
Lodge
to
pass
in
with
her
basket
,
and
would
not
often
get
it
.
<EOS>
But
ladies
in
carriages
would
frequently
make
purchases
from
her
trifling
stock
,
and
were
usually
pleased
with
her
bright
eyes
and
her
hopeful
speech
.
<EOS>
In
these
and
her
clean
dress
originated
a
fable
that
she
was
well
to
do
in
the
world
:
one
might
say
,
for
her
station
,
rich
.
<EOS>
As
making
a
comfortable
provision
for
its
subject
which
costs
nobody
anything
,
this
class
of
fable
has
long
been
popular
.
  
<EOS>
In
those
pleasant
little
towns
on
Thames
,
you
may
hear
the
fall
of
the
water
over
the
weirs
,
or
even
,
in
still
weather
,
the
rustle
of
the
rushes
;
and
from
the
bridge
you
may
see
the
the
young
river
,
dimpled
like
a
young
child
,
playfully
gliding
away
among
the
trees
,
unpolluted
by
the
defilements
that
lie
in
wait
for
it
on
its
course
,
and
as
yet
out
of
hearing
of
the
deep
summons
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
It
were
too
much
to
pretend
that
Betty
Higden
made
out
such
thoughts
;
no
;
 
but
she
heard
the
tender
river
whispering
to
many
like
herself
,
"
Come
to
me
,
come
to
me
!
<EOS>
When
the
cruel
shame
and
terror
you
have
so
long
fled
from
,
most
beset
you
,
come
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
am
the
Relieving
Officer
appointed
by
eternal
ordinance
to
do
my
work
;
I
am
not
held
in
estimation
according
as
I
shirk
it
.
<EOS>
My
breast
is
softer
than
the
pauper
-
nurse
's
;
death
in
my
arms
is
peacefuller
than
among
the
pauper
-
wards
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
abundant
place
for
gentler
fancies
too
,
in
her
untutored
mind
.
<EOS>
Those
gentlefolks
and
their
children
inside
those
fine
houses
,
could
they
think
,
as
they
looked
out
at
her
,
what
it
was
to
be
really
hungry
,
really
cold
?
<EOS>
Did
they
feel
any
of
the
wonder
about
her
,
that
she
felt
about
them
?
<EOS>
Bless
the
dear
laughing
children
!
<EOS>
If
they
could
have
seen
sick
Johnny
in
her
arms
,
would
they
have
cried
for
pity
?
<EOS>
If
they
could
have
seen
dead
Johnny
on
that
little
bed
,
would
they
have
understood
it
?
<EOS>
Bless
the
dear
children
for
his
sake
,
<EOS>
any
how
!
<EOS>
So
with
the
humbler
houses
in
the
little
street
,
the
inner
firelight
shining
on
the
panes
as
the
outer
twilight
darkened
.
<EOS>
When
the
families
gathered
in
-
doors
there
,
for
the
night
,
it
was
only
a
foolish
fancy
to
feel
as
if
it
were
a
little
hard
in
them
to
close
the
shutter
and
blacken
the
flame
.
<EOS>
So
with
the
lighted
shops
,
and
speculations
whether
their
masters
and
mistresses
taking
tea
in
a
perspective
of
back
-
parlour
---
not
so
far
within
but
that
the
flavour
of
tea
and
toast
came
out
,
mingled
with
the
glow
of
light
,
into
the
street
---
ate
or
drank
or
wore
what
they
sold
,
with
the
greater
relish
because
they
dealt
in
it
.
<EOS>
So
with
the
churchyard
on
a
branch
of
the
solitary
way
to
the
night
's
sleeping
-
place
.
"
Ah
me
!
<EOS>
The
dead
<EOS>
and
I
seem
to
have
it
pretty
much
to
ourselves
in
the
dark
and
in
this
weather
!
<EOS>
But
so
much
the
better
for
all
who
are
warmly
housed
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
poor
soul
envied
no
one
in
bitterness
,
and
grudged
no
one
anything
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
old
abhorrence
grew
stronger
on
her
as
she
grew
weaker
,
and
it
found
more
sustaining
food
than
she
did
in
her
wanderings
.
<EOS>
Now
,
she
would
light
upon
the
shameful
spectacle
of
some
desolate
creature
---
or
some
wretched
ragged
groups
of
either
sex
,
or
of
both
sexes
,
with
children
among
them
,
huddled
together
like
the
smaller
vermin
for
a
little
warmth
---
lingering
and
lingering
on
a
doorstep
,
while
the
appointed
evader
of
the
public
trust
did
his
dirty
office
of
trying
to
weary
them
out
and
so
get
rid
of
them
.
<EOS>
Now
,
she
would
light
upon
some
poor
decent
person
,
like
herself
,
going
afoot
on
a
pilgrimage
of
many
weary
miles
to
see
some
worn
-
out
relative
or
friend
who
had
been
charitably
clutched
off
to
a
great
blank
barren
Union
House
,
as
far
from
old
home
as
the
County
Jail
the
remoteness
of
which
is
always
its
worst
punishment
for
small
rural
offenders
)
,
and
in
its
dietary
,
and
in
its
lodging
,
and
in
its
tending
of
the
sick
,
a
much
more
penal
establishment
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
would
hear
a
newspaper
read
out
,
and
would
learn
how
the
Registrar
General
cast
up
the
units
that
had
within
the
last
week
died
of
want
and
of
exposure
to
the
weather
:
for
which
that
Recording
Angel
seemed
to
have
a
regular
fixed
place
in
his
sum
,
as
if
they
were
its
halfpence
.
<EOS>
All
such
things
she
would
hear
discussed
,
as
we
,
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honorable
boards
,
in
our
unapproachable
magnificence
never
hear
them
,
and
from
all
such
things
she
would
fly
with
the
wings
of
raging
Despair
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
not
to
be
received
as
a
figure
of
speech
.
<EOS>
Old
Betty
Higden
however
tired
,
however
footsore
,
would
start
up
and
be
driven
away
by
her
awakened
horror
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
Charity
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
remarkable
Christian
improvement
,
to
have
made
a
pursuing
Fury
of
the
Good
Samaritan
;
but
it
was
so
in
this
case
,
and
it
is
a
type
of
many
,
many
,
many
.
  
<EOS>
Two
incidents
united
to
intensify
the
old
unreasoning
abhorrence
---
granted
in
a
previous
place
to
be
unreasoning
,
because
the
people
always
are
unreasoning
,
and
invariably
make
a
point
of
producing
all
their
smoke
without
fire
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
she
was
sitting
in
a
market
-
place
on
a
bench
outside
an
inn
,
with
her
little
wares
for
sale
,
when
the
deadness
that
she
strove
against
came
over
her
so
heavily
that
the
scene
departed
from
before
her
eyes
;
when
it
returned
,
she
found
herself
on
the
ground
,
her
head
supported
by
some
good
-
natured
market
-
women
,
and
a
little
crowd
about
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
better
now
,
mother
?
"
asked
one
of
the
women
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
you
can
do
nicely
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
I
been
ill
then
?
<EOS>
"
asked
old
Betty
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
a
faint
like
,
"
was
the
answer
,
"
or
a
fit
.
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
that
you
've
been
a
-
struggling
,
mother
,
but
you
've
been
stiff
and
numbed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Betty
,
recovering
her
memory
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
numbness
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
It
comes
over
me
at
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Was
it
gone
?
<EOS>
the
women
asked
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
gone
now
,
"
said
Betty
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
stronger
than
I
was
afore
.
<EOS>
Many
thanks
to
ye
,
my
dears
,
and
when
you
come
to
be
as
old
as
I
am
,
may
others
do
as
much
for
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
assisted
her
to
rise
,
but
she
could
not
stand
yet
,
and
they
supported
her
when
she
sat
down
again
upon
the
bench
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
head
's
a
bit
light
,
and
my
feet
are
a
bit
heavy
,
"
said
old
Betty
,
leaning
her
face
drowsily
on
the
breast
of
the
woman
who
had
spoken
before
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
both
come
nat'ral
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
more
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
her
,
"
said
some
farmers
standing
by
,
who
had
come
out
from
their
market
-
dinner
,
"
who
belongs
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
there
any
folks
belonging
to
you
,
mother
?
"
said
the
woman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
sure
,
"
answered
Betty
.
<EOS>
"
I
heerd
the
gentleman
say
it
,
but
I
could
n't
answer
quick
enough
.
<EOS>
There
's
plenty
belonging
to
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
ye
fear
for
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
are
any
of
'em
near
here
?
"
said
the
men
's
voices
;
the
women
's
voices
chiming
in
when
it
was
said
,
and
prolonging
the
strain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
near
enough
,
"
said
Betty
,
rousing
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ye
be
afeard
for
me
,
neighbours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
not
fit
to
travel
.
<EOS>
Where
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
next
compassionate
chorus
she
heard
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
going
to
London
when
I
've
sold
out
all
,
"
said
Betty
,
rising
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
right
good
friends
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
want
for
nothing

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
Thankye

<EOS>
Do

afeard

"
  
<EOS>
A
well
-
meaning
bystander
,
yellow
-
legginged
and
purple
-
faced
,
said
hoarsely
over
his
red
comforter
,
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
,
that
she
"
ought
n't
to
be
let
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
the
Lord
's
love
do
n't
meddle
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
old
Betty
,
all
her
fears
crowding
on
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
well
now
,
and
I
must
go
this
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
caught
up
her
basket
as
she
spoke
and
was
making
as
unsteady
rush
away
from
them
,
when
the
same
bystander
checked
her
with
his
hand
on
her
sleeve
,
and
urged
her
to
come
with
him
and
see
the
parish
-
doctor
.
<EOS>
Strengthening
herself
by
the
utmost
exercise
of
her
resolution
,
the
poor
trembling
creature
shook
him
off
,
almost
fiercely
,
and
took
to
flight
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
feel
safe
until
she
had
set
a
mile
or
two
of
by
-
road
between
herself
and
the
market
-
place
,
and
had
crept
into
a
copse
,
like
a
hunted
animal
,
to
hide
and
recover
breath
.
<EOS>
Not
until
then
for
the
first
time
did
she
venture
to
recall
how
she
had
looked
over
her
shoulder
before
turning
out
of
the
town
,
and
had
seen
the
sign
of
the
White
Lion
hanging
across
the
road
,
and
the
fluttering
market
booths
,
and
the
old
grey
church
,
and
the
little
crowd
gazing
after
her
but
not
attempting
to
follow
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
frightening
incident
was
this
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
again
as
bad
,
and
had
been
for
some
days
better
,
and
was
travelling
along
by
a
part
of
the
road
where
it
touched
the
river
,
and
in
wet
seasons
was
so
often
overflowed
by
it
that
there
were
tall
white
posts
set
up
to
mark
the
way
.
<EOS>
A
barge
was
being
towed
towards
her
,
and
she
sat
down
on
the
bank
to
rest
and
watch
it
.
<EOS>
As
the
tow
-
rope
was
slackened
by
a
turn
of
the
stream
and
dipped
into
the
water
,
such
a
confusion
stole
into
her
mind
that
she
thought
she
saw
the
forms
of
her
dead
children
and
dead
grandchildren
peopling
the
barge
,
and
waving
their
hands
to
her
in
solemn
measure
;
then
,
as
the
rope
tightened
and
came
up
,
dropping
diamonds
,
it
seemed
to
vibrate
into
two
parallel
ropes
and
strike
her
,
with
a
twang
,
though
it
was
far
off
.
<EOS>
When
she
looked
again
,
there
was
no
barge
,
no
river
,
no
daylight
,
and
a
man
whom
she
had
never
before
seen
held
a
candle
close
to
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Missis
,
"
said
he
;
"
where
did
you
come
from
and
where
are
you
going
to
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
poor
soul
confusedly
asked
the
counter
-
question
where
she
was
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
Lock
,
"
said
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Lock
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
Deputy
Lock
,
on
job
,
and
this
is
the
Lock
-
house
.
<EOS>
(
Lock
or
Deputy
Lock
,
it
's
all
one
,
while
the
t'other
man
's
in
the
hospital
.
)
<EOS>
What
's
your
Parish
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Parish
!
"
<EOS>
She
was
up
from
the
truckle
-
bed
directly
,
wildly
feeling
about
her
for
her
basket
,
and
gazing
at
him
in
affright
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
asked
the
question
down
town
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
They
wo
n't
let
you
be
more
than
a
Casual
there
.
<EOS>
They
'll
pass
you
on
to
your
settlement
Missis

with
all
speed

You

"
  
<EOS>
"
'
Twas
the
deadness
again
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Betty
Higden
,
with
her
hand
to
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
deadness
,
there
's
not
a
doubt
about
it
,
"
returned
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
the
deadness
was
a
mild
word
for
it
,
if
it
had
been
named
to
me
when
we
brought
you
in

up

said
the
Deputy
Lock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have

"
  
<EOS>
"
Just

<EOS>
"
Sure

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

"
said
the
Deputy
Lock
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
shaking
his
head
in
a
sulkily
ominous
manner
,
"
the
parish
authorities
down
town
will
have
it
out
of
you

if
you
go

pursued
the
Deputy
,
"
for
your
relief

"
  
"
Stop
a
bit

said
the
Deputy
,
striking
in
between
her
and
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Why
are
you
all
of
a
shake

what
's
your

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Oh

Master

Master

returned
Betty
Higden
,
"
I
've
fought
against
the
Parish

fled
from

all
my
life

I
want
to
die
free
of
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know

said
the
Deputy
,
with
deliberation
,
"
as
I
ought

let

go

<EOS>
I
'm
a
honest

gets
my

sweat

by

I
know
what

it

careful

<EOS>
You

be
took
with
your

again

half
a
mile
off

half
of
half
a
quarter

for
the

then
it

be
asked

Why
did
that
there
honest
Deputy
Lock

let
her
go

instead

putting
her
safe
with
the
Parish

<EOS>
That

what

his
character

have
done

it
would
be
argueyfied

said
the
Deputy
Lock

cunningly
harping
on
the
strong
string
of
her
terror
;
"
he
ought
to
have
handed
her
over
safe

the

That

<EOS>
As
he
stood
in
the
doorway
,
the
poor
old
careworn
wayworn
woman
burst
into
tears
,
and
clasped
her
hands
,
as
if
in
a
very
agony
she
prayed
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
've
told
you
,
Master
,
I
've
the
best
of
friends
.
<EOS>
This
letter
will
show
how
true
I
spoke
,
and
they
will
be
thankful
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Deputy
Lock
opened
the
letter
with
a
grave
face
,
which
underwent
no
change
as
he
eyed
its
contents
.
<EOS>
But
it
might
have
done
,
if
he
could
have
read
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
amount
of
small
change
,
Missis
,
"
he
said
,
with
an
abstracted
air
,
after
a
little
meditation
,
"
might
you
call
a
morsel
of
money
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hurriedly
emptying
her
pocket
,
old
Betty
laid
down
on
the
table
,
a
shilling
,
and
two
sixpenny
pieces
,
and
a
few
pence
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
to
let
you
go
instead
of
handing
you
over
safe
to
the
Parish
,
"
said
the
Deputy
,
counting
the
money
with
his
eyes
,
"
might
it
be
your
own
free
wish
to
leave
that
there
behind
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Take
it
,
Master
,
take
it
,
and
welcome
and
thankful
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
man
,
"
said
the
Deputy
,
giving
her
back
the
letter
,
and
pocketing
the
coins
,
one
by
one
,
"
as
earns
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
;
"
here
he
drew
his
sleeve
across
his
forehead
,
as
if
this
particular
portion
of
his
humble
gains
were
the
result
of
sheer
hard
labour
and
virtuous
industry
;
"
and
I
wo
n't
stand
in
your
way
.
<EOS>
Go
where
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
gone
out
of
the
Lock
-
house
as
soon
as
he
gave
her
this
permission
,
and
her
tottering
steps
were
on
the
road
again
.
<EOS>
But
,
afraid
to
go
back
and
afraid
to
go
forward
;
seeing
what
she
fled
from
,
in
the
sky
-
glare
of
the
lights
of
the
little
town
before
her
,
and
leaving
a
confused
horror
of
it
everywhere
behind
her
,
as
if
she
had
escaped
it
in
every
stone
of
every
market
-
place
;
she
struck
of
by
side
ways
,
among
which
she
got
bewildered
and
lost
.
<EOS>
That
night
she
took
refuge
from
the
Samaritan
in
his
latest
accredited
form
,
under
a
farmer
's
rick
;
and
if
---
worth
thinking
of
,
perhaps
,
my
fellow
-
Christians
---
the
Samaritan
had
in
the
lonely
night
,
"
passed
by
on
the
other
side
,
"
she
would
have
most
devoutly
thanked
High
Heaven
for
her
escape
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
found
her
afoot
again
,
but
fast
declining
as
to
the
clearness
of
her
thoughts
,
though
not
as
to
the
steadiness
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
Comprehending
that
her
strength
was
quitting
her
,
and
that
the
struggle
of
her
life
was
almost
ended
,
she
could
neither
reason
out
the
means
of
getting
back
to
her
protectors
,
nor
even
form
the
idea
.
<EOS>
The
overmastering
dread
,
and
the
proud
stubborn
resolution
it
engendered
in
her
to
die
undegraded
,
were
the
two
distinct
impressions
left
in
her
failing
mind
.
<EOS>
Supported
only
by
a
sense
that
she
was
bent
on
conquering
in
her
life
-
long
fight
,
she
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
The
time
was
come
,
now
,
when
the
wants
of
this
little
life
were
passing
away
from
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
swallowed
food
,
though
a
table
had
been
spread
for
her
in
the
next
field
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
cold
and
wet
,
but
she
scarcely
knew
it
.
<EOS>
She
crept
on
,
poor
soul
,
like
a
criminal
afraid
of
being
taken
,
and
felt
little
beyond
the
terror
of
falling
down
while
it
was
yet
daylight
,
and
being
found
alive
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
fear
that
she
would
live
through
another
night
.
  
<EOS>
Sewn
in
the
breast
of
her
gown
,
the
money
to
pay
for
her
burial
was
still
intact
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
wear
through
the
day
,
and
then
lie
down
to
die
under
cover
of
the
darkness
,
she
would
die
independent
.
<EOS>
If
she
were
captured
previously
,
the
money
would
be
taken
from
her
as
a
pauper
who
had
no
right
to
it
,
and
she
would
be
carried
to
the
accursed
workhouse
.
<EOS>
Gaining
her
end
,
the
letter
would
be
found
in
her
breast
,
along
with
the
money
,
and
the
gentlefolks
would
say
when
it
was
given
back
to
them
,
"
She
prized
it
,
did
old
Betty
Higden
;
 
she
was
true
to
it
;
and
while
she
lived
,
she
would
never
let
it
be
disgraced
by
falling
into
the
hands
of
those
that
she
held
in
horror
.
"
 
<EOS>
Most
illogical
,
inconsequential
,
and
light
-
headed
,
this
;
but
travellers
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
are
apt
to
be
light
-
headed
;
 
and
worn
-
out
old
people
of
low
estate
have
a
trick
of
reasoning
as
indifferently
as
they
live
,
and
doubtless
would
appreciate
our
Poor
Law
more
philosophically
on
an
income
of
ten
thousand
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
keeping
to
byways
,
and
shunning
human
approach
,
this
troublesome
old
woman
hid
herself
,
and
fared
on
all
through
the
dreary
day
.
<EOS>
Yet
so
unlike
was
she
to
vagrant
hiders
in
general
,
that
sometimes
,
as
the
day
advanced
,
there
was
a
bright
fire
in
her
eyes
,
and
a
quicker
beating
at
her
feeble
heart
,
as
though
she
said
exultingly
,
"
The
Lord
will
see
me
through
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
By
what
visionary
hands
she
was
led
along
upon
that
journey
of
escape
from
the
Samaritan
;
by
what
voices
,
hushed
in
the
grave
,
she
seemed
to
be
addressed
;
how
she
fancied
the
dead
child
in
her
arms
again
,
and
times
innumerable
adjusted
her
shawl
to
keep
it
warm
;
what
infinite
variety
of
forms
of
tower
and
roof
and
steeple
<EOS>
the
trees
took
;
how
many
furious
horsemen
rode
at
her
,
crying
,
"
There
she
goes
!
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
Stop
,
Betty
Higden
!
"
and
melted
away
as
they
came
close
;
be
these
things
left
untold
.
<EOS>
Faring
on
and
hiding
,
hiding
and
faring
on
,
the
poor
harmless
creature
,
as
though
she
were
a
Murderess
and
the
whole
country
were
up
after
her
,
were
out
the
day
,
and
gained
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Water
-
meadows
,
or
such
like
,
"
she
had
sometimes
murmured
,
on
the
day
's
pilgrimage
,
when
she
had
raised
her
head
and
taken
any
note
of
the
real
objects
about
her
.
<EOS>
There
now
arose
in
the
darkness
,
a
great
building
,
full
of
lighted
windows
.
<EOS>
Smoke
was
issuing
from
a
high
chimney
in
the
rear
of
it
,
and
there
was
the
sound
of
a
waterwheel
at
the
side
.
<EOS>
Between
her
and
the
building
,
lay
a
piece
of
water
,
in
which
the
lighted
windows
were
reflected
,
and
on
its
nearest
margin
was
a
plantation
of
trees
.
<EOS>
"
I
humbly
thank
the
Power
and
the
Glory
,
"
said
Betty
Higden
,
holding
up
her
withered
hands
,
"
that
I
have
come
to
my
journey
's
end
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
crept
among
the
trees
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
whence
she
could
see
,
beyond
some
intervening
trees
and
branches
,
the
lighted
windows
,
both
in
their
reality
and
their
reflection
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
She
placed
her
orderly
little
basket
at
her
side
,
and
sank
upon
the
ground
,
supporting
herself
against
the
tree
.
<EOS>
It
brought
to
her
mind
the
foot
of
the
Cross
,
and
she
committed
herself
to
Him
who
died
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Her
strength
held
out
to
enable
her
to
arrange
the
letter
in
her
breast
,
so
as
that
it
could
be
seen
that
she
had
a
paper
there
.
<EOS>
It
had
held
out
for
this
,
and
it
departed
when
this
was
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
safe
here
,
"
was
her
last
benumbed
thought
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
am
found
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
Cross
,
it
will
be
by
some
of
my
own
sort
;
 
some
of
the
working
people
who
work
among
the
lights
yonder
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
the
lighted
windows
now
,
but
they
are
there
.
<EOS>
I
am
thankful
for
all
!

<EOS>
The
darkness
gone
,

a
face
bending
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
can
not
be

boofer
lady

<EOS>

I

Did

I

long
gone

"
  
<EOS>
It
is
as
the
face
of
a
woman
,
shaded
by
a
quantity
of
rich
dark
hair
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
earnest
face
of
a
woman
who
is
young
and
handsome
.
<EOS>
But
all
is
over
with
me
on
earth

and
this
must
be
an
Angel

I
hurried
all
I

motionless

she

These

A
look

thankfulness

lights
the
worn
old
face

<EOS>
The
eyes
,
which
have
been
darkly
fixed
upon
the
sky
,
turn
with
meaning
in
them
towards
the
compassionate
face
from
which
the
tears
are
dropping
,
and
a
smile
is
on
the
aged
lips
as
they
ask
:
  
"

The
answer
is
,
the
ready
pressure
of
her
lips
upon
the
cold
but
smiling
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless

Lizzie

very
softly
raised
the

stained
grey
head

lifted
her

high

SOMEBODY

So
read
the

in
a

untroubled
voice

for
his
heart
misgave
him

all
was
not
quite
right

say
our

Poor

awful
manner

over

And
Sloppy

on

the

knowing
that
otherwise
he
would
not
be
separated
from
her
---
Sloppy
could
not
in
his
conscience
as
yet
find
the
hearty
thanks
required
of
it
.
<EOS>
Selfish
in
Sloppy
,
and
yet
excusable
,
it
may
be
humbly
hoped
,
because
our
sister
had
been
more
than
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
The
words
were
read
above
the
ashes
of
Betty
Higden
,
in
a
corner
of
a
churchyard
near
the
river
;
in
a
churchyard
so
obscure
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
<EOS>
but
grass
-
mounds
,
not
so
much
as
one
single
tombstone
.
<EOS>
It
might
not
be
to
do
an
unreasonably
great
deal
for
the
diggers
and
hewers
,
in
a
registering
age
,
if
we
ticketed
their
graves
at
the
common
charge
;
so
that
a
new
generation
might
know
which
was
which
:
so
that
the
soldier
,
sailor
,
emigrant
,
coming
home
,
should
be
able
to
identify
the
resting
-
place
of
father
,
mother
,
playmate
,
or
betrothed
.
<EOS>
For
,
we
turn
up
our
eyes
and
say
that
we
are
all
alike
in
death
,
and
we
might
turn
them
down
and
work
the
saying
out
in
this
world
,
so
far
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
sentimental
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
But
how
say
ye
,
my
lords
and
gentlemen
and
honorable
boards
,
shall
we
not
find
good
standing
-
room
left
for
a
little
sentiment
,
if
we
look
into
our
crowds
?
  
<EOS>
Near
unto
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
as
he
read
,
stood
his
little
wife
,
John
Rokesmith
the
Secretary
,
and
Bella
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
These
,
over
and
above
Sloppy
,
were
the
mourners
at
the
lowly
grave
.
<EOS>
Not
a
penny
had
been
added
to
the
money
sewn
in
her
dress
:
what
her
honest
spirit
had
so
long
projected
,
was
fulfilled
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
took
it
in
my
head
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
laying
it
,
inconsolable
,
against
the
church
door
,
when
all
was
done
<EOS>
:
"
I
've
took
it
in
my
wretched
head
that
I
might
have
sometimes
turned
a
little
harder
for
her
,
and
it
cuts
me
deep
to
think
so
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
,
comforting
Sloppy
,
expounded
to
him
how
the
best
of
us
were
more
or
less
remiss
in
our
turnings
at
our
respective
Mangles
---
<EOS>
some
of
us
very
much
so
---
and
how
we
were
all
a
halting
,
failing
,
feeble
,
and
inconstant
crew
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
warn't
,
sir
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
taking
this
ghostly
counsel
rather
ill
,
in
behalf
of
his
late
benefactress
.
<EOS>
Let
us
speak
for
ourselves
,
sir
.
<EOS>
She
went
through
with
whatever
duty
she
had
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
went
through
with
me
<EOS>
,
she
went
through
with
the
Minders
,
she
went
through
with
herself
,
she
went
through
with
everythink
.
<EOS>
O
Mrs.
Higden
,
Mrs.
Higden
,
you
was
a
woman
and
a
mother
and
a
mangler
in
a
million
million
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
heartfelt
words
,
Sloppy
removed
his
dejected
head
from
the
church
door
,
and
took
it
back
to
the
grave
in
the
corner
,
and
laid
it
down
there
,
and
wept
alone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
a
very
poor
grave
,
"
said
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
,
brushing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
"
when
it
has
that
homely
figure
on
it
.
<EOS>
Richer
,
I
think
,
than
it
could
be
made
by
most
of
the
sculpture
in
Westminster
Abbey
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
left
him
undisturbed
,
and
passed
out
at
the
wicket
-
gate
.
<EOS>
The
water
-
wheel
of
the
paper
-
mill
was
audible
there
,
and
seemed
to
have
a
softening
influence
on
the
bright
wintry
scene
.
<EOS>
They
had
arrived
but
a
little
while
before
,
and
Lizzie
Hexam
now
told
them
the
little
she
could
add
to
the
letter
in
which
she
had
enclosed
Mr.
Rokesmith
's
letter
and
had
asked
for
their
instructions
.
<EOS>
This
was
merely
how
she
had
heard
the
groan
,
and
what
had
afterwards
passed
,
and
how
she
had
obtained
leave
for
the
remains
to
be
placed
in
that
sweet
,
fresh
,
empty
store
-
room
of
the
mill
from
which
they
had
just
accompanied
them
to
the
churchyard
,
and
how
the
last
requests
had
been
religiously
observed
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
have
done
it
all
,
or
nearly
all
,
of
myself
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
wanted
the
will
;
but
I
should
not
have
had
the
power
,
without
our
managing
partner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
not
the
Jew
who
received
us
?
"
said
Mrs.
Milvey
.
  
<EOS>
(
"
My
dear
,
"
observed
her
husband
in
parenthesis
,
"
why
not
?
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
certainly
is
a
Jew
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
and
the
lady
,
his
wife
,
is
a
Jewess
,
and
I
was
first
brought
to
their
notice
by
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
there
can
not
be
kinder
people
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
suppose
they
try
to
convert
you
!
"
<EOS>
suggested
Mrs.
Milvey
,
bristling
in
her
good
little
way
,
as
a
clergyman
's
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
do
what
,
ma'am
?
"
asked
Lizzie
,
with
a
modest
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
make
you
change
your
religion
,
"
said
Mrs.
Milvey
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
shook
her
head
,
still
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
never
asked
me
what
my
religion
is
.
<EOS>
They
asked
me
what
my
story
was
,
and
I
told
them
.
<EOS>
They
asked
me
to
be
industrious
and
faithful
,
and
I
promised
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
They
most
willingly
and
cheerfully
do
their
duty
to
all
of
us
who
are
employed
here
,
<EOS>
and
we
try
to
do
ours
to
them
.
<EOS>
Indeed
they
do
much
more
than
their
duty
to
us
,
for
they
are
wonderfully
mindful
of
us
in
many
ways
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
easy
to
see
you
're
a
favourite
,
my
dear
,
"
said
little
Mrs.
Milvey
,
not
quite
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
very
ungrateful
in
me
to
say
I
am
not
,
"
returned
Lizzie
,
"
for
I
have
been
already
raised
to
a
place
of
confidence
here
.
<EOS>
But
that
makes
no
difference
in
their
following
their
own
religion
and
leaving
all
of
us
to
ours
.
<EOS>
They
never
talk
of
theirs
to
us
,
and
they
never
talk
of
our
to
us
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
the
last
in
the
mill
,
it
would
be
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
They
never
asked
me
what
religion
that
poor
thing
had
followed
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Milvey
,
aside
to
the
Reverend
Frank
,
"
I
wish
you
would
talk
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
the
Reverend
Frank
aside
to
his
good
little
wife
,
"
I
think
I
will
leave
it
to
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
The
circumstances
are
hardly
favourable
.
<EOS>
There
are
plenty
of
talkers
going
about
,
my
love
,
and
she
will
soon
find
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
this
discourse
was
interchanging
,
both
Bella
and
the
Secretary
observed
Lizzie
Hexam
with
great
attention
.
<EOS>
Brought
face
to
face
for
the
first
time
with
the
daughter
of
his
supposed
murderer
,
it
was
natural
that
John
Harmon
should
have
his
own
secret
reasons
for
a
careful
scrutiny
of
her
countenance
and
manner
.
<EOS>
Bella
knew
that
Lizzie
's
father
had
been
falsely
accused
of
the
crime
which
had
had
so
great
an
influence
on
her
own
life
and
fortunes
;
and
her
interest
,
though
it
had
no
secret
springs
,
like
that
of
the
Secretary
,
was
equally
natural
.
<EOS>
Both
had
expected
to
see
something
very
different
from
the
real
Lizzie
Hexam
,
and
thus
it
fell
out
that
she
became
the
unconscious
means
of
bringing
them
together
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
when
they
had
walked
on
with
her
to
the
little
house
in
the
clean
village
by
the
paper
-
mill
,
where
Lizzie
had
a
lodging
with
an
elderly
couple
employed
in
the
establishment
,
and
when
Mrs.
Milvey
and
Bella
had
been
up
to
see
her
room
and
had
come
down
,
the
mill
bell
rang
.
<EOS>
This
called
Lizzie
away
for
the
time
,
and
left
the
Secretary
and
Bella
standing
rather
awkwardly
in
the
small
street
;
Mrs.
Milvey
being
engaged
in
pursuing
the
village
children
,
and
her
investigations
whether
they
were
in
danger
of
becoming
children
of
Israel
;
and
the
Reverend
Frank
being
engaged
 
---
to
say
the
truth
---
in
evading
that
branch
of
his
spiritual
functions
,
and
getting
out
of
sight
surreptitiously
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
at
length
said
:
  
"
Had
n't
we
better
talk
about
the
commission
we
have
undertaken
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
faltered
Bella
,
"
that
we
are
both
commissioned
,
or
we
should
n't
both
be
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,
"
was
the
Secretary
's
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
proposed
to
come
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Milvey
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
Mrs.
Boffin
urged
me
to
do
so
,
in
order
that
I
might
give
her
my
small
report
---
it
's
not
worth
anything
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
except
for
it
's
being
a
woman
's
---
which
indeed
with
you
may
be
a
fresh
reason
for
it
's
being
worth
nothing
---
of
Lizzie
Hexam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
"
directed
me
to
come
for
the
same
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
they
spoke
they
were
leaving
the
little
street
and
emerging
on
the
wooded
landscape
by
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
well
of
her
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
"
pursued
Bella
,
conscious
of
making
all
the
advances
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
highly
of
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
glad
of
that
!
<EOS>
Something
quite
refined
in
her
beauty
,
is
there
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
appearance
is
very
striking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
shade
of
sadness
upon
her
that
is
quite
touching
.
<EOS>
At
least
I
<EOS>
---
I
am
not
setting
up
my
own
poor
opinion
,
you
know
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Bella
,
excusing
and
explaining
herself
in
a
pretty
shy
way
;
"
I
am
consulting
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
noticed
that
sadness
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
may
not
,
"
said
the
Secretary
in
a
lower
voice
,
"
be
the
result
of
the
false
accusation
which
has
been
retracted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
had
passed
on
a
little
further
without
speaking
,
Bella
,
after
stealing
a
glance
or
two
at
the
Secretary
,
suddenly
said
:
  
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
do
n't
be
hard
with
me
<EOS>
,
do
n't
be
stern
with
me
;
 
be
magnanimous
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
talk
with
you
on
equal
terms
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
as
suddenly
brightened
,
and
returned
:
"
Upon
my
honour
I
had
no
thought
but
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
forced
myself
to
be
constrained
,
lest
you
might
misinterpret
my
being
more
natural
.
<EOS>
There
.
<EOS>
It
's
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Bella
,
holding
out
her
little
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Forgive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
cried
the
Secretary
,
eagerly
.
"
<EOS>
Forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
For
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
,
and
they
were
prettier
in
his
sight
(
though
they
smote
him
on
the
heart
rather
reproachfully
too
)
than
any
other
glitter
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
had
walked
a
little
further
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
going
to
speak
to
me
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
with
the
shadow
so
long
on
him
quite
thrown
off
and
cast
away
,
"
about
Lizzie
Hexam
.
<EOS>
So
was
I
going
to
speak
to
you
,
if
I
could
have
begun
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
that
you
can
begin
,
sir
,
"
returned
Bella
,
with
a
look
as
if
she
italicized
the
word
by
putting
one
of
her
dimples
under
it
,
"
what
were
you
going
to
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
,
of
course
,
that
in
her
short
letter
to
Mrs.
Boffin
---
  
short
,
but
containing
everything
to
the
purpose
---
she
stipulated
that
either
her
name
,
or
else
her
place
of
residence
,
must
be
kept
strictly
a
secret
among
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
nodded
<EOS>
Yes
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
duty
to
find
out
why
she
made
that
stipulation
.
<EOS>
I
have
it
in
charge
from
Mr.
Boffin
to
discover
,
and
I
am
very
desirous
for
myself
to
discover
,
whether
that
retracted
accusation
still
leaves
any
stain
upon
her
.
<EOS>
I
mean
whether
it
places
her
at
any
disadvantage
towards
any
one
,
even
towards
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Bella
,
nodding
thoughtfully
;
"
I
understand
.
<EOS>
That
seems
wise
,
and
considerate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
not
have
noticed
,
Miss
Wilfer
,
that
she
has
the
same
kind
of
interest
in
you
,
that
you
have
in
her
.
<EOS>
Just
as
you
are
attracted
by
her
beaut
---
by
her
appearance
and
manner
,
she
is
attracted
by
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
certainly
have
not
noticed
it
,
"
returned
Bella
,
again
italicizing
with
the
dimple
,
"
and
I
should
have
given
her
credit
for
---
"
  
The
Secretary
with
a
smile
held
up
his
hand
<EOS>
,
so
plainly
interposing
"
not
for
better
taste
,
"
that
Bella
's
colour
deepened
over
the
little
piece
of
coquetry
<EOS>
she
was
checked
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
"
resumed
the
Secretary
,
"
if
you
would
speak
with
her
alone
before
we
go
away
from
here
,
I
feel
quite
sure
that
a
natural
and
easy
confidence
would
arise
between
you
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
would
not
be
asked
to
betray
it
;
and
of
course
you
would
not
,
if
you
were
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
do
not
object
to
put
this
question
to
her
---
to
ascertain
for
us
her
own
feeling
in
this
one
matter
---
you
can
do
so
at
a
far
greater
advantage
than
I
or
any
else
could
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
is
anxious
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
,
"
added
the
Secretary
after
a
moment
,
"
for
a
special
reason
,
very
anxious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
happy
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
returned
Bella
,
"
to
be
of
the
least
use
;
for
I
feel
,
after
the
serious
scene
of
to
-
day
,
that
I
am
useless
enough
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
that
,
"
urged
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
I
mean
that
,
"
said
Bella
,
raising
her
eyebrows
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
one
is
useless
in
this
world
,
"
retorted
the
Secretary
,
"
who
lightens
the
burden
of
it
for
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
assure
you
I
do
n't
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Bella
,
half
crying
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
for
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
loving
,
self
-
forgetting
,
easily
-
satisfied
Pa
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
He
thinks
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
if
he
only
thinks
so
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
Excuse
the
interruption
:
I
do
n't
like
to
hear
you
depreciate
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
once
depreciated
me
,
sir
,
"
thought
Bella
,
pouting
,
"
and
I
hope
you
may
be
satisfied
with
the
consequences
you
brought
upon
your
head
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
she
said
nothing
to
that
purpose
;
she
even
said
something
to
a
different
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
it
seems
so
long
since
we
spoke
together
naturally
,
that
I
am
embarrassed
in
approaching
another
subject
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
am
very
grateful
to
him
;
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
You
know
I
feel
a
true
respect
for
him
,
and
am
bound
to
him
by
the
strong
ties
of
his
own
generosity
;
now
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unquestionably
.
<EOS>
And
also
that
you
are
his
favourite
companion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
makes
it
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
so
very
difficult
to
speak
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
---
.
Does
he
treat
you
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
how
he
treats
me
,
"
the
Secretary
answered
,
with
a
patient
and
yet
proud
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
I
see
it
with
pain
,
"
said
Bella
,
very
energetically
.
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
gave
her
such
a
radiant
look
,
that
if
he
had
thanked
her
a
hundred
times
,
he
could
not
have
said
as
much
as
the
look
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
with
pain
,
"
repeated
Bella
,
"
and
it
often
makes
me
miserable
.
<EOS>
Miserable
,
because
I
can
not
bear
to
be
supposed
to
approve
of
it
,
or
have
any
indirect
share
in
it
.
<EOS>
Miserable
,
because
I
can
not
bear
to
be
forced
to
admit
to
myself
that
Fortune
is
spoiling
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Miss
Wilfer
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
with
a
beaming
face
,
"
if
you
could
know
with
what
delight
I
make
the
discovery
that
Fortune
is
not
spoiling
you
,
you
would
know
that
it
more
than
compensates
me
for
any
slight
at
any
other
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
speak
of
me
,
"
said
Bella
,
giving
herself
an
impatient
little
slap
with
her
glove
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
me
as
well
as
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
know
yourself
?
"
suggested
the
Secretary
,
finding
that
she
stopped
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
quite
enough
of
myself
,
"
said
Bella
,
with
a
charming
air
of
being
inclined
to
give
herself
up
as
a
bad
job
,
"
and
I
do
n't
improve
upon
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
Mr.
Boffin
's
manner
to
me
,
or
consideration
for
me
,
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
,
"
observed
the
Secretary
,
"
must
be
admitted
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
plain
to
be
denied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
disposed
to
deny
it
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
"
asked
Bella
,
with
a
look
of
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ought
I
not
to
be
glad
to
do
so
,
if
I
could
:
though
it
were
only
for
my
own
sake
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
"
returned
Bella
,
"
it
must
try
you
very
much
,
and
---
you
must
please
promise
me
that
you
wo
n't
take
ill
what
I
am
going
to
add
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
it
with
all
my
heart
.
"
  
"
---
And
it
must
sometimes
,
I
should
think
,
"
said
Bella
,
hesitating
,
"
a
little
lower
you
in
your
own
estimation
?
"
  
<EOS>
Assenting
with
a
movement
of
his
head
,
though
not
at
all
looking
as
if
it
did
,
the
Secretary
replied
:
  
"
I
have
very
strong
reasons
,
Miss
Wilfer
,
for
bearing
with
the
drawbacks
of
my
position
in
the
house
<EOS>
we
both
inhabit
.
<EOS>
Believe
that
they
are
not
all
mercenary
,
although
I
have
,
through
a
series
of
strange
fatalities
,
faded
out
of
my
place
in
life
.
<EOS>
If
what
you
see
with
such
a
gracious
and
good
sympathy
is
calculated
to
rouse
my
pride
,
there
are
other
considerations
(
and
those
you
do
not
see
)
urging
me
to
quiet
endurance
.
<EOS>
The
latter
are
by
far
the
stronger
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
noticed
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Bella
,
looking
at
him
with
curiosity
,
as
not
quite
making
him
out
,
"
that
you
repress
yourself
,
and
force
yourself
,
to
act
a
passive
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
.
<EOS>
I
repress
myself
and
force
myself
to
act
a
part
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
tameness
of
spirit
that
I
submit
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
settled
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
a
good
one
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
a
good
one
,
I
hope
,
"
he
answered
,
looking
steadily
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sometimes
I
have
fancied
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
,
turning
away
her
eyes
,
"
that
your
great
regard
for
Mrs.
Boffin
is
a
very
powerful
motive
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
again
;
it
is
.
<EOS>
I
would
do
anything
for
her
,
bear
anything
for
her
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
words
to
express
how
I
esteem
that
good
,
good
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
I
do
too
!
<EOS>
May
I
ask
you
one
thing
more
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
"
  
"
Anything
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
see
that
she
really
suffers
,
when
Mr.
Boffin
shows
how
he
is
changing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
,
every
day
,
as
you
see
it
,
and
am
grieved
to
give
her
pain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
give
her
pain
?
"
said
Bella
,
repeating
the
phrase
quickly
,
with
her
eyebrows
raised
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
generally
the
unfortunate
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
she
says
to
you
,
as
she
often
says
to
me
,
that
he
is
the
best
of
men
,
in
spite
of
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
often
overhear
her
,
in
her
honest
and
beautiful
devotion
to
him
,
saying
so
to
you
,
"
returned
the
Secretary
,
with
the
same
steady
look
,
"
but
I
can
not
assert
that
she
ever
says
so
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
met
the
steady
look
for
a
moment
with
a
wistful
,
musing
little
look
of
her
own
,
and
then
,
nodding
her
pretty
head
several
times
,
like
a
dimpled
philosopher
(
of
the
very
best
school
)
who
was
moralizing
on
Life
,
heaved
a
little
sigh
,
and
gave
up
things
in
general
for
a
bad
job
,
as
she
had
previously
been
inclined
to
give
up
herself
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
that
,
they
had
a
very
pleasant
walk
.
<EOS>
The
trees
were
bare
of
leaves
,
and
the
river
was
bare
of
water
-
lilies
;
but
the
sky
was
not
bare
of
its
beautiful
blue
,
and
the
water
reflected
it
,
and
a
delicious
wind
ran
with
the
stream
,
touching
the
surface
crisply
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
old
mirror
was
never
yet
made
by
human
hands
,
which
,
if
all
the
images
it
has
in
its
time
reflected
could
pass
across
its
surface
again
,
would
fail
to
reveal
some
scene
of
horror
or
distress
.
<EOS>
But
the
great
serene
mirror
of
the
river
seemed
as
if
it
might
have
reproduced
all
it
had
ever
reflected
between
those
placid
banks
,
and
brought
nothing
to
the
light
save
what
was
peaceful
,
pastoral
,
and
blooming
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
they
walked
,
speaking
of
the
newly
filled
-
up
grave
,
and
of
Johnny
,
and
of
many
things
.
<EOS>
So
,
on
their
return
,
they
met
brisk
Mrs.
Milvey
coming
to
seek
them
,
with
the
agreeable
intelligence
that
there
was
no
fear
for
the
village
children
,
there
being
a
Christian
school
in
the
village
,
and
no
worse
Judaical
interference
with
it
than
to
plant
its
garden
.
<EOS>
So
,
they
got
back
to
the
village
as
Lizzie
Hexam
was
coming
from
the
paper
-
mill
,
and
Bella
detached
herself
to
speak
with
her
in
her
own
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
it
is
a
poor
room
for
you
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
with
a
smile
of
welcome
,
as
she
offered
the
post
of
honor
by
the
fireside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
so
poor
as
you
think
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
Bella
,
"
if
you
knew
all
.
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
though
attained
by
some
wonderful
winding
narrow
stairs
,
which
seemed
to
have
been
erected
in
a
pure
white
chimney
,
and
though
very
low
in
the
ceiling
,
and
very
rugged
in
the
floor
,
and
rather
blinking
as
to
the
proportions
of
its
lattice
window
,
it
was
a
pleasanter
room
than
that
despised
chamber
once
at
home
,
in
which
Bella
had
first
bemoaned
the
miseries
of
taking
lodgers
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
was
closing
as
the
two
girls
looked
at
one
another
by
the
fireside
.
<EOS>
The
dusky
room
was
lighted
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
The
grate
might
have
been
the
old
brazier
,
and
the
glow
might
have
been
the
old
hollow
down
by
the
flare
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
quite
new
to
me
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
to
be
visited
by
a
lady
so
nearly
of
my
own
age
,
and
so
pretty
,
as
you
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pleasure
to
me
to
look
at
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
left
to
begin
with
,
"
returned
Bella
,
blushing
,
"
because
I
was
going
to
say
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
me
to
look
at
you
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
But
we
can
begin
without
a
beginning
,
ca
n't
we
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
took
the
pretty
little
hand
that
was
held
out
in
as
pretty
a
little
frankness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
dear
,
"
said
Bella
,
drawing
her
chair
a
little
nearer
,
and
taking
Lizzie
's
arm
as
if
they
were
going
out
for
a
walk
,
"
I
am
commissioned
with
something
to
say
,
and
I
dare
say
I
shall
say
it
wrong
,
but
I
wo
n't
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
reference
to
your
letter
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
and
this
is
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
.
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
This
is
what
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
exordium
,
Bella
set
forth
that
request
of
Lizzie
's
touching
secresy
,
and
delicately
spoke
of
that
false
accusation
and
its
retractation
,
and
asked
might
she
beg
to
be
informed
whether
it
had
any
bearing
,
near
or
remote
,
on
such
request
.
<EOS>
"
I
feel
,
my
dear
.
"
said
Bella
,
quite
amazing
herself
by
the
business
-
like
manner
in
which
she
was
getting
on
,
"
that
the
subject
must
be
a
painful
one
to
you
,
but
I
am
mixed
up
in
it
also
;
for
---
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
may
know
it
or
suspect
it
<EOS>
---
I
am
the
willed
-
away
girl
who
was
to
have
been
married
to
the
unfortunate
gentleman
,
if
he
had
been
pleased
to
approve
of
me
.
<EOS>
So
I
was
dragged
into
the
subject
without
my
consent
,
and
you
were
dragged
into
it
without
your
consent
,
and
there
is
very
little
to
choose
between
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
doubt
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
that
you
were
the
Miss
Wilfer
I
have
often
heard
named
.
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
who
my
unknown
friend
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unknown
friend
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
caused
the
charge
against
poor
father
to
be
contradicted
,
and
sent
me
the
written
paper
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
had
never
heard
of
him
.
<EOS>
Had
no
notion
who
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
been
glad
to
thank
him
,
"
returned
Lizzie
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
done
a
great
deal
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
hope
that
he
will
let
me
thank
him
some
day
.
<EOS>
You
asked
me
has
it
anything
to
do
---
"
  
"
It
or
the
accusation
itself
,
"
Bella
put
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
Has
either
anything
to
do
with
my
wishing
to
live
quite
secret
and
retired
here
?
<EOS>
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Lizzie
Hexam
shook
her
head
in
giving
this
reply
and
as
her
glance
sought
the
fire
,
there
was
a
quiet
resolution
in
her
folded
hands
,
not
lost
on
Bella
's
bright
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
lived
much
alone
?
"
asked
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
It
's
nothing
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
be
always
alone
<EOS>
many
hours
together
,
in
the
day
and
in
the
night
,
when
poor
father
was
alive
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
brother
,
I
have
been
told
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
brother
,
but
he
is
not
friendly
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
very
good
boy
though
,
and
has
raised
himself
by
his
industry
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
complain
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
said
it
,
with
her
eyes
upon
the
fire
-
glow
,
there
was
an
instantaneous
escape
of
distress
into
her
face
.
<EOS>
Bella
seized
the
moment
to
touch
her
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
whether
you
have
any
friend
of
your
own
sex
and
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
lived
that
lonely
kind
of
life
,
that
I
have
never
had
one
,
"
 
was
the
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
I
neither
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
that
my
life
has
been
lonely
,
for
I
could
have
sometimes
wished
it
lonelier
,
instead
of
having
Ma
going
on
like
the
Tragic
Muse
with
a
face
-
ache
in
majestic
corners
,
and
Lavvy
being
spiteful
---
though
of
course
I
am
very
fond
of
them
both
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
could
make
a
friend
of
me
,
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
you
could
?
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
of
what
they
call
character
,
my
dear
,
than
a
canary
-
bird
,
but
<EOS>
I
know
I
am
trustworthy
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
wayward
,
playful
,
affectionate
nature
,
giddy
for
want
of
the
weight
of
some
sustaining
purpose
,
and
capricious
because
it
was
always
fluttering
among
little
things
,
was
yet
a
captivating
one
.
<EOS>
To
Lizzie
it
was
so
new
,
so
pretty
,
at
once
so
womanly
and
so
childish
,
that
it
won
her
completely
.
<EOS>
And
when
Bella
said
again
,
"
Do
you
think
you
could
,
Lizzie
?
"
<EOS>
with
her
eyebrows
raised
,
her
head
inquiringly
on
one
side
,
and
an
odd
doubt
about
it
in
her
own
bosom
<EOS>
,
Lizzie
showed
beyond
all
question
that
she
thought
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
what
is
the
matter
,
and
why
you
live
like
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
presently
began
,
by
way
of
prelude
,
"
You
must
have
many
lovers
---
"
when
Bella
checked
her
with
a
little
scream
of
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
I
have
n't
one
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
one
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
had
one
,
but
what
he
may
think
about
it
at
the
present
time
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
have
half
a
one
(
of
course
I
do
n't
count
that
Idiot
,
George
Sampson
)
.
<EOS>
However
,
never
mind
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
hear
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
certain
man
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
a
passionate
and
angry
man
,
who
says
he
loves
me
,
and
who
I
must
believe
does
love
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
friend
of
my
brother
.
<EOS>
I
shrank
from
him
within
myself
when
my
brother
first
brought
him
to
me
;
but
the
last
time
I
saw
him
he
terrified
me
more
than
I
can
say
.
<EOS>
"
There
she
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
come
here
to
escape
from
him
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
here
immediately
after
he
so
alarmed
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
afraid
of
him
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
timid
generally
,
but
I
am
always
afraid
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
to
see
a
newspaper
,
or
to
hear
a
word
spoken
of
what
is
done
in
London
,
lest
he
should
have
done
some
violence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
are
not
afraid
of
him
for
yourself
,
dear
?
"
said
Bella
,
after
pondering
on
the
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
even
that
,
if
I
met
him
about
here
.
<EOS>
I
look
round
for
him
always
,
as
I
pass
to
and
fro
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
afraid
of
anything
he
may
do
to
himself
in
London
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
fierce
enough
even
to
do
some
violence
to
himself
,
but
I
do
n't
think
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
would
almost
seem
,
dear
,
"
said
Bella
quaintly
,
"
as
if
there
must
be
somebody
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
put
her
hands
before
her
face
for
a
moment
before
replying
:
"
The
words
are
always
in
my
cars
,
and
the
blow
he
struck
upon
a
stone
wall
as
he
said
them
is
always
before
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
have
tried
hard
to
think
it
not
worth
remembering
,
but
I
can
not
make
so
little
of
it
.
<EOS>
His
hand
was
trickling
down
with
blood
as
he
said
to
me
,
`
`
Then
I
hope
that
I
may
never
kill
him
!
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
Rather
startled
,
Bella
made
and
clasped
a
girdle
of
her
arms
round
Lizzie
's
waist
,
and
then
asked
quietly
,
in
a
soft
voice
,
as
they
both
looked
at
the
fire
:
  
<EOS>
"
Kill
him
!
<EOS>
Is
this
man
so
jealous
,
then
?
"
  
"
Of
a
gentleman
,
"
said
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
---
I
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
---
  
of
a
gentleman
far
above
me
and
my
way
of
life
,
who
broke
father
's
death
to
me
,
and
has
shown
an
interest
in
me
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
love
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
he
admire
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
ceased
to
shake
her
head
,
and
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
living
girdle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
through
his
influence
that
you
came
here
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
O
no
!
<EOS>
And
of
all
the
world
I
would
n't
have
him
know
that
I
am
here
,
or
get
the
least
clue
where
to
find
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
dear
!
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Bella
,
in
amazement
at
this
burst
.
<EOS>
But
then
quickly
added
,
reading
Lizzie
's
face
:
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
why
That
was
a
foolish
question
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
see
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
between
them
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
with
a
drooping
head
,
glanced
down
at
the
glow
in
the
fire
where
her
first
fancies
had
been
nursed
,
and
her
first
escape
made
from
the
grim
life
out
of
which
she
had
plucked
her
brother
,
foreseeing
her
reward
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
all
now
,
"
she
said
,
raising
her
eyes
to
Bella
's
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
left
out
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
reason
for
living
secret
here
,
with
the
aid
of
a
good
old
man
who
is
my
true
friend
.
<EOS>
For
a
short
part
of
my
life
at
home
with
father
,
I
knew
of
things
---
do
n't
ask
me
what
 
---
that
I
set
my
face
against
,
and
tried
to
better
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
could
have
done
more
,
then
,
without
letting
my
hold
on
father
go
;
 
but
they
sometimes
lie
heavy
on
my
mind
.
<EOS>
By
doing
all
for
the
best
,
I
hope
I
may
wear
them
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
wear
out
too
,
"
said
Bella
soothingly
,
"
this
weakness
,
Lizzie
,
in
favour
of
one
who
is
not
worthy
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
wear
that
out
,
"
was
the
flushed
reply
,
"
nor
do
I
want
to
believe
,
nor
do
I
believe
,
that
he
is
not
worthy
of
it
.
<EOS>
What
should
I
gain
by
that
,
and
how
much
should
I
lose
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
's
expressive
little
eyebrows
remonstrated
with
the
fire
for
some
short
time
before
she
rejoined
:
  
"
Do
n't
think
that
I
press
you
,
Lizzie
;
but
would
n't
you
gain
in
peace
,
and
hope
,
and
even
in
freedom
?
<EOS>
Would
n't
it
be
better
not
to
live
a
secret
life
in
hiding
,
and
not
to
be
shut
out
from
your
natural
and
wholesome
prospects
?
<EOS>
Forgive
my
asking
you
,
would
that
be
no
gain
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Does
a
woman
's
heart
that
---
that
has
that
weakness
in
it
which
you
have
spoken
of
,
"
returned
Lizzie
,
"
seek
to
gain
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
question
was
so
directly
at
variance
with
Bella
's
views
in
life
,
as
set
forth
to
her
father
,
that
she
said
internally
,
"
There
,
you
little
mercenary
wretch
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
that
?
<EOS>
Ai
n't
you
ashamed
of
yourself
?
"
and
unclasped
the
girdle
of
her
arms
,
expressly
to
give
herself
a
penitential
poke
in
the
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
said
,
Lizzie
,
"
observed
Bella
,
returning
to
her
subject
when
she
had
administered
this
chastisement
,
"
that
you
would
lose
,
besides
.
<EOS>
Would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
would
lose
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
lose
some
of
the
best
recollections
,
best
encouragements
,
and
best
objects
,
that
I
carry
through
my
daily
life
.
<EOS>
I
should
lose
my
belief
that
if
I
had
been
his
equal
,
and
he
had
loved
me
,
I
should
have
tried
with
all
my
might
to
make
him
better
and
happier
,
as
he
would
have
made
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
lose
almost
all
the
value
that
I
put
upon
the
little
learning
I
have
,
which
is
all
owing
to
him
,
and
which
<EOS>
I
conquered
the
difficulties
of
,
that
he
might
not
think
it
thrown
away
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
lose
a
kind
of
picture
of
him
---
or
of
what
he
might
have
been
,
if
I
had
been
a
lady
,
and
he
had
loved
me
---
which
is
always
with
me
,
and
which
I
somehow
feel
that
I
could
not
do
a
mean
or
a
wrong
thing
before
.
<EOS>
I
should
leave
off
prizing
the
remembrance
that
he
has
done
me
nothing
but
good
since
I
have
known
him
,
and
that
he
has
made
a
change
within
me
,
like
 
---
like
the
change
in
the
grain
of
these
hands
,
which
were
coarse
,
and
cracked
,
and
hard
,
and
brown
when
I
rowed
on
the
river
with
father
,
and
are
softened
and
made
supple
by
this
new
work
as
you
see
them
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
trembled
,
but
with
no
weakness
,
as
she
showed
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Understand
me
,
my
dear
;
"
thus
she
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
dreamed
of
the
possibility
of
his
being
anything
to
me
on
this
earth
but
the
kind
of
picture
that
I
know
I
could
not
make
you
understand
,
if
the
understanding
was
not
in
your
own
breast
already
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
more
dreamed
of
the
possibility
of
my
being
his
wife
,
than
he
ever
has
---
and
words
could
not
be
stronger
than
that
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
love
him
.
<EOS>
I
love
him
so
much
,
and
so
dearly
,
that
when
I
sometimes
think
my
life
may
be
but
a
weary
one
,
I
am
proud
of
it
and
glad
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
proud
and
glad
to
suffer
something
for
him
,
even
though
it
is
of
no
service
to
him
,
and
he
will
never
know
of
it
or
care
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
sat
enchained
by
the
deep
,
unselfish
passion
of
this
girl
or
woman
of
her
own
age
,
courageously
revealing
itself
in
the
confidence
of
her
sympathetic
perception
of
its
truth
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
had
never
experienced
anything
like
it
,
or
thought
of
the
existence
of
anything
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
late
upon
a
wretched
night
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
when
his
eyes
first
looked
at
me
in
my
old
river
-
side
home
,
very
different
from
this
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
may
never
look
at
me
again
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
that
they
never
did
;
I
hope
that
they
never
may
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
have
the
light
of
them
taken
out
of
my
life
,
for
anything
my
life
can
give
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
everything
now
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
If
it
comes
a
little
strange
to
me
to
have
parted
with
it
,
I
am
not
sorry
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
thought
of
ever
parting
with
a
single
word
of
it
,
a
moment
before
you
came
in
;
but
you
came
in
,
and
my
mind
changed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
,
and
thanked
her
warmly
for
her
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
wish
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
I
was
more
deserving
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
deserving
of
it
?
"
repeated
Lizzie
,
with
an
incredulous
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
in
respect
of
keeping
it
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
because
any
one
should
tear
me
to
bits
before
getting
at
a
syllable
of
it
---
though
there
's
no
merit
in
that
,
for
I
am
naturally
as
obstinate
as
a
Pig
.
<EOS>
What
I
mean
is
,
Lizzie
,
that
I
am
a
mere
impertinent
piece
of
conceit
,
and
you
shame
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
put
up
the
pretty
brown
hair
that
came
tumbling
down
,
owing
to
the
energy
with
which
Bella
shook
her
head
;
and
she
remonstrated
while
thus
engaged
,
"
My
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
's
all
very
well
to
call
me
your
dear
,
"
said
Bella
,
with
a
pettish
whimper
,
"
and
I
am
glad
to
be
called
so
,
though
I
have
slight
enough
claim
to
be
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
such
a
nasty
little
thing
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
!
"
urged
Lizzie
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Such
a
shallow
,
cold
,
worldly
,
Limited
little
brute
!
"
said
Bella
,
bringing
out
her
last
adjective
with
culminating
force
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
"
inquired
Lizzie
with
her
quiet
smile
,
the
hair
being
now
secured
,
"
that
I
do
n't
know
better
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
better
though
?
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
really
believe
you
know
better
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
should
be
so
glad
if
you
did
know
better
,
but
I
am
so
very
much
afraid
that
I
must
know
best
!
"
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
asked
her
,
laughing
outright
,
whether
she
ever
saw
her
own
face
or
heard
her
own
voice
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
so
,
"
returned
Bella
;
"
I
look
in
the
glass
often
enough
,
and
I
chatter
like
a
Magpie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
your
face
,
and
heard
your
voice
,
at
any
rate
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
"
and
they
have
tempted
me
to
say
to
you
---
with
a
certainty
of
not
going
wrong
---
what
I
thought
I
should
never
say
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
Does
that
look
ill
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
hope
it
does
n't
,
"
pouted
Bella
,
stopping
herself
in
something
between
a
humoured
laugh
and
a
humoured
sob
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
used
once
to
see
pictures
in
the
fire
,
"
said
Lizzie
playfully
,
"
to
please
my
brother
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
you
what
I
see
down
there
where
the
fire
is
glowing
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
risen
,
and
were
standing
on
the
hearth
,
the
time
being
come
for
separating
;
each
had
drawn
an
arm
around
the
other
to
take
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
tell
you
,
"
asked
Lizzie
,
"
what
I
see
down
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Limited
little
b
?
"
suggested
Bella
with
her
eyebrows
raised
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
heart
well
worth
winning
,
and
well
won
.
<EOS>
A
heart
that
,
once
won
,
goes
through
fire
and
water
for
the
winner
,
and
never
changes
,
and
is
never
daunted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Girl
's
heart
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Bella
,
with
accompanying
eyebrows
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
nodded
.
"
<EOS>
And
the
figure
to
which
it
belongs
---
"
  
"
Is
yours
,
"
suggested
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Most
clearly
and
distinctly
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
the
interview
terminated
with
pleasant
words
on
both
sides
,
and
with
many
reminders
on
the
part
of
Bella
that
they
were
friends
,
and
pledges
that
she
would
soon
come
down
into
that
part
of
the
country
again
.
<EOS>
Therewith
Lizzie
returned
to
her
occupation
,
and
Bella
ran
over
to
the
little
inn
to
rejoin
her
company
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
rather
serious
,
Miss
Wilfer
,
"
was
the
Secretary
's
first
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
rather
serious
,
"
returned
Miss
Wilfer
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
nothing
else
to
tell
him
but
that
Lizzie
Hexam
's
secret
had
no
reference
whatever
to
the
cruel
charge
,
or
its
withdrawal
.
<EOS>
Oh
yes
though
!
<EOS>
said
Bella
<EOS>
;
she
might
as
well
mention
one
other
thing
;
 
Lizzie
was
very
desirous
to
thank
her
unknown
friend
who
had
sent
her
the
written
retractation
.
<EOS>
Was
she
,
indeed
?
<EOS>
observed
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Bella
asked
him
,
had
he
any
notion
who
that
unknown
friend
might
be
?
<EOS>
He
had
no
notion
whatever
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
on
the
borders
of
Oxfordshire
,
so
far
had
poor
old
Betty
Higden
strayed
.
<EOS>
They
were
to
return
by
the
train
presently
,
and
,
the
station
being
near
at
hand
,
the
Reverend
Frank
and
Mrs.
Frank
,
and
Sloppy
and
Bella
and
the
Secretary
,
set
out
to
walk
to
it
.
<EOS>
Few
rustic
paths
are
wide
enough
for
five
,
and
Bella
and
the
Secretary
dropped
behind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
believe
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
that
I
feel
as
if
whole
years
had
passed
since
I
went
into
Lizzie
Hexam
's
cottage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
crowded
a
good
deal
into
the
day
,
"
he
returned
,
"
and
you
were
much
affected
in
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
You
are
over
-
tired
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
am
not
at
all
tired
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
quite
expressed
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
that
I
feel
as
if
a
great
space
of
time
had
gone
by
,
but
that
I
feel
as
if
much
had
happened
---
to
myself
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
good
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
cold
;
I
felt
you
tremble
.
<EOS>
Pray
let
me
put
this
wrapper
of
mine
about
you
.
<EOS>
May
I
fold
it
over
this
shoulder
without
injuring
your
dress
?
<EOS>
Now
,
it
will
be
too
heavy
and
too
long
.
<EOS>
Let
me
carry
this
end
over
my
arm
,
as
you
have
no
arm
to
give
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
she
had
though
.
<EOS>
How
she
got
it
out
,
in
her
muffled
state
,
Heaven
knows
;
but
she
got
it
out
somehow
---
there
it
was
---
and
slipped
it
through
the
Secretary
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
a
long
and
interesting
talk
with
Lizzie
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
and
she
gave
me
her
full
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
withhold
it
,
"
said
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
how
you
come
,
"
said
Bella
,
stopping
short
as
she
glanced
at
him
,
"
to
say
to
me
just
what
she
said
about
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
infer
that
it
must
be
because
I
feel
just
as
she
felt
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
how
was
that
,
do
you
mean
to
say
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Bella
,
moving
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
if
you
were
inclined
to
win
her
confidence
---
anybody
's
confidence
 
<EOS>
---
you
were
sure
to
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
railway
,
at
this
point
,
knowingly
shutting
a
green
eye
and
opening
a
red
one
,
they
had
to
run
for
it
.
<EOS>
As
Bella
could
not
run
easily
so
wrapped
up
,
the
Secretary
had
to
help
her
.
<EOS>
When
she
took
her
opposite
place
in
the
carriage
corner
,
the
brightness
in
her
face
was
so
charming
to
behold
,
that
on
her
exclaiming
,
"
What
beautiful
stars
and
what
a
glorious
night
!
"
<EOS>
the
Secretary
said
"
Yes
,
"
but
seemed
to
prefer
to
see
the
night
and
the
stars
in
the
light
of
her
lovely
little
countenance
,
to
looking
out
of
window
.
  
<EOS>
O
boofer
lady
,
fascinating
boofer
lady
!
<EOS>
If
I
were
but
legally
executor
of
Johnny
's
will
!
<EOS>
If
I
had
but
the
right
to
pay
your
legacy
and
to
take
your
receipt
!
<EOS>
---
Something
to
this
purpose
surely
mingled
with
the
blast
of
the
train
as
it
cleared
the
stations
,
all
knowingly
shutting
up
their
green
eyes
and
opening
their
red
ones
when
they
prepared
to
let
the
boofer
lady
pass
.

SCOUTS
OUT
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
so
,
Miss
Wren
,
"
said
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
"
I
can
not
persuade
you
to
dress
me
a
doll
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Miss
Wren
snappishly
;
"
if
you
want
one
,
go
and
buy
one
at
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
my
charming
young
goddaughter

said
Mr.
Wrayburn
plaintively
,
"
down
in
Hertfordshire

put
upon
the
cold
footing

public

to
derive
no

my
private
acquaintance
with
the
Court
Dressmaker

<EOS>
"
If
it
's
any
advantage
to
your
charming
godchild

oh
,
a
precious
godfather
she
has
got
!
<EOS>
"
---
replied
Miss
Wren
,
pricking
at
him
in
the
air
with
her
needle
,
"
to
be
informed
that
the
Court
Dressmaker
knows
your
tricks
and
your
manners
,
you
may
tell
her
so
by
post
,
with
my
compliments
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
was
busy
at
her
work
by
candle
-
light
,
and
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
half
amused
and
half
vexed
,
and
all
idle
and
shiftless
,
stood
by
her
bench
looking
on
.
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
's
troublesome
child
was
in
the
corner
in
deep
disgrace
,
and
exhibiting
great
wretchedness
in
the
shivering
stage
of
prostration
from
drink
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ugh
,
you
disgraceful
boy
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Miss
Wren
,
attracted
by
the
sound
of
his
chattering
teeth
,
"
I
wish
they
'd
all
drop
down
your
throat
and
play
at
dice
in
your
stomach
!
<EOS>
Boh
,
wicked
child
!
<EOS>
Bee
-
baa
,
black
sheep
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
her
accompanying
each
of
these
reproaches
with
a
threatening
stamp
of
the
foot
,
the
wretched
creature
protested
with
a
whine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pay
five
shillings
for
you
indeed
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
proceeded
;
"
how
many
hours
do
you
suppose
it
costs
me
to
earn
five
shillings
,
you
infamous
boy
?
---
<EOS>
Do
n't
cry
like
that
,
or
I
'll
throw
a
doll
at
you

<EOS>
Pay
five
shillings
fine
for
you
indeed
.
<EOS>
Fine
in
more
ways
than
one
,
I
think
!
<EOS>
I
'd
give
the
dustman
five
shillings
,
to
carry
you
off
in
the
dust
cart

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No

no

pleaded
the
absurd
creature
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Please
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
enough
to
break
his
mother
's
heart
,
is
this
boy
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
half
appealing
to
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
never
brought
him
up
.
<EOS>
He
'd
be
sharper
than
a
serpent
's
tooth
,
if
he
was
n't
as
dull
as
ditch
water
.
<EOS>
Look
at
him
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
pretty
object
for
a
parent
's
eyes
!
"
  
<EOS>
Assuredly
,
in
his
worse
than
swinish
state
(
for
swine
at
least
fatten
on
their
guzzling
,
and
make
themselves
good
to
eat
)
<EOS>
,
he
was
a
pretty
object
for
any
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
muddling
and
a
swipey
old
child
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
rating
him
with
great
severity
,
"
fit
for
nothing
but
to
be
preserved
in
the
liquor
that
destroys
him
,
and
put
in
a
great
glass
bottle
as
a
sight
for
other
swipey
children
of
his
own
pattern
,
---
if
he
has
no
consideration
for
his
liver
,
has
he
none
for
his
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Deration
,
<EOS>
oh
do
n't
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
subject
of
these
angry
remarks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
do
n't
and
oh
do
n't
,
"
pursued
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
oh
do
<EOS>
and
oh
do
.
<EOS>
And
why
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
do
so
any
more
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
indeed
.
<EOS>
Pray
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
bear
to
look
at
you
.
<EOS>
Go
up
stairs
and
get
me
my
bonnet
and
shawl
.
<EOS>
Make
yourself
useful
in
some
way
,
bad
boy
,
and
let
me
have
your
room
instead
of
your
company
,
for
one
half
minute
.
"
  
<EOS>
Obeying
her
,
he
shambled
out
,
and
Eugene
Wrayburn
saw
the
tears
exude
from
between
the
little
creature
's
fingers
as
she
kept
her
hand
before
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
was
sorry
,
but
his
sympathy
did
not
move
his
carelessness
to
do
anything
but
feel
sorry
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
to
the
Italian
Opera
to
try
on
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
taking
away
her
hand
after
a
little
while
,
and
laughing
satirically
to
hide
that
she
had
been
crying
;
"
I
must
see
your
back
before
I
go
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
Let
me
first
tell
you
,
once
for
all
,
that
it
's
of
no
use
your
paying
visits
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
would
n't
get
what
you
want
,
of
me
,
no
,
not
if
you
brought
pincers
with
you
to
tear
it
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
so
obstinate
on
the
subject
of
a
doll
's
dress
for
my
godchild
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
returned
Miss
Wren
with
a
hitch
of
her
chin
,
"
<EOS>
I
am
so
obstinate
.
<EOS>
And
of
course
it
's
on
the
subject
of
a
doll
's
dress
---
or
address
---
whichever
you
like
.
<EOS>
Get
along
and
give
it
up
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
degraded
charge
had
come
back
,
and
was
standing
behind
her
with
the
bonnet
and
shawl
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
'em
to
me
and
get
back
into
your
corner
,
you
naughty
old
thing
!
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
as
she
turned
and
espied
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
wo
n't
have
your
help
.
<EOS>
Go
into
your
corner
,
this
minute
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
miserable
man
,
feebly
rubbing
the
back
of
his
faltering
hands
downward
from
the
wrists
,
shuffled
on
to
his
post
of
disgrace
;
but
not
without
a
curious
glance
at
Eugene
in
passing
him
,
accompanied
with
what
seemed
as
if
it
might
have
been
an
action
of
his
elbow
,
if
any
action
of
any
limb
or
joint
he
had
,
would
have
answered
truly
to
his
will
.
<EOS>
Taking
no
more
particular
notice
of
him
than
instinctively
falling
away
from
the
disagreeable
contact
,
Eugene
,
with
a
lazy
compliment
or
so
to
Miss
Wren
,
begged
leave
to
light
his
cigar
,
and
departed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
you
prodigal
old
son
,
"
said
Jenny
,
shaking
her
head
and
her
emphatic
little
forefinger
at
her
burden
<EOS>
,
"
you
sit
there
till
I
come
back
.
<EOS>
You
dare
to
move
out
of
your
corner
for
a
single
instant
while
I
'm
gone
,
and
I
'll
know
the
reason
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
admonition
,
she
blew
her
work
candles
out
,
leaving
him
to
the
light
of
the
fire
,
and
,
taking
her
big
door
-
key
in
her
pocket
and
her
crutch
-
stick
in
her
hand
,
marched
off
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
lounged
slowly
towards
the
Temple
,
smoking
his
cigar
,
but
saw
no
more
of
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
through
the
accident
of
their
taking
opposite
sides
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
He
lounged
along
moodily
,
and
stopped
at
Charing
Cross
to
look
about
him
,
with
as
little
interest
in
the
crowd
as
any
man
might
take
,
and
was
lounging
on
again
,
when
a
most
unexpected
object
caught
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
No
less
an
object
than
Jenny
Wren
's
bad
boy
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
cross
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
A
more
ridiculous
and
feeble
spectacle
than
this
tottering
wretch
making
unsteady
sallies
into
the
roadway
,
and
as
often
staggering
back
again
,
oppressed
by
terrors
of
vehicles
that
were
a
long
way
off
or
were
nowhere
,
the
streets
could
not
have
shown
.
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
,
when
the
course
was
perfectly
clear
,
he
set
out
,
got
half
way
,
described
a
loop
,
turned
,
and
went
back
again
,
when
he
might
have
crossed
and
re
-
crossed
half
a
dozen
times
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
would
stand
shivering
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
,
looking
up
the
street
and
looking
down
,
while
scores
of
people
jostled
him
,
and
crossed
,
and
went
on
.
<EOS>
Stimulated
in
course
of
time
by
the
sight
of
so
many
successes
,
he
would
make
another
sally
,
make
another
loop
,
would
all
but
have
his
foot
on
the
opposite
pavement
,
would
see
or
imagine
something
coming
,
and
would
stagger
back
again
.
<EOS>
There
,
he
would
stand
making
spasmodic
preparations
as
if
for
a
great
leap
,
and
at
last
would
decide
on
a
start
at
precisely
the
wrong
moment
,
and
would
be
roared
at
by
drivers
,
and
would
shrink
back
once
more
,
and
stand
in
the
old
spot
shivering
,
with
the
whole
of
the
proceedings
to
go
through
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
strikes
me
,
"
remarked
Eugene
coolly
,
after
watching
him
for
some
minutes
,
"
that
my
friend
is
likely
to
be
rather
behind
time
if
he
has
any
appointment
on
hand
.
<EOS>
"
With
which
remark
he
strolled
on
,
and
took
no
further
thought
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
was
at
home
when
he
got
to
the
Chambers
,
and
had
dined
alone
there
.
<EOS>
Eugene
drew
a
chair
to
the
fire
by
which
he
was
having
his
wine
and
reading
the
evening
paper
,
and
brought
a
glass
,
and
filled
it
for
good
fellowship
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mortimer
,
you
are
the
express
picture
of
contented
industry

reposing
(
on
credit

after
the
virtuous
labours
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Eugene
,
you
are
the
express

discontented
idleness
not
reposing
at
all

<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
,
"
replied
Wrayburn
,
"
---
about
town
.
<EOS>
I
have
turned
up
at
the
present
juncture
,
with
the
intention
of
consulting
my
highly
intelligent
and
respected
solicitor
on
the
position
of
my
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
highly
intelligent
and
respected
solicitor
is
of
opinion
that
your
affairs
are
in
a
bad
way
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Though
whether

said
Eugene
thoughtfully
,
"
that
can
be
intelligently
said
,
now
,
of
the
affairs
of
a
client
who
has
nothing
to
lose
and
who
can
not
possibly
be
made
to
pay
,
may
be
open
to
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
Jews
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
boy
,
"
returned
the
debtor
,
very
composedly
taking
up
his
glass
,
"
having
previously
fallen
into
the
hands
of
some
of
the
Christians
,
I
can
bear
it
with
philosophy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
an
interview
to
-
day
,
Eugene
,
with
a
Jew
,
who
seems
determined
to
press
us
hard
.
<EOS>
Quite
a
Shylock
,
and
quite
a
Patriarch
.
<EOS>
A
picturesque
grey
-
headed
and
grey
-
bearded
old
Jew
,
in
a
shovel
-
hat
and
gaberdine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
,
"
said
Eugene
,
pausing
in
setting
down
his
glass
,
"
surely
not
my
worthy
friend
Mr.
Aaron
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
calls
himself
Mr.
Riah
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
By
-
the
-
by
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
it
comes
into
my
mind
that
---
no
doubt
with
an
instinctive
desire
to
receive
him
into
the
bosom
of
our
Church
 
---
I
gave
him
the
name
of
Aaron
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eugene
,
Eugene
,
"
returned
Lightwood
,
"
you
are
more
ridiculous
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Say
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Merely
,
my
dear
fellow
,
that
I
have
the
honor
and
pleasure
of
a
speaking
acquaintance
with
such
a
Patriarch
as
you
describe
,
and
that
I
address
him
as
Mr.
Aaron
,
because
it
appears
to
me
Hebraic
,
expressive
,
appropriate
,
and
complimentary
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
which
strong
reasons
for
its
being
his
name
,
it
may
not
be
his
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
you
are
the
absurdest
man
on
the
face
of
the
earth
,
"
 
said
Lightwood
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
Did
he
mention
that
he
knew
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
not
.
<EOS>
He
only
said
of
you
that
he
expected
to
be
paid
by
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
looks
,
"
remarked
Eugene
with
much
gravity
,
"
like
not
knowing
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
may
not
be
my
worthy
friend
Mr.
Aaron
,
for
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
Mortimer
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
he
may
have
a
prepossession
against
me
.
<EOS>
I
strongly
suspect
him
of
having
had
a
hand
in
spiriting
away
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
,
"
returned
Lightwood
impatiently
,
"
seems
,
by
a
fatality
,
to
bring
us
round
to
Lizzie
.
`
<EOS>
`
About
town
"
"
meant
about
Lizzie
,
just
now
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
solicitor
,
do
you
know
,
"
observed
Eugene
,
turning
round
to
the
furniture
,
"
is
a
man
of
infinite
discernment
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
it
not
,
Eugene
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
it
did
,
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
Eugene
,
you
know
you
do
not
really
care
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eugene
Wrayburn
rose
,
and
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
stood
with
a
foot
on
the
fender
,
indolently
rocking
his
body
and
looking
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
After
a
prolonged
pause
,
he
replied
:
"
I
do
n't
know
that
.
<EOS>
I
must
ask
you
not
to
say
that
,
as
if
we
took
it
for
granted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
do
care
for
her
,
so
much
the
more
should
you
leave
her
to
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
again
paused
as
before
,
Eugene
said
:
"
I
do
n't
know
that
,
either
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
me
take
so
much
trouble
about
anything
,
as
about
this
disappearance
of
hers
?
<EOS>
I
ask
,
for
information
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Eugene
,
I
wish
I
ever
had
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
have
not
?
<EOS>
Just
so
.
<EOS>
You
confirm
my
own
impression
.
<EOS>
Does
that
look
as
if
I
cared
for
her
?
<EOS>
I
ask
,
for
information
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
asked
you
for
information
,
Eugene
,
"
said
Mortimer
reproachfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
boy
,
I
know
it
,
but
I
ca
n't
give
it
.
<EOS>
I
thirst
for
information
.
<EOS>
What
do
I
mean
?
<EOS>
If
my
taking
so
much
trouble
to
recover
her
does
not
mean
that
I
care
for
her
,
what
does
it
mean
?
<EOS>
`
`
If
Peter
Piper
picked
a
peck
of
pickled
pepper
,
where
's
the
peck
,
"
"
&
c.
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Though
he
said
this
gaily
,
he
said
it
with
a
perplexed
and
inquisitive
face
,
as
if
he
actually
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Look
on
to
the
end
---
"
Lightwood
was
beginning
to
remonstrate
,
when
he
caught
at
the
words
:
  
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
See
now
!
<EOS>
That
's
exactly
what
I
am
incapable
of
doing
.
<EOS>
How
very
acute
you
are
,
Mortimer
,
in
finding
my
weak
place
!
<EOS>
When
we
were
at
school
together
,
I
got
up
my
lessons
at
the
last
moment
,
day
by
day
and
bit
by
bit
;
now
we
are
out
in
life
together
,
I
get
up
my
lessons
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
In
the
present
task
I
have
not
got
beyond
this
:
---
I
am
bent
on
finding
Lizzie
,
and
I
mean
to
find
her
,
and
I
will
take
any
means
of
finding
her
that
offer
themselves
.
<EOS>
Fair
means
or
foul
means
,
are
all
alike
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
---
for
information
---
what
does
that
mean
?
<EOS>
When
I
have
found
her
I
may
ask
you
---
also
for
information
---
<EOS>
what
do
I
mean
now
?
<EOS>
But
it
would
be
premature
in
this
stage
,
and
it
's
not
the
character
of
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
was
shaking
his
head
over
the
air
with
which
his
friend
held
forth
thus
---
an
air
so
whimsically
open
and
argumentative
as
almost
to
deprive
what
he
said
of
the
appearance
of
evasion
---
when
a
shuffling
was
heard
at
the
outer
door
,
and
then
an
undecided
knock
,
as
though
some
hand
were
groping
for
the
knocker
.
<EOS>
"
The
frolicsome
youth
of
the
neighbourhood
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
whom
I
should
be
delighted
to
pitch
from
this
elevation
into
the
church
-
yard
below
,
without
any
intermediate
ceremonies
,
have
probably
turned
the
lamp
out
.
<EOS>
I
am
on
duty
to
-
night
,
and
will
see
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
friend
had
barely
had
time
to
recall
the
unprecedented
gleam
of
determination
with
which
he
had
spoken
of
finding
this
girl
,
and
which
had
faded
out
of
him
with
the
breath
of
the
spoken
words
,
when
Eugene
came
back
,
ushering
in
a
most
disgraceful
shadow
of
a
man
,
shaking
from
head
to
foot
,
and
clothed
in
shabby
grease
and
smear
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
interesting
gentleman
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
is
the
son
---
the
occasionally
rather
trying
son
,
for
he
has
his
failings
---
of
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Mortimer
---
Mr.
Dolls
.
<EOS>
"
Eugene
had
no
idea
what
his
name
was
,
knowing
the
little
dressmaker
's
to
be
assumed
,
but
presented
him
with
easy
confidence
under
the
first
appellation
that
his
associations
suggested
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
gather
,
my
dear
Mortimer
,
"
pursued
Eugene
,
as
Lightwood
stared
at
the
obscene
visitor
,
"
from
the
manner
of
Mr.
Dolls
---
which
is
occasionally
complicated
---
that
he
desires
to
make
some
communication
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
mentioned
to
Mr.
Dolls
that
you
and
I
are
on
terms
of
confidence
,
and
have
requested
Mr.
Dolls
to
develope
his
views
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
wretched
object
being
much
embarrassed
by
holding
what
remained
of
his
hat
<EOS>
,
Eugene
airily
tossed
it
to
the
door
,
and
put
him
down
in
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
necessary
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
"
he
observed
,
"
to
wind
up
Mr.
Dolls
,
before
anything
to
any
mortal
purpose
can
be
got
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
Brandy
,
Mr.
Dolls
,
or
---
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Threepenn'orth
Rum
,
"
said
Mr.
Dolls
.
  
<EOS>
A
judiciously
small
quantity
of
the
spirit
was
given
him
in
a
wineglass
,
and
he
began
to
convey
it
to
his
mouth
,
with
all
kinds
of
falterings
and
gyrations
on
the
road
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
nerves
of
Mr.
Dolls
,
"
remarked
Eugene
to
Lightwood
,
"
are
considerably
unstrung
.
<EOS>
And
I
deem
it
on
the
whole
expedient
to
fumigate
Mr.
Dolls
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
the
shovel
from
the
grate
,
sprinkled
a
few
live
ashes
on
it
,
and
from
a
box
on
the
chimney
-
piece
took
a
few
pastiles
,
which
he
set
upon
them
;
then
,
with
great
composure
began
placidly
waving
the
shovel
in
front
of
Mr.
Dolls
,
to
cut
him
off
from
his
company
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
my
soul
,
Eugene
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lightwood
,
laughing
again
,
"
what
a
mad
fellow
you
are
!
<EOS>
Why
does
this
creature
come
to
see
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
hear
,
"
said
Wrayburn
,
very
observant
of
his
face
withal
.
<EOS>
"
Now
then
.
Speak
out
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
State
your
business
,
Dolls

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mist

said
the
visitor
,
thickly
and
huskily
.
"
<EOS>
---
'

Mist
Wrayburn

"
<EOS>
With
a
stupid
stare
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
is
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dolls
collapsed
in
his
chair
,
and
faintly
said
"
Threepenn'orth
Rum
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
do
me
the
favour
,
my
dear
Mortimer
,
to
wind
up
Mr.
Dolls
again
?
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
occupied
with
the
fumigation

"
  
<EOS>
A
similar
quantity
was
poured
into
his
glass
,
and
he
got
it
to
his
lips
by
similar
circuitous
ways
.
<EOS>
Having
drunk
it
,
Mr.
Dolls
,
with
an
evident
fear
of
running
down
again
unless
he
made
haste
,
proceeded

Do

Mist
Wrayburn

"
  
<EOS>
With
a
glance
at
his
friend
,
Eugene
replied
to
the
question
sternly
,
"
I
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
er
man
,
"
said
Mr.
Dolls
,
trying
to
smite
himself
on
the
breast
,
but
bringing
his
hand
to
bear
upon
the
vicinity
of
his
eye
,
"

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What

demanded
Eugene
,
still
sternly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Er
give
up
that
drection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
got
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
most
laborious
attempt
at
pride
and
dignity
,
Mr.
Dolls
rolled
his
head
for
some
time
,
awakening
the
highest
expectations
,
and
then
answered
,
as
if
it
were
the
happiest
point
that
could
possibly
be
expected
of
him
:
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dolls
,
collapsing
in
the
drowsiest
manner
after
his
late
intellectual
triumph
,
replied
:
"
<EOS>
Threepenn'orth

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wind

Wrayburn
;

"
  
<EOS>
"
Eugene
,
Eugene
,
"
urged
Lightwood
in
a
low
voice
,
as
he
complied
,
"
can
you
stoop
to
the
use
of
such
an
instrument
as
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
"
was
the
reply
,
made
with
that
former
gleam
of
determination
,
"
that
I
would
find
her
out

any
means

fair

foul

<EOS>
These
are
foul

I
'll
take
them

if
I

tempted

the

Can

<EOS>
Do

Ten

Fifteen

himself

"
Get

"
rejoined
Eugene
,
tapping
his
palsied
head
with
the
fire
-
shovel
,
as
it
sank
on
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"
What
comes
next
?
"
  
<EOS>
Making
a
dignified
attempt
to
gather
himself
together
,
but
,
as
it
were
,
dropping
half
a
dozen
pieces
of
himself
while
he
tried
in
vain
to
pick
up
one
,
Mr.
Dolls
,
swaying
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
regarded
his
questioner
with
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
haughty
smile
and
a
scornful
glance
.
  
<EOS>
"
She

it
then

said
Eugene
;
adding
very
heartily
under
his
breath
,
"
---
You
Brute

<EOS>
Get
it
,
and
bring
it
here
to
me

and
earn
the
money
for
sixty
threepenn'orths
of
rum
,
and
drink
them
all
,
one
a
top
of
another
,
and
drink
yourself
dead
with
all
possible
expedition
.
<EOS>
"
The
latter
clauses
of
these
special
instructions
he
addressed
to
the
fire
,
as
he
gave
it
back
the
ashes
he
had
taken
from
it
,
and
replaced
the
shovel
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Dolls
now
struck
out
the
highly
unexpected
discovery
that
he
had
been
insulted
by
Lightwood
,
and
stated
his
desire
to
"
have
it
out
with
him
"
on
the
spot
,
and
defied
him
to
come
on
,
upon
the
liberal
terms
of
a
sovereign
to
a
halfpenny
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dolls
then
fell
a
crying
,
and
then
exhibited
a
tendency
to
fall
asleep
.
<EOS>
This
last
manifestation
as
by
far
the
most
alarming
,
by
reason
of
its
threatening
his
prolonged
stay
on
the
premises
,
necessitated
vigorous
measures
.
<EOS>
Eugene
picked
up
his
worn
-
out
hat
with
the
tongs
,
clapped
it
on
his
head
,
and
,
taking
him
by
the
collar
---
all
this
at
arm
's
length
---
conducted
him
down
stairs
and
out
of
the
precincts
into
Fleet
Street
.
<EOS>
There
,
he
turned
his
face
westward
,
and
left
him
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
got
back
,
Lightwood
was
standing
over
the
fire
,
brooding
in
a
sufficiently
low
-
spirited
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
wash
my
hands
of
Mr.
Dolls
---
physically
---
"
said
Eugene
,
"
and
be
with
you
again
directly
,
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
much
prefer
,
"
retorted
Mortimer
,
"
your
washing
your
hands
of
Mr.
Dolls
,
morally
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
would
I
,
"
said
Eugene
;
"
but
you
see
,
dear
boy
,
I
ca
n't
do
without
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
minute
or
two
he
resumed
his
chair
,
as
perfectly
unconcerned
as
usual
,
and
rallied
his
friend
on
having
so
narrowly
escaped
the
prowess
of
their
muscular
visitor
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
be
amused
on
this
theme
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
restlessly
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
make
almost
any
theme
amusing
to
me
,
Eugene
,
but
not
this
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
cried
Eugene
,
"
I
am
a
little
ashamed
of
it
myself
,
and
therefore
let
us
change
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
deplorably
underhanded
,
"
said
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
unworthy
of
you
,
this
setting
on
of
such
a
shameful
scout
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
changed
the
subject
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Eugene
,
airily
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
found
a
new
one
in
that
word
,
scout
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
like
Patience
on
a
mantelpiece
frowning
at
Dolls
,
but
sit
down
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
something
that
you
really
will
find
amusing
.
<EOS>
Take
a
cigar
.
<EOS>
Look
at
this
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
light
it
---
draw
one
puff
---
breathe
the
smoke
out
<EOS>
---
there
it
goes
---
it
's
Dolls
!
<EOS>
---
it
's
gone
---
and
being
gone
<EOS>
you
are
a
man
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
subject
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
after
lighting
a
cigar
,
and
comforting
himself
with
a
whiff
or
two
,
"
was
scouts
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Exactly
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
droll
that
I
never
go
out
after
dark
,
but
I
find
myself
attended
,
always
by
one
scout
,
and
often
by
two
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
took
his
cigar
from
his
lips
in
surprise
,
and
looked
at
his
friend
,
as
if
with
a
latent
suspicion
that
there
must
be
a
jest
or
hidden
meaning
in
his
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
On
my
honour
,
no
,
"
said
Wrayburn
,
answering
the
look
and
smiling
carelessly
;
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
your
supposing
so
,
but
on
my
honour
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
say
what
I
mean
.
<EOS>
I
never
go
out
after
dark
,
but
I
find
myself
in
the
ludicrous
situation
of
being
followed
and
observed
at
a
distance
,
always
by
one
scout
,
and
often
by
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
,
Eugene
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sure
?
<EOS>
My
dear
boy
,
they
are
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
no
process
out
against
you
.
<EOS>
The
Jews
only
threaten
.
<EOS>
They
have
done
nothing
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
they
know
where
to
find
you
,
and
I
represent
you
.
<EOS>
Why
take
the
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Observe
the
legal
mind
!
"
<EOS>
remarked
Eugene
,
turning
round
to
the
furniture
again
,
with
an
air
of
indolent
rapture
.
<EOS>
"
Observe
the
dyer
's
hand
,
assimilating
itself
to
what
it
works
in
,
---
or
would
work
in
,
if
anybody
would
give
it
anything
to
do
.
<EOS>
Respected
solicitor
,
it
's
not
that
.
<EOS>
The
schoolmaster
's
abroad

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
schoolmaster
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
schoolmaster
and
the
pupil
are
both
abroad
.
<EOS>
Why
,
how
soon
you
rust
in
my
absence
!
<EOS>
You
do
n't
understand
yet
?
<EOS>
Those
fellows
who
were
here
one
night
.
<EOS>
They
are
the
scouts
I
speak
of
,
as
doing
me
the
honor
to
attend
me
after
dark
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
has
this
been
going
on
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Lightwood
,
opposing
a
serious
face
to
the
laugh
of
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
apprehend
it
has
been
going
on
,
ever
since
a
certain
person
went
off
.
<EOS>
Probably
,
it
had
been
going
on
some
little
time
before
I
noticed
it
:
which
would
bring
it
to
about
that
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
they
suppose
you
to
have
inveigled
her
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mortimer
,
you
know
the
absorbing
nature
of
my
professional
occupations
;
I
really
have
not
had
leisure
to
think
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
asked
them
what
they
want
?
<EOS>
Have
you
objected
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
should
I
ask
them
what
they
want
,
<EOS>
dear
fellow
,
when
I
am
indifferent
what
they
want
?
<EOS>
Why
should
I
express
objection
,
when
I
do
n't
object
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
in
your
most
reckless
mood
.
<EOS>
But
you
called
the
situation
just
now
,
a
ludicrous
one
;
and
most
men
object
to
that
,
even
those
who
are
utterly
indifferent
to
everything
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
charm
me
,
Mortimer
,
with
your
reading
of
my
weaknesses
.
<EOS>
(
By
-
the
-
by
,
that
very
word

Reading
,
in
its
critical
use
,
always
charms

<EOS>
An

Reading

Reading

are
phrases
ever
youthful
and
delightful
.
)
<EOS>
I
was
mentioning
your
perception
of
my
weaknesses
.
<EOS>
I
own
to
the
weakness
of
objecting
to
occupy
a
ludicrous
position
,
and
therefore
I
transfer
the
position
to
the
scouts
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
wish
,
Eugene
,
you
would
speak
a
little
more
soberly
and
plainly
,
if
it
were
only
out
of
consideration
for
my
feeling
less
at
ease
than
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Then
soberly
and
plainly
,
Mortimer
,
I
goad
the
schoolmaster
to
madness
.
<EOS>
I
make
the
schoolmaster
,
so
ridiculous
,
and
so
aware
of
being
made
ridiculous
,
that
I
see
him
chafe
and
fret
at
every
pore
when
we
cross
one
another
.
<EOS>
The
amiable
occupation
has
been
the
solace
of
my
life
,
since
I
was
baulked
in
the
manner
unnecessary
to
recall
.
<EOS>
I
have
derived
inexpressible
comfort
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
it
thus
:
I
stroll
out
after
dark
,
stroll
a
little
way
,
look
in
at
a
window
and
furtively
look
out
for
the
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
Sooner
or
later
,
I
perceive
the
schoolmaster
on
the
watch
;
sometimes
accompanied
by
his
hopeful
pupil
;
oftener
,
pupil
-
less
.
<EOS>
Having
made
sure
of
his
watching
me
,
I
tempt
him
on
,
all
over
London
.
<EOS>
One
night
I
go
east
,
another
night
north
,
in
a
few
nights
I
go
all
round
the
compass
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
I
walk
;
sometimes
,
I
proceed
in
cabs
,
draining
the
pocket
of
the
schoolmaster
who
then
follows
in
cabs
.
<EOS>
I
study
and
get
up
abstruse
No
Thoroughfares
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
With
Venetian
mystery
I
seek
those
No
Thoroughfares
at
night
,
glide
into
them
by
means
of
dark
courts
,
tempt
the
schoolmaster
to
follow
,
turn
suddenly
,
and
catch
him
before
he
can
retreat
.
<EOS>
Then
we
face
one
another
,
and
I
pass
him
as
unaware
of
his
existence
,
and
he
undergoes
grinding
torments
.
<EOS>
Similarly
,
I
walk
at
a
great
pace
down
a
short
street
,
rapidly
turn
the
corner
,
and
,
getting
out
of
his
view
,
as
rapidly
turn
back
.
<EOS>
I
catch
him
coming
on
post
,
again
pass
him
as
unaware
of
his
existence
,
and
again
he
undergoes
grinding
torments
.
<EOS>
Night
after
night
his
disappointment
is
acute
,
but
hope
springs
eternal
in
the
scholastic
breast
,
and
he
follows
me
again
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Thus
I
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
,
and
derive
great
benefit
from
the
healthful
exercise
.
<EOS>
When
I
do
not
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
,
for
anything
I
know
he
watches
at
the
Temple
Gate
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
an
extraordinary
story
,
"
observed
Lightwood
,
who
had
heard
it
out
with
serious
attention
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
little
hipped
,
dear
fellow
,
"
said
Eugene
;
"
you
have
been
too
sedentary
.
<EOS>
Come
and
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
you
believe
he
is
watching
now
?
"
  
"
I
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
he
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
seen
him
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
forgot
to
look
for
him
when
I
was
last
out
,
"
returned
Eugene
with
the
calmest
indifference
;
"
but
I
dare
say
he
was
there
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
Be
a
British
sportsman
and
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
.
<EOS>
It
will
do
you
good
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
hesitated
;
but
,
yielding
to
his
curiosity
,
rose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bravo
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Eugene
,
rising
too
.
<EOS>
"
Or
,
if
Yoicks
would
be
in
better
keeping
,
consider
that
I
said
Yoicks
.
<EOS>
Look
to
your
feet
,
Mortimer
,
for
we
shall
try
your
boots
.
<EOS>
When
you
are
ready
,
I
am
---
need
I
say
with
a
Hey
Ho
Chivey
,
and
likewise
with
a
Hark
Forward
,
Hark
Forward
,
Tantivy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
nothing
make
you
serious
?
"
said
Mortimer
,
laughing
through
his
gravity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
always
serious
,
but
just
now
I
am
a
little
excited
by
the
glorious
fact
that
a
southerly
wind
and
a
cloudy
sky
proclaim
a
hunting
evening
.
<EOS>
Ready
?
<EOS>
So
.
<EOS>
We
turn
out
the
lamp
and
shut
the
door
,
and
take
the
field
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
two
friends
passed
out
of
the
Temple
into
the
public
street
,
Eugene
demanded
with
a
show
of
courteous
patronage
in
which
direction
Mortimer
would
like
the
run
to
be
?
"
<EOS>
There
is
a
rather
difficult
country
about
Bethnal
Green
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
and
we
have
not
taken
in
that
direction
lately
.
<EOS>
What
is
your
opinion
of
Bethnal
Green
?
"
<EOS>
Mortimer
assented
to
Bethnal
Green
,
and
they
turned
eastward
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
when
we
come
to
St.
Paul
's
churchyard
,
"
pursued
Eugene
,
"
we
'll
loiter
artfully
,
and
I
'll
show
you
the
schoolmaster
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
they
both
saw
him
,
before
they
got
there
;
alone
,
and
stealing
after
them
in
the
shadow
of
the
houses
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Get
your
wind
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
for
I
am
off
directly
.
<EOS>
Does
it
occur
to
you
that
the
boys
of
Merry
England
will
begin
to
deteriorate
in
an
educational
light
,
if
this
lasts
long
?
<EOS>
The
schoolmaster
ca
n't
attend
to
me
and
the
boys
too
.
<EOS>
Got
your
wind
?
<EOS>
I
am
off
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
what
a
rate
he
went
,
to
breathe
the
schoolmaster
;
and
how
he
then
lounged
and
loitered
,
to
put
his
patience
to
another
kind
of
wear
;
what
preposterous
ways
he
took
,
with
no
other
object
on
earth
than
to
disappoint
and
punish
him
;
and
how
he
wore
him
out
by
every
piece
of
ingenuity
that
his
eccentric
humour
could
devise
;
all
this
Lightwood
noted
,
with
a
feeling
of
astonishment
that
so
careless
a
man
could
be
so
wary
,
and
that
so
idle
a
man
could
take
so
much
trouble
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
far
on
in
the
third
hour
of
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
,
when
he
had
brought
the
poor
dogging
wretch
round
again
into
the
City
,
he
twisted
Mortimer
up
a
few
dark
entries
,
twisted
him
into
a
little
square
court
,
twisted
him
sharp
round
again
,
and
they
almost
ran
against
Bradley
Headstone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
see
,
as
I
was
saying
,
Mortimer
,
"
remarked
Eugene
aloud
with
the
utmost
coolness
,
as
though
there
were
no
one
within
hearing
but
themselves
:
"
<EOS>
and
you
see
,
as
I
was
saying
---
undergoing
grinding
torments
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
too
strong
a
phrase
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Looking
like
the
hunted
and
not
the
hunter
,
baffled
,
worn
,
with
the
exhaustion
of
deferred
hope
and
consuming
hate
and
anger
in
his
face
,
white
-
lipped
,
wild
-
eyed
,
draggle
-
haired
,
seamed
with
jealousy
and
anger
,
and
torturing
himself
with
the
conviction
that
he
showed
it
all
<EOS>
and
they
exulted
in
it
<EOS>
,
he
went
by
them
in
the
dark
,
like
a
haggard
head
suspended
in
the
air
:
<EOS>
so
completely
did
the
force
of
his
expression
cancel
his
figure
.
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
Lightwood
was
not
an
extraordinarily
impressible
man
,
but
this
face
impressed
him
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
if
more
than
once
on
the
remainder
of
the
way
home
,
and
more
than
once
when
they
got
home
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
been
abed
in
their
respective
rooms
two
or
three
hours
,
when
Eugene
was
partly
awakened
by
hearing
a
footstep
going
about
,
and
was
fully
awakened
by
seeing
Lightwood
standing
at
his
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
wrong
,
Mortimer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
fancy
takes
you
,
then
,
for
walking
about
in
the
night
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
horribly
wakeful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
comes
that
about
,
I
wonder
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eugene
,
I
can
not
lose
sight
of
that
fellow
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Odd
!
"
said
Eugene
with
a
light
laugh
,
"
I
can
.
"
<EOS>
And
turned
over
,
and
fell
asleep
again
.
   
<EOS>
IN
THE
DARK
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
sleep
for
Bradley
Headstone
on
that
night
when
Eugene
Wrayburn
turned
so
easily
in
his
bed
;
there
was
no
sleep
for
little
Miss
Peecher
.
<EOS>
Bradley
consumed
the
lonely
hours
,
and
consumed
himself
,
in
haunting
the
spot
where
his
careless
rival
lay
a
dreaming
;
little
Miss
Peecher
wore
them
away
in
listening
for
the
return
home
of
the
master
of
her
heart
,
and
in
sorrowfully
presaging
that
much
was
amiss
with
him
.
<EOS>
Yet
more
was
amiss
with
him
than
<EOS>
Miss
Peecher
's
simply
arranged
little
work
-
box
of
thoughts
,
fitted
with
no
gloomy
and
dark
recesses
,
could
hold
.
<EOS>
For
,
the
state
of
the
man
was
murderous
.
  
<EOS>
The
state
of
the
man
was
murderous
,
and
he
knew
it
.
<EOS>
More
;
he
irritated
it
,
with
a
kind
of
perverse
pleasure
akin
to
that
which
a
sick
man
sometimes
has
in
irritating
a
wound
upon
his
body
.
<EOS>
Tied
up
all
day
with
his
disciplined
show
upon
him
,
subdued
to
the
performance
of
his
routine
of
educational
tricks
,
encircled
by
a
gabbling
crowd
,
he
broke
loose
at
night
like
at
ill
-
tames
wild
animal
.
<EOS>
Under
his
daily
restraint
,
it
was
his
compensation
,
not
his
trouble
,
to
give
a
glance
towards
his
state
at
night
,
and
to
the
freedom
of
its
being
indulged
.
<EOS>
If
great
criminals
told
the
truth
---
which
,
being
great
criminals
,
they
do
not
---
they
would
very
rarely
tell
of
their
struggles
against
the
crime
.
<EOS>
Their
struggles
are
towards
it
.
<EOS>
They
buffet
with
opposing
waves
,
to
gain
the
bloody
shore
,
not
to
recede
from
it
.
<EOS>
This
man
perfectly
comprehended
that
he
hated
his
rival
with
his
strongest
and
worst
forces
,
and
that
if
he
tracked
him
to
Lizzie
Hexam
,
his
so
doing
would
never
serve
himself
with
her
,
or
serve
her
.
<EOS>
All
his
pains
were
taken
,
to
the
end
that
he
might
incense
himself
with
the
sight
of
the
detested
figure
in
her
company
and
favour
,
in
her
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
And
he
knew
as
well
what
act
of
his
would
follow
if
he
did
,
as
he
know
that
his
mother
had
borne
him
.
<EOS>
Granted
,
that
he
may
not
have
held
it
necessary
to
make
express
mention
to
himself
of
the
one
familiar
truth
any
more
than
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
equally
well
that
he
fed
his
wrath
and
hatred
,
and
that
he
accumulated
provocation
and
self
-
justification
,
by
being
made
the
nightly
sport
of
the
reckless
and
insolent
Eugene
.
<EOS>
Knowing
all
this
,
and
still
always
going
on
with
infinite
endurance
,
pains
,
and
perseverance
,
<EOS>
would
his
dark
soul
doubt
whither
he
went
?
  
<EOS>
Baffled
,
exasperated
,
and
weary
<EOS>
,
he
lingered
opposite
the
Temple
gate
when
it
closed
on
Wrayburn
and
Lightwood
,
debating
with
himself
should
he
go
home
for
that
time
or
should
he
watch
longer
.
<EOS>
Possessed
in
his
jealousy
by
the
fixed
idea
that
Wrayburn
was
in
the
secret
,
if
it
were
not
altogether
of
his
contriving
,
Bradley
was
as
confident
of
getting
the
better
of
him
at
last
by
sullenly
sticking
to
him
,
as
he
would
have
been
---
and
often
had
been
---
of
mastering
any
piece
of
study
in
the
way
of
his
vocation
,
by
the
like
slow
persistent
process
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
rapid
passions
and
sluggish
intelligence
,
it
had
served
him
often
and
should
serve
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
suspicion
crossed
him
as
he
rested
in
a
doorway
with
his
eyes
upon
the
temple
gate
,
that
perhaps
she
was
even
concealed
in
that
set
of
Chambers
.
<EOS>
It
would
furnish
another
reason
for
Wrayburn
's
purposeless
walks
,
and
it
might
be
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
it
and
thought
of
it
,
until
he
resolved
to
steal
up
the
stairs
,
if
the
gate
-
keeper
would
let
him
through
,
and
listen
.
<EOS>
So
,
the
haggard
head
suspended
in
the
air
flitted
across
the
road
,
like
the
spectre
of
one
of
the
many
heads
erst
hoisted
upon
neighbouring
Temple
Bar
,
and
stopped
before
the
watchman
.
  
<EOS>
The
watchman
looked
at
it
,
and
asked
:
"
Who
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
late
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
came
back
with
Mr.
Lightwood
,
I
know
,
near
upon
two
hours
ago
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
has
gone
to
bed
,
I
'll
put
a
paper
in
his
letter
-
box
.
<EOS>
I
am
expected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
watchman
said
no
more
,
but
opened
the
gate
,
though
rather
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
Seeing
,
however
,
that
the
visitor
went
straight
and
fast
in
the
right
direction
,
he
seemed
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
The
haggard
head
floated
up
the
dark
staircase
,
and
softly
descended
nearer
to
the
floor
outside
the
outer
door
of
the
chambers
.
<EOS>
The
doors
of
the
rooms
within
,
appeared
to
be
standing
open
.
<EOS>
There
were
rays
of
candlelight
from
one
of
them
,
and
there
was
the
sound
of
a
footstep
going
about
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
voices
.
<EOS>
The
words
they
uttered
were
not
distinguishable
,
but
they
were
both
the
voices
of
men
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
the
voices
were
silent
,
and
there
was
no
sound
of
footstep
,
and
the
inner
light
went
out
.
<EOS>
If
Lightwood
could
have
seen
the
face
which
kept
him
awake
,
staring
and
listening
in
the
darkness
outside
the
door
as
he
spoke
of
it
,
he
might
have
been
less
disposed
to
sleep
,
through
the
remainder
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
there
,
"
said
Bradley
;
"
but
she
might
have
been
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
head
arose
to
its
former
height
from
the
ground
,
floated
down
the
staircase
again
,
and
passed
on
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
A
man
was
standing
there
,
in
parley
with
the
watchman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
the
watchman
.
<EOS>
"
Here
he
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
Perceiving
himself
to
be
the
antecedent
,
Bradley
looked
from
the
watchman
to
the
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
man
is
leaving
a
letter
for
Mr.
Lightwood
,
"
the
watchman
explained
,
showing
it
in
his
hand
;
"
and
I
was
mentioning
that
a
person
had
just
gone
up
to
Mr.
Lightwood
's
chambers
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
the
same
business
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Bradley
,
glancing
at
the
man
who
was
a
stranger
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
the
man
assented
in
a
surly
way
;
"
my
letter
---
it
's
wrote
by
my
daughter
,
but
it
's
mine
---
is
about
my
business
,
and
my
business
ai
n't
nobody
else
's
business
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Bradley
passed
out
at
the
gate
with
an
undecided
foot
,
he
heard
it
shut
behind
him
,
and
heard
the
footstep
of
the
man
coming
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Scuse
me
,
"
said
the
man
,
who
appeared
to
have
been
drinking
,
and
rather
stumbled
at
him
than
touched
him
,
to
attract
his
attention
;
 
"
<EOS>
but
might
you
be
acquainted
with
the
T'other
Governor
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
With
whom
?
"
asked
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
,
"
returned
the
man
,
pointing
backward
over
his
right
shoulder
with
his
right
thumb
,
"
the
T'other
Governor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
look
here
,
"
hooking
his
proposition
on
his
left
-
hand
fingers
with
the
forefinger
of
his
right
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
two
Governors
,
ai
n't
there
?
<EOS>
One
and
one
,
two
---
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
<EOS>
my
first
finger
,
he
's
one
,
ai
n't
he
?
<EOS>
Well
;
might
you
be
acquainted
with
my
middle
finger
,
the
T'other
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
quite
as
much
of
him
,
"
said
Bradley
,
with
a
frown
and
a
distant
look
before
him
,
"
as
I
want
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hooroar
!
"
cried
the
man
.
"
<EOS>
Hooroar
T'other
t'other
Governor
.
<EOS>
Hooroar
T'otherest
Governor
!
<EOS>
I
am
of
your
way
of
thinkin
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
make
such
a
noise
at
this
dead
hour
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
talking
about
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
T'otherest
Governor
,
"
replied
the
man
,
becoming
hoarsely
confidential
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
T'other
Governor
<EOS>
he
's
always
joked
his
jokes
<EOS>
agin
me
,
owing
,
as
I
believe
,
to
my
being
a
honest
man
as
gets
my
living
by
the
sweat
of

<EOS>
"
What
is
that
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
T'otherest
Governor
,
"
returned
the
man
in
a
tone
of
injured
innocence
,
"
if
you
do
n't
care
to
hear
no
more
,
do
n't
hear
no
more
.
<EOS>
You
begun
it
.
<EOS>
You
said
,
and
likeways
showed
pretty
plain
,
as
you
warn't
by
no
means
friendly
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
seek
to
force
my
company
nor
yet
my
opinions
on
no
man
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
honest
man
,
that
's
what
I
am
.
<EOS>
Put
me
in
the
dock
anywhere
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
care
where
---
and
I
says
,
`
`
My
Lord
,
I
am
a
honest
man

"
<EOS>
"
Put
me
in
the
witness
-
box
anywhere
<EOS>
---
I
do
n't
care
where
---
and
<EOS>
I
says
the
same
to
his
lordship

I
kisses
the

<EOS>
I
do
n't
kiss
my

I
kisses
the

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
much
in
deference
to
these
strong
testimonials
to
character
,
as
in
his
restless
casting
about
for
any
way
or
help
towards
the
discovery
on
which
he
was
concentrated
,
that
Bradley
Headstone
replied
:
"
You
need
n't
take
offence
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
mean
to
stop
you
.
<EOS>
You
were
too
loud
in
the
open
street
;
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
'
Totherest
Governor
,
"
replied
Mr.
Riderhood
,
mollified
and
mysterious
,
"
I
know
wot
it
is
to
be
loud
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
wot
<EOS>
it
is
to
be
soft
.
<EOS>
Nat'rally
I
do
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
wonder
if
I
did
not
,
being
by
the
Chris'en
name
of
Roger
,
which
took
it
arter
my
own
father
,
which
took
it
from
his
own
father
,
though
which
of
our
fam'ly
fust
took
it
nat'ral
<EOS>
I
will
not
in
any
ways
mislead
you
by

to
say
.
<EOS>
And
wishing
that
your
elth
may
be
better
than
your
looks
,
which
your
inside
must
be
bad
indeed
if
it
's
on
the
footing
of
your
out
.
"
  
<EOS>
Startled
by
the
implication
that
his
face
revealed
too
much
of
his
mind
,
Bradley
made
an
effort
to
clear
his
brow
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
worth
knowing
what
this
strange
man
's
business
was
with
Lightwood
,
or
Wrayburn
,
or
both
,
at
such
an
unseasonable
hour
.
<EOS>
He
set
himself
to
find
out
,
for
the
man
might
prove
to
be
a
messenger
between
those
two
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
call
at
the
Temple
late
,
"
he
remarked
,
with
a
lumbering
show
of
ease
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wish
I
may
die
,
"
cried
Mr.
Riderhood
,
with
a
hoarse
laugh
,
"
if
I
warn't
a
goin'
to
say
the
self

same
words
to
you

T'otherest
Governor

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
chanced
so
with
me
"
said
Bradley
,
looking
disconcertedly
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
chanced
so
with
me
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
how
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
mind
telling
you
?
<EOS>
I
'm
a
Deputy
Lock

keeper
up
the
river

I
was
off
duty
yes'day

<EOS>
"
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
I
come
to
London
to
look
arter
my
private
affairs
.
<EOS>
My
private
affairs
is
to
get
appinted
to
the
Lock
as
reg'lar
keeper
at
fust
hand
,
and
to
have
the
law
of
a
busted
B'low

Bridge
steamer
which
drownded
of

<EOS>
I
ai
n't
a
goin'

"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
looked
at
hi
,
as
though
he
were
claiming
to
be
a
Ghost
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
steamer
,
"
said
Mr.
Riderhood
,
obstinately
,
"
run
me
down
and
drownded
of
me
.
<EOS>
Interference
on
the
part
of
other
parties
brought
me
round
;
but
I
never
asked
'em
to
bring
me
round
,
nor
yet
the
steamer
never
asked
'em
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
be
paid
for
the
life
as
the
steamer
took
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
that
your
business
at
Mr.
Lightwood
's
chambers
in
the
middle
of
the
night
?
"
asked
Bradley
,
eyeing
him
with
distrust
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
and
to
get
a
writing
to
be
fust
-
hand
Lock
Keeper
.
<EOS>
A
recommendation
in
writing
being
looked
for
,
who
else
ought
to
give
it
to
me
?
<EOS>
As
I
says
in
the
letter
in
my
daughter
's
hand
,
with
my
mark
put
to
it
to
make
it
good
in
law
,
Who
but
you
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
ought
to
hand
over
this
here
stifficate
,
and
who
<EOS>
but
you
ought
to
go
in
for
damages
on
my
account
agin
the
Steamer
?
<EOS>
For
(
as
I
says
under
my
mark
)
I
have
had
trouble
enough
along
of
you
and
your
friend
.
<EOS>
If
you
,
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
had
backed
me
good
and
true
,
and
if
the
T'other
Governor
had
took
me
down
correct
(
I
says
under
my
mark
)
,
I
should
have
been
worth
money
at
the
present
time
,
instead
of
having
a
barge
-
load
of
bad
names
chucked
at
me
,
and
being
forced
to
eat
my
words
,
which
is
a
unsatisfying
sort
of
food
wotever
a
man
's
appetite
!
<EOS>
And
when
you
mention
the
middle
of
the
night
,
T'otherest
Governor
,
"
growled
Mr.
Riderhood
,
winding
up
his
monotonous
summary
of
his
wrongs
,
"
throw
your
eye
on
this
here
bundle
under
my
arm
,
and
bear
in
mind
that
I
'm
a
walking
back
to
my
Lock
,
and
that
the
Temple
laid
upon
my
line
of
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
's
face
had
changed
during
this
latter
recital
,
and
he
had
observed
the
speaker
with
a
more
sustained
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
"
said
he
,
after
a
pause
,
during
which
they
walked
on
side
by
side
,
"
that
I
believe
I
could
tell
you
your
name
,
if
I
tried
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Prove
your
opinion
,
"
was
the
answer
,
accompanied
with
a
stop
and
a
stare
.
<EOS>
"
Try
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
name
is
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
blest
if
it
ai
n't
,
"
returned
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
know
your'n
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
quite
another
think
,
"
said
Bradley
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
supposed
you
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Bradley
walked
on
meditating
,
the
Rogue
walked
on
at
his
side
muttering
.
<EOS>
The
purport
of
the
muttering
was
:
"
that
Rogue
Riderhood
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
seemed
to
be
made
public
property
on
,
now
,
and
that
every
man
seemed
to
think
himself
free
to
handle
his
name
as
if
it
was
a
Street
Pump
.
<EOS>
"
The
purport
of
the
meditating
was
:
"
Here
is
an
instrument
.
<EOS>
Can
I
use
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
walked
along
the
Strand
,
and
into
Pall
Mall
,
and
had
turned
up
-
hill
towards
Hyde
Park
Corner
;
Bradley
Headstone
waiting
on
the
pace
and
lead
of
Riderhood
,
and
leaving
him
to
indicate
the
course
.
<EOS>
So
slow
were
the
schoolmaster
's
thoughts
,
and
so
indistinct
his
purposes
when
they
were
but
tributary
to
the
one
absorbing
purpose
---
or
rather
when
,
like
dark
trees
under
a
stormy
sky
,
they
only
lined
the
long
vista
at
the
end
of
which
he
saw
those
two
figures
of
Wrayburn
and
Lizzie
on
which
his
eyes
were
fixed
---
that
at
least
a
good
half
-
mile
was
traversed
before
he
spoke
again
.
<EOS>
Even
then
,
it
was
only
to
ask
:
  
"
Where
is
your
Lock
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Twenty
mile
and
odd
---
call
it
five
-
and
-
twenty
mile
and
odd
,
if
you
like
---
up
stream
,
"
was
the
sullen
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
it
called
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Plashwater
Weir
Mill
Lock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
was
to
offer
you
five
shillings
;
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
I
'd
take
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
The
schoolmaster
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
produced
two
half
-
crowns
,
and
placed
them
in
Mr.
Riderhood
's
palm
:
who
stopped
at
a
convenient
doorstep
to
ring
them
both
,
before
acknowledging
their
receipt
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
one
thing
about
you
,
T'otherest
Governor
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
faring
on
again
,
"
as
looks
well
and
goes
fur
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
ready
-
money
man
.
<EOS>
Now
;
"
when
he
had
carefully
pocketed
the
coins
on
that
side
of
himself
which
was
furthest
from
his
new
friend
;
"
what
's
this
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
o
'
course
I
know
that
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
as
arguing
something
that
was
self
-
evident
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
'
course
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
as
no
man
in
his
right
senses
would
suppose
as
anything
would
make
me
give
it
up
agin
when
I
'd
once
got
it
.
<EOS>
But
what
do
you
want
for
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
want
anything
for
it
.
<EOS>
Or
if
I
do
want
anything
for
it
,
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bradley
gave
this
answer
in
a
stolid
,
vacant
,
and
self
-
communing
manner
,
which
Mr.
Riderhood
found
very
extraordinary
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
goodwill
towards
this
Wrayburn
,
"
said
Bradley
,
coming
to
the
name
in
a
reluctant
and
forced
way
,
as
if
he
were
dragged
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
have
I.
"
  
Riderhood
nodded
,
and
asked
:
"
Is
it
for
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
as
much
for
that
as
anything
else
.
<EOS>
It
's
something
to
be
agreed
with
,
on
a
subject
that
occupies
so
much
of
one
's
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
do
n't
agree
with
you
,
"
returned
Mr.
Riderhood
,
bluntly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
It
do
n't
,
T'otherest
Governor
,
and
it
's
<EOS>
no
use
a
lookin
'
as
if
you
wanted
to
make
out
that
it
did
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
it
rankles
in
you
.
<EOS>
It
rankles
in
you
,
rusts
in
you
,
and
pisons
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
that
it
does
so
,
"
returned
Bradley
with
quivering
lips
;
"
is
there
no
cause
for
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cause
enough
,
I
'll
bet
a
pound
!
"
cried
Mr.
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
yourself
declared
that
the
fellow
has
heaped
provocations
,
insults
,
and
affronts
on
you
,
or
something
to
that
effect
?
<EOS>
He
has
done
the
same
by
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
made
of
venomous
insults
and
affronts
,
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
.
<EOS>
Are
you
so
hopeful
or
so
stupid
,
as
not
to
know
that
he
and
the
other
will
treat
your
application
with
contempt
,
and
light
their
cigars
with
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
wonder
if
they
did
,
by
George
!
"
<EOS>
said
Riderhood
,
turning
angry
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
they
did
!
<EOS>
They
will
.
<EOS>
Let
me
ask
you
a
question
.
<EOS>
I
know
something
more
than
your
name
about
you
;
I
knew
something
about
Gaffer
Hexam
.
<EOS>
When
did
you
last
set
eyes
upon
his
daughter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
I
last
set
eyes
upon
his
daughter
,
T'otherest
Governor
?
"
 
<EOS>
repeated
Mr.
Riderhood
,
growing
intentionally
slower
of
comprehension
as
the
other
quickened
in
his
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ye
.
<EOS>
Not
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
To
see
her
---
anywhere
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Rogue
had
got
the
clue
he
wanted
,
thought
he
held
it
with
a
clumsy
hand
.
<EOS>
Looking
perplexedly
at
the
passionate
face
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
work
out
a
sum
in
his
mind
,
he
slowly
answered
:
"
I
ai
n't
set
eyes
upon
her
---
never
once
---
not
since
the
day
of
Gaffer
's
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
her
well
,
by
sight
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
I
did
!
<EOS>
No
one
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
know
him
as
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
him
?
"
asked
Riderhood
,
taking
off
his
hat
and
rubbing
his
forehead
,
as
he
directed
a
dull
look
at
his
questioner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Curse
the
name
!
<EOS>
Is
it
so
agreeable
to
you
that
you
want
to
hear
it
again
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Him
!
"
said
Riderhood
,
who
had
craftily
worked
the
schoolmaster
into
this
corner
,
that
he
might
again
take
note
of
his
face
under
its
evil
possession
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
know
him
among
a
thousand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
---
"
Bradley
tried
to
ask
it
quietly
;
but
,
do
what
he
might
with
his
voice
,
he
could
not
subdue
his
face
;
---
"
did
you
ever
see
them
together
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
The
Rogue
had
got
the
clue
in
both
hands
now
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
'em
together
,
T'otherest
Governor
,
on
the
very
day
when
Gaffer
was
towed
ashore
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
could
have
hidden
a
reserved
piece
of
information
from
the
sharp
eyes
of
a
whole
inquisitive
class
,
but
he
could
not
veil
from
the
eyes
of
the
ignorant
Riderhood
the
withheld
question
next
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"
You

put
it
plain
if
you
want
it
answered

"
thought
the
Rogue
,
doggedly
;
"
I

going
a
wolunteering

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
was
he
insolent
to
her
too
?
"
asked
Bradley
after
a
struggle
.
"
<EOS>
Or
did
he
make
a
show
of
being
kind
to
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
made
a
show
of
being
most
uncommon
kind
to
her
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
George
!
<EOS>
now
I
---
"
  
<EOS>
His
flying
off
at
a
tangent
was
indisputably
natural
.
<EOS>
Bradley
looked
at
him
for
the
reason
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
think
of
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Riderhood
,
evasively
,
for
he
was
substituting
those
words
for
"
Now
I
see
you
so
jealous
,
"
which
was
the
phrase
really
in
his
mind
;
"
P'r'aps
he
went
and
took
me
down
wrong
,
a
purpose
,
on
account
o
'
being
sweet
upon
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
baseness
of
confirming
him
in
this
suspicion
or
pretence
of
one
(
for
he
could
not
have
really
entertained
it
)
,
was
a
line
's
breadth
beyond
the
mark
the
schoolmaster
had
reached
.
<EOS>
The
baseness
of
communing
and
intriguing
with
the
fellow
who
would
have
set
that
stain
upon
her
,
and
upon
her
brother
too
,
as
attained
.
<EOS>
The
line
's
breadth
further
,
lay
beyond
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
reply
,
but
walked
on
with
a
lowering
face
.
  
<EOS>
What
he
might
gain
by
this
acquaintance
,
he
could
not
work
out
in
his
slow
and
cumbrous
thoughts
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
an
injury
against
the
object
of
his
hatred
,
and
that
was
something
;
though
it
was
less
than
he
supposed
,
for
there
dwelt
in
the
man
no
such
deadly
rage
and
resentment
as
burned
in
his
own
breast
.
<EOS>
The
man
knew
her
,
and
might
by
a
fortunate
chance
see
her
,
or
hear
of
her
;
that
was
something
,
as
enlisting
one
pair
of
eyes
and
ears
the
more
.
<EOS>
The
man
was
a
bad
man
,
and
willing
enough
to
be
in
his
pay
.
<EOS>
That
was
something
,
for
his
own
state
and
purpose
were
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
,
and
he
seemed
to
derive
a
vague
support
from
the
possession
of
a
congenial
instrument
,
though
it
might
never
be
used
.
  
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
stood
still
,
and
asked
Riderhood
point
-
blank
if
he
knew
where
she
was
?
<EOS>
Clearly
,
he
did
not
know
.
<EOS>
He
asked
Riderhood
if
he
would
be
willing
,
in
case
any
intelligence
of
her
,
or
of
Wrayburn
as
seeking
her
or
associating
with
her
,
should
fall
in
his
way
,
to
communicate
it
if
it
were
paid
for
?
<EOS>
He
would
be
very
willing
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
was
"
agin
<EOS>
'em
both
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
with
an
oath
,
and
for
why
?
<EOS>
'Cause
they
had
both
stood
betwixt
him
and
his
getting
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
long
then
,
"
said
Bradley
Headstone
,
after
some
more
discourse
to
this
effect
,
"
before
we
see
one
another
again
.
<EOS>
Here
is
the
country
road
,
and
here
is
the
day
.
<EOS>
Both
have
come
upon
me
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
but
,
T'otherest
Governor
,
"
urged
Mr.
Riderhood
,
"
I
do
n't
know
where
to
find
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
know
where
to
find
you
,
and
I
'll
come
to
your
Lock
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
.
<EOS>
T'otherest
Governor
,
"
urged
Mr.
Riderhood
again
,
"
no
luck
never
come
yet
of
a
dry
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Let
's
wet
it
,
in
a
mouthful
of
rum
and
milk
,
T'otherest
Governor
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
,
assenting
,
went
with
him
into
an
early
public
-
house
,
haunted
by
unsavoury
smells
of
musty
hay
and
stale
straw
,
where
returning
carts
,
farmers
'
men
,
gaunt
dogs
,
fowls
of
a
beery
breed
,
and
certain
human
nightbirds
fluttering
home
to
roost
,
were
solacing
themselves
after
their
several
manners
;
and
where
not
one
of
the
nightbirds
hovering
about
the
sloppy
bar
failed
to
discern
at
a
glance
in
the
passion
-
wasted
nightbird
with
respectable
feathers
,
the
worst
nightbird
of
all
.
  
<EOS>
An
inspiration
of
affection
for
a
half
-
drunken
carter
going
his
way
led
to
Mr.
Riderhood
's
being
elevated
on
a
high
heap
of
baskets
on
a
waggon
,
and
pursuing
his
journey
recumbent
on
his
back
with
his
head
on
his
bundle
.
<EOS>
Bradley
then
turned
to
retrace
his
steps
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
struck
off
through
little
-
traversed
ways
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
reached
school
and
home
.
<EOS>
Up
came
the
sun
to
find
him
washed
and
brushed
,
methodically
dressed
in
decent
black
coat
and
waistcoat
,
decent
formal
black
tie
,
and
pepper
-
and
-
salt
pantaloons
,
with
his
decent
silver
watch
in
its
pocket
,
and
its
decent
hair
-
guard
round
his
neck
;
a
scholastic
huntsman
clad
for
the
field
,
with
his
fresh
pack
yelping
and
barking
around
him
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
more
really
bewitched
than
the
miserable
creatures
of
the
much
-
lamented
times
,
who
accused
themselves
of
impossibilities
under
a
contagion
of
horror
and
the
strongly
suggestive
influences
of
Torture
,
he
had
been
ridden
hard
by
Evil
Spirits
in
the
night
that
was
newly
gone
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
spurred
and
whipped
any
heavily
sweated
.
<EOS>
If
a
record
of
the
sport
had
usurped
the
places
of
the
peaceful
texts
from
Scripture
on
the
wall
,
the
most
advanced
of
the
scholars
might
have
taken
fright
and
run
away
from
the
master
.
   
<EOS>
MEANING
MISCHIEF
.
 
<EOS>
Up
came
the
sun
,
streaming
all
over
London
,
and
in
its
glorious
impartiality
even
condescending
to
make
prismatic
sparkles
in
the
whiskers
of
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
as
he
sat
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
In
need
of
some
brightening
from
without
,
was
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
,
for
he
had
the
air
of
being
dull
enough
within
,
and
looked
grievously
discontented
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle
faced
her
lord
.
<EOS>
The
happy
pair
of
swindlers
,
with
the
comfortable
tie
between
them
that
each
had
swindled
the
other
,
sat
moodily
observant
of
the
tablecloth
.
<EOS>
Things
looked
so
gloomy
in
the
breakfast
-
room
,
albeit
on
the
sunny
side
of
Sackville
Street
,
that
any
of
the
family
tradespeople
glancing
through
the
blinds
might
have
taken
the
hint
to
send
in
his
account
and
press
for
it
.
<EOS>
but
this
,
indeed
,
most
of
the
family
tradespeople
had
already
done
,
without
the
hint
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
that
you
have
had
no
money
at
all
,
ever
since
we
have
been
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
seems
to
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
,
"
to
have
been
the
case
,
may
possibly
have
been
the
case
.
<EOS>
It
does
n't
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Was
it
the
speciality
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
,
or
does
it
ever
obtain
with
other
loving
couples
?
<EOS>
In
these
matrimonial
dialogues
they
never
addressed
each
other
,
but
always
some
invisible
presence
that
appeared
to
take
a
station
about
midway
between
them
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
comes
out
to
be
talked
to
,
on
such
domestic
occasions
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
seen
any
money
in
the
house
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
to
the
skeleton
,
"
except
my
own
annuity
.
<EOS>
That
I
swear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
take
the
trouble
of
swearing
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
to
the
skeleton
;
"
once
more
,
it
does
n't
matter
.
<EOS>
You
never
turned
your
annuity
to
so
good
an
account
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
an
account
!
<EOS>
In
what
way
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
way
of
getting
credit
,
and
living
well
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
skeleton
laughed
scornfully
on
being
intrusted
with
this
question
and
this
answer
;
certainly
Mrs.
Lammle
did
,
and
Mr.
Lammle
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
is
to
happen
next
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Lammle
of
the
skeleton
.
  
<EOS>
"
Smash
is
to
happen
next
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
to
the
same
authority
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
Mrs.
Lammle
looked
disdainfully
at
the
skeleton
---
but
without
carrying
the
look
on
to
Mr.
Lammle
---
and
drooped
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
Mr.
Lammle
did
exactly
the
same
thing
,
and
drooped
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
A
servant
then
entering
with
toast
,
the
skeleton
retired
into
the
closet
,
and
shut
itself
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sophronia
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
,
when
the
servant
had
withdrawn
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
very
much
louder
:
<EOS>
"
Sophronia
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Attend
to
me
,
if
you
please
.
"
<EOS>
He
eyed
her
sternly
until
she
did
attend
,
and
then
went
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
take
counsel
with
you
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
;
no
more
trifling
.
<EOS>
You
know
our
league
and
covenant
.
<EOS>
We
are
to
work
together
for
our
joint
interest
,
and
you
are
as
knowing
a
hand
as
I
am
.
<EOS>
We
should
n't
be
together
,
if
you
were
not
.
<EOS>
What
's
to
be
done
?
<EOS>
We
are
hemmed
into
a
corner
.
<EOS>
What
shall
we
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
scheme
on
foot
that
will
bring
in
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
plunged
into
his
whiskers
for
reflection
,
and
came
out
hopeless
:
"
<EOS>
No
;
as
adventurers
we
are
obliged
to
play
rash
games
for
chances
of
high
winnings
,
and
there
has
been
a
run
of
luck
against
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
resuming
,
"
<EOS>
Have
you
nothing
---
"
when
he
stopped
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
,
Sophronia

<EOS>
We

we

we

"
  
<EOS>
"
Have

nothing

sell

"
  
"
Deuce
a
bit
.
<EOS>
I
have
given
a
Jew
a
bill
of
sale
on
this
furniture
,
and
he
could
take
it
to
-
morrow
,
to

day
,
now
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
taken
it
before
now

I
believe
,
but
for
Fledgeby

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
Fledgeby
to
do
with
him
?
"
  
"
Knew
him
.
<EOS>
Cautioned
me
against
him
before
I
got
into
his
claws
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
persuade
him
then
,
in
behalf
of
somebody
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
that
Fledgeby
has
at
all
softened
him
towards
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Us
,
Sophronia

<EOS>
Us
,
us

us

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Towards
us

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
the
Jew
has
not
yet
done
what
he
might
have
done
,
and
that
Fledgeby
takes
the
credit
of
having
got
him
to
hold
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
you
believe
Fledgeby
?
"
  
"
Sophronia
,
I
never
believe
anybody
.
<EOS>
I
never
have
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
since
I
believed
you

<EOS>
But
it
looks
like
it

"
  
<EOS>
Having
given
her
this
back
-
handed
reminder
of
her
mutinous
observations
to
the
skeleton
,
Mr.
Lammle
rose
from
table
---
perhaps
,
the
better
to
conceal
a
smile
,
and
a
white
dint
or
two
about
his
nose
---
and
took
a
turn
on
the
carpet
and
came
to
the
hearthrug
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
could
have
packed
the
brute
off
with
Georgiana
;
---
but
however
;
that
's
spilled
milk
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Lammle
,
standing
gathering
up
the
skirts
of
his
dressing
-
gown
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
said
this
,
looking
down
at
his
wife
,
she
turned
pale
and
looked
down
at
the
ground
.
<EOS>
With
a
sense
of
disloyalty
upon
her
,
and
perhaps
with
a
sense
of
personal
danger
---
for
she
was
afraid
of
him
---
even
afraid
of
his
hand
and
afraid
of
his
foot
,
though
he
had
never
done
her
violence
---
she
hastened
to
put
herself
right
in
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
could
borrow
money
,
Alfred
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Beg
money

borrow
money

steal
money

<EOS>
It
would
be
all
one
to
us

Sophronia

"
her
husband
struck
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
Then
,
we
could
weather
this
?
"
  
"
No
doubt
.
<EOS>
To
offer
another
original
and
undeniable
remark
,
Sophronia
,
two
and
two
make
four
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
seeing
that
she
was
turning
something
in
her
mind
,
he
gathered
up
the
skirts
of
his
dressing
-
gown
again
,
and
,
tucking
them
under
one
arm
,
and
collecting
his
ample
whiskers
in
his
other
hand
,
kept
his
eye
upon
her
,
silently
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
natural
,
Alfred
,
"
she
said
,
looking
up
with
some
timidity
into
his
face
,
"
to
think
in
such
an
emergency
of
the
richest
people
we
know
,
and
the
simplest
.
<EOS>

Just

The

Just
so

<EOS>
"
Is
there
nothing

"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
there
to
be
done
with
them
,
Sophronia
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
cast
about
in
her
thoughts
again
,
and
he
kept
his
eye
upon
her
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
have
repeatedly
thought
of
the
Boffins
,
Sophronia
,
"
 
he
resumed
,
after
a
fruitless
silence
;
"
but
I
have
seen
my
way
to
nothing

<EOS>
They
are
well
guarded

<EOS>
That
infernal
Secretary

between
them

<EOS>
"
If

could
be
got
rid
of

said
she
,
brightening
a
little
,
after
more
casting
about
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
time

Sophronia

observed
her
watchful
husband
,
in
a
patronizing
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
working
him
out
of
the
way
could
be
presented
in
the
light
of
a
service
to
Mr.
Boffin

<EOS>
"
  
"
Take
time
,
Sophronia
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
remarked
lately
,
Alfred
,
that
the
old
man
is
turning
very
suspicious
and
distrustful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miserly
too
,
my
dear
;
which
is
far
the
most
unpromising
for
us
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
take
time
,
Sophronia
,
take
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
took
time
and
then
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
Suppose
we
should
address
ourselves
to
that
tendency
in
him
of
which
we
have
made
ourselves
quite
sure
.
<EOS>
Suppose
my
conscience
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
we
know
what
a
conscience
<EOS>
it
is
,
my
soul
.
<EOS>
Yes
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
my
conscience
should
not
allow
me
to
keep
to
myself
any
longer
what
that
upstart
girl
told
me
of
the
Secretary
's
having
made
a
declaration
to
her
.
<EOS>
Suppose
my
conscience
should
oblige
me
to
repeat
it
to
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
rather
like
that
,
"
said
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
so
repeated
it
to
Mr.
Boffin
,
as
to
insinuate
that
my
sensitive
delicacy
and
honor
---
"
  
"
Very
good
words
,
Sophronia
.
"
  
"
---
As
to
insinuate
that
our
sensitive
delicacy
and
honor
,
"
she
resumed
,
with
a
bitter
stress
upon
the
phrase
,
"
would
not
allow
us
to
be
silent
parties
to
so
mercenary
and
designing
a
speculation
on
the
Secretary
's
part
,
and
so
gross
a
breach
of
faith
towards
his
confiding
employer
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
had
imparted
my
virtuous
uneasiness
to
my
excellent
husband
,
and
he
had
said
,
in
his
integrity
,
`
`
Sophronia
,
you
must
immediately
disclose
this
to
Mr.
Boffin
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
"
Once
more
,
Sophronia
,
"
observed
Lammle
,
changing
the
leg
on
which
he
stood
,
"
I
rather
like
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
remark
that
he
is
well
guarded
,
"
she
pursued
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
.
<EOS>
But
if
this
should
lead
to
his
discharging
his
Secretary
,
there
would
be
a
weak
place
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
on
expounding
,
Sophronia
.
<EOS>
I
begin
to
like
this
very
much
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Having
,
in
our
unimpeachable
rectitude
,
done
him
the
service
of
opening
his
eyes
to
the
treachery
of
the
person
he
trusted
,
we
shall
have
established
a
claim
upon
him
and
a
confidence
with
him
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
can
be
made
much
of
,
or
little
of
,
we
must
wait
---
because
we
ca
n't
help
it

to
see
.
<EOS>
Probably
we
shall
make
the
most
of
it
that
is
to
be
made
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Probably
,
"
said
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
it
impossible
,
"
she
asked
,
in
the
same
cold
plotting
way
,
"
that
you
might
replace
the
Secretary
?
"
  
"
Not
impossible
,
Sophronia
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
brought
about
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
it
might
be
skilfully
led
up
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
nodded
her
understanding
of
the
hint
,
as
she
looked
at
the
fire
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
,
"
she
said
,
musingly
:
not
without
a
slight
ironical
touch
:
"
Mr.
Lammle
would
be
so
delighted
to
do
anything
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
,
himself
a
man
of
business
as
well
as
a
capitalist
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
,
accustomed
to
be
intrusted
with
the
most
delicate
affairs
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
,
who
has
managed
my
own
little
fortune
so
admirably
,
but
who
,
to
be
sure
,
began
to
make
his
reputation
with
the
advantage
of
being
a
man
of
property
,
above
temptation
,
and
beyond
suspicion
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
smiled
,
and
even
patted
her
on
the
head
.
<EOS>
In
his
sinister
relish
of
the
scheme
,
as
he
stood
above
her
,
making
it
the
subject
of
his
cogitations
,
he
seemed
to
have
twice
as
much
nose
on
his
face
as
he
had
ever
had
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
pondering
,
and
she
sat
looking
at
the
dusty
fire
without
moving
,
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
moment
he
began
to
speak
again
she
looked
up
with
a
wince
and
attended
to
him
,
as
if
that
double
-
dealing
of
hers
had
been
in
her
mind
,
and
the
fear
were
revived
in
her
of
his
hand
or
his
foot
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
appears
to
me
,
Sophronia
,
that
you
have
omitted
one
branch
of
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
not
,
for
women
understand
women
.
<EOS>
We
might
oust
the
girl
herself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
an
immensely
strong
hold
upon
them
both
,
Alfred
.
<EOS>
Not
to
be
compared
with
that
of
a
paid
secretary
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
the
dear
child
,
"
said
Lammle
,
with
a
crooked
smile
,
"
ought
to
have
been
open
with
her
benefactor
and
benefactress
.
<EOS>
The
darling
love
ought
to
have
reposed
unbounded
confidence
in
her
benefactor
and
benefactress
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sophronia
shook
her
head
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Women
understand
women
,
"
said
her
husband
,
rather
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
press
it
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
the
making
of
our
fortune
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
them
both
.
<EOS>
With
me
to
manage
the
property
,
and
my
wife
to
manage
the
people
---
Whew
!
"
  
<EOS>
Again
shaking
her
head
,
she
returned
:
"
They
will
never
quarrel
with
the
girl
.
<EOS>
They
will
never
punish
the
girl
.
<EOS>
We
must
accept
the
girl
,
rely
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
"
cried
Lammle
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
<EOS>
,
"
so
be
it
:
only
always
remember
that
we
do
n't
want
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
the
sole
remaining
question
is
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
when
shall
I
begin
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
begin
too
soon
,
Sophronia
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
told
you
,
the
condition
of
our
affairs
is
desperate
,
and
may
be
blown
upon
at
any
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
secure
Mr.
Boffin
alone
,
Alfred
.
<EOS>
If
his
wife
was
present
,
she
would
throw
oil
upon
the
waters
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
should
fail
to
move
him
to
an
angry
outburst
,
if
his
wife
was
there
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
the
girl
herself
---
as
I
am
going
to
betray
her
confidence
,
she
is
equally
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
n't
do
to
write
for
an
appointment
?
"
said
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
They
would
wonder
among
themselves
why
I
wrote
,
and
I
want
to
have
him
wholly
unprepared
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Call
,
and
ask
to
see
him
alone
?
"
suggested
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
do
that
either
.
<EOS>
Leave
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
Spare
me
the
little
carriage
for
to
-
day
,
and
for
to
-
morrow
(
if
I
do
n't
succeed
to
-
day
)
,
and
I
'll
lie
in
wait
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
barely
settled
when
a
manly
form
was
seen
to
pass
the
windows
and
heard
to
knock
and
ring
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
's
Fledgeby
,
"
said
Lammle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
admires
you
,
and
has
a
high
opinion
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
out
.
<EOS>
Coax
him
to
use
his
influence
with
the
Jew
.
<EOS>
His
name
is
Riah
,
of
the
House
of
Pubsey

Adding
these
words
under
his
breath
,
lest
he
should
be
audible
in
the
erect
ears
of
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
through
two
keyholes
and
the
hall
,
Lammle
,
making
signals
of
discretion
to
his
servant
,
went
softly
up
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.

said
Mrs.

giving
him
a
very
gracious
reception

"
<EOS>
so
glad
to
see
you

<EOS>
My
poor
dear
Alfred
,
who
is
greatly
worried
just
now
about
his
affairs
,
went
out
rather
early
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
do
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dear
Mr.
Fledgeby
did
sit
down
,
and
satisfied
himself
(
or
,
judging
from
the
expression
of
his
countenance
,
dissatisfied
himself
)
that
nothing
new
had
occurred
in
the
way
of
whisker
-
sprout
since
he
came
round
the
corner
from
the
Albany
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
it
was
needless
to
mention
to
you
that
my
poor
dear
Alfred
is
much
worried
about
his
affairs
at
present
,
for
he
has
told
me
what
a
comfort
you
are
to
him
in
his
temporary
difficulties
,
and
what
a
great
service
you
have
rendered
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
,
"
remarked
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
trying
a
new
part
of
his
chair
,
"
but
that
Lammle
might
be
reserved
about
his
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
to
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
with
deep
feeling

<EOS>
"
Oh

indeed

"
said
Fledgeby

<EOS>
"
Not

his

"
<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
always
understood
so

said
Mr.
Fledgeby

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
as
the
wife
of
Alfred

may
I
,
dear
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
wholly
without
his
authority
or
knowledge
,
as
I
am
sure
your
discernment
will
perceive
,
entreat
you
to
continue
that
great
service

and
once
more
use
your
well

earned
influence

Mr.
Riah
for
a
little
more
indulgence

<EOS>
The
name
I
have
heard
Alfred
mention

tossing
in
his
dreams

Riah

it
not

<EOS>

The

rather
uncompromising

The

Mr.

so
long

sweetly

I
ca

he
'll
do
it

Exactly

(

She

Fledgeby

<EOS>
"
In
point

fact

dear
Mr.

Mrs.

went
on

not

affect
concealment

distant
break

This
figure

speech
seemed
rather
mysterious

Fledgeby

a
what

<EOS>
"
Alfred

dear
Mr.

discussed
with

this

Really

Mrs.

you
know

you
who
study
the
human
heart

study
the

what
an
affliction
it
would
be
to
lose
position

lose
credit

ability

tide
over

very
short
time
might
save
all
appearances

"
<EOS>
Oh

Then
you
think

time

burst
up

To
use
an
expression

Mr.

get
rid
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
what
I
was
going
to
say
,
"
returned
Fledgeby
,
who
never
would
,
under
any
circumstances
,
accept
a
suggested
expression
,
"
but
you
're
very
complimentary
.
<EOS>
May
I
imprint
a
---
a
one
---
upon
it
?
<EOS>
Good
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
depend
upon
your
promptitude
,
dearest
Mr.
Fledgeby
?
"
  
<EOS>
Said
Fledgeby
,
looking
back
at
the
door
and
respectfully
kissing
his
hand
,
"
You
may
depend
upon
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
sped
on
his
errand
of
mercy
through
the
streets
,
at
so
brisk
a
rate
that
his
feet
might
have
been
winged
by
all
the
good
spirits
that
wait
on
Generosity
.
<EOS>
They
might
have
taken
up
their
station
in
his
breast
,
too
,
for
he
was
blithe
and
merry
.
<EOS>
There
was
quite
a
fresh
trill
in
his
voice
,
when
,
arriving
at
the
counting
-
house
in
St.
Mary
Axe
,
and
finding
it
for
the
moment
empty
,
he
trolled
forth
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
:
"
<EOS>
Now
,
Judah
,
what
are
you
up
to
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
appeared
,
with
his
accustomed
deference
.
  
<EOS>
"
Holloa
!
<EOS>
"
said
Fledgeby
,
falling
back
,
with
a
wink
.
<EOS>
"
You
mean
mischief
,
Jerusalem
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
raised
his
eyes
inquiringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
you
do
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
sinner
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
dodger
!
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
You
're
going
to
act
upon
that
bill
of
sale
at
Lammle
's
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
Nothing
will
turn
you
,
wo
n't
it
?
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
be
put
off
for
another
single
minute
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Ordered
to
immediate
action
by
the
master
's
tone
and
look
,
the
old
man
took
up
his
hat
from
the
little
counter
where
it
lay
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
told
that
he
might
pull
through
it
,
if
you
did
n't
go
in
to
win
,
Wide
-
Awake
;
have
you
?
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
it
's
not
your
game
that
he
should
pull
through
it
;
ai
n't
it
?
<EOS>
You
having
got
security
,
and
there
being
enough
to
pay
you
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
Jew
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
stood
irresolute
and
uncertain
for
a
moment
,
as
if
there
might
be
further
instructions
for
him
in
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
go
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
at
length
asked
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Asks
me
if
he
is
going
!
"
exclaimed
Fledgeby
.
"
<EOS>
Asks
me
,
as
if
he
did
n't
know
his
own
purpose
!
<EOS>
Asks
me
,
as
if
he
had
n't
got
his
hat
on
ready
!
<EOS>
Asks
me
,
as
if
his
sharp
old
eye
---
why
,
it
cuts
like
a
knife
---
was
n't
looking
at
his
walking
-
stick
by
the
door
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
go
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
go
?
"
<EOS>
sneered
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
do
go
.
<EOS>
Toddle
,
Judah
!
"
   
GIVE
A
DOG
<EOS>
A
BAD
NAME
,
AND
HANG
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
Fascination
Fledgeby
,
left
alone
in
the
counting
-
house
,
strolled
about
with
his
hat
on
one
side
,
whistling
,
and
investigating
the
drawers
,
and
prying
here
and
there
for
any
small
evidences
of
his
being
cheated
,
but
could
find
none
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
his
merit
that
he
do
n't
cheat
me
,
"
was
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
commentary
delivered
with
a
wink
,
"
but
my
precaution
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
with
a
lazy
grandeur
asserted
his
rights
as
lord
of
Pubsey
and
Co.
by
poking
his
cane
at
the
stools
and
boxes
,
and
spitting
in
the
fireplace
,
and
so
loitered
royally
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
narrow
street
,
with
his
small
eyes
just
peering
over
the
top
of
Pubsey
and
Co.
's
blind
.
<EOS>
As
a
blind
in
more
senses
than
one
,
it
reminded
him
that
he
was
alone
in
the
counting
-
house
with
the
front
door
open
.
<EOS>
He
was
moving
away
to
shut
it
,
lest
he
should
be
injudiciously
identified
with
the
establishment
,
when
he
was
stopped
by
some
one
coming
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
This
some
one
was
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
with
a
little
basket
on
her
arm
,
and
her
crutch
stick
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
keen
eyes
had
espied
Mr.
Fledgeby
before
Mr.
Fledgeby
had
espied
her
,
and
he
was
paralyzed
in
his
purpose
of
shutting
her
out
,
not
so
much
by
her
approaching
the
door
,
as
by
her
favouring
him
with
a
shower
of
nods
,
the
instant
he
saw
her
.
<EOS>
This
advantage
she
improved
by
hobbling
up
the
steps
with
such
despatch
that
before
Mr.
Fledgeby
could
take
measures
for
her
finding
nobody
at
home
,
she
was
face
to
face
with
him
in
the
counting
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hope
<EOS>
I
see
you
well
,
sir
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Riah
in
?
"
  
<EOS>
Fledgeby
had
dropped
into
a
chair
,
in
the
attitude
of
one
waiting
wearily
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
he
will
be
back
soon
,
"
he
replied
;
"
he
has
cut
out
and
left
me
expecting
him
back
,
in
an
odd
way
.
<EOS>
Have
n't
I
seen
you
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Once
before
---
if
you
had
your
eyesight
,
"
replied
Miss
Wren
;
the
conditional
clause
in
an
under
-
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
were
carrying
on
some
games
up
at
the
top
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
remember
.
<EOS>
How
's
your
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
more
friends
than
one
,
sir
,
I
hope
,
"
replied
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Which
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
,
"
said
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
shutting
up
one
eye
,
"
any
of
your
friends
,
all
your
friends
.
<EOS>
Are
they
pretty
tolerable
?
"
  
<EOS>
Somewhat
confounded
,
Miss
Wren
parried
the
pleasantry
,
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
behind
the
door
,
with
her
basket
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
,
she
said
,
breaking
a
long
and
patient
silence
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
but
I
am
used
to
find
Mr.
Riah
at
this
time
,
and
so
I
generally
come
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
I
only
want
to
buy
my
poor
little
two
shillings
'
worth
of
waste
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
'll
kindly
let
me
have
it
,
and
I
'll
trot
off
to
my
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
let
you
have
it
?
"
said
Fledgeby
,
turning
his
head
towards
her
;
 
<EOS>
for
he
had
been
sitting
blinking
at
the
light
,
and
feeling
his
cheek
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
do
n't
really
suppose
that
I
have
anything
to
do
with
the
place
,
or
the
business
;
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
?
"
exclaimed
Miss
Wren
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
,
that
day
,
you
were
the
master
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
old
cock
in
black
said
?
<EOS>
Riah
said
?
<EOS>
Why
,
he
'd
say
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
;
but
you
said
so
too
,
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
Or
at
least
you
took
on
like
the
master
,
and
did
n't
contradict
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
his
dodges
,
"
said
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
with
a
cool
and
contemptuous
shrug
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
made
of
dodges
.
<EOS>
He
said
to
me
,
`
`
Come
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
,
sir
,
and
I
'll
show
you
a
handsome
girl
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
call
you
the
master
.
"
<EOS>
"
So
I
went
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
and
he
showed
me
the
handsome
girl
(
very
well
worth
looking
at
<EOS>
she
was
)
,
and
I
was
called
the
master
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
why
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
he
do
n't
.
<EOS>
He
loves
a
dodge
for
its
own
sake
;
being
,
"
added
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
after
casting
about
for
an
expressive
phrase
,
"
the
dodgerest
of
all
the
dodgers
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
my
head
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
holding
it
with
both
her
hands
,
as
if
it
were
cracking
.
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
mean
what
you
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
my
little
woman
,
"
retorted
Fledgeby
,
"
and
I
do
,
I
assure
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
repudiation
was
not
only
an
act
of
deliberate
policy
on
Fledgeby
's
part
,
in
case
of
his
being
surprised
by
any
other
caller
,
but
was
also
a
retort
upon
Miss
Wren
for
her
over
-
sharpness
,
and
a
pleasant
instance
of
his
humour
as
regarded
the
old
Jew
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
got
a
bad
name
as
an
old
Jew
,
and
he
is
paid
for
the
use
of
it
,
and
I
'll
have
my
money
's
worth
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
Fledgeby
's
habitual
reflection
in
the
way
of
business
,
and
it
was
sharpened
just
now
by
the
old
man
's
presuming
to
have
a
secret
from
him
:
though
of
the
secret
itself
,
as
annoying
somebody
else
whom
he
disliked
,
he
by
no
means
disapproved
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
with
a
fallen
countenance
sat
behind
the
door
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
ground
,
and
the
long
and
patient
silence
had
again
set
in
for
some
time
,
when
the
expression
of
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
face
betokened
that
through
the
upper
portion
of
the
door
,
which
was
of
glass
,
he
saw
some
one
faltering
on
the
brink
of
the
counting
-
house
.
<EOS>
Presently
there
was
a
rustle
and
a
tap
,
and
then
some
more
rustling
and
another
tap
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
taking
no
notice
,
the
door
was
at
length
softly
opened
,
and
the
dried
face
of
a
mild
little
elderly
gentleman
looked
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Riah
?
"
said
this
visitor
,
very
politely
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
waiting
for
him
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
"
<EOS>
He
went
out
and
left
me
here
.
<EOS>
I
expect
him
back
every
minute
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
had
better
take
a
chair
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
took
a
chair
,
and
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
as
if
he
were
in
a
melancholy
frame
of
mind
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
eyed
him
aside
,
and
seemed
to
relish
his
attitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
fine
day
,
sir
,
"
remarked
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
dried
gentleman
was
so
occupied
with
his
own
depressed
reflections
that
he
did
not
notice
the
remark
until
the
sound
of
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
voice
had
died
out
of
the
counting
-
house
.
<EOS>
Then
he
started
,
and
said
:
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
fear
you
spoke
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
"
remarked
Fledgeby
,
a
little
louder
than
before
,
"
it
was
a
fine
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
little
dried
gentleman
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
and
again
Mr.
Fledgeby
seemed
to
enjoy
his
doing
it
.
<EOS>
When
the
gentleman
changed
his
attitude
with
a
sigh
,
Fledgeby
spake
with
a
grin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Twemlow
,
I
think
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
dried
gentleman
seemed
much
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
the
pleasure
of
dining
with
you
at
Lammle
's
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Even
have
the
honor
of
being
a
connexion
of
yours
.
<EOS>
An
unexpected
sort
of
place
this
to
meet
in
;
but
one
never
knows
,
when
one
gets
into
the
City
,
what
people
one
may
knock
up
against
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
your
health
,
and
are
enjoying
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
might
have
been
a
touch
of
impertinence
in
the
last
words
;
 
on
the
other
hand
,
it
might
have
been
but
the
native
grace
of
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
manner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
sat
on
a
stool
with
a
foot
on
the
rail
of
another
stool
,
and
his
hat
on
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Twemlow
had
uncovered
on
looking
in
at
the
door
,
and
remained
so
.
  
<EOS>
Now
the
conscientious
Twemlow
,
knowing
what
he
had
done
to
thwart
the
gracious
Fledgeby
,
was
particularly
disconcerted
by
this
encounter
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
ill
at
ease
as
a
gentleman
well
could
be
.
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
bound
to
conduct
himself
stiffly
towards
Fledgeby
,
and
he
made
him
a
distant
bow
.
<EOS>
Fledgeby
made
his
small
eyes
smaller
in
taking
special
note
of
his
manner
.
<EOS>
The
dolls
'
dressmaker
sat
in
her
corner
behind
the
door
,
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
and
her
hands
folded
on
her
basket
,
holding
her
crutch
-
stick
between
them
,
and
appearing
to
take
no
heed
of
anything
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
long
time
,
"
muttered
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
looking
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
What
time
may
you
make
it
,
Mr.
Twemlow
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Twemlow
made
it
ten
minutes
past
twelve
,
sir
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
near
as
a
toucher
,
"
assented
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Mr.
Twemlow
,
your
business
here
may
be
of
a
more
agreeable
character
than
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Twemlow
.
  
<EOS>
Fledgeby
again
made
his
small
eyes
smaller
,
as
he
glanced
with
great
complacency
at
Twemlow
,
who
was
timorously
tapping
the
table
with
a
folded
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
know
of
Mr.
Riah
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
with
a
very
disparaging
utterance
of
his
name
,
"
leads
me
to
believe
that
this
is
about
the
shop
for
disagreeable
business
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
found
him
the
bitingest
and
tightest
screw
in
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Twemlow
acknowledged
the
remark
with
a
little
distant
bow
.
<EOS>
It
evidently
made
him
nervous
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
so
,
"
pursued
Fledgeby
,
"
that
if
it
was
n't
to
be
true
to
a
friend
,
nobody
should
catch
me
waiting
here
a
single
minute
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
have
friends
in
adversity
,
stand
by
them
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
say
and
act
up
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
equitable
Twemlow
felt
that
this
sentiment
,
irrespective
of
the
utterer
,
demanded
his
cordial
assent
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
right
,
sir
,
"
he
rejoined
with
spirit
.
<EOS>
"
You
indicate
the
generous
and
manly
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
have
your
approbation
,
"
returned
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
coincidence
,
Mr.
Twemlow
;
"
here
he
descended
from
his
perch
,
and
sauntered
towards
him
;
"
that
the
friends
I
am
standing
by
to
-
day
are
the
friends
at
whose
house
I
met
you
!
<EOS>
The
Lammles
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
very
taking
and
agreeable
woman
?
"
  
<EOS>
Conscience
smote
the
gentle
Twemlow
pale
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
she
appealed
to
me
this
morning
,
to
come
and
try
what
I
could
do
to
pacify
their
creditor
,
this
Mr.
Riah
---
that
I
certainly
have
gained
some
little
influence
with
in
transacting
business
for
another
friend
,
but
nothing
like
so
much
as
she
supposes
---
and
when
a
woman
like
that
spoke
to
me
as
her
dearest
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
and
shed
tears
---
<EOS>
why
what
could
I
do
,
you
know
?
"
  
<EOS>
Twemlow
gasped
"
Nothing
but
come
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
but
come
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
came
.
<EOS>
But
why
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
counterfeiting
deep
meditation
,
"
why
Riah
should
have
started
up
,
when
I
told
him
that
the
Lammles
entreated
him
to
hold
over
a
Bill
of
Sale
he
has
on
all
their
effects
;
 
and
why
he
should
have
cut
out
,
saying
he
would
be
back
directly
;
 
and
why
he
should
have
left
me
here
alone
so
long
;
I
can
not
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
chivalrous
Twemlow
,
Knight
of
the
Simple
Heart
,
was
not
in
a
condition
to
offer
any
suggestion
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
penitent
,
too
remorseful
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
had
done
an
underhanded
action
,
and
he
had
done
wrong
.
<EOS>
He
had
secretly
interposed
against
this
confiding
young
man
,
for
no
better
real
reason
than
because
the
young
man
's
ways
were
not
his
ways
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
confiding
young
man
proceeded
to
heap
coals
of
fire
on
his
sensitive
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Twemlow
;
you
see
I
am
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
affairs
that
are
transacted
here
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you
here
?
<EOS>
You
have
always
been
brought
up
as
a
gentleman
,
and
never
as
a
man
of
business
;
"
another
touch
of
possible
impertinence
in
this
place
;
"
and
perhaps
you
are
but
a
poor
man
of
business
.
<EOS>
What
else
is
to
be
expected
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
even
a
poorer
man
of
business
than
I
am
a
man
,
sir
,
"
returned
Twemlow
,
"
and
I
could
hardly
express
my
deficiency
in
a
stronger
way
.
<EOS>
I
really
do
not
so
much
as
clearly
understand
my
position
in
the
matter
on
which
I
am
brought
here
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
reasons
which
make
me
very
delicate
of
accepting
your
assistance
.
<EOS>
I
am
greatly
,
greatly
,
disinclined
to
profit
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
deserve
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Good
childish
creature
!
<EOS>
Condemned
to
a
passage
through
the
world
by
such
narrow
little
dimly
-
lighted
ways
,
and
picking
up
so
few
specks
or
spots
on
the
road
!
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
"
you
may
be
a
little
proud
of
entering
on
the
topic
,
---
having
been
brought
up
as
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
that
,
sir
,
"
returned
Twemlow
,
"
it
's
not
that
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
distinguish
between
true
pride
and
false
pride
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
pride
at
all
,
myself
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
"
and
perhaps
I
do
n't
cut
things
so
fine
as
to
know
one
from
t'other
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
this
is
a
place
where
even
a
man
of
business
needs
his
wits
about
him
;
and
if
mine
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
here
,
you
're
welcome
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
,
"
said
Twemlow
,
faltering
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
most
unwilling
---
"
  
"
I
do
n't
,
you
know
,
"
proceeded
Fledgeby
with
an
ill
-
favoured
glance
,
"
entertain
the
vanity
of
supposing
that
my
wits
could
be
of
any
use
to
you
in
society
,
but
they
might
be
here
.
<EOS>
You
cultivate
society
and
society
cultivates
you
,
but
Mr.
Riah
's
not
society
.
<EOS>
In
society
,
Mr.
Riah
is
kept
dark
;
eh
,
Mr.
Twemlow
?
"
  
<EOS>
Twemlow
,
much
disturbed
,
and
with
his
hand
fluttering
about
his
forehead
,
replied
:
"
Quite
true
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
confiding
young
man
besought
him
to
state
his
case
.
<EOS>
The
innocent
Twemlow
,
expecting
Fledgeby
to
be
astounded
by
what
he
should
unfold
,
and
not
for
an
instant
conceiving
the
possibility
of
its
happening
every
day
,
but
treating
of
it
as
a
terrible
phenomenon
occurring
in
the
course
of
ages
,
related
how
that
he
had
had
a
deceased
friend
,
a
married
civil
officer
with
a
family
,
who
had
wanted
money
for
change
of
place
on
change
of
post
,
and
how
he
,
Twemlow
,
had
"
given
him
his
name
,
"
with
the
usual
,
but
in
the
eyes
of
Twemlow
almost
incredible
result
that
he
had
been
left
to
repay
what
he
had
never
had
.
<EOS>
How
,
in
the
course
of
years
,
he
had
reduced
the
principal
by
trifling
sums
,
"
having
,
"
said
Twemlow
,
"
always
to
observe
great
economy
,
being
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
fixed
income
limited
in
extent
,
and
that
depending
on
the
munificence
of
a
certain
nobleman
,
"
and
had
always
pinched
the
full
interest
out
of
himself
with
punctual
pinches
.
<EOS>
How
he
had
come
,
in
course
of
time
,
to
look
upon
this
one
only
debt
of
his
life
as
a
regular
quarterly
drawback
,
and
no
worse
,
when
"
his
name
"
had
some
way
fallen
into
the
possession
of
Mr.
Riah
,
who
had
sent
him
notice
to
redeem
it
by
paying
up
in
full
,
in
one
plump
sum
,
or
take
tremendous
consequences
.
<EOS>
This
,
with
hazy
remembrances
of
how
he
had
been
carried
to
some
office
to
"
confess
judgment
"
(
as
he
recollected
the
phrase
)
,
and
how
he
had
been
carried
to
another
office
where
his
life
was
assured
for
somebody
not
wholly
unconnected
with
the
sherry
trade
whom
he
remembered
by
the
remarkable
circumstance
that
he
had
a
Straduarius
violin
to
dispose
of
,
and
also
a
Madonna
,
formed
the
sum
and
substance
of
Mr.
Twemlow
's
narrative
.
<EOS>
Through
which
stalked
the
shadow
of
the
awful
Snigsworth
,
eyed
afar
off
by
money
-
lenders
as
Security
in
the
Mist
,
and
menacing
Twemlow
with
his
baronial
truncheon
.
  
<EOS>
To
all
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
listened
with
the
modest
gravity
becoming
a
confiding
young
man
who
knew
it
all
beforehand
,
and
,
when
it
was
finished
,
seriously
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
,
Mr.
Twemlow
,
"
 
said
Fledgeby
,
"
I
do
n't
like
Riah
's
calling
in
the
principal
.
<EOS>
If
he
's
determined
to
call
it
in
,
it
must
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
supposing
,
sir
,
"
said
Twemlow
,
downcast
,
"
that
it
ca
n't
come
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
retorted
Fledgeby
,
"
you
must
go
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
asked
Twemlow
,
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
prison
,
"
returned
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
Whereat
Mr.
Twemlow
leaned
his
innocent
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
moaned
a
little
moan
of
distress
and
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
appearing
to
pluck
up
his
spirits
,
"
we
'll
hope
it
's
not
so
bad
as
that
comes
to
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
allow
me
,
I
'll
mention
to
Mr.
Riah
when
he
comes
in
,
who
you
are
,
and
I
'll
tell
him
you
're
my
friend
,
and
<EOS>
I
'll
say
my
say
for
you
,
instead
of
your
saying
it
for
yourself
;
I
may
be
able
to
do
it
in
a
more
business
-
like
way
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
consider
it
a
liberty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
again
and
again
,
sir
,
"
said
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
strong
,
strongly
,
disinclined
to
avail
myself
of
your
generosity
,
though
my
helplessness
yields
.
<EOS>
For
I
can
not
but
feel
that
I
---
to
put
it
in
the
mildest
form
of
speech
---
that
I
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
can
he
be
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
Fledgeby
,
referring
to
his
watch
again
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
he
have
gone
out
for
?
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
him
,
Mr.
Twemlow
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
thorough
Jew
to
look
at
,
but
he
is
a
more
thorough
Jew
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
He
's
worst
when
he
's
quiet
.
<EOS>
If
he
's
quiet
,
I
shall
take
it
as
a
very
bad
sign
.
<EOS>
Keep
your
eye
upon
him
when
he
comes
in
,
and
,
if
he
's
quiet
,
do
n't
be
hopeful
.
<EOS>
Here
he
is
!
---
<EOS>
He
looks
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
which
had
the
effect
of
causing
the
harmless
Twemlow
painful
agitation
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
withdrew
to
his
former
post
,
and
the
old
man
entered
the
counting
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mr.
Riah
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
"
I
thought
you
were
lost
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
,
glancing
at
the
stranger
,
stood
stock
-
still
.
<EOS>
He
perceived
that
his
master
was
leading
up
to
the
orders
he
was
to
take
,
and
he
waited
to
understand
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
thought
,
"
repeated
Fledgeby
slowly
,
"
that
you
were
lost
,
Mr.
Riah
.
<EOS>
Why
,
now
I
look
at
you
---
but
no
,
you
ca
n't
have
done
it
;
 
no
<EOS>
,
you
ca
n't
have
done
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hat
in
hand
,
the
old
man
lifted
his
head
,
and
looked
distressfully
at
Fledgeby
as
seeking
to
know
what
new
moral
burden
he
was
to
bear
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
have
rushed
out
to
get
the
start
of
everybody
else
,
and
put
in
that
bill
of
sale
at
Lammle
's
?
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
Say
you
have
n't
,
Mr.
Riah
.
"
  
"
Sir
,
I
have
,
"
replied
the
old
man
in
a
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
eye
!
"
cried
Fledgeby
.
"
<EOS>
Tut
,
tut
,
tut
!
<EOS>
Dear

dear

<EOS>
dear

<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
knew
you
were
a
hard
customer

Mr.

but
I
never
thought
you
were
as
hard
as
that

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir

said
the
old
man
,
with
great
uneasiness
,
<EOS>
"
I
do
as
I
am
directed
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
the
principal
here

<EOS>
I
am
<EOS>

the
agent

a
superior

and
<EOS>
I
have
no
choice
,
no
power

<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
say
so
,
"
retorted
Fledgeby
,
secretly
exultant
as
the
old
man
stretched
out
his
hands
,
with
a
shrinking
action
of
defending
himself
against
the
sharp
construction
of
the
two
observers
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
play
the
tune
of
the
trade
,
Mr.
Riah
.
<EOS>
You
've
a
right
to
get
in
your
debts
,
if
you
're
determined
to
do
it
,
but
do
n't
pretend
what
every
one
in
your
line
regularly
pretends
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
do
n't
do
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
,
Mr.
Riah
?
<EOS>
You
know
I
know
all
about
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
clasped
the
skirt
of
his
long
coat
with
his
disengaged
hand
,
and
directed
a
wistful
look
at
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
n't
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
"
do
n't
,
I
entreat
you
as
a
favour
,
Mr.
Riah
,
be
so
devilish
meek

for
I
know
what
'll
follow
if
you
are

<EOS>
Look
here
,
Mr.
Riah
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
is
Mr.
Twemlow
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Jew
turned
to
him
and
bowed
.
<EOS>
That
poor
lamb
bowed
in
return
;
polite
,
and
terrified
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
such
a
failure
,
"
proceeded
Fledgeby
,
"
in
trying
to
do
anything
with
you
for
my
friend
Lammle
,
that
I
've
hardly
a
hope
of
doing
anything
with
you
for
my
friend
(
and
connexion
indeed
)
<EOS>
Mr.
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
think
that
if
you
would
do
a
favor
for
anybody
,
you
would
for
me
,
and
I
wo
n't
fail
for
want
of
trying
,
and
I
've
passed
my
promise
to
Mr.
Twemlow
besides

<EOS>
Now
,
Mr.
Riah
,
here
is
Mr.
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
Always
good
for
his
interest
,
always
coming
up
to
time
,
always
paying
his
little
way
.
<EOS>
Now
,
why
should
you
press
Mr.
Twemlow
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
have
any
spite
against
Mr.
Twemlow
!
<EOS>
Why
not
be
easy
with
Mr.
Twemlow
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
into
Fledgeby
's
little
eyes
for
any
sign
of
leave
to
be
easy
with
Mr.
Twemlow
;
but
there
was
no
sign
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Twemlow
is
no
connexion
of
yours
,
Mr.
Riah
,
"
said
Fledgeby
;
 
<EOS>
"
you
ca
n't
want
to
be
even
with
him
for
having
through
life
<EOS>
gone
in
for
a
gentleman
and
hung
on
to
his
Family
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Twemlow
has
a
contempt
for
business
,
what
can
it
matter
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
pardon
me
,
"
interposed
the
gentle
victim
,
"
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
I
should
consider
it
presumption
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
Mr.
Riah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Fledgeby
,
"
is
n't
that
handsomely
said
?
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
Make
terms
with
me
for
Mr.
Twemlow
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
again
for
any
sign
of
permission
to
spare
the
poor
little
gentleman
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
meant
him
to
be
racked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
sorry
,
Mr.
Twemlow
,
"
said
Riah
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
my
instructions
.
<EOS>
I
am
invested
with
no
authority
for
diverging
from
them
.
<EOS>
The
money
must
be
paid
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
full
and
slap
down
,
do
you
mean
,
Mr.
Riah
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Fledgeby
,
to
make
things
quite
explicit
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
full
,
sir
,
and
at
once
,
"
was
Riah
's
answer
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
shook
his
head
deploringly
at
Twemlow
,
and
mutely
expressed
in
reference
to
the
venerable
figure
standing
before
him
with
eyes
upon
the
ground
:
"
What
a
Monster
of
an
Israelite
this
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Riah
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
lifted
up
his
eyes
once
more
to
the
little
eyes
in
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
head
,
with
some
reviving
hope
that
the
sign
might
be
coming
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Riah
,
it
's
of
no
use
my
holding
back
the
fact
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
certain
great
party
in
the
background
in
Mr.
Twemlow
's
case
,
and
you
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
,
"
the
old
man
admitted
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
put
it
as
a
plain
point
of
business
,
Mr.
Riah
.
<EOS>
Are
you
fully
determined
(
as
a
plain
point
of
business
)
either
to
have
<EOS>
that
said
great
party
's
security
,
or
that
said
great
party
's
money
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fully
determined
,
"
answered
Riah
,
as
he
read
his
master
's
face
,
and
learnt
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
caring
,
for
,
and
indeed
as
it
seems
to
me
rather
enjoying
<EOS>
,
"
 
said
Fledgeby
,
with
peculiar
unction
,
"
the
precious
kick
-
up
and
row
that
will
come
off
between
Mr.
Twemlow
and
the
said
great
party
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
required
no
answer
,
and
received
none
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mr.
Twemlow
,
who
had
betrayed
the
keenest
mental
terrors
since
his
noble
kinsman
loomed
in
the
perspective
,
rose
with
a
sigh
to
take
his
departure
.
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
very
much
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
offering
Fledgeby
his
feverish
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
me
an
unmerited
service
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
thank
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
mention
it
,
"
answered
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
failure
so
far
,
but
I
'll
stay
behind
,
and
take
another
touch
at
Mr.
Riah
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
not
deceive
yourself
,
Mr.
Twemlow
,
"
said
the
Jew
,
then
addressing
him
directly
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
hope
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
expect
no
leniency
here
.
<EOS>
You
must
pay
in
full
,
and
you
can
not
pay
too
promptly
,
or
you
will
be
put
to
heavy
charges
.
<EOS>
Trust
nothing
to
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Money
,
money
,
money
.
<EOS>
"
When
he
had
said
these
words
in
an
emphatic
manner
,
he
acknowledged
Mr.
Twemlow
's
still
polite
motion
of
his
head
,
and
that
amiable
little
worthy
took
his
departure
in
the
lowest
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
Fascination
Fledgeby
was
in
such
a
merry
vein
when
the
counting
-
house
was
cleared
of
him
,
that
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
to
the
window
,
and
lean
his
arms
on
the
frame
of
the
blind
,
and
have
his
silent
laugh
out
,
with
his
back
to
his
subordinate
.
<EOS>
When
he
turned
round
again
with
a
composed
countenance
,
his
subordinate
still
stood
in
the
same
place
,
and
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
sat
behind
the
door
with
a
look
of
horror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
cried
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
"
you
're
forgetting
this
young
lady
,
Mr.
Riah
,
and
she
has
been
waiting
long
enough
too
.
<EOS>
Sell
her
her
waste
,
please
,
and
give
her
good
measure
if
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
do
the
liberal
thing
for
once
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
on
for
a
time
,
as
the
Jew
filled
her
little
basket
with
such
scraps
as
she
was
used
to
buy
;
but
,
his
merry
vein
coming
on
again
,
he
was
obliged
to
turn
round
to
the
window
once
more
,
and
lean
his
arms
on
the
blind
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
my
Cinderella
dear
,
"
said
the
old
man
in
a
whisper
,
and
with
a
worn
-
out
look
,
"
the
basket
's
full
now
.
<EOS>
Bless
you
!
<EOS>
And
get
you
gone
!
"
  
"
Do
n't
call
me
your
Cinderella
dear
,
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
O
you
cruel
godmother
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
shook
that
emphatic
little
forefinger
of
hers
in
his
face
at
parting
,
as
earnestly
and
reproachfully
as
she
had
ever
shaken
it
at
her
grim
old
child
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
the
godmother
at
all
!
"
<EOS>
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
Wolf
in
the
Forest
,
the
wicked
Wolf
!
<EOS>
And
if
ever
my
dear
Lizzie
is
sold

betrayed

I
shall
know
who
sold

<EOS>
WEGG
PREPARES
A
GRINDSTONE
FOR
MR
.
BOFFIN
'S
NOSE
.
 
<EOS>
Having
assisted
at
a
few
more
expositions
of
the
lives
of
Misers
,
Mr.
Venus
became
almost
indispensable
to
the
evenings
at
the
Bower
.
<EOS>
The
circumstance
of
having
another
listener
to
the
wonders
unfolded
by
Wegg
,
or
,
as
it
were
,
another
calculator
to
cast
up
the
guineas
found
in
teapots
,
chimneys
,
racks
and
mangers
,
and
other
such
banks
of
deposit
,
seemed
greatly
to
heighten
Mr.
Boffin
's
enjoyment
;
while
Silas
Wegg
,
for
his
part
,
though
of
a
jealous
temperament
which
might
under
ordinary
circumstances
have
resented
the
anatomist
's
getting
into
favour
,
was
so
very
anxious
to
keep
his
eye
on
that
gentleman
---
lest
,
being
too
much
left
to
himself
,
he
should
be
tempted
to
play
any
tricks
with
the
precious
document
in
his
keeping
---
that
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
commending
him
to
Mr.
Boffin
's
notice
as
a
third
party
whose
company
was
much
to
be
desired
.
<EOS>
Another
friendly
demonstration
towards
him
Mr.
Wegg
now
regularly
gratified
.
<EOS>
After
each
sitting
was
over
,
and
the
patron
had
departed
,
Mr.
Wegg
invariably
saw
Mr.
Venus
home
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
he
as
invariably
requested
to
be
refreshed
with
a
sight
of
the
paper
in
which
he
was
a
joint
proprietor
;
but
he
never
failed
to
remark
that
it
was
the
great
pleasure
he
derived
from
Mr.
Venus
's
improving
society
which
had
insensibly
lured
him
round
to
Clerkenwell
again
,
and
that
,
finding
himself
once
more
attracted
to
the
spot
by
the
social
powers
of
Mr.
V.
,
he
would
beg
leave
to
go
through
that
little
incidental
procedure
,
as
a
matter
of
form
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
well
I
know
,
sir
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
would
add
,
"
that
a
man
of
your
delicate
mind
would
wish
to
be
checked
off
whenever
the
opportunity
arises
,
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
baulk
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
certain
rustiness
in
Mr.
Venus
,
which
never
became
so
lubricated
by
the
oil
of
Mr.
Wegg
but
that
he
turned
under
the
screw
in
a
creaking
and
stiff
manner
,
was
very
noticeable
at
about
this
period
.
<EOS>
While
assisting
at
the
literary
evenings
,
he
even
went
so
far
,
on
two
or
three
occasions
,
as
to
correct
Mr.
Wegg
when
he
grossly
mispronounced
a
word
,
or
made
nonsense
of
a
passage
;
insomuch
that
Mr.
Wegg
took
to
surveying
his
course
in
the
day
,
and
to
making
arrangements
for
getting
round
rocks
at
night
instead
of
running
straight
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Of
the
slightest
anatomical
reference
he
became
particularly
shy
,
and
,
if
he
saw
a
bone
ahead
,
would
go
any
distance
out
of
his
way
rather
than
mention
it
by
name
.
  
<EOS>
The
adverse
destinies
ordained
that
one
evening
Mr.
Wegg
's
labouring
bark
became
beset
by
polysyllables
,
and
embarrassed
among
a
perfect
archipelago
of
hard
words
.
<EOS>
It
being
necessary
to
take
soundings
every
minute
,
and
to
feel
the
way
with
the
greatest
caution
,
Mr.
Wegg
's
attention
was
fully
employed
.
<EOS>
Advantage
was
taken
of
this
dilemma
by
Mr.
Venus
,
to
pass
a
scrap
of
paper
into
Mr.
Boffin
's
hand
,
and
lay
his
finger
on
his
own
lip
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Boffin
got
home
at
night
he
found
that
the
paper
contained
Mr.
Venus
's
card
and
these
words
:
"
<EOS>
Should
be
glad
to
be
honored
with
a
call
respecting
business
of
your
own
,
about
dusk
on
an
early
evening
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
very
next
evening
saw
Mr.
Boffin
peeping
in
at
the
preserved
frogs
in
Mr.
Venus
's
shop
-
window
,
and
saw
Mr.
Venus
espying
Mr.
Boffin
with
the
readiness
of
one
on
the
alert
,
and
beckoning
that
gentleman
into
his
interior
.
<EOS>
Responding
,
Mr.
Boffin
was
invited
to
seat
himself
on
the
box
of
human
miscellanies
before
the
fire
,
and
did
so
,
looking
round
the
place
with
admiring
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
fire
being
low
and
fitful
,
and
the
dusk
gloomy
,
the
whole
stock
seemed
to
be
winking
and
blinking
with
both
eyes
,
as
Mr.
Venus
did
.
<EOS>
The
French
gentleman
,
though
he
had
no
eyes
,
was
not
at
all
behindhand
,
but
appeared
,
as
the
flame
rose
and
fell
,
to
open
and
shut
his
no
eyes
,
with
the
regularity
of
the
glass
-
eyed
dogs
and
ducks
and
birds
.
<EOS>
The
big
-
headed
babies
were
equally
obliging
in
lending
their
grotesque
aid
to
the
general
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Mr.
Venus
,
I
've
lost
no
time
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Here
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
you
are
,
sir
,
"
assented
Mr.
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
secrecy
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Boffin
---
"
at
least
,
not
in
a
general
way
I
do
n't
---
<EOS>
but
I
dare
say
you
'll
show
me
good
reason
for
being
secret
so
far
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
,
sir
,
"
returned
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
expect
Wegg
,
I
take
it
for
granted
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
expect
no
one
but
the
present
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
glanced
about
him
,
as
accepting
under
that
inclusive
denomination
the
French
gentleman
and
the
circle
in
which
he
did
n't
move
,
and
repeated
,
"
The
present
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Venus
,
"
before
entering
upon
business
,
I
shall
have
to
ask
you
for
your
word
and
honor
that
we
are
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
's
wait
a
bit
and
understand
what
the
expression
means
,
"
 
answered
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
confidence
for
how
long
?
<EOS>
In
confidence
for
ever
and
a
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
your
hint
,
sir
,
"
said
Venus
;
"
you
think
you
might
consider
the
business
,
when
you
came
to
know
it
,
to
be
of
a
nature
incompatible
with
confidence
on
your
part
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
might
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
with
a
cautious
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
"
observed
Venus
,
after
clutching
at
his
dusty
hair
,
to
brighten
his
ideas
,
"
let
us
put
it
another
way
.
<EOS>
I
open
the
business
with
you
,
relying
upon
your
honor
not
to
do
anything
in
it
,
and
not
to
mention
me
in
it
,
without
my
knowledge
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
sounds
fair
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
agree
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
your
word
and
honor
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
good
fellow
,
"
retorted
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
you
have
my
word
;
and
how
you
can
have
that
,
without
my
honor
too
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
've
sorted
a
lot
of
dust
in
my
time
,
but
I
never
knew
the
two
things
go
into
separate
heaps
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
remark
seemed
rather
to
abash
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
He
hesitated
,
and
said
,
"
Very
true
,
sir
;
"
and
again
,
"
Very
true
,
sir
,
"
before
resuming
the
thread
of
his
discourse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Boffin
,
if
I
confess
to
you
that
I
fell
into
a
proposal
of
which
you
were
the
subject
,
and
of
which
you
ought
n't
to
have
been
the
subject
,
you
will
allow
me
to
mention
,
and
will
please
take
into
favourable
consideration
,
that
I
was
in
a
crushed
state
of
mind
at
the
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Golden
Dustman
,
with
his
hands
folded
on
the
top
of
his
stout
stick
,
with
his
chin
resting
upon
them
,
and
with
something
leering
and
whimsical
in
his
eyes
,
gave
a
nod
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Quite
so
,
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
That
proposal
,
sir
,
was
a
conspiring
breach
of
your
confidence
,
to
such
an
extent
,
that
I
ought
at
once
to
have
made
it
known
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
did
n't
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
I
fell
into
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Without
moving
eye
or
finger
,
Mr.
Boffin
gave
another
nod
,
and
placidly
repeated
,
"
Quite
so
,
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
that
I
was
ever
hearty
in
it
,
sir
,
"
the
penitent
anatomist
went
on
,
"
or
that
I
ever
viewed
myself
with
anything
but
reproach
for
having
turned
out
of
the
paths
of
science
into
the
paths
of
---
"
 
he
was
going
to
say
"
villany
,
"
but
,
unwilling
to
press
too
hard
upon
himself
,
substituted
with
great
emphasis
---
"
Weggery
.
"
  
<EOS>
Placid
and
whimsical
of
look
as
ever
,
Mr.
Boffin
answered
:
"
Quite
so
,
Venus
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
sir
,
"
said
Venus
,
"
having
prepared
your
mind
in
the
rough
,
I
will
articulate
the
details
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
which
brief
professional
exordium
,
he
entered
on
the
history
of
the
friendly
move
,
and
truly
recounted
it
.
<EOS>
One
might
have
thought
that
it
would
have
extracted
some
show
of
surprise
or
anger
,
or
other
emotion
,
from
Mr.
Boffin
,
but
it
extracted
nothing
beyond
his
former
comment
:
"
Quite
so
,
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
astonished
you
,
sir
,
I
believe
?
"
said
Mr.
Venus
,
pausing
dubiously
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
simply
answered
as
aforesaid
:
"
Quite
so
,
Venus
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
astonishment
was
all
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
,
however
,
so
continue
.
<EOS>
For
,
when
Venus
passed
to
Wegg
's
discovery
,
and
from
that
to
their
having
both
seen
Mr.
Boffin
dig
up
the
Dutch
bottle
,
that
gentleman
changed
colour
,
changed
his
attitude
,
became
extremely
restless
,
and
ended
(
when
Venus
ended
)
by
being
in
a
state
of
manifest
anxiety
,
trepidation
,
and
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
Venus
,
finishing
off
;
"
you
best
know
what
was
in
that
Dutch
bottle
,
and
why
you
dug
it
up
,
and
took
it
away
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
anything
more
about
it
than
I
saw
.
<EOS>
All
I
know
is
this
:
I
am
proud
of
my
calling
after
all
(
though
it
has
been
attended
by
one
dreadful
drawback
which
has
told
upon
my
heart
,
and
almost
equally
upon
my
skeleton
)
,
and
I
mean
to
live
by
my
calling
.
<EOS>
Putting
the
same
meaning
into
other
words
,
I
do
not
mean
to
turn
a
single
dishonest
penny
by
this
affair
.
<EOS>
As
the
best
amends
I
can
make
you
for
having
ever
gone
into
it
,
I
make
known
to
you
,
<EOS>
as
a
warning
,
what
Wegg
has
found
out
.
<EOS>
My
opinion
is
,
that
Wegg
is
not
to
be
silenced
at
a
modest
price
,
and
I
build
that
opinion
on
his
beginning
to
dispose
of
your
property
the
moment
he
knew
his
power
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
's
worth
your
while
to
silence
him
at
any
price
,
you
will
decide
for
yourself
,
and
take
your
measures
accordingly
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
I
have
no
price
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
ever
called
upon
for
the
truth
,
I
tell
it
,
but
I
want
to
do
no
more
than
I
have
now
done
and
ended
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Venus
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
hearty
grip
of
his
hand
;
"
thank'ee
,
Venus
,
thank'ee
,
Venus
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
walked
up
and
down
the
little
shop
in
great
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
But
look
here
,
Venus
,
"
he
by
-
and
-
by
resumed
,
nervously
sitting
down
again
;
"
if
I
have
to
buy
Wegg
up
,
I
sha
n't
buy
him
any
cheaper
for
your
being
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
his
having
half
the
money
---
it
was
to
have
been
half
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
Share
and
share
alike
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
to
have
been
half
,
sir
,
"
answered
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Instead
of
that
,
he
'll
now
have
all
.
<EOS>
I
shall
pay
the
same
,
if
not
more
.
<EOS>
For
you
tell
me
he
's
an
unconscionable
dog
,
a
ravenous
rascal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
,
"
said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
,
Venus
,
"
insinuated
Mr.
Boffin
,
after
looking
at
the
fire
for
a
while
---
"
<EOS>
do
n't
you
feel
as
if
---
you
might
like
to
pretend
to
be
in
it
till
Wegg
was
bought
up
,
and
then
ease
your
mind
by
handing
over
to
me
what
you
had
made
believe
to
pocket
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
I
do
n't
,
sir
,
"
returned
Venus
,
very
positively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
make
amends
?
"
insinuated
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
,
after
maturely
thinking
it
over
,
that
the
best
amends
for
having
got
out
of
the
square
is
to
get
back
into
the
square
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Humph
!
"
mused
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
say
the
square
,
you
mean
---
"
  
"
I
mean
,
"
said
Venus
,
stoutly
and
shortly
,
"
the
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
appears
to
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
grumbling
over
the
fire
in
an
injured
manner
,
"
that
the
right
is
with
me
,
if
it
's
anywhere
.
<EOS>
I
have
much
more
right
to
the
old
man
's
money
than
the
Crown
can
ever
have
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
Crown
to
him
except
the
King
's
Taxes
?
<EOS>
Whereas
,
me
and
my
wife
<EOS>
,
we
was
all
in
all
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
with
his
head
upon
his
hands
,
rendered
melancholy
by
the
contemplation
of
Mr.
Boffin
's
avarice
,
only
murmured
to
steep
himself
in
the
luxury
of
that
frame
of
mind
:
"
She
did
not
wish
so
to
regard
herself
,
nor
yet
to
be
so
regarded
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
am
I
to
live
,
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
piteously
,
"
if
I
'm
to
be
going
buying
fellows
up
out
of
the
little
that
I
've
got
?
<EOS>
And
how
am
I
to
set
about
it
?
<EOS>
When
am
I
to
get
my
money
ready
?
<EOS>
When
am
I
to
make
a
bid
?
<EOS>
You
have
n't
told
me
when
he
threatens
to
drop
down
upon
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Venus
explained
under
what
conditions
,
and
with
what
views
,
the
dropping
down
upon
Mr.
Boffin
was
held
over
until
the
Mounds
should
be
cleared
away
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
listened
attentively
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
 
said
he
,
with
a
gleam
of
hope
,
"
there
's
no
doubt
about
the
genuineness
and
date
of
this
confounded
will
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
whatever
,
"
said
Mr.
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
might
it
be
deposited
at
present
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
a
wheedling
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
in
my
possession
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
with
great
eagerness
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
for
any
liberal
sum
of
money
that
could
be
agreed
upon
,
Venus
,
would
you
put
it
in
the
fire
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
sir
,
I
would
n't
,
"
interrupted
Mr.
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
pass
it
over
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
The
Golden
Dustman
seemed
about
to
pursue
these
questions
,
when
a
stumping
noise
was
heard
outside
,
coming
towards
the
door
.
"
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
here
's
Wegg
!
"
said
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
Get
behind
the
young
alligator
in
the
corner
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
judge
him
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
light
a
candle
till
he
's
gone
;
there
'll
only
be
the
glow
of
the
fire
;
 
<EOS>
Wegg
's
well
acquainted
with
the
alligator
,
and
he
wo
n't
take
particular
notice
of
him
.
<EOS>
Draw
your
legs
in
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
at
present
I
see
a
pair
of
shoes
at
the
end
of
his
tail
.
<EOS>
Get
your
head
well
behind
his
smile
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
you
'll
lie
comfortable
there
;
you
'll
find
plenty
of
room
behind
his
smile
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
little
dusty
,
but
he
's
very
like
you
in
tone
.
<EOS>
Are
you
right
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
had
but
whispered
an
affirmative
response
,
when
Wegg
came
stumping
in
.
<EOS>
"
Partner
,
"
said
that
gentleman
in
a
sprightly
manner
,
"
how
's
yourself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tolerable
,
"
returned
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
Not
much
to
boast
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
-
deed
!
<EOS>
"
said
Wegg
:
"
sorry
,
partner
,
that
you
're
not
picking
up
faster
,
but
your
soul
's
too
large
for
your
body
,
sir
<EOS>
;
that
's
where
it
is
.
<EOS>
And
how
's
our
stock
in
trade
,
partner
?
<EOS>
Safe
bind
,
safe
find
,
partner
?
<EOS>
Is
that
about
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
wish
to
see
it
?
"
asked
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
please
,
partner
,
"
said
Wegg
,
rubbing
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
see
it
jintly
with
yourself
.
<EOS>
Or
,
in
similar
words
to
some
that
was
set
to
music
some
time
back
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
to
see
it
with
your
eyes
,
And
I
will
pledge
with
mine
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Turning
his
back
and
turning
a
key
,
Mr.
Venus
produced
the
document
,
holding
on
by
his
usual
corner
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
holding
on
by
the
opposite
corner
,
sat
down
on
the
seat
so
lately
vacated
by
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
looked
it
over
.
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
sir
,
"
he
slowly
and
unwillingly
admitted
,
in
his
reluctance
to
loose
his
hold
,
"
all
right
!
"
 
And
greedily
watched
his
partner
as
he
turned
his
back
again
,
and
turned
his
key
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
new
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Venus
,
resuming
his
low
chair
behind
the
counter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
there
is
,
sir
,
"
replied
Wegg
;
"
there
was
something
new
this
morning
.
<EOS>
That
foxey
old
grasper
and
griper
---
"
  
"
Mr.
Boffin
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Venus
,
with
a
glance
towards
the
alligator
's
yard
or
two
of
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mister
be
blowed
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wegg
,
yielding
to
his
honest
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Dusty
Boffin
.
<EOS>
That
foxey
old
grunter
and
grinder
,
sir
,
turns
into
the
yard
this
morning
,
to
meddle
with
our
property
,
a
menial
tool
of
his
own
,
a
young
man
by
the
name
of
Sloppy
.
<EOS>
Ecod
,
when
I
say
to
him
,
`
`
What
do
you
want
here
,
<EOS>
young
man
?
<EOS>
This
is
a
private
yard
,
"
"
he
pulls
out
a
paper
from
Boffin
's
other
blackguard
,
the
one
I
was
passed
over
for
.
<EOS>
`
`
This
is
to
authorize
Sloppy
to
overlook
the
carting
and
to
watch
the
work
.
"
<EOS>
"
That
's
pretty
strong
,
I
think
,
Mr.
Venus
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
he
does
n't
know
yet
of
our
claim
on
the
property
,
"
 
suggested
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
must
have
a
hint
of
it
,
"
said
Wegg
,
"
and
a
strong
one
that
'll
jog
his
terrors
a
bit
.
<EOS>
Give
him
an
inch
,
and
he
'll
take
an
ell
.
<EOS>
Let
him
alone
this
time
,
and
what
'll
he
do
with
our
property
next
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
,
Mr.
Venus
;
it
comes
to
this
;
I
must
be
overbearing
with
Boffin
,
or
I
shall
fly
into
several
pieces
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
contain
myself
when
I
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
Every
time
I
see
him
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
I
see
him
putting
it
into
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
Every
time
I
hear
him
jingling
his
money
,
I
hear
him
taking
liberties
with
my
money
.
<EOS>
Flesh
and
blood
ca
n't
bear
it
.
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Wegg
,
greatly
exasperated
,
"
and
I
'll
go
further
.
<EOS>
A
wooden
leg
ca
n't
bear
it
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
urged
Venus
,
"
it
was
your
own
idea
that
he
should
not
be
exploded
upon
,
till
the
Mounds
were
carted
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
was
likewise
my
idea
,
Mr.
Venus
,
"
retorted
Wegg
,
"
that
if
he
came
sneaking
and
sniffing
about
the
property
,
he
should
be
threatened
,
given
to
understand
that
he
has
no
right
to
it
,
and
be
made
our
slave
.
<EOS>
Was
n't
that
my
idea
,
Mr.
Venus
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
was
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
certainly
was
,
as
you
say
,
partner
,
"
assented
Wegg
,
put
into
a
better
humour
by
the
ready
admission
.
"
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
I
consider
his
planting
one
of
his
menial
tools
in
the
yard
,
an
act
of
sneaking
and
sniffing
.
<EOS>
And
his
nose
shall
be
put
to
the
grindstone
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
your
fault
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
I
must
admit
,
"
said
Venus
,
"
that
he
got
off
with
the
Dutch
bottle
that
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
handsomely
say
again
,
partner
!
<EOS>
No
,
it
was
not
my
fault
.
<EOS>
I
'd
have
had
that
bottle
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
Was
it
to
be
borne
that
he
should
come
,
like
a
thief
in
the
dark
,
digging
among
stuff
that
was
far
more
ours
than
his
(
seeing
that
we
could
deprive
him
of
every
grain
of
it
,
if
he
did
n't
buy
us
at
our
own
figure
)
,
and
carrying
off
treasure
from
its
bowels
?
<EOS>
No
,
it
was
not
to
be
borne
.
<EOS>
And
for
that
,
too
,
his
nose
shall
be
put
to
the
grindstone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
propose
to
do
it
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
put
his
nose
to
the
grindstone
?
<EOS>
I
propose
,
"
returned
that
estimable
man
,
"
to
insult
him
openly
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
looking
into
this
eye
of
mine
,
he
dares
to
offer
a
word
in
answer
,
to
retort
upon
him
before
he
can
take
his
breath
,
`
`
Add
another
word
to
that
<EOS>
,
you
dusty
old
dog
,
and
you
're
a
beggar
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
"
Suppose
he
says
nothing
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
replied
Wegg
,
"
we
shall
have
come
to
an
understanding
with
very
little
trouble
,
and
I
'll
break
him
and
drive
him
,
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
I
'll
put
him
in
harness
,
and
I
'll
bear
him
up
tight
,
and
I
'll
break
him
and
drive
him
.
<EOS>
The
harder
the
old
Dust
is
driven
,
sir
,
the
higher
he
'll
pay
.
<EOS>
And
I
mean
to
be
paid
high
,
Mr.
Venus
,
I
promise
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
quite
revengefully
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Revengefully
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Is
it
for
him
that
I
have
declined
and
falled
,
night
after
night
?
<EOS>
Is
it
for
his
pleasure
that
I
've
waited
at
home
of
an
evening
,
like
a
set
of
skittles
,
to
be
set
up
and
knocked
over
,
set
up
and
knocked
over
,
by
whatever
balls
---
or
books
<EOS>
---
he
chose
to
bring
against
me
?
<EOS>
Why
,
I
'm
a
hundred
times
the
man
he
is
,
sir
;
 
five
hundred
times
!
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
with
the
malicious
intent
of
urging
him
on
to
his
worst
that
Mr.
Venus
looked
as
if
he
doubted
that
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
<EOS>
Was
it
outside
the
house
at
present
ockypied
,
to
its
disgrace
,
by
that
minion
of
fortune
and
worm
of
the
hour
,
"
said
Wegg
,
falling
back
upon
his
strongest
terms
of
reprobation
,
and
slapping
the
counter
,
"
that
I
,
Silas
Wegg
,
five
hundred
times
the
man
he
ever
was
,
sat
in
all
weathers
,
waiting
for
a
errand
or
a
customer
?
<EOS>
Was
it
outside
that
very
house
as
I
first
set
eyes
upon
him
,
rolling
in
the
lap
of
luxury
,
when
I
was
a
selling
halfpenny
ballads
there
for
a
living
?
<EOS>
And
am
I
to
grovel
in
the
dust
for
him
to
walk
over
?
<EOS>
No
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
grin
upon
the
ghastly
countenance
of
the
French
gentleman
under
the
influence
of
the
firelight
,
as
if
he
were
computing
how
many
thousand
slanderers
and
traitors
array
themselves
against
the
fortunate
,
on
premises
exactly
answering
to
those
of
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
One
might
have
fancied
that
the
big
-
headed
babies
were
toppling
over
with
their
hydrocephalic
attempts
to
reckon
up
the
children
of
men
who
transform
their
benefactors
into
their
injurers
by
the
same
process
.
<EOS>
The
yard
or
two
of
smile
on
the
part
of
the
alligator
might
have
been
invested
with
the
meaning
,
"
All
about
this
was
quite
familiar
knowledge
down
in
the
depths
of
the
slime
,
ages
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Wegg
,
possibly
with
some
slight
perception
to
the
foregoing
effect
,
"
your
speaking
countenance
remarks
,
Mr.
Venus
,
that
I
'm
duller
and
savager
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
have
allowed
myself
to
brood
too
much
.
<EOS>
Begone
,
dull
Care
!
'
<EOS>
Tis
gone
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
've
looked
in
upon
you
,
and
empire
resumes
her
sway
.
<EOS>
For
,
as
the
song
says
---
subject
to
your
correction
,
sir
---
     
`
`
When
the
heart
of
a
man
is
depressed
with
cares
,
  
The
mist
is
dispelled
if
Venus
appears
.
  
<EOS>
Like
the
notes
of
a
fiddle
,
you
sweetly
,
sir
,
sweetly
,
  
Raises
our
spirits
and
charms
our
ears
.
"
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
you
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
before
long
,
"
 
remarked
Venus
,
"
respecting
my
share
in
the
project
we
've
been
speaking
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
time
,
sir
,
"
returned
Wegg
,
"
is
yours
.
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
let
it
be
fully
understood
that
I
shall
not
neglect
bringing
the
grindstone
to
bear
,
nor
yet
bringing
Dusty
Boffin
's
nose
to
it
.
<EOS>
His
nose
once
brought
to
it
,
shall
be
held
to
it
by
these
hands
,
Mr.
Venus
,
till
the
sparks
flies
out
in
showers
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
this
agreeable
promise
Wegg
stumped
out
,
and
shut
the
shop
-
door
after
him
.
"
<EOS>
Wait
till
I
light
a
candle
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
said
Venus
,
"
and
you
'll
come
out
more
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
,
he
lighting
a
candle
and
holding
it
up
at
arm
's
length
,
Mr.
Boffin
disengaged
himself
from
behind
the
alligator
's
smile
,
with
an
expression
of
countenance
so
very
downcast
that
it
not
only
appeared
as
if
the
alligator
had
the
whole
of
the
joke
to
himself
,
<EOS>
but
further
as
if
it
had
been
conceived
and
executed
at
Mr.
Boffin
's
expense
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
treacherous
fellow
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
dusting
his
arms
and
legs
as
he
came
forth
,
the
alligator
having
been
but
musty
company
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
dreadful
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
alligator
,
sir
?
"
said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Venus
,
no
.
<EOS>
The
Serpent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
the
goodness
to
notice
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
remarked
Venus
,
"
that
I
said
nothing
to
him
about
my
going
out
of
the
affair
altogether
,
because
I
did
n't
wish
to
take
you
anyways
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
be
too
soon
out
of
it
for
my
satisfaction
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
<EOS>
I
now
put
it
to
you
when
it
will
suit
your
views
for
me
to
retire
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Venus
,
thank'ee
,
Venus
;
but
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
,
"
 
returned
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
'll
drop
down
on
me
any
way
.
<EOS>
He
seems
fully
determined
to
drop
down
;
do
n't
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
opined
that
such
was
clearly
his
intention
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
might
be
a
sort
of
protection
for
me
,
if
you
remained
in
it
,
"
 
said
Mr.
Boffin
;
"
you
might
stand
betwixt
him
and
me
,
and
take
the
edge
off
him
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
feel
as
if
you
could
make
a
show
of
remaining
in
it
,
Venus
,
till
I
had
time
to
turn
myself
round
?
"
  
<EOS>
Venus
naturally
inquired
how
long
Mr.
Boffin
thought
it
might
take
him
to
turn
himself
round
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
,
"
was
the
answer
,
given
quite
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
"
Everything
is
so
at
sixes
and
sevens
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
never
come
into
the
property
,
I
should
n't
have
minded
.
<EOS>
But
being
in
it
,
it
would
be
very
trying
to
be
turned
out
;
now
,
do
n't
you
acknowledge
that
it
would
,
Venus
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
preferred
,
he
said
,
to
leave
Mr.
Boffin
to
arrive
at
his
own
conclusions
on
that
delicate
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
ask
advice
of
any
one
else
,
it
's
only
letting
in
another
person
to
be
bought
out
,
and
then
I
shall
be
ruined
that
way
,
and
might
as
well
have
given
up
the
property
and
gone
slap
to
the
workhouse
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
to
take
advice
of
my
young
man
,
Rokesmith
,
I
should
have
to
buy
him
out
.
<EOS>
Sooner
or
later
,
of
course
,
he
'd
drop
down
upon
me
,
like
Wegg
.
<EOS>
I
was
brought
into
the
world
to
be
dropped
down
upon
,
it
appears
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
listened
to
these
lamentations
in
silence
,
while
Mr.
Boffin
jogged
to
and
fro
,
holding
his
pockets
as
if
he
had
a
pain
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
you
have
n't
said
what
you
mean
to
do
yourself
,
Venus
.
<EOS>
When
you
do
go
out
of
it
,
how
do
you
mean
to
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Venus
replied
that
as
Wegg
had
found
the
document
and
handed
it
to
him
,
it
was
his
intention
to
hand
it
back
to
Wegg
,
with
the
declaration
that
he
himself
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
it
,
or
do
with
it
,
and
that
Wegg
must
act
as
he
chose
,
and
take
the
consequences
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
he
drops
down
with
his
whole
weight
upon
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr.
Boffin
,
ruefully
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
sooner
be
dropped
upon
by
you
than
by
him
,
or
even
by
you
jintly
,
than
by
him
alone
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
could
only
repeat
that
it
was
his
fixed
intention
to
betake
himself
to
the
paths
of
science
,
and
to
walk
in
the
same
all
the
days
of
his
life
;
not
dropping
down
upon
his
fellow
-
creatures
until
they
were
deceased
,
and
then
only
to
articulate
them
to
the
best
of
his
humble
ability
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
could
you
be
persuaded
to
keep
up
the
appearance
of
remaining
in
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
retiring
on
his
other
idea
.
<EOS>
"
Could
you
be
got
to
do
so
,
till
the
Mounds
are
gone
?
"
  
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
That
would
protract
the
mental
uneasiness
of
Mr.
Venus
too
long
,
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
I
was
to
show
you
reason
now
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Mr.
Boffin
;
"
not
if
I
was
to
show
you
good
and
sufficient
reason
?
"
  
<EOS>
If
by
good
and
sufficient
reason
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
meant
honest
and
unimpeachable
reason
,
that
might
weigh
with
Mr.
Venus
against
his
personal
wishes
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
But
he
must
add
that
he
saw
no
opening
to
the
possibility
of
such
reason
being
shown
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
see
me
,
Venus
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
at
my
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
reason
there
,
sir
?
"
asked
Mr.
Venus
,
with
an
incredulous
smile
and
blink
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
,
or
may
not
be
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
just
as
you
view
it
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
meantime
do
n't
go
out
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Look
here
.
<EOS>
Do
this
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
word
that
you
wo
n't
take
any
steps
with
Wegg
,
without
my
knowledge
,
just
as
I
have
given
you
my
word
that
I
wo
n't
without
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Done
,
Mr.
Boffin
!
<EOS>
"
said
Venus
,
after
brief
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Venus
,
thank'ee
,
Venus
!
<EOS>
Done
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
shall
I
come
to
see
you
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
you
like
.
<EOS>
The
sooner
the
better
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
going
now
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Good
-
night
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
good
-
night
to
the
rest
of
the
present
company
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
glancing
round
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
They
make
a
queer
show
,
Venus
,
and
I
should
like
to
be
better
acquainted
with
them
some
day
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
Venus
,
good
-
night
!
<EOS>
Thankee
,
Venus
,
thankee
,
Venus
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
that
he
jogged
out
into
the
street
,
and
jogged
upon
his
homeward
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
wonder
,
"
he
meditated
as
he
went
along
,
nursing
his
stick
,
"
whether
it
can
be
,
that
Venus
is
setting
himself
to
get
the
better
of
Wegg
?
<EOS>
Whether
it
can
be
,
that
he
means
,
when
I
have
bought
Wegg
out
,
to
have
me
all
to
himself
and
to
pick
me
clean
to
the
bones
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
cunning
and
suspicious
idea
,
quite
in
the
way
of
his
school
of
Misers
,
and
he
looked
very
cunning
and
suspicious
as
he
went
jogging
through
the
streets
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
or
twice
,
more
than
twice
or
thrice
,
say
half
a
dozen
times
,
he
took
his
stick
from
the
arm
on
which
he
nursed
it
,
and
hit
a
straight
sharp
rap
at
the
air
with
its
head
.
<EOS>
Possibly
the
wooden
countenance
of
Mr.
Silas
Wegg
was
incorporeally
before
him
at
those
moments
,
for
he
hit
with
intense
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
within
a
few
streets
of
his
own
house
,
when
a
little
private
carriage
,
coming
in
the
contrary
direction
,
passed
him
,
turned
round
,
and
passed
him
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
carriage
of
eccentric
movement
,
for
again
he
heard
it
stop
behind
him
and
turn
round
,
and
again
he
saw
it
pass
him
.
<EOS>
Then
it
stopped
,
and
then
went
on
,
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
But
,
not
far
out
of
sight
,
for
,
when
he
came
to
the
corner
of
his
own
street
,
there
it
stood
again
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
lady
's
face
at
the
window
as
he
came
up
with
this
carriage
,
and
he
was
passing
it
when
the
lady
softly
called
to
him
by
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Ma'am
?
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
coming
to
a
stop
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
said
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
went
up
to
the
window
,
and
hoped
Mrs.
Lammle
was
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
very
well
,
dear
Mr.
Boffin
;
I
have
fluttered
myself
by
being
---
perhaps
foolishly
---
uneasy
and
anxious
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
waiting
for
you
some
time
.
<EOS>
Can
I
speak
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
proposed
that
Mrs.
Lammle
should
drive
on
to
his
house
,
a
few
hundred
yards
further
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
not
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
unless
you
particularly
wish
it
.
<EOS>
I
feel
the
difficulty
and
delicacy
of
the
matter
so
much
that
I
would
rather
avoid
speaking
to
you
at
your
own
home
.
<EOS>
You
must
think
this
very
strange
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
said
no
,
but
meant
yes
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
because
I
am
so
grateful
for
the
good
opinion
of
all
my
friends
,
and
am
so
touched
by
it
,
that
I
can
not
bear
to
run
the
risk
of
forfeiting
it
in
any
case
,
even
in
the
cause
of
duty
.
<EOS>
I
have
asked
my
husband
(
my
dear
Alfred
,
Mr.
Boffin
)
whether
it
is
the
cause
of
duty
,
and
he
has
most
emphatically
said
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
asked
him
sooner
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
spared
me
much
distress
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
"
Can
this
be
more
dropping
down
upon
me
!
"
thought
Mr.
Boffin
,
quite
bewildered
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
Alfred
who
sent
me
to
you
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Alfred
said
,
`
`
Do
n't
come
back
,
Sophronia
,
until
you
have
seen
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
told
him
all
.
<EOS>
Whatever
he
may
think
of
it
,
he
ought
certainly
to
know
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
Would
you
mind
coming
into
the
carriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
answered
,
"
Not
at
all
,
"
and
took
his
seat
at
Mrs.
Lammle
's
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Drive
slowly
anywhere
,
"
Mrs.
Lammle
called
to
her
coachman
,
"
and
do
n't
let
the
carriage
rattle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
more
dropping
down
,
I
think
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
What
next
?
"
   
<EOS>
THE
GOLDEN
DUSTMAN
<EOS>
AT
<EOS>
HIS
WORST
.
 
<EOS>
The
breakfast
table
at
Mr.
Boffin
's
was
usually
a
very
pleasant
one
,
and
was
always
presided
over
by
Bella
.
<EOS>
As
though
he
began
each
new
day
in
his
healthy
natural
character
,
and
some
waking
hours
were
necessary
to
his
relapse
into
the
corrupting
influences
of
his
wealth
,
the
face
and
the
demeanour
of
the
Golden
Dustman
were
generally
unclouded
at
that
meal
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
easy
to
believe
then
,
that
there
was
no
change
in
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
the
day
went
on
that
the
clouds
gathered
,
and
the
brightness
of
the
morning
became
obscured
.
<EOS>
One
might
have
said
that
the
shadows
of
avarice
and
distrust
lengthened
as
his
own
shadow
lengthened
,
and
that
the
night
closed
around
him
gradually
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
one
morning
long
afterwards
to
be
remembered
,
it
was
black
midnight
with
the
Golden
Dustman
when
he
first
appeared
.
<EOS>
His
altered
character
had
never
been
so
grossly
marked
.
<EOS>
His
bearing
towards
his
Secretary
was
so
charged
with
insolent
distrust
and
arrogance
,
that
the
latter
rose
and
left
the
table
before
breakfast
was
half
done
.
<EOS>
The
look
he
directed
at
the
Secretary
's
retiring
figure
was
so
cunningly
malignant
,
that
Bella
would
have
sat
astounded
and
indignant
,
even
though
he
had
not
gone
the
length
of
secretly
threatening
Rokesmith
with
his
clenched
fist
as
he
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
This
unlucky
morning
,
of
all
mornings
in
the
year
,
was
the
morning
next
after
Mr.
Boffin
's
interview
with
Mrs.
Lammle
in
her
little
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
looked
to
Mrs.
Boffin
's
face
for
comment
on
,
or
explanation
of
,
this
stormy
humour
in
her
husband
,
but
none
was
there
.
<EOS>
An
anxious
and
a
distressed
observation
of
her
own
face
was
all
she
could
read
in
it
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
left
alone
together
---
which
was
not
until
noon
,
for
Mr.
Boffin
sat
long
in
his
easy
-
chair
,
by
turns
jogging
up
and
down
the
breakfast
-
room
,
clenching
his
fist
and
muttering
---
Bella
,
in
consternation
,
asked
her
what
had
happened
,
what
was
wrong
?
<EOS>
"
I
am
forbidden
to
speak
to
you
about
it
,
Bella
dear
;
 
I
must
n't
tell
you
,
"
was
all
the
answer
she
could
get
.
<EOS>
And
still
,
whenever
,
in
her
wonder
and
dismay
,
she
raised
her
eyes
to
Mrs.
Boffin
's
face
,
she
saw
in
it
the
same
anxious
and
distressed
observation
of
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
Oppressed
by
her
sense
that
trouble
was
impending
,
and
lost
in
speculations
why
Mrs.
Boffin
should
look
at
her
as
if
she
had
any
part
in
it
,
Bella
found
the
day
long
and
dreary
.
<EOS>
It
was
far
on
in
the
afternoon
when
,
she
being
in
her
own
room
,
a
servant
brought
her
a
message
from
Mr.
Boffin
begging
her
to
come
to
his
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
was
there
,
seated
on
a
sofa
,
and
Mr.
Boffin
was
jogging
up
and
down
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Bella
he
stopped
,
beckoned
her
to
him
,
and
drew
her
arm
through
his
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
,
gently
;
"
I
am
not
angry
with
you
.
<EOS>
Why
you
actually
tremble
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
Bella
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
you
righted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
See
me
righted
?
"
thought
Bella
.
<EOS>
And
then
repeated
aloud
in
a
tone
of
astonishment
:
<EOS>
"
see
me
righted
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
See
you
righted
.
<EOS>
Send
Mr.
Rokesmith
here
,
you
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
would
have
been
lost
in
perplexity
if
there
had
been
pause
enough
;
but
the
servant
found
Mr.
Rokesmith
near
at
hand
,
and
he
almost
immediately
presented
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shut
the
door
,
sir
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
got
something
to
say
to
you
which
I
fancy
<EOS>
you
'll
not
be
pleased
to
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
reply
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
returned
the
Secretary
,
as
,
having
closed
the
door
,
he
turned
and
faced
him
,
"
that
I
think
that
very
likely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
"
blustered
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
it
has
become
no
novelty
to
me
to
hear
from
your
lips
what
I
would
rather
not
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
we
shall
change
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
with
a
threatening
roll
of
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
returned
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
He
was
quiet
and
respectful
;
 
but
stood
,
as
Bella
thought
(
and
was
glad
to
think
)
,
on
his
manhood
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
<EOS>
look
at
this
young
lady
on
my
arm
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
involuntarily
raising
her
eyes
,
when
this
sudden
reference
was
made
to
herself
,
met
those
of
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
He
was
pale
and
seemed
agitated
.
<EOS>
Then
her
eyes
passed
on
to
Mrs.
Boffin
's
,
and
she
met
the
look
again
.
<EOS>
In
a
flash
it
enlightened
her
,
and
she
began
to
understand
what
she
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
to
you
,
sir
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
repeated
,
"
<EOS>
look
at
this
young
lady
on
my
arm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
so
,
"
returned
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
As
his
glance
rested
again
on
Bella
for
a
moment
,
she
thought
there
was
reproach
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
possible
that
the
reproach
was
within
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
tamper
,
unknown
to
me
,
with
this
young
lady
?
<EOS>
How
dare
you
come
out
of
your
station
,
and
your
place
in
my
house
,
to
pester
this
young
lady
with
your
impudent
addresses
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
decline
to
answer
questions
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
"
that
are
so
offensively
asked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
decline
to
answer
?
"
retorted
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
You
decline
to
answer
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
Then
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
Rokesmith
;
I
'll
answer
for
you
.
<EOS>
There
are
two
sides
to
this
matter
,
and
I
'll
take
'em
separately
.
<EOS>
The
first
side
is
,
sheer
Insolence
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
first
side
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Secretary
smiled
with
some
bitterness
,
as
though
he
would
have
said
,
"
So
I
see
and
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
sheer
Insolence
in
you
,
I
tell
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
even
to
think
of
this
young
lady
.
<EOS>
This
young
lady
was
far
above
you
.
<EOS>
This
young
lady
was
no
match
for
you
.
<EOS>
This
young
lady
was
lying
in
wait
(
as
she
was
qualified
to
do
)
for
money
,
and
you
had
no
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
hung
her
head
and
seemed
to
shrink
a
little
from
Mr.
Boffin
's
protecting
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
,
I
should
like
to
know
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
that
you
were
to
have
the
audacity
to
follow
up
this
young
lady
?
<EOS>
This
young
lady
was
looking
about
the
market
for
a
good
bid
;
she
was
n't
in
it
to
be
snapped
up
by
fellows
that
had
no
money
to
lay
out
;
nothing
to
buy
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mr.
Boffin
!
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
,
pray
say
something
for
me
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Bella
,
disengaging
her
arm
,
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Old
lady
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
anticipating
his
wife
,
"
you
hold
your
tongue
.
<EOS>
Bella
,
my
dear
,
do
n't
you
let
yourself
be
put
out
.
<EOS>
I
'll
right
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
,
you
do
n't
right
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Bella
,
with
great
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
You
wrong
me
,
wrong
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
be
put
out
,
my
dear
,
"
complacently
retorted
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bring
this
young
man
to
book
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
Rokesmith
!
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
decline
to
hear
,
you
know
,
as
well
as
to
answer
.
<EOS>
You
hear
me
tell
you
that
the
first
side
of
your
conduct
was
Insolence
---
Insolence
and
Presumption
.
<EOS>
Answer
me
one
thing
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
this
young
lady
tell
you
so
herself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
?
"
asked
Bella
with
her
face
still
covered
.
<EOS>
"
O
say
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
!
<EOS>
Did
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
distressed
,
Miss
Wilfer
;
it
matters
very
little
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
deny
it
,
though
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
knowing
shake
of
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
asked
him
to
forgive
me
since
,
"
cried
Bella
;
"
and
I
would
ask
him
to
forgive
me
now
again
,
upon
my
knees
,
if
it
would
spare
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mrs.
Boffin
broke
out
a
-
crying
.
  
<EOS>
"
Old
lady
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
stop
that
noise
!
<EOS>
Tender
-
hearted
in
you
,
Miss
Bella
;
but
I
mean
to
have
it
out
right
through
with
this
young
man
,
having
got
him
into
a
corner
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
's
one
side
of
your
conduct
---
Insolence
and
Presumption
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
'm
a
-
coming
to
the
other
,
which
is
much
worse
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
speculation
of
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
indignantly
deny
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
your
denying
it
;
it
does
n't
signify
a
bit
whether
you
deny
it
or
not
;
I
've
got
a
head
upon
my
shoulders
,
and
it
ai
n't
a
baby
's
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
gathering
himself
together
in

most
suspicious
attitude

wrinkling
his
face
into
a

map
of
curves

corners

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
I
know
what
grabs
are
made
at
a
man
with
money
?
<EOS>
If
I
did
n't
keep
my
eyes
open
,
and
my
pockets
buttoned
,
should
n't
I
be
brought
to
the
workhouse
before
I
knew
where
I
was

<EOS>
Was
n't
the
experience
of
Dancer
,
and
Elwes
,
and
Hopkins
,
and
Blewbury
Jones
,
and
ever
so
many
more
of
'em
,
similar
to
mine
?
<EOS>
Did
n't
everybody
want
to
make
grabs
at
what
they
'd
got
,
and
bring
'em
to
poverty
and
ruin
?
<EOS>
Were
n't
they
forced
to
hide
everything
belonging
to
'em
,
for
fear
it
should
be
snatched
from
'em
?
<EOS>
Of
course
they
was
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
told
next
that
they
did
n't
know
human
natur

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
!
<EOS>
Poor
creatures
,
"
murmured
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
snapping
at
him
,
"
However
,
you
need
n't
be
at
the
trouble
of
repeating
it
,
for
it
ai
n't
worth
hearing
,
and
wo
n't
go
down
with
me

<EOS>
I
'm
a
-
going
to
unfold
your
plan
,
before
this
young
lady
;
I
'm
a
-
going
to
show
this
young
lady
the
second
view
of
you
;

nothing
you
can
say
will
stave
it
off

<EOS>
(
Now

attend
here
,
Bella

my
dear

<EOS>
Rokesmith
,
you
're
a
needy
chap

<EOS>
You
're
a
chap

I
pick
up

street

Are
you

you

<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
Mr.
Boffin
;
do
n't
appeal
to
me

<EOS>
"
Not
appeal
to
you

retorted
Mr.
Boffin
as
if
he
had
n't
done
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
should
hope
not

<EOS>
Appealing
to
you
,
would
be
rather
a
rum
course
.
<EOS>
As
I
was
saying
,
you
're
a
needy
chap
that
I
pick
up
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
You
come
and
ask
me
in
the
street
to
take
you
for
a
Secretary
,
and
I
take
you
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
bad
,
"
murmured
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
snapping
at
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
returned
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
after
eyeing
him
with
a
comical
look
of
discomfited
curiosity
,
was
fain
to
begin
afresh
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
Rokesmith
is
a
needy
young
man
that
I
take
for
my
Secretary
out
of
the
open
street
.
<EOS>
This
Rokesmith
gets
acquainted
with
my
affairs
,
and
gets
to
know
that
I
mean
to
settle
a
sum
of
money
on
this
young
lady
.
`
`
Oho
!
"
"
says
this
Rokesmith
;
"
here
Mr.
Boffin
clapped
a
finger
against
his
nose
,
and
tapped
it
several
times
with
a
sneaking
air
,
as
embodying
Rokesmith
confidentially
confabulating
with
his
own
nose
;
"
`
`
This
will
be
a
good
haul
;
I
'll
go
in
for
this
!
"
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
this
Rokesmith
,
greedy
and
hungering
,
begins
a
-
creeping
on
his
hands
and
knees
towards
the
money
.
<EOS>
Not
so
bad
a
speculation
either
:
for
if
this
young
lady
had
had
less
spirit
,
or
had
had
less
sense
,
through
being
at
all
in
the
romantic
line
,
by
George
he
might
have
worked
it
out
and
made
it
pay
!
<EOS>
But
fortunately
she
was
too
many
for
him
,
and
a
pretty
figure
he
cuts
now
he
is
exposed

<EOS>
There
he
stands

said
Mr.
Boffin
,
addressing
Rokesmith
himself
with
ridiculous
inconsistency

Look

<EOS>
"
Your

the
Secretary

<EOS>
"
Precious

Mr.

<EOS>
"
---
are
not
to
be
combated
by
any
one
,
and
I
address
myself
to
no
such
hopeless
task

<EOS>
But
I
will
say
a
word
upon
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yah
!
<EOS>
Much
you
care
about
the

Mr.

his
fingers

<EOS>
"
Noddy

expostulated
his

<EOS>
"
Old

returned
Mr.

,
"
you
keep
still

I
say
to
this
Rokesmith
here

much

I
tell

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Our
connexion
being
at
an
end
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
"
it
can
be
of
very
little
moment
to
me
what
you
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
You
are
knowing
enough
,
"
retorted
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
sly
look
.
"
<EOS>
to
have
found
out
that
our
connexion
's
at
an
end

eh
?
<EOS>
But
you
ca
n't
get
beforehand
with
me
.
<EOS>
Look
at
this
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
This
is
your
pay
,
on
your
discharge
.
<EOS>
You
can
only
follow
suit
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
deprive
me
of
the
lead
.
<EOS>
Let
's
have
no
pretending
that
you
discharge
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
discharge
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
that
I
go
,
"
remarked
the
Secretary
,
waving
the
point
aside
with
his
hand
,
"
it
is
all
one
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
two
to
me
,
let
me
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Allowing
a
fellow
that
's
found
out
,
to
discharge
himself
,
is
one
thing
;
 
discharging
him
for
insolence
and
presumption
,
and
likewise
for
designs
upon
his
master
's
money
,
is
another
.
<EOS>
One
and
one
's
two
;
 
not
one
.
<EOS>
(
Old
lady
,
do
n't
you
cut
in
.
<EOS>
You
keep
still
.
)
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
said
all
you
wish
to
say
to
me
?
"
demanded
the
Secretary
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
have
or
not
,
"
answered
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
It
depends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
consider
whether
there
are
any
other
strong
expressions
that
you
would
like
to
bestow
upon
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
consider
that
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
obstinately
,
"
at
my
convenience
,

not
at
yours

<EOS>
You
want
the
last
word
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
suitable
to
let
you
have
it

"
  
<EOS>
"
Noddy
!
<EOS>
My
dear
,
dear
Noddy
!
<EOS>
You
sound
so
hard
!
"
<EOS>
cried
poor
Mrs.
Boffin
,
not
to
be
quite
repressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Old
lady
,
"
said
her
husband
,
but
without
harshness
,
"
if
you
cut
in
when
requested
not
,
I
'll
get
a
pillow
and
carry
you
out
of

it

<EOS>
What
do
you
want
to
say
,
you
Rokesmith
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
you
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
to
Miss
Wilfer
and
to
your
good
kind
wife
,
a
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Out
with
it
then
,
"
replied
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
and
cut
it
short
,
for
we
've
had
enough
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
borne
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
with
my
false
position
here
,
that
I
might
not
be
separated
from
Miss
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
To
be
near
her
,
has
been
a
recompense
to
me
from
day
to
day
,
even
for
the
undeserved
treatment
I
have
had
here
,
and
for
the
degraded
aspect
in
which
she
has
often
seen
me
.
<EOS>
Since
Miss
Wilfer
rejected
me
,
I
have
never
again
urged
my
suit
,
to
the
best
of
my
belief
,
with
a
spoken
syllable
or
a
look
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
never
changed
in
my
devotion
to
her
,
except
---
if
she
will
forgive
my
saying
so
---
<EOS>
that
it
is
deeper
than
it
was
,
and
better
founded
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
mark
this
chap
's
saying
Miss
Wilfer
,
<EOS>
when
he
means
£
s.
d.
!

cried
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
cunning
wink
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
mark
this
chap
's
making
Miss
Wilfer
stand
for
Pounds
,
Shillings
,
and
Pence
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
feeling
for
Miss
Wilfer
,
"
pursued
the
Secretary
,
without
deigning
to
notice
him
,
"
is
not
one
to
be
ashamed
of
.
<EOS>
I
avow
it
.
<EOS>
I
love
her
.
<EOS>
Let
me
go
where
I
may
when
I
presently
leave
this
house
,
I
shall
go
into
a
blank
life
,
leaving
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Leaving
£
s.
d.
behind
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
by
way
of
commentary
,
with
another
wink
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
incapable
,
"
the
Secretary
went
on
,
still
without
heeding
him
,
"
of
a
mercenary
project
,
or
a
mercenary
thought
,
in
connexion
with
Miss
Wilfer
,
is
nothing
meritorious
in
me
,
because
any
prize
that
I
could
put
before
my
fancy
would
sink
into
insignificance
beside
her
.
<EOS>
If
the
greatest
wealth
or
the
highest
rank
were
hers
,
it
would
only
be
important
in
my
sight
as
removing
her
still
farther
from
me
,
and
making
me
more
hopeless
,
if
that
could
be
.
<EOS>
Say
,
"
remarked
the
Secretary
,
looking
full
at
his
late
master
,
"
say
that
with
a
word
she
could
strip
Mr.
Boffin
of
his
fortune
and
take
possession
of
it
,
she
would
be
of
no
greater
worth
in
my
eyes
than
she
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
by
this
time
,
old
lady
,
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
turning
to
his
wife
in
a
bantering
tone
,
"
about
this
Rokesmith
here
,
and
his
caring
for
the
truth
?
<EOS>
You
need
n't
say
what
you
think
,
<EOS>
my
dear
,
because
I
do
n't
want
you
to
cut
in
,
but
you
can
think
it
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
As
to
taking
possession
of
my
property
,
I
warrant
you
he
would
n't
do
that
himself
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
returned
the
Secretary
,
with
another
full
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
laughed
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
like
a
good
'
un
while
you
are
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
for
a
moment
,
"
said
the
Secretary
,
turning
from
him
and
falling
into
his
former
manner
,
"
diverted
from
the
little
I
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
My
interest
in
Miss
Wilfer
began
when
I
first
saw
her
;
 
even
began
when
I
had
only
heard
of
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
in
fact
,
the
cause
of
my
throwing
myself
in
Mr.
Boffin
's
way
,
and
entering
his
service
.
<EOS>
Miss
Wilfer
has
never
known
this
until
now
.
<EOS>
I
mention
it
now
,
only
as
a
corroboration
(
though
I
hope
it
may
be
needless
)
of
my
being
free
from
the
sordid
design
attributed
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
this
is
a
very
artful
dog
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
a
deep
look
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
longer
-
headed
schemer
than
I
thought
him
.
<EOS>
See
how
patiently
and
methodically
he
goes
to
work
.
<EOS>
He
gets
to
know
about
me
and
my
property
,
and
about
this
young
lady
,
and
her
share
in
poor
young
John
's
story
,
and
he
puts
this
and
that
together
,
and
he
says
to
himself
,
`
`
I
'll
get
in
with
Boffin
,
and
I
'll
get
in
with
this
young
lady
,
and
I
'll
work
'em
both
at
the
same
time
,
and
I
'll
bring
my
pigs
to
market
somewhere
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
hear
him
say
it
,
bless
you
!
<EOS>
Why
,
I
look
at
him
,
now
,
and
I
see
him
say
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
pointed
at
the
culprit
,
as
it
were
in
the
act
,
and
hugged
himself
in
his
great
penetration
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
luckily
he
had
n't
to
deal
with
the
people
he
supposed
,
Bella
,
my
dear
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Luckily
he
had
to
deal
with
you
,
and
with
me
,
and
with
Daniel
and
Miss
Dancer
,
and
with
Elwes
,
and
with
Vulture
Hopkins
,
and
with
Blewbury
Jones
and
all
the
rest
of
us
,
one
down
t'other
come
on
.
<EOS>
And
he
's
beat
;
that
's
what
he
is
;
regularly
beat
.
<EOS>
He
,
thought
to
squeeze
money
out
of
us
,
and
he
has
done
for
himself
instead
,
Bella
my
dear
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
my
dear
made
no
response
,
gave
no
sign
of
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
first
covered
her
face
she
had
sunk
upon
a
chair
with
her
hands
resting
on
the
back
of
it
,
and
had
never
moved
since
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
silence
at
this
point
,
and
Mrs.
Boffin
softly
rose
as
if
to
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
Mr.
Boffin
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
,
and
she
obediently
sat
down
again
and
stayed
where
she
was
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
your
pay
,
Mister
Rokesmith
,
"
said
the
Golden
Dustman
,
jerking
the
folded
scrap
of
paper
he
had
in
his
hand
,
towards
his
late
Secretary
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
you
can
stoop
to
pick
it
up
,
after
what
you
have
stooped
to
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
stooped
to
nothing
<EOS>
but
this
,
"
Rokesmith
answered
as
he
took
it
from
the
ground
;
"
and
this
is
mine
,
for
I
have
earned
it
by
the
hardest
of
hard
labour
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're

pretty
quick
packer
,
I
hope
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
;
"
because
the
sooner
you
are
gone
,
bag
and
baggage
,
the
better
for
all
parties

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
have
no
fear
of
my
lingering

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
just
one
thing
though
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
that
I
should
like
to
ask
you
before
we
come
to
a
good
riddance
,
if
it
was
only
to
show
this
young
lady
how
conceited
you
schemers
are
,
in
thinking
that
nobody
finds
out
how
you
contradict
yourselves
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
me
anything
you
wish
to
ask
,
"
returned
Rokesmith
,
"
but
use
the
expedition
that
you
recommend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
pretend
to
have
a
mighty
admiration
for
this
young
lady
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
laying
his
hand
protectingly
on
Bella
's
head
without
looking
down
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
pretend
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Well
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
mighty
admiration
for
this
young
lady

since
you
are
so
particular
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
reconcile
that
,
with
this
young
lady
's
being
a
weak
-
spirited
,
improvident
idiot
,
not
knowing
what
was
due
to
herself
,
flinging
up
her
money
to
the
church

weathercocks

racing
off
at
a
splitting
pace
for
the
workhouse

"
I
do
n't

you

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do

you
?
<EOS>
Or

you

<EOS>
What
else

you
have
made
this
young

out
to
be

she
had
listened
to
such
addresses

yours

<EOS>

happy

"
Win
her
affections

Mr.

with
ineffable
contempt

<EOS>
John
Rokesmith
started
at
him
in
his
outburst
,
as
if
with
some
faint
idea
that
he
had
gone
mad
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
due
to
this
young
lady
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
is
Money
,
and
this
young

<EOS>
right
well
knows
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>

You

<EOS>
"
You
slander
the
young
lady
;
you
with
your
affections

hearts

trumpery

"
returned
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
your
behaviour
.
<EOS>
I
heard
of
these
doings
of
yours
only
last
night
,
or
you
should
have
heard
of
'em
from
me
,
sooner
,
take
your
oath
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
heard
of
'em
from
a
lady
with
as
good
a
headpiece
as
the
best
,
and
she
knows
this
young
lady
,
and
I
know
this
young
lady
,
and
we
all
three
know
that
it
's
Money
<EOS>
she
makes
a
stand
for
---
money
,
money
,
money
---
and
that
you
and
your
affections
and
hearts
are
a
Lie
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
said
Rokesmith
,
quietly
turning
to
her
,
"
for
your
delicate
and
unvarying
kindness
<EOS>
I
thank
you
with
the
warmest
gratitude

<EOS>
Good

<EOS>
Miss
Wilfer
,
good

"
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
laying
his
hand
on
Bella
's
head
again
,
"
you
may
begin
to
make
yourself
quite
comfortable
,
and
I
hope
you
feel
that
you
've
been
righted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
Bella
was
so
far
from
appearing
to
feel
it
,
that
she
shrank
from
his
hand
and
from
the
chair
,
and
,
starting
up
in
an
incoherent
passion
of
tears
,
and
stretching
out
her
arms
,
cried
,
"
O
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
before
you
go
,
if
you
could
but
make
me
poor
again
!
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
Make
me
poor
again
,
Somebody
,
I
beg
and
pray
,
or
my
heart
will
break
if
this
goes
on
!
<EOS>
Pa
,
dear
,
make
me
poor
again
and
take
me
home
!
<EOS>
I
was
bad
enough
there
,
but
I
have
been
so
much
worse
here
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
give
me
money
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
I
wo
n't
have
money
.
<EOS>
Keep
it
away
from
me
,
and
only
let
me
speak
to
good
little
Pa
,
and
lay
my
head
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
tell
him
all
my
griefs
.
<EOS>
NObody
else
can
understand
me
,
nobody
else
can
comfort
me
,
nobody
else
knows
how
unworthy
I
am
,
and
yet
can
love
me
like
a
little
child
.
<EOS>
I
am
better
with
Pa
than
any
one
---
more
innocent
,
more
sorry
,
more
glad
!
"
<EOS>
So
,
crying
out
in
a
wild
way
that
she
could
not
bear
this
,
Bella
drooped
her
head
on
Mrs.
Boffin
's
ready
breast
.
  
<EOS>
John
Rokesmith
from
his
place
in
the
room
,
and
Mr.
Boffin
from
his
,
looked
on
at
her
in
silence
until
she
was
silent
herself
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr.
Boffin
observed
in
a
soothing
and
comfortable
tone
,
"
There
,
my
dear
,
there
;
you
are
righted
now
,
and
it
's
all
right
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wonder
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
at
your
being
a
little
flurried
by
having
a
scene
with
this
fellow
,
but
it
's
all
over
,
my
dear
,
and
you
're
righted
,
and
it
's
---
<EOS>
and
it
's
all
right
!
"
<EOS>
Which
Mr.
Boffin
repeated
with
a
highly
satisfied
air
of
completeness
and
finality
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hate
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
,
turning
suddenly
upon
him
,
with
a
stamp
of
her
little
foot
---
<EOS>
"
at
least
,
I
ca
n't
hate
you
,
but
I
do
n't
like
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hul
---
lo
!
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Boffin
in
an
amazed
under
-
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
scolding
,
unjust
,
abusive
,
aggravating
,
bad
old
creature
!
"
 
cried
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
angry
with
my
ungrateful
self
for
calling
you
names
;
but
you
are
,
you
are
;
you
know
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
stared
here
,
and
stared
there
,
as
misdoubting
that
he
must
be
in
some
sort
of
fit
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
you
with
shame
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
shame
for
myself
,
and
with
shame
for
you
.
<EOS>
You
ought
to
be
above
the
base
talebearing
of
a
time
-
serving
woman
;
but
you
are
above
nothing
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
seeming
to
become
convinced
that
this
was
a
fit
,
rolled
his
eyes
and
loosened
his
neckcloth
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
came
here
,
I
respected
you
and
honored
you
,
and
I
soon
loved
you
,
"
cried
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
now
I
ca
n't
bear
the
sight
of
you
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
I
do
n't
know
that
I
ought
to
go
so
far
as
that
<EOS>
---
only
you
're
a
---
you
're
a
Monster
!
"
<EOS>
Having
shot
this
bolt
out
with
a
great
expenditure
of
force
,
Bella
hysterically
laughed
and
cried
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
wish
I
can
wish
you
is
,
"
said
Bella
,
returning
to
the
charge
,
"
that
you
had
not
one
single
farthing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
If
any
true
friend
and
well
-
wisher
could
make
you
a
bankrupt
,
you
would
be
a
Duck
;
but
as
a
man
of
property
you
are
a
Demon
!
"
  
<EOS>
After
despatching
this
second
bolt
with
a
still
greater
expenditure
of
force
,
Bella
laughed
and
cried
still
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
pray
stay
one
moment
.
<EOS>
Pray
hear
one
word
from
me
before
you
go
!
<EOS>
I
am
deeply
sorry
for
the
reproaches
you
have
borne
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
Out
of
the
depths
of
my
heart
I
earnestly
and
truly
beg
your
pardon
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
stepped
towards
him
,
he
met
her
.
<EOS>
As
she
gave
him
her
hand
,
he
put
it
to
his
lips
,
and
said
,
"
God
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
No
laughing
was
mixed
with
Bella
's
crying
then
;
her
tears
were
pure
and
fervent
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
not
an
ungenerous
word
that
I
have
heard
addressed
to
you
---
heard
with
scorn
and
indignation
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
---
but
it
has
wounded
me
far
more
than
you
,
for
I
have
deserved
it
,
and
you
never
have
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
it
is
to
me
you
owe
this
perverted
account
of
what
passed
between
us
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
parted
with
the
secret
,
even
while
I
was
angry
with
myself
for
doing
so
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
bad
in
me
,
but
indeed
it
was
not
wicked
.
<EOS>
I
did
it
in
a
moment
of
conceit
and
folly
 
---
one
of
my
many
such
moments
---
one
of
my
many
such
hours
---
years
.
<EOS>
As
I
am
punished
for
it
severely
,
try
to
forgive
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
with
all
my
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
O
thank
you
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
part
from
me
till
I
have
said
one
other
word
,
to
do
you
justice
.
<EOS>
The
only
fault
you
can
be
truly
charged
with
,
in
having
spoken
to
me
as
you
did
that
night
---
with
how
much
delicacy
and
<EOS>
how
much
forbearance
<EOS>
no
one
<EOS>
but
I
can
know
or
be
grateful
to
you
for
---
<EOS>
is
,
that
you
laid
yourself
open
to
be
slighted
by
a
worldly
shallow
girl
whose
head
was
turned
,
and
who
was
quite
unable
to
rise
to
the
worth
of
what
you
offered
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
that
girl
has
often
seen
herself
in
a
pitiful
and
poor
light
since
,
but
never
in
so
pitiful
and
poor
a
light
as
now
,
when
the
mean
tone
in
which
she
answered
you
---
sordid
and
vain
girl
that
she
was
---
has
been
echoed
in
her
ears
by
Mr.
Boffin
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
kissed
her
hand
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Boffin
's
speeches
were
detestable
to
me
,
shocking
to
me
,
"
said
Bella
,
startling
that
gentleman
with
another
stamp
of
her
little
foot
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
quite
true
that
there
was
a
time
,
and
very
lately
,
when
I
deserved
to
be
so
`
`
righted
,
"
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
;
but
I
hope
that
I
shall
never
deserve
it
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
once
more
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
,
and
then
relinquished
it
,
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Bella
was
hurrying
back
to
the
chair
in
which
she
had
hidden
her
face
<EOS>
so
long
,
when
,
catching
sight
of
Mrs.
Boffin
by
the
way
,
she
stopped
at
her
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
gone
,
"
sobbed
Bella
indignantly
,
despairingly
,
in
fifty
ways
at
once
,
with
her
arms
round
Mrs.
Boffin
's
neck
.
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
most
shamefully
abused
,
and
most
unjustly
and
most
basely
driven
away
,
and
I
am
the
cause
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
Mr.
Boffin
had
been
rolling
his
eyes
over
his
loosened
neckerchief
,
as
if
his
fit
were
still
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Appearing
now
to
thing
that
he
was
coming
to
,
he
stared
straight
before
him
for
a
while
,
tied
his
neckerchief
again
,
took
several
long
inspirations
,
swallowed
several
times
,
and
ultimately
exclaimed
with
a
deep
sigh
,
as
if
he
felt
himself
on
the
whole
better
:
"
Well
!
"
  
<EOS>
No
word
,
good
or
bad
,
did
Mrs.
Boffin
say
;
but
she
tenderly
took
care
of
Bella
,
and
glanced
at
her
husband
as
if
for
orders
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
without
imparting
any
,
took
his
seat
on
a
chair
over
against
them
,
and
there
sat
leaning
forward
,
with
a
fixed
countenance
,
his
legs
apart
,
a
hand
on
each
knee
,
and
his
elbows
squared
,
until
Bella
should
dry
her
eyes
and
raise
her
head
,
which
in
the
fulness
of
time
she
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
home
,
"
said
Bella
,
rising
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
,
but
I
ca
n't
stay
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
My
darling
girl

"
remonstrated
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
ca
n't
stay
here
,
"
said
Bella
;
"
I
ca
n't
indeed
.
<EOS>
---
Ugh
!
<EOS>
you
vicious
old
thing
!
"
<EOS>
(
This
to
Mr.
Boffin
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
rash
,
my
love
,
"
urged
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Think
well
of
what
you
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
had
better
think
well
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
more
think
well
of
you
,
"
cried
Bella
,
cutting
him
short
,
with
intense
defiance
in
her
expressive
little
eyebrows
,
and
championship
of
the
late
Secretary
in
every
dimple
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Never
again
!
<EOS>
Your
money
has
changed
you
to
marble
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
hard
-
hearted
Miser
.
<EOS>
You
are
worse
than
Dancer
,
worse
than
Hopkins
,
worse
than
Blackberry
Jones
,
worse
than
any
of
the
wretches
.
<EOS>
And
more
!
"
 
<EOS>
proceeded
Bella
,
breaking
into
tears
again
<EOS>
,
"
you
were
wholly
undeserving
of
the
Gentleman
you
have
lost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
,
Miss
Bella
,
"
the
Golden
Dustman
slowly
remonstrated
,
"
that
you
set
up
Rokesmith
against
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
!
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
worth
a
Million
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Very
pretty
she
looked
,
though
very
angry
,
as
she
made
herself
as
tall
as
she
possibly
could
<EOS>
(
which
was
not
extremely
tall
)
,
and
utterly
renounced
her
patron
with
a
lofty
toss
of
her
rich
brown
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
he
thought
well
of
me
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
though
he
swept
the
street
for
bread
,
than
that
you
did
,
though
you
splashed
the
mud
upon
him
from
the
wheels
of
a
chariot
of
pure
gold
.
<EOS>
---
There
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
I
'm
sure
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
,
staring
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
for
a
long
time
past
,
when
you
have
thought
you
set
yourself
above
him
,
I
have
only
seen
you
under
his
feet
,
"
said
Bella
---
"
<EOS>
There
!
<EOS>
And
throughout
I
saw
in
him
the
master
,
and
I
saw
in
you
the
man
 
<EOS>
---
There
!
<EOS>
And
when
you
used
him
shamefully
,
I
took
his
part
and
loved
him
---
There
!
<EOS>
I
boast
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
After
which
strong
avowal
Bella
underwent
reaction
,
and
cried
to
any
extent
,
with
her
face
on
the
back
of
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
look
here
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
as
soon
as
he
could
find
an
opening
for
breaking
the
silence
and
striking
in
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Give
me
your
attention
,
Bella
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
angry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
!
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
resumed
the
Golden
Dustman
,
"
I
am
not
angry
,
and
I
mean
kindly
to
you
,
and
I
want
to
overlook
this
.
<EOS>
So
you
'll
stay
where
you
are
,
and
we
'll
agree
to
say
no
more
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
ca
n't
stay
here
,
"
cried
Bella
,
rising
hurriedly
again
;
"
I
ca
n't
think
of
staying
here
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
home
for
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
be
silly
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
reasoned
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
do
what
you
ca
n't
undo
;
do
n't
do
what
you
're
sure
to
be
sorry
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
never
be
sorry
for
it
,
"
said
Bella
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
should
always
be
sorry
,
and
should
every
minute
of
my
life
despise
myself
,
if
I
remained
here
after
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
Bella
,
"
argued
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
let
there
be
no
mistake
about
it
.
<EOS>
Look
before
you
leap
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
Stay
where
you
are
,
and
all
's
well
,
and
all
's
as
it
was
to
be
.
<EOS>
Go
away
,
and
you
can
never
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
I
can
never
come
back
,
and
that
's
what
I
mean
,
"
 
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
expect
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
pursued
,
"
that
I
'm
a
-
going
to
settle
money
on
you
,
if
you
leave
us
like
this
,
because
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
No
,
Bella
!
<EOS>
Be
careful
!
<EOS>
Not
one
brass
farthing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Expect
!
"
<EOS>
said
Bella
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
that
any
power
on
earth
could
make
me
take
it
,
if
you
did
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
Mrs.
Boffin
to
part
from
,
and
,
in
the
full
flush
of
her
dignity
,
the
impressible
little
soul
collapsed
again
.
<EOS>
Down
upon
her
knees
before
that
good
woman
,
she
rocked
herself
upon
her
breast
,
and
cried
,
and
sobbed
,
and
folded
her
in
her
arms
with
all
her
might
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
dear
,
a
dear
,
the
best
of
dears
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
the
best
of
human
creatures
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
be
thankful
enough
to
you
,
and
can
never
forget
you
.
<EOS>
If
I
should
live
to
be
blind
and
deaf
,
I
know
I
shall
see
and
hear
you
,
in
my
fancy
,
to
the
last
of
my
dim
old
days
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
wept
most
heartily
,
and
embraced
her
with
all
fondness
;
 
but
said
not
one
single
word
except
that
she
was
her
dear
girl
.
<EOS>
She
said
that
often
enough
,
to
be
sure
,
for
she
said
it
over
and
over
again
;
but
not
one
word
else
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
broke
from
her
at
length
,
and
was
going
weeping
out
of
the
room
,
when
in
her
own
little
queer
<EOS>
affectionate
way
,
she
half
relented
towards
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
,
"
sobbed
Bella
,
"
that
I
called
you
names
,
sir
,
because
you
richly
deserved
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
very
sorry
that
I
called
you
names
,
because
you
used
to
be
so
different
.
<EOS>
Say
good
-
bye
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
shortly
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
knew
which
of
your
hands
was
the
least
spoilt
,
I
would
ask
you
to
let
me
touch
it
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
But
not
because
I
repent
of
what
I
have
said
to
you
.
<EOS>
For
I
do
n't
.
<EOS>
It
's
true
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Try
the
left
hand
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
holding
it
out
in
a
stolid
manner
;
"
it
's
the
least
used
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
wonderfully
good
and
kind
to
me
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
and
I
kiss
it
for
that
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
as
bad
as
bad
<EOS>
could
be
to
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
and
I
throw
it
away
for
that
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
for
myself
,
and
good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
as
before
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
caught
him
round
the
neck
and
kissed
him
,
and
ran
out
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
She
ran
up
-
stairs
,
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
her
own
room
,
and
cried
abundantly
.
<EOS>
But
the
day
was
declining
and
she
had
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
She
opened
all
the
places
where
she
kept
her
dresses
;
 
selected
only
those
she
had
brought
with
her
,
leaving
all
the
rest
;
 
and
made
a
great
misshapen
bundle
of
them
,
to
be
sent
for
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
take
one
of
the
others
,
"
said
Bella
,
tying
the
knots
of
the
bundle
very
tight
,
in
the
severity
of
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
leave
all
the
presents
behind
,
and
begin
again
entirely
on
my
own
account
.
"
 
That
the
resolution
might
be
thoroughly
carried
into
practice
,
she
even
changed
the
dress
she
wore
,
for
that
in
which
she
had
come
to
the
grand
mansion
.
<EOS>
Even
the
bonnet
she
put
on
,
was
the
bonnet
that
had
mounted
into
the
Boffin
chariot
at
Holloway
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
am
complete
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
little
trying
,
but
I
have
steeped
my
eyes
in
cold
water
,
and
I
wo
n't
ery
any
more
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
a
pleasant
room
to
me
,
dear
room
.
<EOS>
Adieu
!
<EOS>
We
shall
never
see
each
other
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
parting
kiss
of
her
fingers
to
it
,
she
softly
closed
the
door
,
and
went
with
a
light
foot
down
the
great
staircase
,
pausing
and
listening
as
she
went
,
that
she
might
meet
none
of
the
household
.
<EOS>
No
one
chanced
to
be
about
,
and
she
got
down
to
the
hall
in
quiet
.
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
late
Secretary
's
room
stood
open
.
<EOS>
She
peeped
in
as
she
passed
,
and
divined
from
the
emptiness
of
his
table
,
and
the
general
appearance
of
things
,
that
he
was
already
gone
.
<EOS>
Softly
opening
the
great
hall
door
,
and
softly
closing
it
upon
herself
,
she
turned
and
kissed
it
on
the
outside
---
insensible
old
combination
of
wood
and
iron
that
it
was
!
<EOS>
---
before
she
ran
away
from
the
house
at
a
swift
pace
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
well
done
!
"
<EOS>
panted
Bella
,
slackening
in
the
next
street
,
and
subsiding
into
a
walk
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
left
myself
any
breath
to
cry
with
,
I
should
have
cried
again
.
<EOS>
Now
poor
dear
darling
little
Pa
,
you
are
going
to
see
your
lovely
woman
unexpectedly
.
"
   
<EOS>
THE
FEAST
OF
THE
THREE
HOBGOBLINS
.
 
<EOS>
The
city
looked
unpromising
enough
,
as
Bella
made
her
way
along
its
gritty
streets
.
<EOS>
Most
of
its
money
-
mills
were
slackening
sail
,
or
had
left
off
grinding
for
the
day
.
<EOS>
The
master
-
millers
had
already
departed
,
and
the
journeymen
were
departing
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
jaded
aspect
on
the
business
lanes
and
courts
,
and
the
very
pavements
had
a
weary
appearance
,
confused
by
the
tread
of
a
million
of
feet
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
hours
of
night
to
temper
down
the
day
's
distraction
of
so
feverish
a
place
.
<EOS>
As
yet
the
worry
of
the
newly
-
stopped
whirling
and
grinding
on
the
part
of
the
money
-
mills
seemed
to
linger
in
the
air
,
and
the
quiet
was
more
like
the
prostration
of
a
spent
giant
than
the
repose
of
one
who
was
renewing
his
strength
.
  
<EOS>
If
Bella
thought
,
as
she
glanced
at
the
mighty
Bank
,
how
agreeable
it
would
be
to
have
an
hour
's
gardening
there
,
with
a
bright
copper
shovel
,
<EOS>
among
the
money
,
still
she
was
not
in
an
avaricious
vein
.
<EOS>
Much
improved
in
that
respect
,
and
with
certain
half
-
formed
images
which
had
little
gold
in
their
composition
,
dancing
before
her
bright
eyes
,
she
arrived
in
the
drug
-
flavoured
region
of
Mincing
Lane
,
with
;
the
sensation
of
having
just
opened
a
drawer
in
a
chemist
's
shop
.
  
<EOS>
The
counting
-
house
of
Chicksey
,
Veneering
,
and
Stobbles
was
pointed
out
by
an
elderly
female
accustomed
to
the
care
of
offices
,
who
dropped
upon
Bella
out
of
a
public
-
house
,
wiping
her
mouth
,
and
accounted
for
its
humidity
on
natural
principles
well
known
to
the
physical
sciences
,
by
explaining
that
she
had
looked
in
at
the
door
to
see
what
o'clock
it
was
.
<EOS>
The
counting
-
house
was
a
walleyed
ground
floor
by
a
dark
gateway
,
and
Bella
was
considering
,
as
she
approached
it
,
could
there
be
any
precedent
in
the
City
for
her
going
in
and
asking
for
R.
Wilfer
,
when
whom
should
she
see
,
sitting
at
one
of
the
windows
with
the
plate
-
glass
sash
raised
,
but
R.
Wilfer
himself
,
preparing
to
take
a
slight
refection
!
  
<EOS>
On
approaching
nearer
,
Bella
discerned
that
the
refection
had
the
appearance
of
a
small
cottage
-
loaf
and
a
pennyworth
of
milk
.
<EOS>
Simultaneously
with
this
discovery
on
her
part
,
her
father
discovered
her
,
and
invoked
the
echoes
of
Mincing
Lane
to
exclaim
"
My
gracious
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
came
cherubically
flying
out
without
a
hat
,
and
embraced
her
,
and
handed
her
in
.
<EOS>
"
For
it
's
after
hours
<EOS>
and
I
am
all
alone
,
my
dear
,
"
he
explained
,
"
and
am
having
---
as
I
sometimes
do
when
they
are
all
gone
---
a
quiet
tea
.
"
  
<EOS>
Looking
round
the
office
,
as
if
her
father
were
a
captive
and
this
his
cell
,
Bella
hugged
him
and
choked
him
to
her
heart
's
content
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
so
surprised
,
my
dear
!
"
said
her
father
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
believe
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
life
,
I
thought
they
had
taken
to
lying
!
<EOS>
The
idea
of
your
coming
down
the
Lane
yourself
!
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
send
the
footman
down
the
Lane
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
no
footman
with
me
,
<EOS>
Pa.
"
  
"
Oh
indeed
!
<EOS>
But
you
have
brought
the
elegant
turn
-
out
,
my
love
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
Pa.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
never
can
have
walked
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
,
<EOS>
Pa.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
so
very
much
astonished
,
that
Bella
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
break
it
to
him
just
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
consequence
is
.
<EOS>
Pa
,
that
your
lovely
woman
feels
a
little
faint
,
and
would
very
much
like
to
share
your
tea
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
cottage
loaf
and
the
pennyworth
of
milk
had
been
set
forth
on
a
sheet
of
paper
on
the
window
-
seat
.
<EOS>
The
cherubic
pocket
-
knife
,
with
the
first
bit
of
the
loaf
still
on
its
point
,
lay
beside
them
where
it
had
been
hastily
thrown
down
.
<EOS>
Bella
took
the
bit
off
,
and
put
it
in
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
"
said
her
father
,
"
the
idea
of
your
partaking
of
such
lowly
fare
!
<EOS>
But
at
least
you
must
have
your
own
loaf
and
your
own
penn'orth
.
<EOS>
One
moment
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
The
Dairy
is
just
over
the
way
and
round
the
corner
.
"
  
<EOS>
Regardless
of
Bella
's
dissuasions
he
ran
out
,
and
quickly
returned
with
the
new
supply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
spread
it
on
another
piece
of
paper
before
her
,
"
the
idea
of
a
splendid
---
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
looked
at
her
figure
,
and
stopped
short
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
,
Pa
?
"
  
"
---
of
a
splendid
female
,
"
he
resumed
more
slowly
,
"
putting
up
with
such
accommodation
as
the
present
!
<EOS>
---
Is
that
a
new
dress
you
have
on
,
my
dear
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
Pa
,
an
old
one
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
thought
I
remembered
it
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
,
for
you
bought
it
,
<EOS>
Pa.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
thought
I
bought
it
my
dear
!
"
said
the
cherub
,
giving
himself
a
little
shake
,
as
if
to
rouse
his
faculties
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
have
you
grown
so
fickle
that
you
do
n't
like
your
own
taste
,
Pa
<EOS>
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
love
,
"
he
returned
,
swallowing
a
bit
of
the
cottage
loaf
with
considerable
effort
,
<EOS>
for
it
seemed
to
stick
by
the
way
<EOS>
:
"
I
should
have
thought
it
was
hardly
sufficiently
splendid
for
existing
circumstances
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
moving
coaxingly
to
his
side
instead
of
remaining
opposite
,
"
you
sometimes
have
a
quiet
tea
here
all
alone
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
in
the
tea
's
way
,
if
I
draw
my
arm
over
your
shoulder
like
this
,
Pa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
and
no
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Yes
to
the
first
question
,
and
Certainly
Not
to
the
second
.
<EOS>
Respecting
the
quiet
tea
,
my
dear
,
why
you
see
the
occupations
of
the
day
are
sometimes
a
little
wearing
;
and
if
there
's
nothing
interposed
between
the
day
and
your
mother
,
why
she
is
sometimes
a
little
wearing
,
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
,
<EOS>
Pa.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
So
sometimes
I
put
a
quiet
tea
at
the
window
here
,
with
a
little
quiet
contemplation
of
the
Lane
(
which
comes
soothing
)
,
between
the
day
,
and
domestic
---
"
  
"
Bliss
,
"
suggested
Bella
,
sorrowfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
domestic
Bliss
,
"
said
her
father
,
quite
contented
to
accept
the
phrase
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
kissed
him
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
is
in
this
dark
dingy
place
of
captivity
,
poor
dear
,
that
you
pass
all
the
hours
of
your
life
when
you
are
not
at
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
home
,
or
not
on
the
road
there
,
or
on
the
road
here
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
You
see
that
little
desk
in
the
corner
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
the
dark
corner
,
furthest
both
from
the
light
and
from
the
fireplace
?
<EOS>
The
shabbiest
desk
of
all
the
desks
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
does
it
really
strike
you
in
that
point
of
view
,
my
dear
?
"
 
<EOS>
said
her
father
,
surveying
it
artistically
with
his
head
on
one
side
:
"
that
's
mine
.
<EOS>
That
's
called
Rumty
's
Perch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Whose
Perch
?
"
asked
Bella
with
great
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rumty
's
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
being
rather
high
and
up
two
steps
<EOS>
they
call
it
a
Perch
.
<EOS>
And
they
call
me
Rumty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
they
!
"
exclaimed
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
're
playful
,
Bella
my
dear
;
they
're
playful
.
<EOS>
They
're
more
or
less
younger
than
I
am
,
and
they
're
playful
.
<EOS>
What
does
it
matter
?
<EOS>
It
might
be
Surly
,
or
Sulky
,
or
fifty
disagreeable
things
that
I
really
should
n't
like
to
be
considered
.
<EOS>
But
Rumty
!
<EOS>
Lor
,
why
not
Rumty
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
inflict
a
heavy
disappointment
on
this
sweet
nature
,
which
had
been
,
through
all
her
caprices
,
the
object
of
her
recognition
,
love
,
and
admiration
from
infancy
,
Bella
felt
to
be
the
hardest
task
of
her
hard
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
done
better
,
"
she
thought
,
"
to
tell
him
at
first
;
I
should
have
done
better
to
tell
him
just
now
,
when
he
had
some
slight
misgiving
;
he
is
quite
happy
again
,
and
I
shall
make
him
wretched
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
falling
back
on
his
loaf
and
milk
,
with
the
pleasantest
composure
,
and
Bella
stealing
her
arm
a
little
closer
about
him
,
and
at
the
same
time
sticking
up
his
hair
with
an
irresistible
propensity
to
play
with
him
founded
on
the
habit
of
her
whole
life
,
had
prepared
herself
to
say
:
"
Pa
dear
,
do
n't
be
cast
down
,
but
I
must
tell
you
something
disagreeable
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
he
interrupted
her
in
an
unlookedfor
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
gracious
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
invoking
the
Mincing
Lane
echoes
as
before
.
"
<EOS>
This
is
very
extraordinary
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
,
Pa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
here
's
Mr.
Rokesmith
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Pa
,
no
,
"
cried
Bella
,
greatly
flurried
.
"
<EOS>
Surely
not
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
there
is
!
<EOS>
Look
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
Sooth
to
say
,
Mr.
Rokesmith
not
only
passed
the
window
,
but
came
into
the
counting
-
house
.
<EOS>
And
not
only
came
into
the
counting
-
house
,
but
,
finding
himself
alone
there
with
Bella
and
her
father
,
rushed
at
Bella
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
,
with
the
rapturous
words
"
My
dear
,
dear
girl
;
my
gallant
,
generous
,
disinterested
,
courageous
,
noble
girl
!
"
<EOS>
And
not
only
that
even
,
(
which
one
might
have
thought
astonishment
enough
for
one
dose
)
,
but
Bella
,
after
hanging
her
head
for
a
moment
,
lifted
it
up
and
laid
it
on
his
breast
,
as
if
that
were
her
head
's
chosen
and
lasting
restingplace
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
would
come
to
him
,
and
I
followed
you
,
"
said
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
my
life
!
<EOS>
You
   
ARE
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
To
which
Bella
responded
,
"
Yes
,
I
   
AM
yours
if
you
think
me
worth
taking
!
"
<EOS>
And
after
that
,
seemed
to
shrink
to
next
to
nothing
in
the
clasp
of
his
arms
,
partly
because
it
was
such
a
strong
one
on
his
part
,
and
partly
because
there
was
such
a
yielding
to
it
on
hers
.
  
<EOS>
The
cherub
,
whose
hair
would
have
done
for
itself
,
under
the
influence
of
this
amazing
spectacle
,
what
Bella
had
just
now
done
for
it
,
staggered
back
into
the
window
-
seat
from
which
he
had
risen
,
and
surveyed
the
pair
with
his
eyes
dilated
to
their
utmost
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
think
of
dear
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
;
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
told
dear
Pa
;
let
us
speak
to
<EOS>
Pa.
"
<EOS>
Upon
which
they
turned
to
do
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
first
,
my
dear
,
"
remarked
the
cherub
faintly
,
"
that
you
'd
have
the
kindness
to
sprinkle
me
with
a
little
milk
,
for
I
feel
as
if
I
was
---
Going
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
good
little
fellow
had
become
alarmingly
limp
,
and
his
senses
seemed
to
be
rapidly
escaping
,
from
the
knees
upward
.
<EOS>
Bella
sprinkled
him
with
kisses
instead
of
milk
,
but
gave
him
a
little
of
that
article
to
drink
;
and
he
gradually
revived
under
her
caressing
care
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
break
it
to
you
gently
,
dearest
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
returned
the
cherub
,
looking
at
them
both
,
"
you
broke
so
much
in
the
first
---
Gush
,
if
I
may
so
express
myself
---
that
I
think
I
am
equal
to
a
good
large
breakage
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wilfer
,
"
said
John
Rokesmith
,
excitedly
and
joyfully
,
"
Bella
takes
me
,
though
I
have
no
fortune
,
even
no
present
occupation
;
 
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
I
can
get
in
the
life
before
us
.
<EOS>
Bella
takes
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
should
rather
have
inferred
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
returned
the
cherub
feebly
,
"
that
Bella
took
you
,
from
what
I
have
within
these
few
minutes
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
,
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
how
ill
I
have
used
him
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
said
Rokesmith
,
"
what
a
heart
she
has
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
,
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
what
a
shocking
creature
I
was
growing
,
when
he
saved
me
from
myself
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
"
said
Rokesmith
,
"
what
a
sacrifice
she
has
made
for
me
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Bella
,
"
replied
the
cherub
,
still
pathetically
scared
,
"
and
my
dear
John
Rokesmith
,
if
you
will
allow
me
so
to
call
you
---
"
  
"
Yes
,
do
,
Pa
,
do
!
"
urged
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
I
allow
you
,
and
my
will
is
his
law
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
---
dear
John
Rokesmith
?
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
engaging
shyness
in
Bella
,
coupled
with
an
engaging
tenderness
of
love
and
confidence
and
pride
,
in
thus
first
calling
him
by
name
,
which
made
it
quite
excusable
in
John
Rokesmith
to
do
what
he
did
.
<EOS>
What
he
did
was
,
once
more
to
give
her
the
appearance
of
vanishing
as
aforesaid
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
my
dears
,
"
observed
the
cherub
,
"
that
if
you
could
make
it
convenient
to
sit
one
on
one
side
of
me
,
and
the
other
on
the
other
,
we
should
get
on
rather
more
consecutively
,
and
make
things
rather
plainer
.
<EOS>
John
Rokesmith
mentioned
,
a
while
ago
,
that
he
had
no
present
occupation
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
,
"
said
Rokesmith
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Pa
,
none
,
"
said
Bella
,
  
"
From
which
I
argue
,
"
proceeded
the
cherub
,
"
that
he
has
left
Mr.
Boffin
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
<EOS>
Pa.
And
so
---
"
  
"
Stop
a
bit
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
lead
up
to
it
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
And
that
Mr.
Boffin
has
not
treated
him
well
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Has
treated
him
most
shamefully
,
dear
Pa
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
with
a
flashing
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
which
,
"
pursued
the
cherub
,
enjoining
patience
with
his
hand
,
"
a
certain
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
,
could
not
approve
?
<EOS>
Am
I
leading
up
to
it
right
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Could
not
approve
,
sweet
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
with
a
tearful
laugh
and
a
joyful
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
which
,
"
pursued
the
cherub
,
"
the
certain
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
,
having
previously
observed
and
mentioned
to
myself
that
prosperity
was
spoiling
Mr.
Boffin
,
felt
that
she
must
not
sell
her
sense
of
what
was
right
and
what
was
wrong
,
and
what
was
true
and
what
was
false
,
and
what
was
just
and
what
was
unjust
,
for
any
price
that
could
be
paid
to
her
by
any
one
alive
?
<EOS>
Am
I
leading
up
to
it
right
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
another
tearful
laugh
Bella
joyfully
kissed
him
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
therefore
---
and
therefore
,
"
the
cherub
went
on
in
a
glowing
voice
,
as
Bella
's
hand
stole
gradually
up
his
waistcoat
to
his
neck
,
"
this
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
,
refused
the
price
,
took
off
the
splendid
fashions
that
were
part
of
it
,
put
on
the
comparatively
poor
dress
that
I
had
last
given
her
,
and
trusting
to
my
supporting
her
in
what
was
right
,
came
straight
to
me
.
<EOS>
Have
I
led
up
to
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
's
hand
was
round
his
neck
by
this
time
,
and
her
face
was
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
,
"
said
her
good
father
,
"
did
well
!
<EOS>
The
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
,
did
not
trust
to
me
in
vain
!
<EOS>
I
admire
this
mercenary
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
,
more
in
this
dress
than
if
she
had
come
to
me
in
China
silks
,
Cashmere
shawls
,
and
Golconda
diamonds
.
<EOS>
I
love
this
young
person
dearly
.
<EOS>
I
say
to
the
man
of
this
young
person
's
heart
,
out
of
my
heart
and
with
all
of
it
,
`
`
My
blessing
on
this
engagement
betwixt
you
,
and
she
brings
you
a
good
fortune
when
she
brings
you
the
poverty
she
has
accepted
for
your
sake
and
the
honest
truth
's
!
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
The
stanch
little
man
's
voice
failed
him
as
he
gave
John
Rokesmith
his
hand
,
and
he
was
silent
,
bending
his
face
low
over
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
,
not
for
long
.
<EOS>
He
soon
looked
up
,
saying
in
a
sprightly
tone
:
  
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
child
,
if
you
think
you
can
entertain
John
Rokesmith
for
a
minute
and
a
half
,
I
'll
run
over
to
the
Dairy
,
and
fetch
him
a
cottage
loaf
and
a
drink
of
milk
,
that
we
may
all
have
tea
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
,
as
Bella
gaily
said
,
like
the
supper
provided
for
the
three
nursery
hobgoblins
at
their
house
in
the
forest
,
without
their
thunderous
low
growlings
of
the
alarming
discovery
,
"
Somebody
's
been
drinking
my
milk
!
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
delicious
repast
;
by
far
the
most
delicious
that
Bella
,
or
John
Bokesmith
,
or
even
R.
Wilfer
had
ever
made
.
<EOS>
The
uncongenial
oddity
of
its
surroundings
,
with
the
two
brass
knobs
of
the
iron
safe
of
Chicksey
,
Veneering
,
and
Stobbles
staring
from
a
corner
,
like
the
eyes
of
some
dull
dragon
,
only
made
it
the
more
delightful
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
think
,
"
said
the
cherub
,
looking
round
the
office
with
unspeakable
enjoyment
,
"
that
anything
of
a
tender
nature
should
come
off
here
,
is
what
tickles
me
.
<EOS>
To
think
that
ever
I
should
have
seen
my
Bella
folded
in
the
arms
of
her
future
husband
,
here
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
the
cottage
loaves
and
the
milk
had
for
some
time
disappeared
,
and
the
foreshadowings
of
night
were
creeping
over
Mincing
Lane
,
that
the
cherub
by
degrees
became
a
little
nervous
,
and
said
to
Bella
,
as
he
cleared
his
throat
:
  
"
Hem
!
---
<EOS>
Have
you
thought
at
all
about
your
mother
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
<EOS>
Pa.
"
  
"
And
your
sister
Lavvy
,
for
instance
,
my
dear
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Pa.
I
think
we
had
better
not
enter
into
particulars
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
will
be
quite
enough
to
say
that
I
had
a
difference
with
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
have
left
for
good
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
John
Rokesmith
being
acquainted
with
your
Ma
,
my
love
,
"
said
her
father
,
after
some
slight
hesitation
,
"
I
need
have
no
delicacy
in
hinting
before
him
that
you
may
perhaps
find
your
Ma
a
little
wearing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
little
,
patient
Pa
?
"
said
Bella
with
a
tuneful
laugh
:
<EOS>
the
tunefuller
for
being
so
loving
in
its
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
We
'll
say
,
strictly
in
confidence
among
ourselves
,
wearing
;
we
wo
n't
qualify
it
,
"
the
cherub
stoutly
admitted
.
"
<EOS>
And
your
sister
's
temper
is
wearing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
,
<EOS>
Pa.
"
  
"
And
you
must
prepare
yourself
,
you
know
,
my
precious
,
"
said
her
father
,
with
much
gentleness
,
"
for
our
looking
very
poor
and
meagre
at
home
,
and
being
at
the
best
but
very
uncomfortable
,
after
Mr.
Boffin
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
,
Pa.
<EOS>
I
could
bear
much
harder
trials
---
for
John
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
closing
words
were
not
so
softly
and
blushingly
said
but
that
John
heard
them
,
and
showed
that
he
heard
them
by
again
assisting
Bella
to
another
of
those
mysterious
disappearances
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
cherub
gaily
,
and
not
expressing
disapproval
,
"
when
you
---
when
you
come
back
from
retirement
,
my
love
,
and
reappear
on
the
surface
,
I
think
it
will
be
time
to
lock
up
and
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
the
counting
-
house
of
Chicksey
,
Veneering
,
and
Stobbles
had
ever
been
shut
up
by
three
happier
people
,
glad
as
most
people
were
to
shut
it
up
,
they
must
have
been
superlatively
happy
indeed
.
<EOS>
But
first
Bella
mounted
upon
Rumty
's
Perch
,
and
said
,
"
Show
me
what
you
do
here
all
day
long
,
<EOS>
dear
Pa.
Do
you
write
like
this
?
"
<EOS>
laying
her
round
cheek
upon
her
plump
left
arm
,
and
losing
sight
of
her
pen
in
waves
of
hair
,
in
a
highly
unbusiness
-
like
manner
.
<EOS>
Though
John
Rokesmith
seemed
to
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
three
hobgoblins
,
having
effaced
all
traces
of
their
feast
,
and
swept
up
the
crumbs
,
came
out
of
Mincing
Lane
to
walk
to
Holloway
;
 
and
if
two
of
the
hobgoblins
did
n't
wish
the
distance
twice
as
long
as
it
was
,
the
third
hobgoblin
was
much
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
that
modest
spirit
deemed
himself
so
much
in
the
way
of
their
deep
enjoyment
of
the
journey
,
that
he
apologetically
remarked
:
"
I
think
,
my
dears
,
I
'll
take
the
lead
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
,
and
seem
not
to
belong
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Which
he
did
,
cherubically
strewing
the
path
with
smiles
,
in
the
absence
of
flowers
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
almost
ten
o'clock
when
they
stopped
within
view
of
Wilfer
Castle
;
and
then
,
the
spot
being
quiet
and
deserted
,
Bella
began
a
series
of
disappearances
which
threatened
to
last
all
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
John
,
"
the
cherub
hinted
at
last
,
"
that
if
you
can
spare
me
the
young
person
distantly
related
to
myself
,
I
'll
take
her
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
spare
her
,
"
answered
John
,
"
but
I
must
lend
her
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
---
My
Darling
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
word
of
magic
which
caused
Bella
instantly
to
disappear
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
dearest
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
when
she
became
visible
,
"
put
your
hand
in
mine
,
and
we
'll
run
home
as
fast
as
ever
we
can
run
,
and
get
it
over
.
<EOS>
Now
,
<EOS>
Pa.
Once
!
<EOS>
---
"
  
"
My
dear
,
"
the
cherub
faltered
,
with
something
of
a
craven
air
,
"
I
was
going
to
observe
that
if
your
mother
---
"
  
"
You
musn't
hang
back
,
sir
,
to
gain
time
,
"
cried
Bella
,
putting
out
her
right
foot
;
"
do
you
see
that
,
sir
?
<EOS>
That
's
the
mark
;
come
up
to
the
mark
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Once
!
<EOS>
Twice
!
<EOS>
Three
times
and
away
,
Pa
!
"
 
<EOS>
Off
she
skimmed
,
bearing
the
cherub
along
,
nor
ever
stopped
,
nor
suffered
him
to
stop
,
until
she
had
pulled
at
the
bell
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
dear
Pa
,
"
said
Bella
,
taking
him
by
both
ears
as
if
he
were
a
pitcher
,
and
conveying
his
face
to
her
rosy
lips
,
"
we
are
in
for
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Lavvy
came
out
to
open
the
gate
,
waited
on
by
that
attentive
cavalier
and
friend
of
the
family
,
Mr.
George
Sampson
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
never
Bella
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Miss
Lavvy
starting
back
at
the
sight
.
<EOS>
And
then
bawled
,
"
Ma
!
<EOS>
Here
's
Bella
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
produced
,
before
they
could
get
into
the
house
,
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
Who
,
standing
in
the
portal
,
received
them
with
ghostly
gloom
,
and
all
her
other
appliances
of
ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
child
is
welcome
,
though
unlooked
for
,
"
said
she
,
at
the
time
presenting
her
cheek
as
if
it
were
a
cool
slate
for
visitors
to
enrol
themselves
upon
.
<EOS>
"
You
too
,
R.
W.
,
are
welcome
,
though
late
.
<EOS>
Does
the
male
domestic
of
Mrs.
Boffin
hear
me
there
?
"
<EOS>
This
deeptoned
inquiry
was
cast
forth
into
the
night
,
for
response
from
the
menial
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
one
waiting
,
Ma
,
dear
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
one
waiting
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Mrs.
Wilfer
in
majestic
accents
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Ma
,
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
dignified
shiver
pervaded
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
shoulders
and
gloves
,
as
who
should
say
,
"
An
Enigma
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
marched
at
the
head
of
the
procession
to
the
family
keeping
-
room
,
where
she
observed
:
  
"
Unless
,
R.
W.
:
"
who
started
on
being
solemnly
turned
upon
:
"
you
have
taken
the
precaution
of
making
some
addition
to
our
frugal
supper
on
your
way
home
,
it
will
prove
but
a
distasteful
one
to
Bella
.
<EOS>
Cold
neck
of
mutton
and
a
lettuce
can
ill
compete
with
the
luxuries
of
Mr.
Boffin
's
board
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pray
do
n't
talk
like
that
,
Ma
dear
,
"
said
Bella
;
"
Mr.
Boffin
's
board
is
nothing
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
here
Miss
Lavinia
,
who
had
been
intently
eyeing
Bella
's
bonnet
,
struck
in
with
"
Why
,
Bella
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Lavvy
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Irrepressible
lowered
her
eyes
to
Bella
's
dress
,
and
stooped
to
look
at
it
,
exclaiming
again
:
"
Why
,
Bella
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Lavvy
,
I
know
what
I
have
got
on
.
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
tell
Ma
when
you
interrupted
.
<EOS>
I
have
left
Mr.
Boffin
's
house
for
good
,
Ma
,
and
<EOS>
I
have
come
home
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
spake
no
word
,
but
,
having
glared
at
her
offspring
for
a
minute
or
two
in
an
awful
silence
,
retired
into
her
corner
of
state
backward
,
and
sat
down
:
like
a
frozen
article
on
sale
in
a
Russian
market
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
dear
Ma
,
"
said
Bella
,
taking
off
the
depreciated
bonnet
and
shaking
out
her
hair
,
"
I
have
had
a
very
serious
difference
with
Mr.
Boffin
on
the
subject
of
his
treatment
of
a
member
of
his
household
,
and
it
's
a
final
difference
,
and
there
's
an
end
of
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
bound
to
tell
you
,
my
dear
,
"
added
R.
W.
,
submissively
,
"
that
Bella
has
acted
in
a
truly
brave
spirit
,
and
with
a
truly
right
feeling
.
<EOS>
And
therefore
I
hope
,
my
dear
,
you
'll
not
allow
yourself
to
be
greatly
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
George
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Lavvy
,
in
a
sepulchral
,
warning
voice
,
founded
on
her
mother
's
;
"
George
Sampson
,
speak
!
<EOS>
What
did
I
tell
you
about
those
Boffins
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sampson
perceiving
his
frail
bark
to
be
labouring
among
shoals
and
breakers
,
thought
it
safest
not
to
refer
back
to
any
particular
thing
that
he
had
been
told
,
lest
he
should
refer
back
to
the
wrong
thing
.
<EOS>
With
admirable
seamanship
he
got
his
bark
into
deep
water
by
murmuring
"
Yes
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
I
told
George
Sampson
,
as
George
Sampson
tells
you
,
"
said
Miss
Lavvy
,
"
that
those
hateful
Boffins
would
pick
a
quarrel
with
Bella
,
as
soon
as
her
novelty
had
worn
off
.
<EOS>
Have
they
done
it
,
or
have
they
not
?
<EOS>
Was
I
right
,
or
was
I
wrong
?
<EOS>
And
what
do
you
say
to
us
,
Bella
,
of
your
Boffins
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Lavvy
and
Ma
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
I
say
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
what
I
always
have
said
;
and
I
always
shall
say
of
them
what
I
always
have
said
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
will
induce
me
to
quarrel
with
any
one
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
not
sorry
to
see
me
,
Ma
dear
,
"
kissing
her
;
 
"
and
I
hope
you
are
not
sorry
to
see
me
,
Lavvy
,
"
kissing
her
too
;
 
"
and
as
I
notice
the
lettuce
Ma
mentioned
,
on
the
table
,
I
'll
make
the
salad
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
playfully
setting
herself
about
the
task
,
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
impressive
countenance
followed
her
with
glaring
eyes
,
presenting
a
combination
of
the
once
popular
sign
of
the
Saracen
's
Head
,
with
a
piece
of
Dutch
clock
-
work
,
and
suggesting
to
an
imaginative
mind
that
from
the
composition
of
the
salad
,
her
daughter
might
prudently
omit
the
vinegar
.
<EOS>
But
no
word
issued
from
the
majestic
matron
's
lips
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
more
terrific
to
her
husband
(
as
perhaps
she
knew
)
than
any
flow
of
eloquence
with
which
she
could
have
edified
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Ma
dear
,
"
said
Bella
in
due
course
,
"
the
salad
's
ready
,
and
it
's
past
supper
-
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
rose
,
but
remained
speechless
.
"
<EOS>
George
!
<EOS>
"
said
Miss
Lavinia
in
her
voice
of
warning
,
"
Ma
's
chair
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Sampson
flew
to
the
excellent
lady
's
back
,
and
followed
her
up
close
,
chair
in
hand
,
as
she
stalked
to
the
banquet
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
table
,
she
took
her
rigid
seat
,
after
favouring
Mr.
Sampson
with
a
glare
for
himself
,
which
caused
the
young
gentleman
to
retire
to
his
place
in
much
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
The
cherub
not
presuming
to
address
so
tremendous
<EOS>
an
object
,
transacted
her
supper
through
the
agency
of
a
third
person
,
as
"
Mutton
to
your
Ma
,
Bella
,
my
dear
;
"
and
"
Lavvy
,
I
dare
say
your
Ma
would
take
some
lettuce
if
you
were
to
put
it
on
her
plate
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
manner
of
receiving
those
viands
was
marked
by
petrified
absence
of
mind
;
in
which
state
,
likewise
,
she
partook
of
them
,
occasionally
laying
down
her
knife
and
fork
,
as
saying
within
her
own
spirit
,
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
I
am
doing
?
"
and
glaring
at
one
or
other
of
the
party
,
as
if
in
indignant
search
of
information
.
<EOS>
A
magnetic
result
of
such
glaring
was
,
that
the
person
glared
at
could
not
by
any
means
successfully
pretend
to
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
:
so
that
a
bystander
,
without
beholding
Mrs.
Wilfer
at
all
,
must
have
known
at
whom
she
was
glaring
,
by
seeing
her
refracted
from
the
countenance
of
the
beglared
one
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
was
extremely
affable
to
Mr.
Sampson
on
this
special
occasion
,
and
took
the
opportunity
of
informing
her
sister
why
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
worth
troubling
you
about
,
Bella
,
when
you
were
in
a
sphere
so
far
removed
from
your
family
as
to
make
it
a
matter
in
which
you
could
be
expected
to
take
very
little
interest
,
"
said
Lavinia
with
a
toss
of
her
chin
;
"
but
George
Sampson
is
paying
his
addresses
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
was
glad
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Sampson
became
thoughtfully
red
,
and
felt
called
upon
to
encircle
Miss
Lavinia
's
waist
with
his
arm
;
 
but
,
encountering
a
large
pin
in
the
young
lady
's
belt
,
scarified
a
finger
,
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
,
and
attracted
the
lightning
of
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
glare
.
  
<EOS>
"
George
is
getting
on
very
well
,
"
said
Miss
Lavinia
---
which
might
not
have
been
supposed
at
the
moment
---
"
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
we
shall
be
married
,
<EOS>
one
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
care
to
mention
it
when
you
were
with
your
Bof
---
"
here
Miss
Lavinia
checked
herself
in
a
bounce
,
and
added
more
placidly
,
"
when
you
were
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
;
 
but
now
I
think
it
sisterly
to
name
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Lavvy
dear

<EOS>
I
congratulate
you

<EOS>

Thank
you

Bella

<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
George
and
I
did
discuss
whether
I
should
tell
you
;
but
I
said
to
George
that
you
would
n't
be
much
interested
in
so
paltry
an
affair
,
and
that
it
was
far
more
likely
you
would
rather
detach
yourself
from
us
altogether
,
than
have
him
added
to
the
rest
of
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
a
mistake
,
dear
Lavvy
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
turns
out
to
be
,
"
replied
Miss
Lavinia
;
"
but
circumstances
have
changed
,
you
know
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
George
is
in
a
new
situation
,
and
his
prospects
are
very
good
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
had
the
courage
to
tell
you
so
yesterday
,
when
you
would
have
thought
his
prospects
poor
,
and
not
worth
notice
;
but
I
feel
quite
bold
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
you
begin
to
feel
timid
,
Lavvy
?
"
inquired
Bella
,
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
say
that
I
ever
felt
timid
,
Bella
,
"
replied
the
Irrepressible
.
"
<EOS>
But
perhaps
I
might
have
said
,
if
I
had
not
been
restrained
by
delicacy
towards
a
sister
's
feelings
,
that
I
have
for
some
time
felt
independent
;
too
independent
,
my
dear
,
to
subject
myself
to
have
my
intended
match
(
you
'll
prick
yourself
again
,
George
)
looked
down
upon
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
could
have
blamed
you
for
looking
down
upon
it
,
when
you
were
looking
up
to
a
rich
and
great
match
,
Bella
;
it
is
only
that
I
was
independent
.
"
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
Irrepressible
felt
slighted
by
Bella
's
declaration
that
she
would
not
quarrel
,
or
whether
her
spitefulness
was
evoked
by
Bella
's
return
to
the
sphere
of
Mr.
George
Sampson
's
courtship
,
or
whether
it
was
a
necessary
fillip
to
her
spirits
that
she
should
come
into
collision
with
somebody
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
---
anyhow
she
made
a
dash
at
her
stately
parent
now
,
with
the
greatest
impetuosity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ma
,
pray
do
n't
sit
staring
at
me
in
that
intensely
aggravating
manner

<EOS>
If
you
see
a
black

my
nose

tell
me
so

leave

A

who
is
old
enough
to
be
engaged

is
quite
old
enough
to
object
to
be
stared
at
as
if

was
a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Audacious
one

Mrs.

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
grandmamma

if
so
addressed
by
one

My

Lavvy

folding

it

<EOS>
A
pretty
exhibition
my

have
made
of
herself

I
wonder
whether
she
ever
insisted
on
people

retiring

the
ball
of
St.

I

returned
Lavinia
coolly

quite
the
contrary

I

<EOS>
Lavinia
's
engineering
having
made
this
crooked
opening
at
Bella

Mrs.

strode
into
it

with

the
unmoved
Irrepressible

presumptuous

All
I

you

clung

<EOS>
Lavinia
was
about
replying
to
her
honored
parent
that
she
might
as
well
have
dispensed
with
her
looks
altogether
then
,
when
Bella
rose
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Good
night

dear
Ma

I
have
had
a
tiring
day

I
'll
go

<EOS>
This
broke
up
the
agreeable
party
.
<EOS>
Mr.
George
Sampson
shortly
afterwards
took
his
leave
,
accompanied
by
Miss
Lavinia
with
a
candle
as
far
as
the
hall
,
and
without
a
candle
as
far
as
the
garden
gate
;
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
washing
her
hands
of
the
Boffins
,
went
to
bed
after
the
manner
of
Lady
Macbeth
;
and
R.
W.
was
left
alone
among
the
dilapidations
of
the
supper
table
,
in
a
melancholy
attitude
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
a
light
footstep
roused
him
from
his
meditations
,
and
it
was
Bella
's
.
<EOS>
Her
pretty
hair
was
hanging
all
about
her
,
and
she
had
tripped
down
softly
,
brush
in
hand
,
and
barefoot
,
to
say
goodnight
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
you
most
unquestionably
are
a
lovely
woman

"
said
the
cherub
,
taking
up
a
tress
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
;
"
when
your
lovely
woman
marries
,
you
shall
have
that
piece
if
you
like
,
and
she
'll
make
you
a
chain
of
it
.
<EOS>
Would
you
prize
that
remembrance
of
the
dear
creature
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
precious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
shall
have
it
if
you
're
good

<EOS>
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
,
dearest
Pa

to
have
brought
home
all
this
trouble

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
pet
,
"
returned
her
father
,
in
the
simplest
good
faith
,
"
do
n't
make
yourself
uneasy
about
that
.
<EOS>
It
really
is
not
worth
mentioning
,
because
things
at
home
would
have
taken
pretty
much
the
same
turn
any
way
.
<EOS>
If
your
mother
and
sister
do
n't
find
one
subject
to
get
at
times
a
little
wearing
on
,
they
find
another
.
<EOS>
We
're
never
out
of
a
wearing
subject
,
my
dear
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
you
find
your
old
room
with
Lavvy
,
dreadfully
inconvenient
,
Bella
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
I
do
n't
,
Pa

I
do
n't
mind

<EOS>
Why
do
n't
I
mind
,
do
you
think
,
Pa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
child
,
you
used
to
complain
of
it
when
it
was
n't
such
a
contrast
as
it
must
be
now
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
I
can
only
answer

because
you
are
so
much
improved

<EOS>
"
No

<EOS>
Pa.
Because
I
am
so
thankful

so
happy

<EOS>
Here
she
choked
him
until
her
long
hair
made
him
sneeze
,
and
then
she
laughed
until
she
made
him
laugh
,
and
then
she
choked
him
again
that
they
might
not
be
overheard
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
lovely
woman
was
told
her
fortune
to
night
on
her
way
home
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
be
a
large
fortune
,
because
if
the
lovely
woman
's
Intended
gets
a
certain
appointment
that
he
hopes
to
get
soon
,
she
will
marry
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
.
<EOS>
But
that
's
at
first
,
and
even
if
it
should
never
be
more
,
the
lovely
woman
will
make
it
quite
enough
.
<EOS>
But
that
's
not
all

In
the
fortune
there
's
a
certain
fair
man

a
little
man

the
fortune

teller
said

who

it
seems

will
always
find
himself
near
the
lovely
woman

and
will
always
have
kept
,
expressly
for
him
,
such
a
peaceful
corner
in
the
lovely
woman
's
little
house
as
never
was
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
name
of
that
man
,
sir
.

<EOS>
"
Is
he
a
Knave
in
the
pack
of
cards

inquired
the
cherub
,
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes

<EOS>
cried
Bella
,
in
high
glee
,
choking
him
again
.
<EOS>
"

He

the
Knave

Dear

the
lovely
woman

What
the
little
fair
man
is
expected
to
do

is
to

saying

putting

her
small
white

A
SOCIAL
CHORUS

<EOS>
Amazement
sits
enthroned
upon
the
countenances
of
Mr.

Mrs.
Alfred
Lammle

circle
of
acquaintance

when
the
disposal
of
their
first

class
furniture

effects
(
including
a
Billiard
Table
in
capital
letters
)
,
"

But

nobody

half
so
much
amazed
as
Hamilton
Veneering

Esquire

M.P.
for
Pocket
Breaches

who
instantly
begins
to
find
out
that
the
Lammles

the
only
people
ever
entered
on
his
soul

who

Mrs.

like
a
faithful

shares
her
husband

discovery
and
inexpressible
astonishment

<EOS>
Perhaps
the
Veneerings
twain
may
deem
the
last
unutterable
feeling
particularly
due
to
their
reputation
,
by
reason
that
once
upon
a
time
some
of
the
longer
heads
in
the
City
are
whispered
to
have
shaken
themselves
,
when
Veneering
's
extensive
dealings
and
great
wealth
were
mentioned
.
<EOS>
But
,
it
is
certain
that
neither
Mr.
nor
Mrs.
Veneering
can
find
words
to
wonder
in
,
and
it
becomes
necessary
that
they
give
to
the
oldest
and
dearest
friends
they
have
in
the
world
,
a
wondering
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
it
is
by
this
time
<EOS>
noticeable
that
,
whatever
befals
,
the
Veneerings
must
give
a
dinner
upon
it

<EOS>
Lady
Tippins
lives
in
a
chronic
state
of
invitation
to
dine
with
the
Veneerings
,
and
in
a
chronic
state
of
inflammation
arising
from
the
dinners
.
<EOS>
Boots

Brewer
go
about
in
cabs
,
with
no
other
intelligible
business
on
earth
than
to
beat
up
people

come

dine
with

Veneerings

<EOS>
Veneering
pervades
the
legislative
lobbies

intent
upon
entrapping
his
fellow

to
dinner

Mrs.

dined
with
five

twenty
bran

new

over
night

calls

sends
them
every
one
a
dinner
-
card
to

morrow
,
for
the
week
after
next
;
before
that
dinner
is
digested
,
calls
upon
their
brothers
and
sisters
,
their
sons
and
daughters
,
their
nephews
and
nieces
,
their
aunts
and
uncles
and
cousins
,
and
invites
them
all
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
And
still
,
as
at
first
,
howsoever
,
the
dining
circle
widens
,
it
is
to
be
observed
that
all
the
diners
are
consistent
in
appearing
to
go
to
the
Veneerings
,
not
to
dine
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Veneering
(
which
would
seem
to
be
the
last
thing
in
their
minds
)
,
but
to
dine
with
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
after
all
,
---
who
knows
?
<EOS>
---
Veneering
may
find
this
dining
,
though
expensive
,
remunerative
,
in
the
sense
that
it
makes
champions
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Podsnap
,
as
a
representative
man
,
is
not
alone
in
caring
very
particularly
for
his
own
dignity
,
if
not
for
that
of
his
acquaintances
,
and
therefore
in
angrily
supporting
the
acquaintances
who
have
taken
out
his
Permit
,
lest
,
in
their
being
lessened
,
he
should
be
.
<EOS>
The
gold
and
silver
camels
,
and
the
ice
-
pails
,
and
the
rest
of
the
Veneering
table
decorations
,
make
a
brilliant
show
,
and
when
I
,
Podsnap
,
casually
remark
elsewhere
<EOS>
that
I
dined
last
Monday
with
a
gorgeous
caravan
of
camels
<EOS>
,
I
find
it
personally
offensive
to
have
it
hinted
to
me
that
they
are
broken
-
kneed
camels
,
or
camels
labouring
under
suspicion
of
any
sort
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
display
camels
myself
,
I
am
above
them
;
 
I
am
a
more
solid
man
;
but
these
camels
have
basked
in
the
light
of
my
countenance
,
and
how
dare
you
,
sir
,
insinuate
to
me
that
I
have
irradiated
any
but
unimpeachable
camels
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
camels
are
polishing
up
in
the
Analytical
's
pantry
for
the
dinner
of
wonderment
on
the
occasion
of
the
Lammles
going
to
pieces
,
and
Mr.
Twemlow
feels
a
little
queer
on
the
sofa
at
his
lodgings
over
the
stable
yard
in
Duke
Street
,
Saint
James
's
,
in
consequence
of
having
taken
two
advertised
pills
at
about
mid
-
day
,
on
the
faith
of
the
printed
representation
accompanying
the
box
(
price
one
and
a
penny
halfpenny
,
government
stamp
included
)
,
that
the
same
"
will
be
found
highly
salutary
as
a
precautionary
measure
in
connection
with
the
pleasures
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
To
whom
,
while
sickly
with
the
fancy
of
an
insoluble
pill
sticking
in
his
gullet
,
and
also
with
the
sensation
of
a
deposit
of
warm
gum
languidly
wandering
within
him
a
little
lower
down
,
a
servant
enters
with
the
announcement
that
a
lady
wishes
to
speak
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
lady
!
<EOS>
"
says
Twemlow
,
pluming
his
ruffled
feathers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ask
the
favour
of
the
lady
's
name
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
lady
's
name
is
Lammle
.
<EOS>
The
lady
will
not
detain
Mr.
Twemlow
longer
than
a
very
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
The
lady
is
sure
that
Mr.
Twemlow
will
do
her
the
kindness
to
see
her
,
on
being
told
that
she
particularly
desires
a
short
interview
.
<EOS>
The
lady
has
no
doubt
whatever
of
Mr.
Twemlow
's
compliance
when
he
hears
her
name
.
<EOS>
Has
begged
the
servant
to
be
particular
not
to
mistake
her
name
.
<EOS>
Would
have
sent
in
a
card
,
but
has
none
.
  
<EOS>
"
Show
the
lady
in

"
<EOS>
Lady
shown
in

comes
in

<EOS>
Mr.
Twemlow
's
little
rooms
are
modestly
furnished
,
in
an
oldfashioned
manner
(
rather
like
the
housekeeper
's
room
at
Snigsworthy
Park
)
,
and
would
be
bare
of
mere
ornament
,
were
it
not
for
a
full
-
length
engraving
of
the
sublime
Snigsworth
over
the
chimneypiece
,
snorting
at
a
Corinthian
column
,
with
an
enormous
roll
of
paper
at
his
feet
,
and
a
heavy
curtain
going
to
tumble
down
on
his
head
;
those
accessories
being
understood
to
represent
the
noble
lord
as
somehow
in
the
act
of
saving
his
country
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
take
a
seat
,
Mrs.
Lammle
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
takes
a
seat
and
opens
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
,
Mr.
Twemlow
,
that
you
have
heard
of
a
reverse
of
fortune
having
befallen
us
.
<EOS>
Of
course
you
have
heard
of
it
,
for
no
kind
of
news
travels
so
fast
---
among
one
's
friends
especially
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mindful
of
the
wondering
dinner
,
Twemlow
,
with
a
little
twinge
,
admits
the
imputation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Probably
it
will
not
,
"
says
Mrs.
Lammle
,
with
a
certain
hardened
manner
upon
her
,
that
makes
Twemlow
shrink
,
"
have
surprised
you
so
much
as
some
others
,
after
what
passed
between
us
at
the
house
which
is
now
turned
out
at
windows
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
the
liberty
of
calling
upon
you
,
Mr.
Twemlow
,
to
add
a
sort
of
postscript
to
what
I
said
that
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Twemlow
's
dry
and
hollow
cheeks
become
more
dry
and
hollow
at
the
prospect
of
some
new
complication
.
  
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
says
the
uneasy
little
gentleman
,
"
really
,
Mrs.
Lammle
,
I
should
take
it
as
a
favour
if
you
could
excuse
me
from
any
further
confidence
.
<EOS>
It
has
ever
been
one
of
the
objects
of
my
life
---
which
,
unfortunately
,
has
not
had
many
objects
---
to
be
inoffensive
,
and
to
keep
out
of
cabals
and
interferences
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
,
by
far
the
more
observant
of
the
two
,
scarcely
finds
it
necessary
to
look
at
Twemlow
while
he
speaks
,
so
easily
does
she
read
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
postscript

to
retain
the
term
I
have
used

---
says
Mrs.
Lammle
,
fixing
her
eyes
on
his
face
,
to
enforce
what
she
says
herself
---
  
"
coincides
exactly
with
what
you
say
,
Mr.
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
So
far
from
troubling
you
with
any
new
confidence
,
I
merely
wish
to
remind
you
what
the
old
one
was
.
<EOS>
So
far
from
asking
you
for
interference
,
I
merely
wish
to
claim
your
strict
neutrality
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Twemlow
going
on
to
reply
,
she
rests
her
eyes
again
,
knowing
her
ears
to
be
quite
enough
for
the
contents
of
so
weak
a
vessel
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
I
suppose
,
"
says
Twemlow
,
nervously
,
"
offer
no
reasonable
objection
to
hearing
anything
that
you
do
me
the
honor
to
wish
to
say
to
me
under
those
heads
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
may
,
with
all
possible
delicacy
and
politeness
,
entreat
you
not
to
range
beyond
them
,
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
---
I
beg
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
says
Mrs.
Lammle
,
raising
her
eyes
to
his
face
again
,
and
quite
daunting
him
with
her
hardened
manner
,
"
I
imparted
to
you
a
certain
piece
of
knowledge
,
to
be
imparted
again
,
as
you
thought
best
,
to
a
certain
person
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Which
I
did
,
"
says
Twemlow
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
for
doing
which
,
I
thank
you
;
though
,
indeed
,
I
scarcely
know
why
I
turned
traitress
to
my
husband
in
the
matter
,
for
the
girl
is
a
poor
little
fool

<EOS>
I
was
a
poor
little
fool
once
myself
;
I
can
find
no
better
reason
.
<EOS>
"
Seeing
the
effect
she
produces
on
him
by
her
indifferent
laugh
and
cold
look
,
she
keeps
her
eyes
upon
him
as
she
proceeds
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Twemlow
,
if
you
should
chance
to
see
my
husband
,
or
to
see
me
,
or
to
see
both
of
us
,
in
the
favour
or
confidence
of
any
one
else
---
whether
of
our
common
acquaintance
or
not
,
is
of
no
consequence
---
you
have
no
right
to
use
against
us
the
knowledge
I
intrusted
you
with
,
for
one
special
purpose
which
has
been
accomplished
.
<EOS>
This
is
what
I
came
to
say
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
stipulation
;
to
a
gentleman
it
is
simply
a
reminder
.
"
  
<EOS>
Twemlow
sits
murmuring
to
himself
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
so
plain
a
case
,
"
Mrs.
Lammle
goes
on
,
"
as
between
me
(
from
the
first
relying
on
your
honor
)
and
you
,
that
I
will
not
waste
another
word
upon
it
.
"
<EOS>
She
looks
steadily
at
Mr.
Twemlow
,
until
,
with
a
shrug
,
he
makes
her
a
little
one
-
sided
bow
,
as
though
saying
"
Yes
,
I
think
you
have
a
right
to
rely
upon
me
,
"
and
then
she
moistens
her
lips
,
and
shows
a
sense
of
relief
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
I
have
kept
the
promise
I
made
through
your
servant
,
that
I
would
detain
you
a
very
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
I
need
trouble
<EOS>
you
no
longer
,
Mr.
Twemlow

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay

says
Twemlow
,
rising
as
she
rises
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pardon
me
a
moment

<EOS>
I
should
never
have
sought
you
out
,
madam

to
say
what
I
am
going
to
say
,
but
since
you
have
sought
me
out
and
are
here
,
I
will
throw
it
off
my
mind

<EOS>
Was
it
quite
consistent
,
in
candour
,
with
our
taking
that
resolution
against
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
that
you
should
afterwards
address
Mr.
Fledgeby
as
your
dear
and
confidential
friend
,
and
entreat
a
favour
of
Mr.
Fledgeby
?
<EOS>
Always
supposing
that
you
did
;
I
assert
no
knowledge
of
my
own
on
the
subject

it
has
been
represented
to
me
that
you
did

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
he
told
you
?
"
<EOS>
retorts
Mrs.
Lammle
,
who
again
has
saved
her
eyes
while
listening
,
and
uses
them
with
strong
effect
while
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
strange
that
he
should
have
told
you
the
truth
,
"
says
Mrs.
Lammle
,
seriously
pondering
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pray
where
did
a
circumstance
so
very
extraordinary
happen
?
"
  
<EOS>
Twemlow
hesitates
.
<EOS>
He
is
shorter
than
the
lady
as
well
as
weaker
,
and
,
as
she
stands
above
him
with
her
hardened
manner
and
her
well
-
used
eyes
,
he
finds
himself
at
such
a
disadvantage
that
he
would
like
to
be
of
the
opposite
sex
.
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
where
it
happened
,
Mr.
Twemlow
?
<EOS>
In
strict
confidence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
confess
,
"
says
the
mild
little
gentleman
,
coming
to
his
answer
by
degrees
,
"
that
I
felt
some
compunctions
when
Mr.
Fledgeby
mentioned
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
admit
that
I
could
not
regard
myself
in
an
agreeable
light
.
<EOS>
More
particularly
,
as
Mr.
Fledgeby
did
,
with
great
civility
,
which
I
could
not
feel
that
I
deserved
from
him
,
render
me
the
same
service
that
you
had
entreated
him
to
render
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
part
of
the
true
nobility
of
the
poor
gentleman
's
soul
to
say
this
last
sentence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Otherwise
,
"
he
has
reflected
,
"
I
shall
assume
the
superior
position
of
having
no
difficulties
of
my
own

I
know
of
hers

Which
would
be

very

Was
Mr.

Mrs.

demands

<EOS>
"
As
ineffectual

I
beg
your
pardon

fixing

Let

tell
you
that

The
information

be
of
use

to
prevent
your
credulity

judging
another

Impossible

standing
aghast

I
scarcely

fire

show
it

Mrs.

coldly

boldly

with
some
disdain

"
how
like

Twemlow
ventures
gently
to
argue

Consider

Men

very
wise
in
their

quoth
Mrs.
Lammle
,
glancing
haughtily
at
the
Snigsworth
portrait
,
and
shaking
out
her
dress
before
departing
;
"
but
they
have
wisdom
to
learn
.
<EOS>
My
husband
,
who
is
not
over
-
confiding
,
ingenuous
,
or
inexperienced
,
sees
this
plain
thing
no
more
than
Mr.
Twemlow
does
---
because
there
is
no
proof
!
<EOS>
Yet
I
believe
five
women
out
of
six
,
in
my
place
,
would
see
it
as
clearly
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
never
rest
(
if
only
remembrance
of
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
having
kissed
my
hand
)
until
my
husband
does
see
it
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
do
well
for
yourself
to
see
it
from
this

forth

Mr.

though
I
can
give
you
no

<EOS>
As
she
moves
towards
the
door
,
Mr.
Twemlow
,
attending
on
her
,
expresses
his
soothing
hope
that
the
condition
of
Mr.

's
affairs
is
not
irretrievable
.
  
<EOS>
"
I

Mrs.

answers
,
stopping
,
and
sketching
out
the
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the

with
the
point
of

If

we

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.

,
in
his
good
-
natured
desire
to
make
the
best
of
it
,
remarks
that
there
are
pleasant

abroad

<EOS>
"
Yes
,

returns
Mrs.
Lammle
,
still
sketching
on
the
wall
;
"
but
I
doubt
whether
billiard

playing

card

playing

and
so
forth

for
the
means

under
suspicion
at
a
dirty

one

<EOS>
It
is
much
for
Mr.
Lammle
<EOS>
,
Twemlow
politely
intimates
(
though
greatly
shocked
)
,
to
have
one
always
beside
him
who
is
attached
to
him
in
all
his
fortunes
,
and
whose
restraining
influence
will
prevent
him
from
courses
that
would
be
discreditable
and
ruinous
.
<EOS>
As
he
says
it
,
Mrs.
Lammle
leaves
off
sketching
,
and
looks
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Restraining
influence
,
Mr.
Twemlow
?
<EOS>
We
must
eat
and
drink
,
and
dress
,
and
have
a
roof
over

heads

<EOS>
Always
beside
him
and
attached
in

his

<EOS>
Not
much
to
boast
of
in
that

what
can
a

at
my
age
do
?
<EOS>
My

I
deceived
one
another
<EOS>
when
we
married

we
must
bear
the
consequences
of
the
deception
 
---
that
is
to
say
,
bear
one
another
,
and
bear
the
burden
of
scheming
together

dinner

<EOS>
With
those
words
,
she
walks
out
into
Duke
Street
,
Saint
James
's
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Twemlow
returning
to
his
sofa
,
lays
down
his
aching
head
on
its
slippery
little
horsehair
bolster
,
with
a
strong
internal
conviction
that
a
painful
interview
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
to
be
taken
after
the
dinner
pills
which
are
so
highly
salutary
in
connexion
with
the
pleasures
of
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
finds
the
worthy
little
gentleman
getting
better
,
and
also
getting
himself
into
his
obsolete
little
silk
stockings
and
pumps
,
for
the
wondering
dinner
at
the
Veneerings
.
<EOS>
And
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
finds
him
trotting
out
into
Duke
Street
,
to
trot
to
the
corner
and
save
a
sixpence
in
coach
-
hire
.
  
<EOS>
Tippins
the
divine
has
dined
herself
into
such
a
condition
by
this
time
,
that
a
morbid
mind
might
desire
her
,
for
a
blessed
change
,
to
sup
at
last
,
and
turn
into
bed
.
<EOS>
Such
a
mind
has
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
whom
Twemlow
finds
contemplating
Tippins
with
the
moodiest
of
visages
,
while
that
playful
creature
rallies
him
on
being
so
long
overdue
at
the
woolsack
.
<EOS>
Skittish
is
Tippins
with
Mortimer
Lightwood
too
,
and
has
raps
to
give
him
with
her
fan
for
having
been
best
man
at
the
nuptials
of
these
deceiving
what's
-
their
-
names
who
have
gone
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
Though
,
indeed
,
the
fan
is
generally
lively
,
and
taps
away
at
the
men
in
all
directions
,
with
something
of
a
grisly
sound
suggestive
of
the
clattering
of
Lady
Tippins
's
bones
.
  
<EOS>
A
new
race
of
intimate
friends
has
sprung
up
at
Veneering
's
since
he
went
into
Parliament
for
the
public
good
,
to
whom
Mrs.
Veneering
is
very
attentive
.
<EOS>
These
friends
,
like
astronomical
distances
,
are
only
to
be
spoken
of
in
the
very
largest
figures
.
<EOS>
Boots
says
that
one
of
them
is
a
Contractor
who
(
it
has
been
calculated
)
gives
employment
,
directly
and
indirectly
,
to
five
hundred
thousand
men
.
<EOS>
Brewer
says
that
another
of
them
is
a
Chairman
,
in
such
request
at
so
many
Boards
,
so
far
apart
,
that
he
never
travels
less
by
railway
than
three
thousand
miles
a
week
.
<EOS>
Buffer
says
that
another
of
them
had
n't
a
sixpence
eighteen
months
ago
,
and
,
through
the
brilliancy
of
his
genius
in
getting
those
shares
issued
at
eighty
-
five
,
and
buying
them
all
up
with
no
money
and
selling
them
at
par
for
cash
,
has
now
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
thousand
pounds
---
<EOS>
Buffer
particularly
insisting
on
the
odd
seventy
-
five
,
and
declining
to
take
a
farthing
less
.
<EOS>
With
Buffer
,
Boots
,
and
Brewer
,
Lady
Tippins
is
eminently
facetious
on
the
subject
of
these
Fathers
of
the
Scrip
-
Church
:
surveying
them
through
her
eyeglass
,
and
inquiring
whether
Boots
and
Brewer
and
Buffer
think
they
will
make
her
fortune
if
she
makes
love
to
them
?
<EOS>
with
other
pleasantries
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
Veenering
,
in
his
different
way
,
is
much
occupied
with
the
Fathers
too
,
piously
retiring
with
them
into
the
conservatory
,
from
which
retreat
the
word
"
Committee
"
is
occasionally
heard
,
and
where
the
Fathers
instruct
Veneering
how
he
must
leave
the
valley
of
the
piano
on
his
left
,
take
the
level
of
the
mantelpiece
,
cross
by
an
open
cutting
at
the
candelabra
,
seize
the
carrying
-
traffic
at
the
console
,
and
cut
up
the
opposition
root
and
branch
at
the
window
curtains
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Podsnap
are
of
the
company
,
and
the
Fathers
descry
in
Mrs.
Podsnap
a
fine
woman
.
<EOS>
She
is
consigned
to
a
Father
---
  
<EOS>
Boot
's
Father
,
who
employs
five
hundred
thousand
men
---
and
is
brought
to
anchor
on
Veneering
's
left
;
thus
affording
opportunity
to
the
sportive
Tippins
on
his
right
(
he
,
as
usual
,
being
mere
vacant
space
)
,
to
entreat
to
be
told
something
about
those
loves
of
Navvies
,
and
whether
they
really
do
live
on
raw
beefsteaks
,
and
drink
porter
out
of
their
barrows
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
spite
of
such
little
skirmishes
it
is
felt
that
this
was
to
be
a
wondering
dinner
,
and
that
the
wondering
must
not
be
neglected
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
Brewer
,
as
the
man
who
has
the
greatest
reputation
to
sustain
,
becomes
the
interpreter
of
the
general
instinct
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
,
"
says
Brewer
in
a
favourable
pause
,
"
a
cab
this
morning
,
and
I
rattled
off
to
that
Sale
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Boots
(
devoured
by
envy
)
says
,
"
So
did
<EOS>
I.
"
  
Buffer
says
,
"
So
did
I
;
"
but
can
find
nobody
to
care
whether
he
did
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
was
it
like
?
"
<EOS>
inquires
Veneering
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
"
replies
Brewer
,
looking
about
for
anybody
else
to
address
his
answer
to
,
and
giving
the
preference
to
Lightwood
;
"
I
assure
you
,
the
things
were
going
for
a
song
.
<EOS>
Handsome
things
enough
,
but
fetching
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
heard
this
afternoon
,
"
says
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
Brewer
begs
to
know
now
<EOS>
,
would
it
be
fair
to
ask
a
professional
man
how
---
on
---
earth
---
<EOS>
these
---
people
---
ever
---
did
---
come
---
to
---
such
 
---
a
---
total
smash
?
"
<EOS>
(
Brewer
's
divisions
being
for
emphasis
.
)
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
replies
that
he
was
consulted
certainly
,
but
could
give
no
opinion
which
would
pay
off
the
Bill
of
Sale
,
and
therefore
violates
no
confidence
in
supposing
that
it
came
of
their
living
beyond
their
means
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
how
,
"
says
Veneering
,
"
  
CAN
people
do
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
Hah
!
<EOS>
That
is
felt
on
all
hands
to
be
a
shot
in
the
bull
's
eye
.
<EOS>
How
   
CAN
people
do
that
!
<EOS>
The
Analytical
Chemist
going
round
with
champagne
,
looks
very
much
as
if
he
could
give
them
a
pretty
good
idea
how
people
did
that
,
if
he
had
a
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
,
"
says
Mrs.
Veneering
,
laying
down
her
fork
to
press
her
aquiline
hands
together
at
the
tips
of
the
fingers
,
and
addressing
the
Father
who
travels
the
three
thousand
miles
per
week
:
"
how
a
mother
can
look
at
her
baby
,
and
know
that
she
lives
beyond
her
husband
's
means
,
I
can
not
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Eugene
suggests
that
Mrs.
Lammle
,
not
being
a
mother
,
had
no
baby
to
look
at
.
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
says
Mrs.
Veneering
,
"
but
the
principle
is
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Boots
is
clear
that
the
principle
is
the
same
.
<EOS>
So
is
Buffer
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
unfortunate
destiny
of
Buffer
to
damage
a
cause
by
espousing
it
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
company
have
meekly
yielded
to
the
proposition
that
the
principle
is
the
same
,
until
Buffer
says
it
is
;
when
instantly
a
general
murmur
arises
that
the
principle
is
not
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
understand
,
"
says
the
Father
of
the
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
five
thousand
pounds
,
"
---
if
these
people
spoken
of
,
occupied
the
position
of
being
in
society
---
they
were
in
society
?
"
  
<EOS>
Veneering
is
bound
to
confess
that
they
dined
here
,
and
were
even
married
from
here
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
do
n't
understand
,
"
pursues
the
Father
,
"
how
even
their
living
beyond
their
means
could
bring
them
to
what
has
been
termed
a
total
smash
.
<EOS>
Because
,
there
is
always
such
a
thing
as
an
adjustment
of
affairs
,
in
the
case
of
people
of
any
standing
at
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
Eugene
(
who
would
seem
to
be
in
a
gloomy
state
of
suggestiveness
)
,
suggests
,
"
Suppose
you
have
no
means
and
live
beyond
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
is
too
insolvent
a
state
of
things
for
the
Father
to
entertain
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
insolvent
a
state
of
things
for
any
one
with
any
self
-
respect
to
entertain
,
and
is
universally
scouted
.
<EOS>
But
,
it
is
so
amazing
how
any
people
can
have
come
to
a
total
smash
,
that
everybody
feels
bound
to
account
for
it
specially
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
Fathers
says
,
"
Gaming
table
.
"
 
<EOS>
Another
of
the
Fathers
says
,
"
Speculated
without
knowing
that
speculation
is
a

"
<EOS>
Boots
says
"
Horses

"
<EOS>
Lady
Tippins
says
to
her
fan
,
"
Two
establishments
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Podsnap
,
saying
nothing
,
is
referred
to
for
his
opinion
;
which
he
delivers
as
follows
;
much
flushed
and
extremely
angry
:
  
"
Do
n't
ask
me
.
<EOS>
I
desire
to
take
no
part
in
the
discussion
of
these
people
's
affairs
.
<EOS>
I
abhor
the
subject
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
odious
subject
,
an
offensive
subject
,
a
subject
that
makes
me
sick
,
and
I
---
"
And
with
his
favourite
right
-
arm
flourish
which
sweeps
away
everything
and
settles
it
for
ever
,
Mr.
Podsnap
sweeps
these
inconveniently
unexplainable
wretches
who
have
lived
beyond
their
means
and
gone
to
total
smash
,
off
the
face
of
the
universe
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
is
observing
Mr.
Podsnap
with
an
irreverent
face
,
and
may
be
about
to
offer
a
new
suggestion
,
when
the
Analytical
is
beheld
in
collision
with
the
Coachman
;
the
Coachman
manifesting
a
purpose
of
coming
at
the
company
with
a
silver
salver
,
as
though
intent
upon
making
a
collection
for
his
wife
and
family
;
the
Analytical
cutting
him
off
at
the
sideboard
.
<EOS>
The
superior
stateliness
,
if
not
the
superior
generalship
,
of
the
Analytical
prevails
over
a
man
who
is
as
nothing
off
the
box
;
and
the
Coachman
,
yielding
up
his
salver
,
retires
defeated
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
the
Analytical
,
perusing
a
scrap
of
paper
lying
on
the
salver
,
with
the
air
of
a
literary
Censor
,
adjusts
it
,
takes
his
time
about
going
to
the
table
with
it
,
and
presents
it
to
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
pleasant
Tippins
says
aloud
,
"
The
Lord
Chancellor
has
resigned
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
distracting
coolness
and
slowness
---
for
he
knows
the
curiosity
of
the
Charmer
to
be
always
devouring
---
Eugene
makes
a
pretence
of
getting
out
an
eyeglass
,
polishing
it
,
and
reading
the
paper
with
difficulty
,
long
after
he
has
seen
what
is
written
on
it
.
<EOS>
What
is
written
on
it
in
wet
ink
,
is
:
  
"
Young
Blight

"
  
<EOS>
"
Waiting

"
says
Eugene
over
his
shoulder
,
in
confidence
,
with
the
Analytical
.
  
<EOS>
"
Waiting

"
returns
the
Analytical
in
responsive
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
looks
"
<EOS>
Excuse

towards
Mrs.
Veneering
,
goes
out
,
and
finds
Young
Blight
,
Mortimer

clerk
,
at
the
hall

<EOS>
"
You

says
that
discreet

standing
on
tiptoe
to
whisper

I

Sharp

Where
is
he

"
asks
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
in
a
cab
,
sir
,
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
best
not
to
show
him
,
you
see
,
if
it
could
be
helped
;
for
he
's
a

like

<EOS>
Blight
's
simile
is
perhaps
inspired
by
the
surrounding
dishes
of
sweets
---
"
like
Glue
Monge

<EOS>
"
  
"
Sharp
boy
again
,
"
returns
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Goes
out
straightway
,
and
,
leisurely
leaning
his
arms
on
the
open
window
of
a
cab
in
waiting
,
looks
in
at
Mr.
Dolls
:
who
has
brought
his
own
atmosphere
with
him
,
and
would
seem
from
its
odour
to
have
brought
it
,
for
convenience
of
carriage
,
in
a
rum
-
cask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
Dolls
,
wake
up
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mist
Wrayburn
?
<EOS>
Drection
!
<EOS>
Fifteen
shillings
!
"
  
<EOS>
After
carefully
reading
the
dingy
scrap
of
paper
handed
to
him
,
and
as
carefully
tucking
it
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
Eugene
tells
out
the
money
;
beginning
incautiously
by
telling
the
first
shilling
into
Mr.
Dolls
's
hand
,
which
instantly
jerks
it
out
of
window
;
and
ending
by
telling
the
fifteen
shillings
on
the
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
him
a
ride
back
to
Charing
Cross
,
sharp
boy
,
and
there
get
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Returning
to
the
dining
-
room
,
and
pausing
for
an
instant
behind
the
screen
at
the
door
,
Eugene
overhears
,
above
the
hum
and
clatter
,
<EOS>
the
fair
Tippins
saying
:
"
I
am
dying
to
ask
him
what
he
was
called
out
for
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
?
"
<EOS>
mutters
Eugene
,
"
then
perhaps
if
you
ca
n't
ask
him
,
you
'll
die
.
<EOS>
So
I
'll
be
a
benefactor
to
society
,
and
go
.
<EOS>
A
stroll
and
a
cigar
,
and
I
can
think
this
over
.
<EOS>
Think
this
over
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
,
with
a
thoughtful
face
,
he
finds
his
hat
and
cloak
,
unseen
of
the
Analytical
,
and
goes
his
way
.
     
<EOS>
A
Turning
.
 
<EOS>
SETTING
TRAPS
.
 
<EOS>
Plashwater
weir
-
Mill
Lock
looked
tranquil
and
pretty
on
an
evening
in
the
summer
time
.
<EOS>
A
soft
air
stirred
the
leaves
of
the
fresh
green
trees
,
and
passed
like
a
smooth
shadow
over
the
river
,
and
like
a
smoother
shadow
over
the
yielding
grass
.
<EOS>
The
voice
of
the
falling
water
,
like
the
voices
of
the
sea
and
the
wind
,
were
as
an
outer
memory
to
a
contemplative
listener
;
but
not
particularly
so
to
Mr.
Riderhood
,
who
sat
on
one
of
the
blunt
wooden
levers
of
his
lock
-
gates
,
dozing
.
<EOS>
Wine
must
be
got
into
a
butt
by
some
agency
before
it
can
be
drawn
out
;
and
the
wine
of
sentiment
never
having
been
got
into
Mr.
Riderhood
by
any
agency
,
nothing
in
nature
tapped
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
Rogue
sat
,
ever
and
again
nodding
himself
off
his
balance
,
his
recovery
was
always
attended
by
an
angry
stare
and
growl
,
as
if
,
in
the
absence
of
any
one
else
,
he
had
aggressive
inclinations
towards
himself
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
starts
the
cry
of
"
Lock
,
ho
!
<EOS>
Lock
!
"
<EOS>
prevented
his
relapse
into
a
doze
.
<EOS>
Shaking
himself
as
he
got
up
,
like
the
surly
brute
<EOS>
he
was
,
he
gave
his
growl
a
responsive
twist
at
the
end
,
and
turned
his
face
down
-
stream
to
see
who
hailed
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
an
amateur
-
sculler
,
well
up
to
his
work
though
taking
it
easily
,
in
so
light
a
boat
that
the
Rogue
remarked
:
"
A
little
less
on
you
,
and
you
'd
a'most
ha
'
been
a
Wagerbut
;
"
then
went
to
work
at
his
windlass
handles
and
sluices
,
to
let
the
sculler
in
.
<EOS>
As
the
latter
stood
in
his
boat
,
holding
on
by
the
boat
-
hook
to
the
woodwork
at
the
lock
side
,
waiting
for
the
gates
to
open
,
Rogue
Riderhood
recognized
his
"
T'other
governor
,
"
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
;
who
was
,
however
,
too
indifferent
or
too
much
engaged
to
recognize
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
creaking
lock
-
gates
opened
slowly
,
and
the
light
boat
passed
in
as
soon
as
there
was
room
enough
,
and
the
creaking
lock
-
gates
closed
upon
it
,
and
it
floated
low
down
in
the
dock
between
the
two
sets
of
gates
,
until
the
water
should
rise
and
the
second
gates
should
open
and
let
it
out
.
<EOS>
When
Riderhood
had
run
to
his
second
windlass
and
turned
it
,
and
while
he
leaned
against
the
lever
of
that
gate
to
help
it
to
swing
open
presently
,
he
noticed
,
lying
to
rest
under
the
green
hedge
by
the
towing
-
path
astern
of
the
Lock
,
a
Bargeman
.
  
<EOS>
The
water
rose
and
rose
as
the
sluice
poured
in
,
dispersing
the
scum
which
had
formed
behind
the
lumbering
gates
,
and
sending
the
boat
up
,
so
that
the
sculler
gradually
rose
like
an
apparition
against
the
light
from
the
bargeman
's
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
observed
that
the
bargeman
rose
too
,
leaning
on
his
arm
,
and
seemed
to
have
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
rising
figure
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
there
was
the
toll
to
be
taken
,
as
the
gates
were
now
complaining
and
opening
.
<EOS>
The
T'other
governor
tossed
it
ashore
,
twisted
in
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
as
he
did
so
,
knew
his
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
?
<EOS>
It
's
you
,
is
it
,
honest
friend
?
"
said
Eugene
,
seating
himself
preparatory
to
resuming
his
sculls
.
<EOS>
"
You
got
the
place
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
got
the
place
,
and
no
thanks
to
you
for
it
,
nor
yet
none
to
Lawyer
Lightwood
,
"
gruffly
answered
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
saved
our
recommendation
,
honest
fellow
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
for
the
next
candidate
---
the
one
who
will
offer
himself
when
you
are
trans
ported
or
hanged
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
long
about
it
;
will
you
be
so
good
?
"
  
<EOS>
So
imperturbable
was
the
air
with
which
he
gravely
bent
to
his
work
that
Riderhood
remained
staring
at
him
,
without
having
found
a
retort
,
until
he
had
rowed
past
a
line
of
wooden
objects
by
the
weir
,
which
showed
like
huge
teetotums
standing
at
rest
in
the
water
,
and
was
almost
hidden
by
the
drooping
boughs
on
the
left
bank
,
as
he
rowed
away
,
keeping
out
of
the
opposing
current
.
<EOS>
It
being
then
too
late
to
retort
with
any
effect
---
if
that
could
ever
have
been
done
 
---
the
honest
man
confined
himself
to
cursing
and
growling
in
a
grim
under
-
tone
.
<EOS>
Having
then
got
his
gates
shut
,
he
crossed
back
by
his
plank
lock
-
bridge
to
the
towing
-
path
side
of
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
in
so
doing
,
he
took
another
glance
at
the
bargeman
,
he
did
it
by
stealth
.
<EOS>
He
cast
himself
on
the
grass
by
the
Lock
side
,
in
an
indolent
way
,
with
his
back
in
that
direction
,
and
,
having
gathered
a
few
blades
,
fell
to
chewing
them
.
<EOS>
The
dip
of
Eugene
Wrayburn
's
sculls
had
become
hardly
audible
in
his
ears
when
the
bargeman
passed
him
,
putting
the
utmost
width
that
he
could
between
them
,
and
keeping
under
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
Then
,
Riderhood
sat
up
and
took
a
long
look
at
his
figure
,
and
then
cried
:
"
<EOS>
Hi
---
i
---
i
!
<EOS>
Lock
,
ho
!
<EOS>
Lock
!
<EOS>
Plashwater
Weir
-
Mill
Lock
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
bargeman
stopped
,
and
looked
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Plashwater
Weir
-
Mill
Lock
,
T'otherest
gov
---
er
---
nor
---
or
---
or
---
  
or

"
cried
Mr.
Riderhood
,
with
his
hands
to
his
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
The
bargeman
turned
back
.
<EOS>
Approaching
nearer
and
nearer
,
the
bargeman
became
Bradley
Headstone
,
in
rough
water
-
side
secondhand
clothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wish
I
may
die
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
smiting
his
right
leg
,
and
laughing
,
as
he
sat
on
the
grass
,
"
if
you
ai
n't
ha
'
been
a
imitating
me
,
T'otherest
governor
!
<EOS>
Never
thought
myself
so
good
-
looking
afore
!
"
  
<EOS>
Truly
,
Bradley
Headstone
had
taken
careful
note
of
the
honest
man
's
dress
in
the
course
of
that
night
-
walk
<EOS>
they
had
had
together
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
committed
it
to
memory
,
and
slowly
got
it
by
heart
.
<EOS>
It
was
exactly
reproduced
in
the
dress
he
now
wore
.
<EOS>
And
whereas
,
in
his
own
schoolmaster
clothes
,
he
usually
looked
as
if
they
were
the
clothes
of
some
other
man
<EOS>
,
he
now
looked
,
in
the
clothes
of
some
other
man
or
men
,
as
if
they
were
his
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
your
Lock
?
"
said
Bradley
,
whose
surprise
had
a
genuine
air
;
 
"
<EOS>
they
told
me
,
where
I
last
inquired
,
it
was
the
third
I
should
come
to
.
<EOS>
This
is
only
the
second
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
my
belief
,
governor
,
"
returned
Riderhood
,
with
a
wink
and
shake
of
his
head
,
"
that
you
've
dropped
one
in
your
counting
.
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
Locks
as
you
've
been
giving
your
mind
to
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
expressively
jerked
his
pointing
finger
in
the
direction
the
boat
had
taken
,
a
flush
of
impatience
mounted
into
Bradley
's
face
,
and
he
looked
anxiously
up
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
Locks
as
you
've
been
a
reckoning
up
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
when
the
schoolmaster
's
eyes
came
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
other
calculations
do
you
suppose
I
have
been
occupied
with
?
<EOS>
Mathematics
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heerd
it
called
that
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
long
word
for
it
.
<EOS>
Hows'ever
,
p'raps
<EOS>
you
call
it
so
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
stubbornly
chewing
his
grass
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
.
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
say
them
,
instead
of
it
,
if
you
like
,
"
was
the
coolly
growled
reply
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
safer
talk
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
that
I
should
understand
by
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Spites
,
affronts
,
offences
giv
'
and
took
,
deadly
aggrawations
,
such
like
,
"
answered
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
Do
what
Bradley
Headstone
would
,
he
could
not
keep
that
former
flush
of
impatience
out
of
his
face
,
or
so
master
his
eyes
as
to
prevent
their
again
looking
anxiously
up
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
ha
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afeerd
,
T'otherest
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
T'other
's
got
to
make
way
agin
the
stream
,
and
he
takes
it
easy
.
<EOS>
You
can
soon
come
up
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
wot
's
the
good
of
saying
that
to
you
!
<EOS>
You
know
how
fur
you
could
have
outwalked
him
betwixt
anywheres
about
where
he
lost
the
tide
---
say
Richmond
---
<EOS>
and
this
,
if
you
had
had
a
mind
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
I
have
been
following
him
?
"
said
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
have
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
have
<EOS>
,
I
have
,
"
Bradley
admitted
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
with
another
anxious
look
up
the
river
,
"
he
may
land
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Easy
you
!
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
be
lost
if
he
does
land
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
He
must
leave
his
boat
behind
him
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
make
a
bundle
or
a
parcel
on
it
,
and
carry
it
ashore
with
him
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
speaking
to
you
just
now
,
"
said
Bradley
,
kneeling
on
one
knee
on
the
grass
beside
the
Lock
-
keeper
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Cheek
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Cheek
,
"
repeated
Riderhood
,
with
an
angry
oath
;
"
cheek
is
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
say
nothing
but
cheek
.
<EOS>
I
'd
ha
'
liked
to
plump
down
aboard
of
him
,
neck
and
crop
,
with
a
heavy
jump
,
and
sunk
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
turned
away
his
haggard
face
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
said
,
tearing
up
a
tuft
of
grass
:
  
"
<EOS>
Damn
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hooroar
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Does
you
credit
!
<EOS>
Hooroar
!
<EOS>
I
cry
chorus
to
the
T'otherest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
turn
,
"
said
Bradley
,
with
an
effort
at
self
-
repression
that
forced
him
to
wipe
his
face
,
"
did
his
insolence
take
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
took
the
turn
,
"
answered
Riderhood
,
with
sullen
ferocity
,
"
of
hoping
as
I
was
getting
ready
to
be
hanged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
look
to
that
,
"
cried
Bradley
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
look
to
that
!
<EOS>
It
will
be
bad
for
him
when
men
he
has
injured
,
and
at
whom
he
has
jeered
,
are
thinking
of
getting
hanged
.
<EOS>
Let
him
get
ready
for
his
fate
,
when
that
comes
about
.
<EOS>
There
was
more
meaning
in
what
he
said
than
he
knew
of
,
or
he
would
n't
have
had
brains
enough
to
say
it
.
<EOS>
Let
him
look
to
it
;
let
him
look
to
it
!
<EOS>
When
men
he
has
wronged
,
and
on
whom
he
has
bestowed
his
insolence
,
are
getting
ready
to
be
hanged
,
there
is
a
death
-
bell
ringing
.
<EOS>
And
not
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
,
looking
fixedly
at
him
,
gradually
arose
from
his
recumbent
posture
while
the
schoolmaster
said
these
words
with
the
utmost
concentration
of
rage
and
hatred
.
<EOS>
So
,
when
the
words
were
all
spoken
,
he
too
kneeled
on
one
knee
on
the
grass
,
and
the
two
men
looked
at
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Riderhood
,
very
deliberately
spitting
out
the
grass
he
had
been
chewing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
I
make
out
,
T'otherest
,
as
he
is
a
going
to
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
left
London
,
"
answered
Bradley
,
"
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
a
doubt
,
this
time
,
that
at
last
he
is
going
to
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ai
n't
sure
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
am
as
sure
here
,
"
said
Bradley
,
with
a
clutch
at
the
breast
of
his
coarse
shirt
,
"
as
if
it
was
written
there
;
"
with
a
blow
or
a
stab
at
the
sky
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
But
judging
from
the
looks
on
you
,
"
retorted
Riderhood
,
completely
ridding
himself
of
his
grass
,
and
drawing
his
sleeve
across
his
mouth
,
"
you
've
made
ekally
sure
afore
,
and
have
got
disapinted
.
<EOS>
It
has
told
upon
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
"
said
Bradley
,
in
a
low
voice
,
bending
forward
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
Lock
-
keeper
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
These
are
my
holidays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
they
,
by
George
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Riderhood
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
passion
-
wasted
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
working
days
must
be
stiff
'
<EOS>
uns
,
if
these
is
your
holidays
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
I
have
never
left
him
,
"
pursued
Bradley
,
waving
the
interruption
aside
with
an
impatient
hand
,
"
since
they
began
.
<EOS>
And
I
never
will
leave
him
now
,
till
I
have
seen
him
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
when
you
have
seen
him
with
her
?
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
I
'll
come
back
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
stiffened
the
knee
on
which
he
had
been
resting
,
got
up
,
and
looked
gloomily
at
his
new
friend
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
they
walked
side
by
side
in
the
direction
the
boat
had
taken
,
as
if
by
tacit
consent
;
Bradley
pressing
forward
,
and
Riderhood
holding
back
:
Bradley
getting
out
his
neat
prim
purse
into
his
hand
(
a
present
made
him
by
penny
subscription
among
his
pupils
)
;
and
Riderhood
,
unfolding
his
arms
to
smear
his
coat
-
cuff
across
his
mouth
with
a
thoughtful
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
pound
for
you
,
"
said
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
two
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
Bradley
held
a
sovereign
between
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
Slouching
at
his
side
with
his
eyes
upon
the
towing
-
path
,
Riderhood
held
his
left
hand
open
,
with
a
certain
slight
drawing
action
towards
himself
.
<EOS>
Bradley
dipped
in
his
purse
for
another
sovereign
,
and
two
chinked
in
Riderhood
's
hand
,
the
drawing
action
of
which
,
promptly
strengthening
,
drew
them
home
to
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
must
follow
him
,
"
said
Bradley
Headstone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
takes
this
river
-
road
---
the
fool
!
---
to
confuse
observation
,
or
divert
attention
,
if
not
solely
to
baffle
me
.
<EOS>
But
he
must
have
the
power
of
making
himself
invisible
before
he
can
shake
Me
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
stopped
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
get
disapinted
agin
,
T'otherest
,
maybe
you
'll
put
up
at
the
Lock
-
house
when
you
come
back
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
"
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
nodded
,
and
the
figure
of
the
bargeman
went
its
way
along
the
soft
turf
by
the
side
of
the
towing
-
path
,
keeping
near
the
hedge
and
moving
quickly
.
<EOS>
They
had
turned
a
point
from
which
a
long
stretch
of
river
was
visible
.
<EOS>
A
stranger
to
the
scene
might
have
been
certain
that
here
<EOS>
and
there
along
the
line
of
hedge
<EOS>
a
figure
stood
,
watching
the
bargeman
,
and
waiting
for
him
to
come
up
.
<EOS>
So
he
himself
had
often
believed
at
first
,
until
his
eyes
became
used
to
the
posts
,
bearing
the
dagger
that
slew
Wat
Tyler
,
in
the
City
of
London
shield
.
  
<EOS>
Within
Mr.
Riderhood
's
knowledge
all
daggers
were
as
one
.
<EOS>
Even
to
Bradley
Headstone
,
who
could
have
told
to
the
letter
without
book
all
about
Wat
Tyler
,
Lord
Mayor
Walworth
,
and
the
King
,
that
it
is
dutiful
for
youth
to
know
<EOS>
,
there
was
but
one
subject
living
in
the
world
for
every
sharp
destructive
instrument
that
summer
evening
.
<EOS>
So
,
Riderhood
looking
after
him
as
he
went
,
and
he
with
his
furtive
hand
laid
upon
the
dagger
as
he
passed
it
,
and
his
eyes
upon
the
boat
,
were
much
upon
a
par
.
  
<EOS>
The
boat
went
on
,
under
the
arching
trees
,
and
over
their
tranquil
shadows
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
The
bargeman
skulking
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
,
went
on
after
it
.
<EOS>
Sparkles
of
light
showed
Riderhood
when
and
where
the
rower
dipped
his
blades
,
until
,
even
as
he
stood
idly
watching
,
the
sun
went
down
and
the
landscape
was
dyed
red
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
red
had
the
appearance
of
fading
out
of
it
and
mounting
up
to
Heaven
,
as
we
say
that
blood
,
guiltily
shed
,
does
.
  
<EOS>
Turning
back
towards
his
Lock
<EOS>
(
he
had
not
gone
out
of
view
of
it
)
,
the
Rogue
pondered
as
deeply
as
it
was
within
the
contracted
power
of
such
a
fellow
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
he
copy
my
clothes
?
<EOS>
He
could
have
looked
like
what
he
wanted
to
look
like
,
without
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
subject
-
matter
in
his
thoughts
;
in
which
,
too
,
there
came
lumbering
up
,
by
times
,
like
any
half
floating
and
half
sinking
rubbish
in
the
river
,
the
question
,
Was
it
done
by
accident
?
<EOS>
The
setting
of
a
trap
for
finding
out
whether
it
was
accidentally
done
,
soon
superseded
,
as
a
practical
piece
of
cunning
,
the
abstruser
inquiry
why
otherwise
it
was
done
.
<EOS>
And
he
devised
a
means
.
  
<EOS>
Rogue
Riderhood
went
into
his
Lock
-
house
,
and
brought
forth
,
into
the
now
sober
grey
light
,
his
chest
of
clothes
.
<EOS>
Sitting
on
the
grass
beside
it
,
he
turned
out
,
one
by
one
,
the
articles
it
contained
,
until
he
came
to
a
conspicuous
bright
red
neckerchief
stained
black
here
and
there
by
wear
.
<EOS>
It
arrested
his
attention
,
and
he
sat
pausing
over
it
,
until
he
took
off
the
rusty
colourless
wisp
that
he
wore
round
his
throat
,
and
substituted
the
red
neckerchief
,
leaving
the
long
ends
flowing
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
"
said
the
Rogue
,
"
if
arter
he
sees
me
in
this
neckhankecher
<EOS>
,
I
see
him
in
a
sim'lar
<EOS>
neckhankecher
,
it
wo
n't
be
accident
!
"
 
<EOS>
Elated
by
his
device
,
he
carried
his
chest
in
again
and
went
to
supper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lock
ho
!
<EOS>
Lock
!
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
light
night
,
and
a
barge
coming
down
summoned
him
out
of
a
long
doze
.
<EOS>
In
due
course
he
had
let
the
barge
through
and
was
alone
again
,
looking
to
the
closing
of
his
gates
,
when
Bradley
Headstone
appeared
before
him
,
standing
on
the
brink
of
the
Lock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Back
a
'
ready
,
T'otherest
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
has
put
up
for
the
night
,
at
an
Angler
's
Inn
,
"
was
the
fatigued
and
hoarse
reply
.
"
<EOS>
He
goes
on
,
up
the
river
,
at
six
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
have
come
back
for
a
couple
of
hours
'
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
'
em
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
making
towards
the
schoolmaster
by
his
plank
bridge
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
them
,
"
returned
Bradley
,
irritably
,
"
because
I
would
rather
not
have
them
,
but
would
much
prefer
to
follow
him
all
night
.
<EOS>
However
,
if
he
wo
n't
lead
,
I
ca
n't
follow
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
waiting
about
,
until
I
could
discover
,
for
a
certainty
,
at
what
time
he
starts
;
if
I
could
n't
have
made
sure
of
it
,
I
should
have
stayed
there
.
<EOS>
---
This
would
be
a
bad
pit
for
a
man
to
be
flung
into
with
his
hands
tied
.
<EOS>
These
slippery
smooth
walls
would
give
him
no
chance
.
<EOS>
And
I
suppose
those
gates
would
suck
him
down
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Suck
him
down
,
or
swaller
him
up
,
he
would
n't
get
out
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Not
even
if
his
hands
warn't
tied
,
he
would
n't
.
<EOS>
Shut
him
in
at
both
ends
,
and
I
'd
give
him
a
pint
o
'
old
ale
ever
to
come
up
to
me
standing
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
looked
down
with
a
ghastly
relish
.
<EOS>
"
You
run
about
the
brink
,
and
run
across
it
,
in
this
uncertain
light
,
on
a
few
inches
width
of
rotten
wood
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
you
have
no
thought
of
being
drowned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
be
!
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
drowned
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
said
Riderhood
,
shaking
his
head
with
an
air
of
thorough
conviction
<EOS>
,
"
it
's
well
known
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
brought
out
o
'
drowning
,
and
I
ca
n't
be
drowned
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
that
there
busted
B'lowbridger
aware
on
it
,
or
her
people
might
make
it
tell
agin
'
the
damages
I
mean
to
get
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
well
known
to
water
-
side
characters
like
myself
,
that
him
as
has
been
brought
out
o
'
drowning
,
can
never
be
drowned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
smiled
sourly
at
the
ignorance
he
would
have
corrected
in
one
of
his
pupils
,
and
continued
to
look
down
into
the
water
,
as
if
the
place
had
a
gloomy
fascination
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
like
it
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
no
notice
,
but
stood
looking
down
,
as
if
he
had
not
heard
the
words
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
very
dark
expression
on
his
face
;
an
expression
that
the
Rogue
found
it
hard
to
understand
.
<EOS>
It
was
fierce
,
and
full
of
purpose
;
but
the
purpose
might
have
been
as
much
against
himself
as
against
another
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
stepped
back
for
a
spring
,
taken
a
leap
,
and
thrown
himself
in
,
it
would
have
been
no
surprising
sequel
to
the
look
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
his
troubled
soul
,
set
upon
some
violence
,
did
hover
for
the
moment
between
that
violence
and
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
say
,
"
asked
Riderhood
,
after
watching
him
for
a
while
with
a
sidelong
glance
,
"
as
you
had
come
back
for
a
couple
o
'
hours
'
rest
?
"
<EOS>
But
,
even
then
he
had
to
jog
him
with
his
elbow
before
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Had
n't
you
better
come
in
and
take
your
couple
o'hours
'
rest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
the
look
of
one
just
awakened
,
he
followed
Riderhood
into
the
Lock
-
house
,
where
the
latter
produced
from
a
cupboard
some
cold
salt
beef
and
half
a
loaf
,
some
gin
in
a
bottle
,
and
some
water
in
a
jug
.
<EOS>
The
last
he
brought
in
,
cool
and
dripping
,
from
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
T'otherest
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
stooping
over
him
to
put
it
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
take
a
bite
and
a
sup
,
afore
you
takes
your
snooze
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
draggling
ends
of
the
red
neckerchief
caught
the
schoolmaster
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
saw
him
look
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
thought
that
worthy
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
-
taking
notice
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
You
shall
have
a
good
squint
at
it
then
.
<EOS>
"
With
which
reflection
he
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
,
threw
open
his
vest
,
and
made
a
pretence
of
re
-
tying
the
neckerchief
with
much
deliberation
.
  
<EOS>
Bradley
ate
and
drank
.
<EOS>
As
he
sat
at
his
platter
and
mug
,
Riderhood
saw
him
,
again
and
yet
again
,
steal
a
look
at
the
neckerchief
,
as
if
he
were
correcting
his
slow
observation
and
prompting
his
sluggish
memory
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
're
ready
for
your
snooze
,
"
said
that
honest
creature
,
"
chuck
yourself
on
my
bed
in
the
corner
,
T'otherest
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
broad
day
afore
three
.
<EOS>
I
'll
call
you
early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
require
no
calling
,
"
answered
Bradley
.
<EOS>
And
soon
afterwards
,
divesting
himself
only
of
his
shoes
and
coat
,
laid
himself
down
.
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
,
leaning
back
in
his
wooden
arm
-
chair
with
his
arms
folded
on
his
breast
,
looked
at
him
lying
with
his
right
hand
clenched
in
his
sleep
and
his
teeth
set
,
until
a
film
came
over
his
own
sight
,
and
he
slept
too
.
<EOS>
He
awoke
to
find
that
it
was
daylight
,
and
that
his
visitor
was
already
astir
,
and
going
out
to
the
riverside
to
cool
his
head
:
---
<EOS>
"
Though
I
'm
blest
,
"
muttered
Riderhood
at
the
Lock
-
house
door
,
looking
after
him
,
"
if
I
think
there
's
water
enough
in
all
the
Thames
to
do
that
for
you
!
"
<EOS>
Within
five
minutes
he
had
taken
his
departure
,
and
was
passing
on
into
the
calm
distance
as
he
had
passed
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
knew
when
a
fish
leaped
,
by
his
starting
and
glancing
round
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lock
ho
!
<EOS>
Lock
!
"
<EOS>
at
intervals
all
day
,
and
"
Lock
ho
!
<EOS>
Lock
!
"
 
<EOS>
thrice
in
the
ensuing
night
,
but
no
return
of
Bradley
.
<EOS>
The
second
day
was
sultry
and
oppressive
.
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
,
a
thunderstorm
came
up
,
and
had
but
newly
broken
into
a
furious
sweep
of
rain
when
he
rushed
in
at
the
door
,
like
the
storm
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
seen
him
with
her
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Riderhood
,
starting
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
  
"
At
his
journey
's
end
.
<EOS>
His
boat
's
hauled
up
for
three
days
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
give
the
order
.
<EOS>
Then
,
I
saw
him
wait
for
her
and
meet
her
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
"
---
he
stopped
as
though
he
were
suffocating
,
and
began
again
---
"
I
saw
them
walking
side
by
side
,
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
dropped
into
a
chair
,
and
laughed
.
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
,
a
great
spirt
of
blood
burst
from
his
nose
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
does
that
happen
?
"
asked
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
keep
it
back
.
<EOS>
It
has
happened
twice
---
  
three
times
---
four
times
---
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
how
many
times
---
since
last
night
.
<EOS>
I
taste
it
,
smell
it
,
see
it
,
it
chokes
me
,
and
then
it
breaks
out
like
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
into
the
pelting
rain
again
with
his
head
bare
,
and
bending
low
over
the
river
,
and
scooping
up
the
water
with
his
two
hands
,
washed
the
blood
away
.
<EOS>
All
beyond
his
figure
,
as
Riderhood
looked
from
the
door
,
was
a
vast
dark
curtain
in
solemn
movement
towards
one
quarter
of
the
heavens
.
<EOS>
He
raised
his
head
and
came
back
,
wet
from
head
to
foot
,
but
with
the
lower
part
of
his
sleeves
,
where
he
had
dipped
into
the
river
,
streaming
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
face
is
like
a
ghost
's
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
ever
see
a
ghost
?
"
was
the
sullen
retort
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
say
,
you
're
quite
wore
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
may
well
be
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
no
rest
since
I
left
here
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
that
I
have
so
much
as
sat
down
since
I
left
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lie
down
now
,
then
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
if
you
'll
give
me
something
to
quench
my
thirst
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bottle
and
jug
were
again
produced
,
and
he
mixed
a
weak
draught
,
and
another
,
and
drank
both
in
quick
succession
.
<EOS>
"
You
asked
me
something
,
"
he
said
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
did
n't
,
"
replied
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
"
retorted
Bradley
,
turning
upon
him
in
a
wild
and
desperate
manner
,
"
you
asked
me
something
,
before
I
went
out
to
wash
my
face
in
the
river
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Then
?
"
said
Riderhood
,
backing
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
asked
you
wot
you
wos
a
-
going
to
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
a
man
in
this
state
know
?
<EOS>
"
he
answered
,
protesting
with
both
his
tremulous
hands
,
with
an
action
so
vigorously
angry
that
he
shook
the
water
from
his
sleeves
upon
the
floor
,
as
if
he
had
wrung
them
.
"
<EOS>
How
can
I
plan
anything
,
if
I
have
n't
sleep
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
's
what
I
as
good
as
said
,
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
say
lie
down
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
perhaps
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Anyways
I
says
it
again
.
<EOS>
Sleep
where
you
slept
last
;
 
the
sounder
and
longer
<EOS>
you
can
sleep
,
the
better
you
'll
know
arterwards
what
you
're
up
to
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
pointing
to
the
truckle
bed
in
the
corner
,
seemed
gradually
to
bring
that
poor
couch
to
Bradley
's
wandering
remembrance
.
<EOS>
He
slipped
off
his
worn
down
-
trodden
shoes
,
and
east
himself
heavily
,
all
wet
as
he
was
,
upon
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
sat
down
in
his
wooden
arm
-
chair
,
and
looked
through
the
window
at
the
lightning
,
and
listened
to
the
thunder
.
<EOS>
But
,
his
thoughts
were
far
from
being
absorbed
by
the
thunder
and
the
lightning
,
for
again
and
again
and
again
he
looked
very
curiously
at
the
exhausted
man
upon
the
bed
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
turned
up
the
collar
of
the
rough
coat
he
wore
,
to
shelter
himself
from
the
storm
,
and
had
buttoned
it
about
his
neck
.
<EOS>
Unconscious
of
that
,
and
of
most
things
,
he
had
left
the
coat
so
,
both
when
he
had
laved
his
face
in
the
river
,
and
when
he
had
cast
himself
upon
the
bed
;
though
it
would
have
been
much
easier
to
him
if
he
had
unloosened
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
thunder
rolled
heavily
,
and
the
forked
lightning
seemed
to
make
jagged
rents
in
every
part
of
the
vast
curtain
without
,
as
Riderhood
sat
by
the
window
,
glancing
at
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
he
saw
the
man
upon
the
bed
,
by
a
red
light
;
sometimes
,
by
a
blue
;
 
sometimes
,
he
scarcely
saw
him
in
the
darkness
of
the
storm
;
sometimes
he
saw
nothing
of
him
in
the
blinding
glare
of
palpitating
white
fire
.
<EOS>
Anon
,
the
rain
would
come
again
with
a
tremendous
rush
,
and
the
river
would
seem
to
rise
to
meet
it
,
and
a
blast
of
wind
,
bursting
upon
the
door
,
would
flutter
the
hair
and
dress
of
the
man
,
as
if
invisible
messengers
were
come
around
the
bed
to
carry
him
away
.
<EOS>
From
all
these
phases
of
the
storm
,
Riderhood
would
turn
,
as
if
they
were
interruptions
---
rather
striking
interruptions
possibly
,
but
interruptions
still
---
of
his
scrutiny
of
the
sleeper
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
sleeps
sound
,
"
he
said
within
himself
;
"
yet
he
's
that
up
to
me
and
that
noticing
of
me
that
my
getting
out
of
my
chair
may
wake
him
,
when
a
rattling
peal
wo
n't
;
let
alone
my
touching
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
very
cautiously
rose
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
T'otherest
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
,
calm
voice
,
"
are
you
a
lying
easy
?
<EOS>
There
's
a
chill
in
the
air
,
governor
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
put
a
coat
over
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
No
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
about
what
it
is
a'ready
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
"
muttered
Riderhood
in
a
lower
and
a
different
voice
;
"
a
coat
over
you
,
a
coat
over
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
sleeper
moving
an
arm
,
he
sat
down
again
in
his
chair
,
and
feigned
to
watch
the
storm
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
grand
spectacle
,
but
not
so
grand
as
to
keep
his
eyes
,
for
half
a
minute
together
,
from
stealing
a
look
at
the
man
upon
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
at
the
concealed
throat
of
the
sleeper
that
Riderhood
so
often
looked
so
curiously
,
until
the
sleep
seemed
to
deepen
into
the
stupor
of
the
dead
-
tired
in
mind
and
body
.
<EOS>
Then
,
Riderhood
came
from
the
window
cautiously
,
and
stood
by
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
man
!
"
<EOS>
he
murmured
in
a
low
tone
,
with
a
crafty
face
,
and
a
very
watchful
eye
and
ready
foot
,
lest
he
should
start
up
;
"
this
here
coat
of
his
must
make
him
uneasy
in
his
sleep
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
loosen
if
for
him
,
and
make
him
more
comfortable
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
ought
to
it
,
poor
man
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
touched
the
first
button
with
a
very
cautions
hand
,
and
a
step
backward
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
sleeper
remaining
in
profound
unconsciousness
,
he
touched
the
other
buttons
with
a
more
assured
hand
,
and
perhaps
the
more
lightly
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
Softly
and
slowly
,
he
opened
the
coat
and
drew
it
back
.
  
<EOS>
The
draggling
ends
of
a
bright
-
red
neckerchief
were
then
disclosed
,
and
he
had
even
been
at
the
pains
of
dipping
parts
of
it
in
some
liquid
,
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
having
become
stained
by
wear
.
<EOS>
With
a
much
-
perplexed
face
,
Riderhood
looked
from
it
to
the
sleeper
,
and
from
the
sleeper
to
it
,
and
finally
crept
back
to
his
chair
,
and
there
,
with
his
hand
to
his
chin
,
sat
long
in
a
brown
study
,
looking
at
both
.
   
<EOS>
THE
GOLDEN
DUSTMAN
RISES
A
LITTLE
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
had
come
to
breakfast
with
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
absolutely
uninvited
,
but
had
pressed
themselves
with
so
much
urgency
on
the
golden
couple
,
that
evasion
of
the
honor
and
pleasure
of
their
company
would
have
been
difficult
,
if
desired
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
a
charming
state
of
mind
,
were
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
,
and
almost
as
fond
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
as
of
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
"
it
imparts
new
life
to
me
,
to
see
my
Alfred
in
confidential
communication
with
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
The
two
were
formed
to
become
intimate
.
<EOS>
So
much
simplicity
combined
with
so
much
force
of
character
,
such
natural
sagacity
united
to
such
amiability
and
gentleness
<EOS>
---
these
are
the
distinguishing
characteristics
of
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
being
said
aloud
,
gave
Mr.
Lammle
an
opportunity
,
as
he
came
with
Mr.
Boffin
from
the
window
to
the
breakfast
table
,
of
taking
up
his
dear
and
honored
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
Sophronia
,
"
said
that
gentleman
,
"
your
too
partial
estimate
of
your
poor
husband
's
character
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Not
too
partial
,
Alfred
<EOS>
,
"
urged
the
lady
,
tenderly
moved
;
 
"
never
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
child
,
your
favourable
opinion
,
then
,
of
your
husband
---
you
do
n't
object
to
that
phrase
,
darling
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
,
Alfred
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
favourable
opinion
then
,
my
Precious
,
does
less
than
justice
to
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
more
than
justice
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
the
first
charge
,
Alfred
,
I
plead
guilty
.
<EOS>
But
to
the
second
,
oh
no
,
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Less
than
justice
to
Mr.
Boffin
,
Sophronia
,
"
said
Mr.
Lammle
,
soaring
into
a
tone
of
moral
grandeur
,
"
because
it
represents
Mr.
Boffin
as
on
my
lower
level
;
more
than
justice
to
me
,
Sophronia
,
because
it
represents
me
as
on
Mr.
Boffin
's
higher
level
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
bears
and
forbears
far
more
than
I
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Far
more
than
you
could
for
yourself
,
Alfred
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
that
is
not
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
the
question
,
Lawyer
?
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
archly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
dear
Sophronia
.
<EOS>
From
my
lower
level
,
I
regard
Mr.
Boffin
as
too
generous
,
as
possessed
of
too
much
clemency
,
as
being
too
good
to
persons
who
are
unworthy
of
him
and
ungrateful
to
him
.
<EOS>
To
those
noble
qualities
I
can
lay
no
claim
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
they
rouse
my
indignation
when
I
see
them
in
action
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Alfred
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
rouse
my
indignation
,
my
dear
,
against
,
the
unworthy
persons
,
and
give
me
a
combative
desire
to
stand
between
Mr.
Boffin
and
all
such
persons
.
<EOS>
Why
?
<EOS>
Because
,
in
my
lower
nature
I
am
more
worldly
and
less
delicate
.
<EOS>
Not
being
so
magnanimous
as
Mr.
Boffin
,
I
feel
his
injuries
more
than
he
does
himself
,
and
feel
more
capable
of
opposing
his
injurers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
struck
Mrs.
Lammle
that
it
appeared
rather
difficult
this
morning
to
bring
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
into
agreeable
conversation
.
<EOS>
Here
had
been
several
lures
thrown
out
,
and
neither
of
them
had
uttered
a
word
.
<EOS>
Here
were
she
,
Mrs.
Lammle
,
and
her
husband
discoursing
at
once
affectingly
and
effectively
,
but
discoursing
alone
.
<EOS>
Assuming
that
the
dear
old
creatures
were
impressed
by
what
they
heard
,
still
one
would
like
to
be
sure
of
it
,
the
more
so
,
as
at
least
one
of
the
dear
old
creatures
was
somewhat
pointedly
referred
to
.
<EOS>
If
the
dear
old
creatures
were
too
bashful
or
too
dull
to
assume
their
required
places
in
the
discussion
,
why
then
it
would
seem
desirable
that
the
dear
old
creatures
should
be
taken
by
their
heads
and
shoulders
and
brought
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
not
my
husband
saying
in
effect
,
"
asked
Mrs.
Lammle
,
therefore
,
with
an
innocent
air
,
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
that
he
becomes
unmindful
of
his
own
temporary
misfortunes
in
his
admiration
of
another
whom
he
is
burning
to
serve
?
<EOS>
And
is
not
that
making
an
admission
that
his
nature
is
a
generous
one
?
<EOS>
I
am
wretched
in
argument
,
but
surely
this
is
so
,
dear
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
?
"
  
<EOS>
Still
,
neither
Mr.
nor
Mrs.
Boffin
said
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
sat
with
his
eyes
on
his
plate
,
eating
his
muffins
and
ham
,
and
she
sat
shyly
looking
at
the
teapot
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
's
innocent
appeal
was
merely
thrown
into
the
air
,
to
mingle
with
the
steam
of
the
urn
.
<EOS>
Glancing
towards
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
she
very
slightly
raised
her
eyebrows
,
as
though
inquiring
of
her
husband
:
"
Do
I
notice
anything
wrong
here
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
,
who
had
found
his
chest
effective
on
a
variety
of
occasions
,
manoeuvred
his
capacious
shirt
front
into
the
largest
demonstration
possible
,
and
then
smiling
retorted
on
his
wife
,
thus
:
  
<EOS>
"
Sophronia
,
darling
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
will
remind
you
of
the
old
adage
,
that
self
-
praise
is
no
recommendation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Self
-
praise
,
Alfred
?
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
because
we
are
one
and
the
same
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
child
.
<EOS>
I
mean
that
you
can
not
fail
to
remember
,
<EOS>
if
you
reflect
for
a
single
moment
,
that
what
you
are
pleased
to
compliment
me
upon
feeling
in
the
case
of
Mr.
Boffin
,
you
have
yourself
confided
to
me
as
your
own
feeling
in
the
case
of
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
(
"
I
shall
be
beaten
by
this
Lawyer
,
"
Mrs.
Lammle
gaily
whispered
to
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
must
admit
it
,
<EOS>
if
he
presses
me
,
for
it
's
damagingly
true
.
"
)
  
<EOS>
Several
white
dints
began
to
come
and
go
about
Mr.
Lammle
's
nose
,
as
he
observed
that
Mrs.
Boffin
merely
looked
up
from
the
teapot
for
a
moment
with
an
embarrassed
smile
,
which
was
no
smile
,
and
then
looked
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
admit
the
charge
,
Sophronia
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Alfred
,
in
a
rallying
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Really
,
I
think
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
still
gaily
,
"
I
must
throw
myself
on
the
protection
of
the
Court
.
<EOS>
Am
I
bound
to
answer
that
question
,
my
Lord
?
"
<EOS>
To
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
,
if
you
do
n't
like
ma'am
,
"
was
his
answer
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
of
the
least
consequence
.
"
  
<EOS>
Both
husband
and
wife
glanced
at
him
,
very
doubtfully
.
<EOS>
His
manner
was
grave
,
but
not
coarse
,
and
derived
some
dignity
from
a
certain
repressed
dislike
of
the
tone
of
the
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
Again
Mrs.
Lammle
raised
her
eyebrows
for
instruction
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
He
replied
in
a
slight
nod
,
"
Try
'em
again
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
protect
myself
against
the
suspicion
of
covert
self
-
laudation
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
said
the
airy
Mrs.
Lammle
therefore
,
"
I
must
tell
you
how
it
was
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
Pray
do
n't
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
turned
to
him
laughingly
.
"
<EOS>
The
Court
objects
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ma'am
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
the
Court
(
if
I
am
the
Court
)
does
object
.
<EOS>
The
Court
objects
for
two
reasons
.
<EOS>
First
,
because
the
Court
do
n't
think
it
fair
.
<EOS>
Secondly
,
because
the
dear
old
lady
,
Mrs.
Court
(
if
I
am
Mr.
)
gets
distressed
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
very
remarkable
wavering
between
two
bearings
---
between
her
propitiatory
bearing
there
,
and
her
defiant
bearing
at
Mr.
Twemlow
's
 
---
was
observable
on
the
part
of
Mrs.
Lammle
as
she
said
:
"
What
does
the
Court
not
consider
fair
?
"
  
<EOS>
Letting
you
go
on
,
"
replied
Mr.
Boffin
,
nodding
his
head
soothingly
,
as
who
should
say
,
We
wo
n't
be
harder
on
you
than
we
can
help
;
we
'll
make
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
above
-
board
<EOS>
and
it
's
not
fair
.
<EOS>
When
the
old
lady
is
uncomfortable
,
there
's
sure
to
be
good
reason
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
see
she
is
uncomfortable
,
and
I
plainly
see
this
is
the
good
reason
wherefore
.
<EOS>
Have
you
breakfasted
,
ma'am
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
,
settling
into
her
defiant
manner
,
pushed
her
plate
away
,
looked
at
her
husband
,
and
laughed
;
but
by
no
means
gaily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
breakfasted
,
sir
?
"
inquired
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
replied
Alfred
,
showing
all
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
If
Mrs.
Boffin
will
oblige
me
,
I
'll
take
another
cup
of
tea
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
spilled
a
little
of
it
over
the
chest
which
ought
to
have
been
so
effective
,
and
which
had
done
so
little
;
but
on
the
whole
drank
it
with
something
of
an
air
,
though
the
coming
and
going
dints
got
almost
as
large
,
the
while
,
as
if
they
had
been
made
by
pressure
of
the
teaspoon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
thousand
thanks
,
"
he
then
observed
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
breakfasted
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Now
,
which
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
softly
,
taking
out
a
pocket
-
book
,
"
which
of
you
two
is
Cashier
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sophronia
,
my
dear
,
"
remarked
her
husband
,
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
waving
his
right
hand
towards
her
,
while
he
hung
his
left
hand
by
the
thumb
in
the
arm
-
hole
of
his
waistcoat
:
"
it
shall
be
your
department
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
that
it
was
your
husband
's
,
ma'am
,
because
---
<EOS>
but
never
mind
,
because
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
have
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
However
,
what
I
have
to
say
,
I
will
say
with
as
little
offence
as
possible
;
if
I
can
say
it
without
any
,
I
shall
be
heartily
glad
.
<EOS>
You
two
have
done
me
a
service
,
a
very
great
service
,
in
doing
what
you
did
(
my
old
lady
knows
what
it
was
)
,
and
I
have
put
into
this
envelope
a
bank
note
for
a
hundred
pound
.
<EOS>
I
consider
the
service
well
worth
a
hundred
pound
,
and
I
am
well
pleased
to
pay
the
money
.
<EOS>
Would
you
do
me
the
favour
to
take
it
,
and
likewise
to
accept
my
thanks
?
<EOS>
"
  
With
a
haughty
action
,
and
without
looking
towards
him
,
Mrs.
Lammle
held
out
her
left
hand
,
and
into
it
Mr.
Boffin
put
the
little
packet
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
conveyed
it
to
her
bosom
,
Mr.
Lammle
had
the
appearance
of
feeling
relieved
,
and
breathing
more
freely
,
as
not
having
been
quite
certain
that
the
hundred
pounds
were
his
,
until
the
note
had
been
safely
transferred
out
of
Mr.
Boffin
's
keeping
into
his
own
Sophronia
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
impossible
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
addressing
Alfred
,
"
that
you
have
had
some
general
idea
,
sir
,
of
replacing
Rokesmith
,
in
course
of
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
,
"
assented
Alfred
,
with
a
glittering
smile
and
a
great
deal
of
nose
,
"
not
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
perhaps
,
ma'am
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Boffin
,
addressing
Sophronia
,
"
you
have
been
so
kind
as
to
take
up
my
old
lady
in
your
own
mind
,
and
to
do
her
the
honor
of
turning
the
question
over
whether
you
might
n't
one
of
these
days
have
her
in
charge
,
like
?
<EOS>
Whether
you
might
n't
be
a
sort
of
Miss
Bella
Wilfer
to
her
,
and
something
more
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
,
"
returned
Mrs.
Lammle
,
with
a
scornful
look
and
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
that
if
I
were
anything
to
your
wife
,
sir
,
I
could
hardly
fail
to
be
something
more
than
Miss
Bella
Wilfer
,
as
you
call
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
her
,
ma'am
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
disdained
to
reply
,
and
sat
defiantly
beating
one
foot
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Again
I
think
I
may
say
,
that
's
not
impossible
.
<EOS>
Is
it
,
sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
turning
to
Alfred
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
,
"
said
Alfred
,
smiling
assent
as
before
,
"
not
impossible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
gently
,
"
it
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
to
say
a
single
word
that
might
be
afterwards
remembered
as
unpleasant
;
 
but
it
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sophronia
,
my
love
,
"
her
husband
repeated
in
a
bantering
manner
,
"
you
hear
?
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
his
voice
still
dropped
,
"
it
really
wo
n't
.
<EOS>
You
positively
must
excuse
us
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
go
your
way
,
we
'll
go
ours
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
hope
this
affair
ends
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
gave
him
the
look
of
a
decidedly
dissatisfied
party
demanding
exemption
from
the
category
;
but
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
thing
we
can
make
of
the
affair
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
is
a
matter
of
business
,
and
as
a
matter
of
business
it
's
brought
to
a
conclusion
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
me
a
great
service
,
a
very
great
service
,
and
I
have
paid
for
it
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
objection
to
the
price
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
looked
at
one
another
across
the
table
,
but
neither
could
say
that
there
was
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
Mrs.
Lammle
sat
rigid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
We
hope
(
my
old
lady
and
me
)
that
you
'll
give
us
credit
for
taking
the
plainest
and
honestest
shortcut
that
could
be
taken
under
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
We
have
talked
it
over
with
a
deal
of
care
(
my
old
lady
and
me
)
,
and
we
have
felt
that
at
all
to
lead
you
on
,
or
even
all
to
let
you
go
on
of
your
own
selves
,
would
n't
be
the
right
thing
.
<EOS>
So
,
I
have
openly
given
you
to
understand
that
<EOS>
---
"
Mr.
Boffin
sought
for
a
new
turn
of
speech
,
but
could
find
none
so
expressive
as
his
former
one
,
repeated
in
a
confidential
tone
,
"
---
that
it
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
put
the
case
more
pleasantly
<EOS>
I
would
;
<EOS>
but
I
hope
I
have
n't
put
it
very
unpleasantly
;
 
at
all
events
I
have
n't
meant
to
.
<EOS>
So
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
by
way
of
peroration
,
"
wishing
you
well
in
the
way
you
go
,
we
now
conclude
with
the
observation
that
perhaps
you
'll
go
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lammle
rose
with
an
impudent
laugh
on
his
side
of
the
table
,
and
Mrs.
Lammle
rose
with
a
disdainful
frown
on
hers
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
hasty
foot
was
heard
on
the
staircase
,
and
Georgiana
Podsnap
broke
into
the
room
,
unannounced
and
in
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
dear
Sophronia
,
"
cried
Georgiana
,
wringing
her
hands
as
she
ran
up
to
embrace
her
,
"
to
think
that
you
and
Alfred
should
be
ruined
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
poor
dear
Sophronia
,
to
think
that
you
should
have
had
a
Sale
at
your
house
after
all
your
kindness
to
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
pray
forgive
me
for
this
intrusion
,
but
you
do
n't
know
how
fond
I
was
of
Sophronia
when
Pa
would
n't
let
me
go
there
any
more
,
or
what
I
have
felt
for
Sophronia
since
I
heard
from
Ma
of
her
having
been
brought
low
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
,
you
ca
n't
<EOS>
,
you
never
can
,
think
,
how
I
have
lain
awake
at
night
and
cried
for
my
good
Sophronia
,
my
first
and
only
friend
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
's
manner
changed
under
the
poor
silly
girl
's
embraces
,
and
she
turned
extremely
pale
:
directing
one
appealing
look
,
first
to
Mrs.
Boffin
,
and
then
to
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Both
understood
her
instantly
,
with
a
more
delicate
subtlety
than
much
better
educated
people
,
whose
perception
came
less
directly
from
the
heart
,
could
have
brought
to
bear
upon
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
a
minute

"
said
poor
little
Georgiana
,
"
to
stay
.
<EOS>
I
am
out
shopping
early
with
Ma

I
said
I
had
a
headache
and
got
Ma
to
leave
me
outside
in
the
phaeton
,
in
Piccadilly
,
and
ran
round
to
Sackville
Street
,
and
heard
that
Sophronia
was
here
,
and
then
Ma
came
to
see
,
oh
such
a
dreadful
old
stony
woman
from
the
country
in
a
turban
in
Portland
Place
,
and
I
said
I
would
n't
go
up
with
Ma
but
would
drive
round
and
leave
cards
for
the
Boffins
,
which
is
taking
a
liberty
with
the
name
;
but
oh
my
goodness
I
am
distracted
,
and
the
phaeton
's
at
the
door
,
and
what
would
Pa
say
if
he
knew
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do

timid

my
dear
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
You
came
in
to
see
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
,
I
did
n't
,
"
cried
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
impolite
,
I
know
,
but
I
came
to
see
my
poor
Sophronia
,
my
only
friend
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
I
felt
the
separation
,
my
dear
Sophronia
,
before
I
knew
you
were
brought
low
in
the
world
,
and
how
much
more
I
feel
it
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
were
actually
tears
in
the
bold
woman
's
eyes
,
as
the
softheaded
and
soft
-
hearted
girl
twined
her
arms
about
her
neck
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
've
come
on
business
,
"
said
Georgiana
,
sobbing
and
drying
her
face
,
and
then
searching
in
a
little
reticule
,
"
and
if
I
do
n't
despatch
it
<EOS>
I
shall
have
come
for
nothing
,
and
oh
good
gracious
!
<EOS>
what
would
Pa
say
if
he
knew
of
Sackville
Street
,
and
what
would
Ma
say
if
she
was
kept
waiting
on
the
doorsteps
of
that
dreadful
turban
,
and
there
never
were
such
pawing
horses
as
ours
unsettling
my
mind
every
moment
more
and
more
when
I
want
more
mind
than
I
have
got
,
by
pawing
up
Mr.
Boffin
's
street
where
they
have
no
business
to
be
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
where
is
,
where
is
it
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
find
it
!
<EOS>
"
All
this
time
sobbing
,
and
searching
in
the
little
reticule
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
miss
,
my
dear
?
"
asked
Mr.
Boffin
,
stepping
forward
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
little
enough
,
"
replied
Georgiana
,
"
because
Ma
always
treats
me
as
if
I
was
in
the
nursery
<EOS>
(
I
am
sure
I
wish
I
was
!
)
,
but
I
hardly
ever
spend
it
<EOS>
and
it
has
mounted
up
to
fifteen
pounds
,
Sophronia
,
and
I
hope
three
five
-
pound
notes
are
better
than
nothing
,
though
so
little
,
so
little
!
<EOS>
And
now
I
have
found
that
---
oh
,
my
goodness
!
<EOS>
there
's
the
other
gone
next
!
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
it
is
n't
,
here
it
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
always
sobbing
and
searching
in
the
reticule
,
Georgiana
produced
a
necklace
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ma
says
chits
and
jewels
have
no
business
together
,
"
pursued
Georgiana
,
"
and
that
's
reason
why
I
have
no
trinkets
except
this
,
but
I
suppose
my
aunt
Hawkinson
was
of
a
different
opinion
,
because
she
left
me
this
,
though
I
used
to
think
she
might
just
as
well
have
buried
it
,
for
it
's
always
kept
in
jewellers
'
cotton
.
<EOS>
However
,
here
it
is
,
I
am
thankful
to
say
,
and
of
use
at
last
,
and
you
'll
sell
it
,
dear
Sophronia
,
and
buy
things
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
it
to
me
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
gently
taking
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
that
it
's
properly
disposed
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
are
you
such
a
friend
of
Sophronia
's
,
Mr.
Boffin
?
"
cried
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
good
of
you
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
gracious
!
<EOS>
there
was
something
else
,
and
it
's
gone
out
of
my
head
!
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
it
is
n't
,
I
remember
what
it
was
.
<EOS>
My
grandmamma
's
property
,
that
'll
come
to
me
when
I
am
of
age
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
will
be
all
my
own
,
and
neither
Pa
nor
Ma
nor
anybody
else
will
have
any
control
over
it
,
and
what
I
wish
to
do
is
to
make
some
of
it
over
somehow
to
Sophronia
and
Alfred
,
by
signing
something
somewhere
that
'll
prevail
on
somebody
to
advance
them
something
.
<EOS>
I
want
them
to
have
something
handsome
to
bring
them
up
in
the
world
again
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
goodness
me
!
<EOS>
Being
such
a
friend
of
my
dear
Sophronia
's
,
you
wo
n't
refuse
me
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
it
shall
be
seen
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
thank
you
,
thank
you
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Georgiana
.
<EOS>
"
If
my
maid
had
a
little
note
and
half
a
crown
,
I
could
run
round
to
the
pastrycook
's
to
sign
something
,
or
I
could
sign
something
in
the
Square
if
some
body
would
come
and
cough
for
me
to
let
'em
in
with
the
key
,
and
would
bring
a
pen
and
ink
with
'em
and
a
bit
of
blotting
-
paper
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
gracious
!
<EOS>
I
must
tear
myself
away
,
or
Pa
and
Ma
will
both
find
out
!
<EOS>
Dear
,
dear
Sophronia
,
good
,
good
-
bye
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
credulous
little
creature
again
embraced
Mrs.
Lammle
most
affectionately
,
and
then
held
out
her
hand
to
Mr.
Lammle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
<EOS>
dear
Mr.
Lammle
---
I
mean
<EOS>
Alfred
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
think
after
to
-
day
that
I
have
deserted
you
and
Sophronia
because
you
have
been
brought
low
in
the
world
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
Oh
me
!
<EOS>
oh
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
crying
my
eyes
out
of
my
head
,
and
Ma
will
be
sure
to
ask
me
what
's
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
take
me
down
,
somebody
,
please
,
please
,
please
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
took
her
down
,
and
saw
her
driven
away
,
with
her
poor
little
red
eyes
and
weak
chin
peering
over
the
great
apron
of
the
custard
-
coloured
phaeton
,
as
if
she
had
been
ordered
to
expiate
some
childish
misdemeanor
by
going
to
bed
in
the
daylight
,
and
were
peeping
over
the
counterpane
in
a
miserable
flutter
of
repentance
and
low
spirits
.
<EOS>
Returning
to
the
breakfast
-
room
,
he
found
Mrs.
Lammle
still
standing
on
her
side
of
the
table
,
and
Mr.
Lammle
on
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
care
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
showing
the
money
and
the
necklace
,
"
that
these
are
soon
given
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
had
taken
up
her
parasol
from
a
side
table
,
and
stood
sketching
with
it
on
the
pattern
of
the
damask
cloth
,
as
she
had
sketched
on
the
pattern
of
Mr.
Twemlow
's
papered
wall
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
undeceive
her
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Mr.
Boffin
?
<EOS>
"
she
said
,
turning
her
head
towards
him
,
but
not
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
as
to
the
worth
and
value
of
her
friend
,
"
Mrs.
Lammle
explained
,
in
a
measured
voice
,
and
with
an
emphasis
on
her
last
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
returned
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
try
to
give
a
hint
at
her
home
that
she
is
in
want
of
kind
and
careful
protection
,
but
I
shall
say
no
more
than
that
to
her
parents
,
and
I
shall
say
nothing
to
the
young
lady
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
said
Mrs.
Lammle
,
still
sketching
,
and
seeming
to
bestow
great
pains
upon
it
,
"
there
are
not
many
people
,
I
think
,
who
,
under
the
circumstances
,
would
have
been
so
considerate
and
sparing
as
you
have
been
to
me
just
now
.
<EOS>
Do
you
care
to
be
thanked
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thanks
are
always
worth
having
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
in
her
ready
good
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
thank
you
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sophronia
,
"
asked
her
husband
,
mockingly
,
"
are
you
sentimental
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
my
good
sir
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
interposed
,
"
it
's
a
very
good
thing
to
think
well
of
another
person
,
and
it
's
a
very
good
thing
to
be
thought
well
of
by
another
person
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Lammle
will
be
none
the
worse
for
it
,
if
she
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
obliged
.
<EOS>
But
I
asked
Mrs.
Lammle
if
she
was
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
stood
sketching
on
the
table
-
cloth
,
with
her
face
clouded
and
set
,
and
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
said
Alfred
,
"
I
am
disposed
to
be
sentimental
myself
,
on
your
appropriation
of
the
jewels
and
the
money
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
As
our
little
Georgiana
,
said
,
three
five
-
pound
notes
are
better
than
nothing
,
and
if
you
sell
a
necklace
you
can
buy
things
with
the
produce
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
sell
it
,
"
was
Mr.
Boffin
's
comment
,
as
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
Alfred
followed
it
with
his
looks
,
and
also
greedily
pursued
the
notes
until
they
vanished
into
Mr.
Boffin
's
waistcoat
pocket
.
<EOS>
Then
he
directed
a
look
,
half
exasperated
and
half
jeering
,
at
his
wife
.
<EOS>
She
still
stood
sketching
;
but
,
as
she
sketched
,
there
was
a
struggle
within
her
,
which
found
expression
in
the
depth
of
the
few
last
lines
the
parasol
point
indented
into
the
table
-
cloth
,
and
then
some
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
confound
the
woman
,
"
exclaimed
Lammle
,
"
she
is
sentimental
!
  
<EOS>
She
walked
to
the
window
,
flinching
under
his
angry
stare
,
looked
out
for
a
moment
,
and
turned
round
quite
coldly
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
no
former
cause
of
complaint
on
the
sentimental
score
,
Alfred
,
and
you
will
have
none
in
future
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
worth
your
noticing
.
<EOS>
We
go
abroad
soon
,
with
the
money
we
have
earned
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
we
do
;
you
know
we
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
fear
of
my
taking
any
sentiment
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
soon
be
eased
of
it
,
if
I
did
.
<EOS>
But
it
will
be
all
left
behind
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
left
behind
.
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
,
Alfred
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
the
deuce
have
I
been
waiting
for
<EOS>
but
you
,
Sophronia
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
then
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
have
delayed
our
dignified
departure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
passed
out
and
he
followed
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
had
the
curiosity
softly
to
raise
a
window
and
look
after
them
as
they
went
down
the
long
street
.
<EOS>
They
walked
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
showily
enough
,
but
without
appearing
to
interchange
a
syllable
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
fanciful
to
suppose
that
under
their
outer
bearing
there
was
something
of
the
shamed
air
of
two
cheats
who
were
linked
together
by
concealed
handcuffs
;
but
,
not
so
,
to
suppose
that
they
were
haggardly
weary
of
one
another
,
of
themselves
,
and
of
all
this
world
.
<EOS>
In
turning
the
street
corner
they
might
have
turned
out
of
this
world
,
for
anything
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
ever
saw
of
them
to
the
contrary
;
 
for
,
they
set
eyes
on
the
Lammles
never
more
.

THE
GOLDEN
DUSTMAN
SINKS
AGAIN
.
 
<EOS>
The
evening
of
that
day
being
one
of
the
reading
evenings
at
the
Bower
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Boffin
kissed
Mrs.
Boffin
after
a
five
o'clock
dinner
,
and
trotted
out
,
nursing
his
big
stick
in
both
arms
,
so
that
,
as
of
old
,
it
seemed
to
be
whispering
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
He
carried
so
very
attentive
an
expression
on
his
countenance
that
it
appeared
as
if
the
confidential
discourse
of
the
big
stick
required
to
be
followed
closely
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
's
face
was
like
the
face
of
a
thoughtful
listener
to
an
intricate
communication
,
and
,
in
trotting
along
,
he
occasionally
glanced
at
that
companion
with
the
look
of
a
man
who
was
interposing
the
remark
:
"
<EOS>
You
do
n't
mean
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
and
his
stick
went
on
alone
together
,
until
they
arrived
at
certain
cross
-
ways
where
they
would
be
likely
to
fall
in
with
any
one
coming
,
at
about
the
same
time
,
from
Clerkenwell
to
the
Bower
.
<EOS>
Here
they
stopped
,
and
Mr.
Boffin
consulted
his
watch
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
wants
five
minutes
,
good
,
to
Venus
's
appointment
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
rather
early
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Venus
was
a
punctual
man
,
and
,
even
as
Mr.
Boffin
replaced
his
watch
in
its
pocket
,
was
to
be
descried
coming
towards
him
.
<EOS>
He
quickened
his
pace
on
seeing
Mr.
Boffin
already
at
the
place
of
meeting
,
and
was
soon
at
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank'ee
,
Venus
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thank'ee
,
thank'ee
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
would
not
have
been
very
evident
why
he
thanked
the
anatomist
,
but
for
his
furnishing
the
explanation
in
what
he
went
on
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
right
,
Venus
,
all
right
.
<EOS>
Now
,
that
you
've
been
to
see
me
,
and
have
consented
to
keep
up
the
appearance
before
Wegg
of
remaining
in
it
for
a
time
<EOS>
,
I
have
got
a
sort
of
a
backer
.
<EOS>
All
right
,
Venus
,
Thank'ee
,
Venus
.
<EOS>
Thank'ee
,
thank'ee
,
thank'ee
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
shook
the
proffered
hand
with
a
modest
air
,
and
they
pursued
the
direction
of
the
Bower
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
Wegg
is
likely
to
drop
down
upon
me
to
-
night
,
Venus
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
Mr.
Boffin
,
wistfully
,
as
they
went
along
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
is
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
any
particular
reason
for
thinking
so
,
Venus
?
"
  
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
returned
that
personage
,
"
the
fact
is
he
has
given
me
another
look
-
in
,
to
make
sure
of
what
he
calls
our
stock
-
in
-
trade
being
correct
,
and
he
has
mentioned
his
intention
that
he
was
not
to
be
put
off
beginning
with
you
the
very
next
time
you
should
come
.
<EOS>
And
this
,
"
hinted
Mr.
Venus
,
delicately
,
"
being
the
very
next
time
,
you
know
,
sir
---
"
   
---
"
Why
,
therefore
you
suppose
he
'll
turn
to
at
the
grindstone
,
eh
,
Wegg
?
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
took
his
nose
in
his
hand
,
as
if
it
were
already
excoriated
,
and
the
sparks
were
beginning
to
fly
out
of
that
feature
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
a
terrible
fellow
,
Venus
;
he
's
an
awful
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
ever
I
shall
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
stand
by
me
,
Venus
,
like
a
good
man
and
true
.
<EOS>
You
'll
do
all
you
can
to
stand
by
me
,
Venus
;
wo
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
replied
with
the
assurance
that
he
would
;
and
Mr.
Boffin
,
looking
anxious
and
dispirited
,
pursued
the
way
in
silence
until
they
rang
at
the
Bower
gate
.
<EOS>
The
stumping
approach
of
Wegg
was
soon
heard
behind
it
,
and
as
it
turned
upon
its
hinges
he
became
visible
with
his
hand
on
the
lock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Boffin
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
quite
a
stranger
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
otherwise
occupied
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
indeed
,
sir
?
"
returned
the
literary
gentleman
with
a
threatening
sneer
.
"
<EOS>
Hah
!
<EOS>
I
've
been
looking
for
you
,
sir
,
<EOS>
rather
what
I
may
call
specially
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
say
so
,
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
say
so
,
sir
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
had
n't
come
round
to
me
tonight
,
dash
my
wig
if
I
would
n't
have
come
round
to
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Now
!
<EOS>
I
tell
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
wrong
,
I
hope
,
Wegg
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
was
the
ironical
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
wrong
!
<EOS>
What
should
be
wrong
in
Boffinses
Bower
!
<EOS>
Step
in
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
`
`
If
you
'll
come
to
the
Bower
I
've
shaded
for
you
,
  
Your
bed
sha
n't
be
roses
all
spangled
with
doo
;
  
Will
you
,
will
you
,
will
you
,
come
to
the
Bower
?
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
wo
n't
you
,
wo
n't
you
,
wo
n't
you
,
<EOS>
wo
n't
you
,
come
to
the
Bower
?
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
An
unholy
glare
of
contradiction
and
offence
shone
in
the
eyes
of
Mr.
Wegg
,
as
he
turned
the
key
on
his
patron
,
after
ushering
him
into
the
yard
with
this
vocal
quotation
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
's
air
was
crestfallen
and
submissive
.
<EOS>
Whispered
Wegg
to
Venus
,
as
they
crossed
the
yard
behind
him
:
<EOS>
"
Look
at
the
worm
and
minion
;
he
's
down
in
the
mouth
already
.
"
<EOS>
Whispered
Venus
to
Wegg
:
<EOS>
"
That
's
because
I
've
told
him
.
<EOS>
I
've
prepared
the
way
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
entering
the
usual
chamber
,
laid
his
stick
upon
the
settle
usually
reserved
for
him
,
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
,
with
his
shoulders
raised
and
his
hat
drooping
back
upon
them
,
looked
disconsolately
at
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
My
friend
and
partner
,
Mr.
Venus
,
gives
me
to
understand
,
"
remarked
that
man
of
might
,
addressing
him
,
"
that
you
are
aware
of
our
power
over
you
.
<EOS>
Now
,
when
you
have
took
your
hat
off
,
we
'll
go
into
that
pint
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
shook
it
off
with
one
shake
,
so
that
it
dropped
on
the
floor
behind
him
,
and
remained
in
his
former
attitude
with
his
former
rueful
look
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
First
of
all
,
I
'm
a
-
going
to
call
you
Boffin
,
for
short
,
"
said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
n't
like
it
,
it
's
open
to
you
to
lump
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
it
,
Wegg
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
lucky
for
you
,
Boffin
.
<EOS>
Now
,
do
you
want
to
be
read
to
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
particularly
care
about
it
to
-
night
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
if
you
did
want
to
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Wegg
,
the
brilliancy
of
whose
point
was
dimmed
by
his
having
been
unexpectedly
answered
:
"
you
would
n't
be
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
your
slave
long
enough
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
to
be
trampled
under
-
foot
by
a
dustman
any
more
.
<EOS>
With
the
single
exception
of
the
salary
,
I
renounce
the
whole
and
total
sitiwation
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Since
you
say
it
is
to
be
so
<EOS>
,
Wegg
,
"
returned
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
folded
hands
,
"
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
must
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
it
must
be
,
"
Wegg
retorted
.
<EOS>
"
Next
(
to
clear
the
ground
before
coming
to
business
)
,
you
've
placed
in
this
yard
a
skulking
,
a
sneaking
,
and
a
sniffing
,
menial
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
had
n't
a
cold
in
his
head
when
I
sent
him
here
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Boffin
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Wegg
<EOS>
,
"
I
warn
you
not
to
attempt
a
joke
with
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Venus
interposed
,
and
remarked
that
he
conceived
Mr.
Boffin
to
have
taken
the
description
literally
;
the
rather
,
forasmuch
as
he
,
Mr.
Venus
,
had
himself
supposed
the
menial
to
have
contracted
an
affliction
or
a
habit
of
the
nose
,
involving
a
serious
drawback
on
the
pleasures
of
social
intercourse
,
until
he
had
discovered
that
Mr.
Wegg
's
description
of
him
was
to
be
accepted
as
merely
figurative
.
  
<EOS>
"
Any
how
,
and
every
how
,
"
said
Wegg
,
"
he
has
been
planted
here
,
and
he
is
here
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
wo
n't
have
him
here
.
<EOS>
So
I
call
upon
Boffin
,
before
I
say
another
word
,
to
fetch
him
in
and
send
him
packing
to
the
right
-
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
unsuspecting
Sloppy
was
at
that
moment
airing
his
many
buttons
within
view
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
after
a
short
interval
of
impassive
discomfiture
,
opened
the
window
and
beckoned
him
to
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
call
upon
Boffin
,
"
said
Wegg
,
with
one
arm
a
-
kimbo
and
his
head
on
one
side
,
like
a
bullying
counsel
pausing
for
an
answer
from
a
witness
,
"
to
inform
that
menial
that
I
am
Master
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
humble
obedience
,
when
the
button
-
gleaming
Sloppy
entered
Mr.
Boffin
said
to
him
:
"
Sloppy
,
my
fine
fellow
,
Mr.
Wegg
is
Master
here
.
<EOS>
He
does
n't
want
you
,
and
you
are
to
go
from
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
good
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
severely
stipulated
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
good
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
Sloppy
stared
,
with
both
his
eyes
and
all
his
buttons
,
and
his
mouth
wide
open
;
but
was
without
loss
of
time
escorted
forth
by
Silas
Wegg
,
pushed
out
at
the
yard
gate
by
the
shoulders
,
and
locked
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
atomspear
,
"
said
Wegg
,
stumping
back
into
the
room
again
,
a
little
reddened
by
his
late
exertion
,
"
is
now
freer
for
the
purposes
of
respiration
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
sir
,
take
a
chair
.
<EOS>
Boffin
,
you
may
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
still
with
his
hands
ruefully
stuck
in
his
pockets
,
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
settle
,
shrunk
into
a
small
compass
,
and
eyed
the
potent
Silas
with
conciliatory
looks
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
gentleman
,
"
said
Silas
Wegg
,
pointing
out
Venus
,
"
this
gentleman
,
Boffin
,
is
more
milk
and
watery
with
you
than
I
'll
be
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
n't
borne
the
Roman
yoke
as
I
have
,
nor
yet
he
has
n't
been
required
to
pander
to
your
depraved
appetite
for
miserly
characters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
meant
,
<EOS>
my
dear
Wegg
---
"
Mr.
Boffin
was
beginning
,
when
Silas
stopped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
Boffin
!
<EOS>
Answer
when
you
're
called
upon
to
answer
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
you
've
got
quite
enough
to
do
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
're
aware
 
---
are
you
---
that
you
're
in
possession
of
property
to
which
you
've
no
right
at
all
?
<EOS>
Are
you
aware
of
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Venus
tells
me
so
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
glancing
towards
him
for
any
support
he
could
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
so
,
"
returned
Silas
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
here
's
my
hat
,
Boffin
,
and
here
's
my
walking
-
stick
.
<EOS>
Trifle
with
me
,
and
instead
of
making
a
bargain
with
you
,
I
'll
put
on
my
hat
and
take
up
my
walking
-
stick
,
and
go
out
,
and
make
a
bargain
with
the
rightful
owner
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
do
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
returned
Mr.
Boffin
,
leaning
forward
in
alarmed
appeal
,
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
"
that
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
trifle
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
I
have
said
so
to
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
certainly
have
,
sir
,
"
said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
too
milk
and
watery
with
our
friend

you
are
indeed

"
 
remonstrated
Silas
,
with
a
disapproving
shake
of
his
wooden
head
.
"
<EOS>
Then
at
once
you
confess
yourself
desirous
to
come
to
terms
,
do
you
,
Boffin
?
<EOS>
Before
you
answer
,
keep
this
hat
well
in
your
mind
,
and
also
this
walking
-
stick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
willing

Wegg

to
come
to
terms

"
Willing
wo
n't
do

Boffin

<EOS>
I
wo
n't
take
willing

Are
you
desirous
to
come
to
terms
?
<EOS>
Do
you
ask
to
be
allowed
as
a
favor
to
come
to
terms
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
again
planted
his
arm
,
and
put
his
head
on
one
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
what
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
inexorable
Wegg
:
"
I
wo
n't
take
yes
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
it
out
of
you
in
full

Boffin

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
cried
that
unfortunate
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
worrited
!
<EOS>
I
ask
to
be
allowed
to
come
to
terms
,
supposing
your
document
is
all
correct
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
be
afraid
of
that
,
"
said
Silas
,
poking
his
head
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
be
satisfied
by
seeing
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
will
show
it
you
,
and
I
'll
hold
you
the
while
.
<EOS>
Then
you
want
to
know
what
the
terms
are
.
<EOS>
Is
that
about
the
sum
and
substance
of
it
?
<EOS>
Will
you
or
wo
n't
you
answer
,
Boffin
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
he
had
paused
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
cried
that
unfortunate
gentleman
again
,
"
I
am
worrited
to
that
degree
that
I
'm
almost
off
my
head
.
<EOS>
You
hurry
me
so
.
<EOS>
Be
so
good
as
name
the
terms
,
Wegg

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
mark
,
Boffin
,
"
returned
Silas
:
"
<EOS>
Mark
'em
well
,
because
they
're
the
lowest
terms
and
the
only
terms
.
<EOS>
You
'll
throw
your
Mound
(
the
little
Mound
as
comes
to
you
any
way
)
into
the
general
estate
,
and
then
you
'll
divide
the
whole
property
into
three
parts
,
and
you
'll
keep
one
and
hand
over
the
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
's
mouth
screwed
itself
up
,
as
Mr.
Boffin
's
face
lengthened
itself
;
Mr.
Venus
not
having
been
prepared
for
such
a
rapacious
demand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
wait
a
bit
,
Boffin
,
<EOS>
"
Wegg
proceeded
,
"
there
's
something
more
.
<EOS>
You
've
been
a
squandering
this
property
---
laying
some
of
it
out
on
yourself
.
<EOS>
That
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
You
've
bought
a
house

<EOS>
You
'll
be
charged
for
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
ruined
,
Wegg
!
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
faintly
protested
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
wait
a
bit
,
Boffin
;
there
's
something
more
.
<EOS>
You
'll
leave
me
in
sole
custody
of
these
Mounds
till
they
're
all
laid
low
.
<EOS>
If
any
waluables
should
be
found
in
'em
,
I
'll
take
care
of
such
waluables
.
<EOS>
You
'll
produce
your
contract
for
the
sale
of
the
Mounds
,
that
we
may
know
to
a
penny
what
they
're
worth
,
and
you
'll
make
out
likewise
an
exact
list
of
all
the
other
property

<EOS>
When
the
Mounds
is
cleared
away
to
the
last
shovel
-
full
,
the
final
diwision
will
come
off
.

Dreadful
,
dreadful
,
dreadful
!
<EOS>
I
shall
die
in
a
workhouse
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
Golden
Dustman
,
with
his
hands
to
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
wait
a
bit
,
Boffin
;
there
's
something
more
.
<EOS>
You
've
been
unlawfully
ferreting
about
this
yard
.
<EOS>
You
've
been
seen
in
the
act
of
ferreting
about
this
yard
.
<EOS>
Two
pair
of
eyes
at
the
present
moment
brought
to
bear
upon
you
,
have
seen
you
dig
up
a
Dutch
bottle
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
mine
,
Wegg
,
"
protested
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
put
it
there
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
in
it
,
Boffin
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
gold
,
not
silver
,
not
bank
notes
,
not
jewels
,
nothing
that
you
could
turn
into
money
,
Wegg
;
upon
my
soul
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Prepared
,
Mr.
Venus
,
"
said
Wegg
,
turning
to
his
partner
with
a
knowing
and
superior
air
,
"
for
an
ewasive
answer
on
the
part
of
our
dusty
friend
here
,
I
have
hit
out
a
little
idea
which
I
think
will
meet
your
views
.
<EOS>
We
charge
that
bottle
against
our
dusty
friend
at
a
thousand
pound
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
drew
a
deep
groan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
wait
a
bit
,
Boffin
;
there
's
something
more
.
<EOS>
In
your
employment
is
an
under
-
handed
sneak
,
named
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
answer
to
have
him
about
,
while
this
business
of
ours
is
about
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
discharged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rokesmith
is
already
discharged
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
speaking
in
a
muffled
voice
,
with
his
hands
before
his
face
,
as
he
rocked
himself
on
the
settle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Already
discharged
,
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
returned
Wegg
,
surprised
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Then
,
Boffin
,
I
believe
there
's
nothing
more
at
present
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
unlucky
gentleman
continuing
to
rock
himself
to
and
fro
,
and
to
utter
an
occasional
moan
,
Mr.
Venus
besought
him
to
bear
up
against
his
reverses
,
and
to
take
time
to
accustom
himself
to
the
thought
of
his
new
position
.
<EOS>
But
,
his
taking
time
was
exactly
the
thing
of
all
others
that
Silas
Wegg
could
not
be
induced
to
hear
of
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
or
no
,
and
no
half
measures
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
motto
which
that
obdurate
person
many
times
repeated
;
shaking
his
fist
at
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
rate
person
many
times
repeated
;
shaking
his
fist
at
Mr.
Boffin
,
and
pegging
his
motto
into
the
floor
with
his
wooden
leg
,
in
a
threatening
and
alarming
manner
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
Mr.
Boffin
entreated
to
be
allowed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
grace
,
and
a
cooling
walk
of
that
duration
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
With
some
difficulty
Mr.
Wegg
granted
this
great
favour
,
but
only
on
condition
that
he
accompanied
Mr.
Boffin
in
his
walk
,
as
not
knowing
what
he
might
fraudulently
unearth
if
he
were
left
to
himself
.
<EOS>
A
more
absurd
sight
,
than
Mr.
Boffin
in
his
mental
irritation
trotting
very
nimbly
,
and
Mr.
Wegg
hopping
after
him
with
great
exertion
,
eager
to
watch
the
slightest
turn
of
an
eyelash
,
lest
it
should
indicate
a
spot
rich
with
some
secret
,
assuredly
had
never
been
seen
in
the
shadow
of
the
Mounds
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
was
much
distressed
when
the
quarter
of
an
hour
expired
,
and
came
hopping
in
,
a
very
bad
second
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
myself
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr.
Boffin
,
flouncing
on
the
settle
in
a
forlorn
manner
,
with
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
,
as
if
his
pockets
had
sunk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
's
the
good
of
my
pretending
to
stand
out
,
when
I
ca
n't
help
myself
?
<EOS>
I
must
give
in
to
the
terms
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
like
to
see
the
document
.
"
  
<EOS>
Wegg
,
who
was
all
for
clinching
the
nail
he
had
so
strongly
driven
home
,
announced
that
Boffin
should
see
it
without
an
hour
's
delay
.
<EOS>
Taking
him
into
custody
for
that
purpose
,
or
overshadowing
him
as
if
he
really
were
his
Evil
Genius
in
visible
form
,
Mr.
Wegg
clapped
Mr.
Boffin
's
hat
upon
the
back
of
his
head
,
and
walked
him
out
by
the
arm
,
asserting
a
proprietorship
over
his
soul
and
body
that
was
at
once
more
grim
and
more
ridiculous
than
anything
in
Mr.
Venus
's
rare
collection
.
<EOS>
That
light
-
haired
gentleman
followed
close
upon
their
heels
,
at
least
backing
up
Mr.
Boffin
in
a
literal
sense
if
he
had
not
had
recent
opportunities
of
doing
so
spiritually
;
while
Mr.
Boffin
,
trotting
on
as
hard
as
he
could
trot
,
involved
Silas
Wegg
in
frequent
collisions
with
the
public
,
much
as
a
pre
-
occupied
blind
man
's
dog
may
be
seen
to
involve
his
master
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
they
reached
Mr.
Venus
's
establishment
,
somewhat
heated
by
the
nature
of
their
progress
thither
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
especially
,
was
in
a
flaming
glow
,
and
stood
in
the
little
shop
,
panting
and
mopping
his
head
with
his
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
speechless
for
several
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mr.
Venus
,
who
had
left
the
duelling
frogs
to
fight
it
out
in
his
absence
by
candlelight
for
the
public
delectation
,
put
the
shutters
up
.
<EOS>
When
all
was
snug
,
and
the
shop
-
door
fastened
,
he
said
to
the
perspiring
Silas
:
"
I
suppose
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
we
may
now
produce
the
paper
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
on
a
minute
,
sir
,
"
replied
that
discreet
character
;
"
hold
on
a
minute
.
<EOS>
Will
you
obligingly
shove
that
box
---
which
you
mentioned
on
a
former
occasion
as
containing
miscellanies
---
towards
me
in
the
midst
of
the
shop
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
did
as
he
was
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
"
said
Silas
,
looking
about
:
"
ve
---
<EOS>
ry
good
.
<EOS>
Will
you
hand
me
that
chair
,
sir
,
to
put
a
-
top
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Venus
handed
him
the
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
Boffin
,
"
said
Wegg
,
"
mount
up
here
and
take
your
seat
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
as
if
he
were
about
to
have
his
portrait
painted
,
or
to
be
electrified
,
or
to
be
made
a
Freemason
,
or
to
be
placed
at
any
other
solitary
disadvantage
,
ascended
the
rostrum
prepared
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr.
Venus
,
"
said
Silas
,
taking
off
his
coat
,
"
when
I
catches
our
friend
here
<EOS>
round
the
arms
and
body
,
and
pins
him
tight
to
the
back
of
the
chair
<EOS>
,
you
may
show
him
what
he
wants
to
see
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
open
it
and
hold
it
well
up
in
one
hand
,
sir
,
and
a
candle
in
the
other
,
he
can
read
it
charming
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
seemed
rather
inclined
to
object
to
these
precautionary
arrangements
,
but
,
being
immediately
embraced
by
Wegg
,
resigned
himself
.
<EOS>
Venus
then
produced
the
document
,
and
Mr.
Boffin
slowly
spelt
it
out
aloud
:
so
very
slowly
,
that
Wegg
,
who
was
holding
him
in
the
chair
with
the
grip
of
a
wrestler
,
became
again
exceedingly
the
worse
for
his
exertions
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Say
when
you
've
put
it
safe
back
,
Mr.
Venus
,
"
 
he
uttered
with
difficulty
,
"
for
the
strain
of
this
is
terrimenjious
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
document
was
restored
to
its
place
;
and
Wegg
,
whose
uncomfortable
attitude
had
been
that
of
a
very
persevering
man
unsuccessfully
attempting
to
stand
upon
his
head
,
took
a
seat
to
recover
himself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
for
his
part
,
made
no
attempt
to
come
down
,
but
remained
aloft
disconsolate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Boffin
!
<EOS>
"
said
Wegg
,
as
soon
as
he
was
in
a
condition
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
Wegg
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
meekly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
doubts
about
it
,
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
No
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
None
,
"
was
the
slow
and
sad
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
take
care
,
you
,
"
said
Wegg
,
"
that
you
stick
to
your
conditions
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
if
on
this
auspicious
occasion
,
you
should
happen
to
have
a
drop
of
anything
not
quite
so
mild
as
tea
in
the
'
ouse
,
I
think
I
'd
take
the
friendly
liberty
of
asking
you
for
a
specimen
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
reminded
of
the
duties
of
hospitality
,
produced
some
rum
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
the
inquiry
,
"
Will
you
mix
it
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
"
<EOS>
that
gentleman
pleasantly
rejoined
,
"
I
think
not
,
sir
.
<EOS>
On
so
auspicious
an
occasion
,
I
prefer
to
take
it
in
the
form
of
a
Gum
-
Tickler
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
declining
rum
,
being
still
elevated
on
his
pedestal
,
was
in
a
convenient
position
to
be
addressed
.
<EOS>
Wegg
having
eyed
him
with
an
impudent
air
at
leisure
addressed
him
,
therefore
,
while
refreshing
himself
with
his
dram
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bof
---
fin
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Wegg
,
"
he
answered
,
coming
out
of
a
fit
of
abstraction
,
with
a
sigh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
n't
mentioned
one
thing
,
because
it
's
a
detail
that
comes
of
course
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
followed
up
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
kept
under
inspection
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
quite
understand
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
sneered
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
's
your
wits
,
Boffin
?
<EOS>
Till
the
Mounds
is
down
and
this
business
completed
,
you
're
accountable
for
all
the
property
,
recollect
.
<EOS>
Consider
yourself
accountable
to
me
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
here
being
too
milk
and
watery
with
you
<EOS>
,
I
am
the
boy
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
a
-
thinking
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
a
tone
of
despondency
,
"
that
I
must
keep
the
knowledge
from
my
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
knowledge
of
the
diwision
,
d'ye
mean
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Wegg
,
helping
himself
to
a
third
Gum
-
Tickler
<EOS>
---
for
he
had
already
taken
a
second
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
If
she
was
to
die
first
of
us
two
she
might
then
think
all
her
life
,
poor
thing
,
that
I
had
got
the
rest
of
the
fortune
still
,
and
was
saving
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
Boffin
,
"
returned
Wegg
,
shaking
his
head
sagaciously
,
and
bestowing
a
wooden
wink
upon
him
,
"
that
you
've
found
out
some
account
of
some
old
chap
,
supposed
to
be
a
Miser
,
who
got
himself
the
credit
of
having
much
more
money
than
he
had
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
n't
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
you
see
,
Wegg
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
feelingly
represented
to
him
:
"
do
n't
you
see
?
<EOS>
My
old
lady
has
got
so
used
to
the
property
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
such
a
hard
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
see
it
at
all
,
"
blustered
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have
as
much
as
I
shall
.
<EOS>
And
who
are
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
then
,
again
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
gently
represented
;
"
my
old
lady
has
very
upright
principles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
's
your
old
lady
,
"
returned
Wegg
,
"
to
set
herself
up
for
having
uprighter
principles
than
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
seemed
a
little
less
patient
at
this
point
than
at
any
other
of
the
negotiations
.
<EOS>
But
he
commanded
himself
,
and
said
tamely
enough
:
"
I
think
it
must
be
kept
from
my
old
lady
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Wegg
,
contemptuously
,
though
,
perhaps
,
perceiving
some
hint
of
danger
otherwise
,
"
keep
it
from
your
old
lady
.
<EOS>
I
ai
n't
going
to
tell
her
.
<EOS>
I
can
have
you
under
close
inspection
without
that
.
<EOS>
I
'm
as
good
a
man
as
you
,
and
better
.
<EOS>
Ask
me
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Give
me
the
run
of
your
'
ouse
.
<EOS>
I
was
good
enough
for
you
and
your
old
lady
once
,
when
I
helped
you
out
with
your
old
lady
once
,
when
I
helped
you
out
with
your
weal
and
hammers
.
<EOS>
Was
there
no
Miss
Elizabeth
,
Master
George
,
Aunt
Jane
,
and
Uncle
Parker
,
before
you
two
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Gently
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
gently
,
"
Venus
urged
.
  
<EOS>
"
Milk
and
water
-
erily
you
mean
,
sir
,
"
he
returned
,
with
some
little
thickness
of
speech
,
in
consequence
of
the
Gum
-
Ticklers
having
tickled
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
him
under
inspection
,
and
I
'll
inspect
him
.
   
<EOS>
`
`
Along
the
line
the
signal
ran
  
<EOS>
England
expects
as
this
present
man
  
Will
keep
Boffin
to
his
duty
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
---
Boffin
,
I
'll
see
you
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
descended
with
an
air
of
resignation
,
and
gave
himself
up
,
after
taking
friendly
leave
of
Mr.
Venus
.
<EOS>
Once
more
,
Inspector
and
Inspected
went
through
the
streets
together
,
and
so
arrived
at
Mr.
Boffin
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
But
even
there
,
when
Mr.
Boffin
had
given
his
keeper
good
-
night
,
and
had
let
himself
in
with
his
key
,
and
had
softly
closed
the
door
,
even
there
<EOS>
and
then
,
the
all
-
powerful
Silas
must
needs
claim
another
assertion
of
his
newly
-
asserted
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bof
---
fin
!
"
<EOS>
he
called
through
the
keyhole
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Wegg
,
"
was
the
reply
through
the
same
channel
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
out
.
<EOS>
Show
yourself
again
.
<EOS>
Let
's
have
another
look
at
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
---
<EOS>
ah
,
how
fallen
from
the
high
estate
of
his
honest
simplicity
!
<EOS>
---
opened
the
door
and
obeyed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
in
.
<EOS>
You
may
get
to
bed
now
,
"
said
Wegg
,
with
a
grin
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
hardly
closed
,
when
he
again
called
through
the
keyhole
:
  
"
Bof
---
fin
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
time
Silas
made
no
reply
,
but
laboured
with
a
will
at
turning
an
imaginary
grindstone
outside
the
keyhole
,
while
Mr.
Boffin
stooped
at
it
within
;
he
then
laughed
silently
,
and
stumped
home
.
   
<EOS>
A
RUNWAY
MATCH
.
 
<EOS>
Cherubic
Pa
arose
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
from
beside
majestic
Ma
,
one
morning
early
,
having
a
holiday
before
him
.
<EOS>
Pa
and
the
lovely
woman
had
a
rather
particular
appointment
to
keep
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
Pa
and
the
lovely
woman
were
not
going
out
together
.
<EOS>
Bella
was
up
before
four
,
but
had
no
bonnet
on
.
<EOS>
she
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
---
was
sitting
on
the
bottom
stair
,
in
fact
---
to
receive
Pa
when
he
came
down
,
but
her
only
object
seemed
to
be
to
get
Pa
well
out
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
breakfast
is
ready
,
sir
,
"
whispered
Bella
,
after
greeting
him
with
a
hug
,
"
and
all
you
have
to
do
,
is
,
to
eat
it
up
and
drink
it
up
,
and
escape
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
feel
,
Pa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
the
best
of
my
judgment
,
like
a
housebreaker
new
to
the
business
,
my
dear
,
who
ca
n't
make
himself
quite
comfortable
till
he
is
off
the
premises
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
tucked
her
arm
in
his
with
a
merry
noiseless
laugh
,
and
they
went
down
to
the
kitchen
on
tiptoe
;
she
stopping
on
every
separate
stair
to
put
the
tip
of
her
forefinger
on
her
rosy
lips
,
and
then
lay
it
on
his
lips
,
according
to
her
favourite
petting
way
of
kissing
Pa.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
feel
,
my
love
?
"
asked
R.
W.
,
as
she
gave
him
his
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
as
if
the
Fortune
-
teller
was
coming
true
,
dear
Pa
,
and
the
fair
little
man
was
turning
out
as
was
predicted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ho
!
<EOS>
Only
the
fair
little
man
?
"
said
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
put
another
of
those
finger
-
seals
upon
his
lips
,
and
then
said
,
kneeling
down
by
him
as
he
sat
at
table
:
"
<EOS>
Now
,
look
here
,
sir
.
<EOS>
If
you
keep
well
up
to
the
mark
this
day
,
what
do
you
think
you
deserve
?
<EOS>
What
did
I
promise
you
should
have
,
if
you
were
good
,
upon
a
certain
occasion
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
I
do
n't
remember
,
Precious
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
do
,
though
.
<EOS>
Was
n't
it
one
of
these
beau
---
tiful
tresses
?
"
with
his
caressing
hand
upon
her
hair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
it
,
too
!
"
returned
Bella
,
pretending
to
pout
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
!
<EOS>
Do
you
know
,
sir
,
that
the
Fortune
-
teller
would
give
five
thousand
guineas
(
if
it
was
quite
convenient
to
him
,
which
it
is
n't
)
for
the
lovely
piece
I
have
cut
off
for
you
?
<EOS>
You
can
form
no
idea
,
sir
,
of
the
number
of
times
he
kissed
quite
a
scrubby
little
piece
---
in
comparison
 
---
that
I
cut
off
for
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
wears
it
,
too
,
round
his
neck
,
I
can
tell
you
!
<EOS>
Near
his
heart
!
"
said
Bella
,
nodding
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
very
near
his
heart
!
<EOS>
However
,
you
have
been
a
good
,
good
boy
,
and
you
are
the
best
of
all
the
dearest
boys
that
ever
were
,
this
morning
,
and
here
's
the
chain
I
have
made
of
it
,
Pa
,
and
you
must
let
me
put
it
<EOS>
round
your
neck
with
my
own
loving
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
pa
bent
his
head
,
she
cried
over
him
a
little
,
and
then
said
(
after
having
stopped
to
dry
her
eyes
on
his
white
waistcoat
,
the
discovery
of
which
incongruous
circumstance
made
her
laugh
)
:
"
Now
,
darling
Pa
,
give
me
your
hands
that
I
may
fold
them
together
,
and
do
you
say
after
me
:
---
<EOS>
My
little
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
little
Bella
,
"
repeated
Pa.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
fond
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
fond
of
you
,
my
darling
,
"
said
Pa.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
n't
say
anything
not
dictated
to
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
You
dare
n't
do
it
in
your
responses
at
Church
,
and
you
must
n't
do
it
in
your
responses
out
of
Church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
withdraw
the
darling
,
"
said
Pa.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
pious
boy
!
<EOS>
Now
again
:
---
You
were
always
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
always
,
"
repeated
Pa.
  
<EOS>
"
A
vexatious
---
"
  
"
No
you
were
n't
,
"
said
Pa.
  
<EOS>
"
A
vexatious
(
do
you
hear
,
sir
?
)
,
a
vexatious
,
capricious
,
thankless
,
troublesome
,
Animal
;
but
I
hope
you
'll
do
better
in
the
time
to
come
,
and
I
bless
you
and
forgive
you
!
"
<EOS>
Here
,
she
quite
forgot
that
it
was
Pa
's
turn
to
make
the
responses
,
and
clung
to
his
neck
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
Pa
,
if
you
knew
how
much
I
think
this
morning
of
what
you
told
me
once
,
about
the
first
time
of
our
seeing
old
Mr.
Harmon
,
when
I
stamped
and
screamed
and
beat
you
with
my
detestable
little
bonnet
!
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
had
been
stamping
and
screaming
and
beating
you
with
my
hateful
little
bonnet
,
ever
since
I
was
born
,
darling
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
your
bonnets
,
they
have
always
been
nice
bonnets
,
for
they
have
always
become
you
---
or
you
have
become
them
;
perhaps
it
was
that
---
at
every
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
hurt
you
much
,
poor
little
Pa
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Bella
,
laughing
(
notwithstanding
her
repentance
)
,
with
fantastic
pleasure
in
the
picture
,
"
when
I
beat
you
with
my
bonnet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
child
.
<EOS>
Would
n't
have
hurt
a
fly
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
but
I
am
afraid
I
should
n't
have
beat
you
at
all
,
unless
I
had
meant
to
hurt
you
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
Did
I
pinch
your
legs
,
Pa
?
"
  
"
Not
much
,
my
dear
;
but
I
think
it
's
almost
time
<EOS>
I
---
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
"
cried
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
go
on
chattering
,
you
'll
be
taken
alive
.
<EOS>
Fly
,
Pa
,
fly
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
they
went
softly
up
the
kitchen
stairs
on
tiptoe
,
and
Bella
with
her
light
hand
softly
removed
the
fastenings
of
the
house
door
,
and
Pa
,
having
received
a
parting
hug
,
made
off
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
gone
a
little
way
,
he
looked
back
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
Bella
set
another
of
those
finger
seals
upon
the
air
,
and
thrust
out
her
little
foot
expressive
of
the
mark
.
<EOS>
Pa
,
in
appropriate
action
,
expressed
fidelity
to
the
mark
,
and
made
off
as
fast
as
he
could
go
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
walked
thoughtfully
in
the
garden
for
an
hour
and
more
,
and
then
,
returning
to
the
bedroom
where
Lavvy
the
Irrepressible
still
slumbered
,
put
on
a
little
bonnet
of
quiet
,
but
on
the
whole
of
sly
appearance
,
which
she
had
yesterday
made
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
for
a
walk
,
Lavvy
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
stooped
down
and
kissed
her
.
<EOS>
The
Irrepressible
,
with
a
bounce
in
the
bed
,
and
a
remark
that
it
was
n't
time
to
get
up
yet
,
relapsed
into
unconsciousness
,
if
she
had
come
out
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Behold
Bella
tripping
along
the
streets
,
the
dearest
girl
afoot
under
the
summer
sun
!
<EOS>
Behold
Pa
waiting
for
Bella
behind
a
pump
,
at
least
three
miles
from
the
parental
roof
-
tree
.
<EOS>
Behold
Bella
and
Pa
aboard
an
early
steamboat
bound
for
Greenwich
.
  
<EOS>
Were
they
expected
at
Greenwich
?
<EOS>
Probably
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
was
on
the
pier
looking
out
,
about
a
couple
of
hours
before
the
coaly
(
<EOS>
but
to
him
gold
-
dusty
)
<EOS>
little
steamboat
got
her
steam
up
in
London
.
<EOS>
Probably
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
when
he
descried
them
on
board
.
<EOS>
Probably
.
<EOS>
At
least
,
Bella
no
sooner
stepped
ashore
than
she
took
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
's
arm
,
without
evincing
surprise
,
and
the
two
walked
away
together
with
an
ethereal
air
of
happiness
which
,
as
it
were
,
wafted
up
from
the
earth
and
drew
after
them
a
gruff
and
glum
old
pensioner
to
see
it
out
.
<EOS>
Two
wooden
legs
had
this
gruff
and
glum
old
pensioner
,
and
,
a
minute
before
Bella
stepped
out
of
the
boat
,
and
drew
that
confiding
little
arm
of
hers
through
Rokesmith
's
,
he
had
had
no
object
in
life
but
tobacco
,
and
not
enough
of
that
.
<EOS>
Stranded
was
Gruff
and
Glum
in
a
harbour
of
everlasting
mud
,
when
all
in
an
instant
Bella
floated
him
,
and
away
he
went
.
  
<EOS>
Say
,
cherubic
parent
taking
the
lead
,
in
what
direction
do
we
steer
first
?
<EOS>
With
some
such
inquiry
in
his
thoughts
,
Gruff
and
Glum
,
stricken
by
so
sudden
an
interest
that
he
perked
his
neck
and
looked
over
the
intervening
people
,
<EOS>
as
if
he
were
trying
to
stand
on
tiptoe
with
his
two
wooden
legs
,
took
an
observation
of
R.
W.
<EOS>
There
was
no
"
first
"
in
the
case
,
Gruff
and
Glum
made
out
;
the
cherubic
parent
was
bearing
down
and
crowding
on
direct
for
Greenwich
church
,
to
see
his
relations
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
Gruff
and
Glum
,
though
most
events
acted
on
him
simply
as
tobacco
-
stoppers
,
pressing
down
and
condensing
the
quids
within
him
,
might
be
imagined
to
trace
a
family
resemblance
between
the
cherubs
in
the
church
architecture
,
and
the
cherub
in
the
white
waistcoat
.
<EOS>
Some
remembrance
of
old
Valentines
,
wherein
a
cherub
,
less
appropriately
attired
for
a
proverbially
uncertain
climate
,
had
been
seen
conducting
lovers
to
the
alter
,
might
have
been
fancied
to
inflame
the
ardour
of
his
timber
toes
.
<EOS>
Be
it
as
it
might
,
he
gave
his
moorings
the
slip
,
and
followed
in
chase
.
  
<EOS>
The
cherub
went
before
,
all
beaming
smiles
;
Bella
and
John
Rokesmith
followed
;
Gruff
and
Glum
stuck
to
them
like
wax
.
<EOS>
For
years
,
the
wings
of
his
mind
had
gone
to
look
after
the
legs
of
his
body
;
but
Bella
had
brought
them
back
for
him
per
steamer
,
and
they
were
spread
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
slow
sailer
on
a
wind
of
happiness
,
but
he
took
a
cross
cut
for
the
rendezvous
,
and
pegged
away
as
if
he
were
scoring
furiously
at
cribbage
.
<EOS>
When
the
shadow
of
the
church
-
porch
swallowed
them
up
,
victorious
Gruff
and
Glum
likewise
presented
himself
to
be
swallowed
up
.
<EOS>
And
by
this
time
the
cherubic
parent
was
so
fearful
of
surprise
,
that
,
but
for
the
two
wooden
legs
on
which
Gruff
and
Glum
was
reassuringly
mounted
,
his
conscience
might
have
introduced
,
in
the
person
of
that
pensioner
,
his
own
stately
lady
disguised
,
arrived
at
Greenwich
in
a
car
and
griffins
,
like
the
spiteful
Fairy
at
the
christenings
of
the
Princesses
,
to
do
something
dreadful
to
the
marriage
service
.
<EOS>
And
truly
he
had
a
momentary
reason
to
be
pale
of
face
,
and
to
whisper
to
Bella
,
"
You
do
n't
think
that
can
be
your
Ma
;
do
you
,
my
dear
?
"
<EOS>
on
account
of
a
mysterious
rustling
and
a
stealthy
movement
somewhere
in
the
remote
neighbourhood
of
the
organ
,
though
it
was
gone
directly
and
was
heard
no
more
.
<EOS>
Albeit
it
was
heard
of
afterwards
,
as
will
afterwards
be
read
in
this
veracious
register
of
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
Who
taketh
?
<EOS>
I
,
John
,
and
so
do
I
,
Bella
.
<EOS>
Who
giveth
?
<EOS>
I.
,
R.
W.
Forasmuch
,
Gruff
and
Glum
,
as
John
and
Bella
have
consented
together
in
holy
wedlock
,
you
may
(
in
short
)
consider
it
done
,
and
withdraw
your
two
wooden
legs
from
this
temple
.
<EOS>
To
the
foregoing
purport
,
the
Minister
speaking
,
as
directed
by
the
Rubric
,
to
the
People
,
selectly
represented
in
the
present
instance
by
G.

G.
above
mentioned
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
the
church
-
porch
having
swallowed
up
Bella
Wilfer
for
ever
and
ever
,
had
it
not
in
its
power
to
relinquish
that
young
woman
,
but
slid
into
the
happy
sunlight
,
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
instead
.

And
long
on
the
bright
steps
stood
Gruff
and
Glum
,
looking
after
the
pretty
bride
,
with
a
narcotic
consciousness
of
having
dreamed
a
dream
.
  
<EOS>
After
which
,
Bella
took
out
from
her
pocket
a
little
letter
,
and
read
it
aloud
to
Pa
and
John
;
this
being
a
true
copy
of
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Ma
,
  
"
I
hope
you
wo
n't
be
angry
,
but
I
am
most
happily
married
to
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
,
who
loves
me
better
than
I
can
ever
deserve
,
except
by
loving
him
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
best
not
to
mention
it
beforehand
,
in
case
it
should
cause
any
little
difference
at
home
.
<EOS>
Please
tell
darling
Pa.
With
love
to
Lavvy
,
  
"
Ever
dearest
Ma
,
  
Your
affectionate
daughter
,
  
Bella
  
<EOS>
(
P.S.
---
Rokesmith
)
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
John
Rokesmith
put
the
queen
's
countenance
on
the
letter
 
---
when
had
Her
Gracious
Majesty
looked
so
benign
as
on
that
blessed
morning
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
then
Bella
popped
it
into
the
post
-
office
,
and
said
merrily
,
"
Now
,
dearest
Pa
,
you
are
safe
,
and
will
never
be
taken
alive
!
"
  
<EOS>
Pa
was
,
at
first
,
in
the
stirred
depths
of
his
conscience
,
so
far
from
sure
of
being
safe
yet
,
that
he
made
out
majestic
matrons
lurking
in
ambush
among
the
harmless
trees
of
Greenwich
Park
,
and
seemed
to
see
a
stately
countenance
tied
up
in
a
well
-
known
pocket
-
handkerchief
glooming
down
at
him
from
a
window
of
the
Observatory
,
where
the
Familiars
of
the
Astronomer
Royal
nightly
outwatch
the
winking
stars
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
minutes
passing
on
and
no
Mrs.
Wilfer
in
the
flesh
appearing
,
he
became
more
confident
,
and
so
repaired
with
good
heart
and
appetite
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
's
cottage
on
Blackheath
,
where
breakfast
was
ready
.
  
<EOS>
A
modest
little
cottage
but
a
bright
and
a
fresh
,
and
on
the
snowy
tablecloth
the
prettiest
of
little
breakfasts
.
<EOS>
In
waiting
,
too
,
like
an
attendant
summer
breeze
,
a
fluttering
young
damsel
,
all
pink
and
ribbons
,
blushing
as
if
she
had
been
married
instead
of
Bella
,
and
yet
asserting
the
triumph
of
her
sex
over
both
John
and
Pa
,
in
an
exulting
and
exalted
flurry
:
as
who
should
say
,
"
This
is
what
you
must
all
come
to
,
gentlemen
,
when
we
choose
to
bring
you
to
book
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
same
young
damsel
was
Bella
's
serving
-
maid
,
and
unto
her
did
deliver
a
bunch
of
keys
,
commanding
treasures
in
the
way
of
drysaltery
,
groceries
,
jams
and
pickles
,
the
investigation
of
which
made
pastime
after
breakfast
,
when
Bella
declared
that
"
Pa
must
taste
everything
,
John
dear
,
or
it
will
never
be
lucky
,
"
and
when
Pa
had
all
sorts
of
things
poked
into
his
mouth
,
and
did
n't
quite
know
what
to
do
with
them
when
they
were
put
there
.
  
<EOS>
Then
they
,
all
three
,
out
for
a
charming
ride
,
and
for
a
charming
stroll
among
heath
in
bloom
,
and
there
behold
the
identical
Gruff
and
Glum
with
his
wooden
legs
horizontally
disposed
before
him
,
apparently
sitting
meditating
on
the
vicissitudes
of
life
!
<EOS>
To
whom
said
Bella
,
in
her
light
-
hearted
surprise
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
again
?
<EOS>
What
a
dear
old
pensioner
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
To
which
Gruff
and
Glum
responded
that
he
see
her
married
this
morning
,
my
Beauty
,
and
that
if
it
warn't
a
liberty
he
wished
her
ji
and
the
fairest
of
fair
wind
and
weather
;
<EOS>
further
,
in
a
general
way
requesting
to
know
what
cheer
?
and
scrambling
up
on
his
two
wooden
legs
to
salute
,
hat
in
hand
,
ship
-
shape
,
with
the
gallantry
of
a
man
-
of
-
warsman
and
a
heart
of
oak
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
pleasant
sight
,
in
the
midst
of
the
golden
bloom
,
to
see
this
salt
old
Gruff
and
Glum
,
waving
his
shovel
hat
at
Bella
,
while
his
thin
white
hair
flowed
free
,
as
if
she
had
once
more
launched
him
into
blue
water
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
charming
old
pensioner
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
and
I
am
so
happy
that
I
wish
I
could
make
you
happy
,
too
.
"
<EOS>
Answered
Gruff
and
Glum
,
"
<EOS>
Give
me
leave
to
kiss
your
hand
,
my
Lovely
,
and
it
's
done
!
"
<EOS>
So
it
was
done
to
the
general
contentment
;
and
if
Gruff
and
Glum
did
n't
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
splice
<EOS>
the
main
brace
,
it
was
not
for
want
of
the
means
of
inflicting
that
outrage
on
the
feelings
of
the
Infant
Bands
of
Hope
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
marriage
dinner
was
the
crowning
success
,
for
what
had
bride
and
bridegroom
plotted
to
do
,
but
to
have
and
to
hold
that
dinner
in
the
very
room
of
the
very
hotel
where
Pa
and
the
lovely
woman
had
once
dined
together
!
<EOS>
Bella
sat
between
Pa
and
John
,
and
divided
her
attentions
pretty
equally
,
but
felt
it
necessary
(
in
the
waiter
's
absence
before
dinner
)
to
remind
Pa
that
she
was
his
lovely
woman
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
well
aware
of
it
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
the
cherub
,
"
and
I
resign
you
willingly
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Willingly
,
sir
?
<EOS>
You
ought
to
be
brokenhearted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
should
be
,
my
dear
,
<EOS>
if
I
thought
that
I
was
going
to
lose
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
know
you
are
not
;
do
n't
you
,
poor
dear
Pa
?
<EOS>
You
know
that
you
have
only
made
a
new
relation
who
will
be
as
fond
of
you
and
as
thankful
to
you
---
for
my
sake
and
your
own
sake
both
---
  
as
I
am
;
do
n't
you
,
dear
little
Pa
?
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Pa
!
"
<EOS>
Bella
put
her
finger
on
her
own
lip
,
and
then
on
Pa
's
,
and
then
on
her
own
lip
again
,
and
then
on
her
husband
's
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
we
are
a
partnership
of
three
,
dear
<EOS>
Pa.
"
  
The
appearance
of
dinner
here
cut
Bella
short
in
one
of
her
disappearances
:
the
more
effectually
,
because
it
was
put
on
under
the
auspices
of
a
solemn
gentleman
in
black
clothes
and
a
white
cravat
,
who
looked
much
more
like
a
clergyman
than
the
clergyman
,
and
seemed
to
have
mounted
a
great
deal
higher
in
the
church
:
not
to
say
,
scaled
the
steeple
.
<EOS>
This
dignitary
,
conferring
in
secrecy
with
John
Rokesmith
on
the
subject
of
punch
and
wines
,
bent
his
head
as
though
stooping
to
the
Papistical
practice
of
receiving
auricular
confession
.
<EOS>
Likewise
,
on
John
's
offering
a
suggestion
which
did
n't
meet
his
views
,
his
face
became
overcast
and
reproachful
,
as
enjoining
penance
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
dinner
!
<EOS>
Specimens
of
all
the
fishes
that
swim
in
the
sea
,
surely
had
swum
their
way
to
it
,
and
if
samples
of
the
fishes
of
divers
colours
that
made
a
speech
in
the
Arabian
Nights
(
quite
a
ministerial
explanation
in
respect
of
cloudiness
)
,
and
then
jumped
out
of
the
frying
-
pan
,
were
not
to
be
recognized
,
it
was
only
because
they
had
all
become
of
one
hue
by
being
cooked
in
batter
among
the
whitebait
.
<EOS>
And
the
dishes
being
seasoned
with
Bliss
---
an
article
which
they
are
sometimes
out
of
,
at
Greenwich
---
were
of
perfect
flavour
,
and
the
golden
drinks
had
been
bottled
in
the
golden
age
and
hoarding
up
their
sparkles
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
The
best
of
it
was
,
that
Bella
and
John
and
the
cherub
had
made
a
covenant
that
they
would
not
reveal
to
mortal
eyes
any
appearance
<EOS>
whatever
of
being
a
wedding
party
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
supervising
dignitary
,
the
Archbishop
of
Greenwich
,
knew
this
as
well
as
if
he
had
performed
the
nuptial
ceremony
.
<EOS>
And
the
loftiness
with
which
his
Grace
entered
into
their
confidence
without
being
invited
,
and
insisted
on
a
show
of
keeping
the
waiters
out
of
it
,
was
the
crowning
glory
of
the
entertainment
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
innocent
young
waiter
of
a
slender
form
and
with
weakish
legs
,
as
yet
unversed
in
the
wiles
of
of
waiterhood
,
and
<EOS>
but
too
evidently
of
a
romantic
temperament
,
and
deeply
(
it
were
not
too
much
to
add
hopelessly
)
in
love
with
some
young
female
not
aware
of
his
merit
.
<EOS>
This
guileless
youth
,
descrying
the
position
of
affairs
,
which
even
his
innocence
could
not
mistake
,
limited
his
waiting
to
languishing
admiringly
against
the
sideboard
when
Bella
did
n't
want
anything
,
and
swooping
at
her
when
she
did
.
<EOS>
Him
,
his
Grace
the
Archbishop
perpetually
obstructed
,
cutting
him
out
with
his
elbow
in
the
moment
of
success
,
despatching
him
in
degrading
quest
of
melted
butter
,
and
,
when
by
any
chance
he
got
hold
of
any
dish
worth
having
,
bereaving
him
of
it
,
and
ordering
him
to
stand
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
excuse
him
,
madam
,
"
said
the
Archbishop
in
a
low
stately
voice
;
"
he
is
a
very
young
man
on
liking
,
and
we
do
n't
like
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
induced
John
Rokesmith
to
observe
---
by
way
of
making
the
thing
more
natural
<EOS>
---
"
Bella
,
my
love
,
this
is
so
much
more
successful
than
any
of
our
past
anniversaries
,
that
I
think
we
must
keep
our
future
anniversaries
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Whereunto
Bella
replied
,
with
probably
the
least
successful
attempt
at
looking
matronly
that
ever
was
seen
:
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
think
so
,
John
,
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
Archbishop
of
Greenwich
coughed
a
stately
cough
to
attract
the
attention
of
three
of
his
ministers
present
,
and
staring
at
them
,
seemed
to
say
:
"
I
call
upon
you
by
your
fealty
to
believe
this
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
his
own
hands
he
afterwards
put
on
the
dessert
,
as
remarking
to
the
three
guests
,
<EOS>
"
The
period
has
now
arrived
at
which
we
can
dispense
with
the
assistance
of
those
fellows
who
are
not
in
our
confidence
,
"
and
would
have
retired
with
complete
dignity
but
for
a
daring
action
issuing
from
the
misguided
brain
of
the
young
man
on
liking
.
<EOS>
He
finding
,
by
ill
-
fortune
,
a
piece
of
orange
flower
somewhere
in
the
lobbies
now
approached
undetected
with
the
same
in
a
fingerglass
,
and
placed
it
on
Bella
's
right
hand
.
<EOS>
The
Archbishop
instantly
ejected
and
excommunicated
him
;
but
the
thing
was
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
trust
,
madam
,
"
said
his
Grace
,
returning
alone
,
"
that
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
overlook
it
,
in
consideration
of
its
being
the
act
of
a
very
young
man
who
is
merely
here
on
liking
,
and
who
will
never
answer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
solemnly
bowed
and
retired
,
and
they
all
burst
into
laughter
,
long
and
merry
.
<EOS>
"
Disguise
is
of
no
use
,
"
said
Bella
;
 
"
they
all
find
me
out
;
I
think
it
must
be
,
Pa
and
John
dear
,
because
I
look
so
happy
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
husband
feeling
it
necessary
at
this
point
to
demand
one
of
those
mysterious
disappearances
on
Bella
's
part
,
she
dutifully
obeyed
;
 
saying
in
a
softened
voice
from
her
place
of
concealment
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
how
we
talked
about
the
ships
that
day
,
Pa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
.
"
  
"
Is
n't
it
strange
,
now
,
to
think
that
there
was
no
John
in
all
the
ships
,
Pa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Pa
!
<EOS>
Not
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
How
can
we
tell
what
coming
people
are
aboard
the
ships
that
may
be
sailing
to
us
now
from
the
unknown
seas
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
remaining
invisible
and
silent
,
her
father
remained
at
his
dessert
and
wine
,
until
he
remembered
it
was
time
for
him
to
get
home
to
Holloway
.
<EOS>
"
Though
I
positively
can
not
tear
myself
away
,
"
 
he
cherubically
added
,
"
---
it
would
be
a
sin
---
without
drinking
to
many
,
many
happy
returns
of
this
most
happy
day
.
"
  
"
Hear
!
<EOS>
ten
thousand
times
!
<EOS>
"
cried
John
.
<EOS>
"
I
fill
my
glass
and
my
precious
wife
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gentlemen
,
"
said
the
cherub
,
inaudibly
addressing
,
in
his
Anglo
-
Saxon
tendency
to
throw
his
feelings
into
the
form
of
a
speech
,
the
boys
down
below
,
who
were
bidding
against
each
other
to
put
their
heads
in
the
mud
for
sixpence
:
"
Gentlemen
---
and
Bella
and
John
---
  
<EOS>
you
will
readily
suppose
that
it
is
not
my
intention
to
trouble
you
with
many
observations
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
You
will
also
at
once
infer
the
nature
and
even
the
terms
of
the
toast
I
am
about
to
propose
on
the
present
occasion
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
---
and
Bella
and
John
---
  
<EOS>
the
present
occasion
is
an
occasion
fraught
with
feelings
that
I
can
not
trust
myself
to
express
.
<EOS>
But
gentlemen
---
and
Bella
and
John
 
---
for
the
part
I
have
had
in
it
,
for
the
confidence
you
have
placed
in
me
,
and
for
the
affectionate
good
-
nature
and
kindness
with
which
you
have
determined
not
to
find
me
in
the
way
,
when
I
am
well
aware
that
I
can
not
be
otherwise
than
in
it
more

less

I
do
most
heartily
thank
you

<EOS>
Gentlemen

Bella

my
love
to
you

and
may
we
meet
,
as
on
the
present
occasion
,
on
many
future
occasions

;
that
is
to
say

gentlemen

on
many
happy
returns

happy
occasion

"
  
<EOS>
Having
thus
concluded
his
address
,
the
amiable
cherub
embraced
his
daughter
,
and
took
his
flight
to
the
steamboat
which
was
to
convey
him
to
London
,
and
was
then
lying
at
the
floating
pier
,
doing
its
best
to
bump
the
same
to
bits
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
happy
couple
were
not
going
to
part
with
him
in
that
way
,
and
before
he
had
been
on
board
two
minutes
,
there
they
were
,
looking
down
at
him
from
the
wharf
above
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pa
,
dear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
,
beckoning
him
with
her
parasol
to
approach
the
side
,
and
bending
gracefully
to
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
darling
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
beat
you
much
with
that
horrid
little
bonnet
,
Pa
?
"
  
"
Nothing
to
speak
of
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
pinch
your
legs
,
Pa
?
"
  
"
Only
nicely
,
my
pet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
you
quite
forgive
me
,
Pa
?
<EOS>
Please
,
Pa
,
please
,
forgive
me
quite
!
"
<EOS>
Half
laughing
at
him
and
half
crying
to
him
,
Bella
besought
him
in
the
prettiest
manner
;
in
a
manner
so
engaging
and
so
playful
and
so
natural
,
that
her
cherubic
parent
made
a
coaxing
face
as
if
she
had
never
grown
up
,
and
said
,
"
What
a
silly
little
Mouse
it
is
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
forgive
me
that
,
and
everything
else
;
do
n't
you
,
Pa
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dearest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
n't
feel
solitary
or
neglected
,
going
away
by
yourself
;
 
do
you
,
Pa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
you
!
<EOS>
No
,
my
Life
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
dearest
pa
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
Take
her
away
,
my
dear
John
.
<EOS>
Take
her
home
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
she
leaning
on
her
husband
's
arm
,
they
turned
homeward
by
a
rosy
path
which
the
gracious
sun
struck
out
for
them
in
its
setting
.
<EOS>
And
O
there
are
days
in
this
life
,
worth
life
and
worth
death
.
<EOS>
And
O
what
a
bright
old
song
it
is
,
that
O
'
tis
love
,
'
tis
love
,
'
tis
love
that
makes
the

<EOS>
CONCERNING
THE
MENDICANT
'S
BRIDE
.
 
<EOS>
The
impressive
gloom
with
which
Mrs.
Wilfer
received
her
husband
on
his
return
from
the
wedding
,
knocked
so
hard
at
the
door
of
the
cherubic
conscience
,
and
likewise
so
impaired
the
firmness
of
the
cherubic
legs
,
that
the
culprit
's
tottering
condition
of
mind
and
body
might
have
roused
suspicion
in
less
occupied
persons
than
the
grimly
heroic
lady
,
Miss
Lavinia
,
and
that
esteemed
friend
of
the
family
,
Mr.
George
Sampson
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
attention
of
all
three
being
fully
possessed
by
the
main
fact
of
the
marriage
,
they
had
happily
none
to
bestow
on
the
guilty
conspirator
;
to
which
fortunate
circumstance
he
owed
the
escape
for
which
he
was
in
nowise
indebted
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
,
R.
W.
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
from
her
stately
corner
,
"
inquire
for
your
daughter
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
my
dear
,
"
he
returned
,
with
a
most
flagrant
assumption
of
unconsciousness
,
"
I
did
omit
it
.
<EOS>
How
---
or
perhaps
I
should
rather
say
where
---
is
Bella
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
here
,
"
Mrs.
Wilfer
proclaimed
,
with
folded
arms
.
  
<EOS>
The
cherub
faintly
muttered
something
to
the
abortive
effect
of
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
indeed
,
my
dear
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
here
,
"
repeated
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
in
a
stern
sonorous
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
,
R.
W.
,
you
have
no
daughter
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
daughter
Bella
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
Your
daughter
Bella
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
a
lofty
air
of
never
having
had
the
least
copartnership
in
that
young
lady
:
of
whom
she
now
made
reproachful
mention
as
an
article
of
luxury
which
her
husband
had
set
up
entirely
on
his
own
account
,
and
in
direct
opposition
to
her
advice
:
"
---
your
daughter
Bella
has
bestowed
herself
upon
a
Mendicant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
my
dear
!
"
  
"
Show
your
father
his
daughter
Bella
's
letter
,
Lavinia
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
in
her
monotonous
Act
of
Parliament
tone
,
and
waving
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
your
father
will
admit
it
to
be
documentary
proof
of
what
I
tell
him
.
<EOS>
I
believe
your
father
is
acquainted
with
his
daughter
Bella
's
writing
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
He
may
tell
you
he
is
not

<EOS>
Nothing
will
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Posted
at
Greenwich
,
and
dated
this
'
morning
,
"
said
the
Irrepressible
,
flouncing
at
her
father
in
handing
him
the
evidence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hopes
Ma
wo
n't
be
angry
,
but
is
happily
married
to
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
,
and
did
n't
mention
it
beforehand
to
avoid
words
,
and
please
tell
darling
you
,
and
love
to
me
,
and
I
should
like
to
know
what
you
'd
have
said
if
any
other
unmarried
member
of
the
family
had
done
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
read
the
letter
,
and
faintly
exclaimed
"
Dear
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
say
Dear
me
!
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
in
a
deep
tone
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
encouragement
he
said
it
again
,
though
scarcely
with
the
success
he
had
expected
;
for
the
scornful
lady
then
remarked
,
with
extreme
bitterness
:
"
<EOS>
You
said
that
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
surprising
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
,
my
dear
,
"
hinted
the
cherub
,
as
he
folded
the
letter
after
a
disconcerting
silence
,
"
that
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
?
<EOS>
Would
you
object
to
my
pointing
out
,
my
dear
,
that
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
is
not
(
so
far
as
I
am
acquainted
with
him
)
,
strictly
speaking
,
a
Mendicant
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Indeed
?
"
returned
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
an
awful
air
of
politeness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Truly
so
?
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
that
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
was
a
gentleman
of
landed
property
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
much
relieved
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
if
you
have
heard
it
,
my
dear
,
"
the
cherub
submitted
with
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
"
I
make
false
statements
,
it
appears
?
<EOS>
So
be
it
.
<EOS>
If
my
daughter
flies
in
my
face
,
surely
my
husband
may
.
<EOS>
The
one
thing
is
not
more
unnatural
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
There
seems
a
fitness
in
the
arrangement
.
<EOS>
By
all
means
!
"
 
<EOS>
Assuming
,
with
a
shiver
of
resignation
,
a
deadly
cheerfulness
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
here
the
Irrepressible
skirmished
into
the
conflict
,
dragging
the
reluctant
form
of
Mr.
Sampson
after
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ma
,
"
interposed
the
young
lady
,
"
I
must
say
I
think
it
would
be
much
better
if
you
would
keep
to
the
point
,
and
not
hold
forth
about
people
's
flying
into
people
's
faces
,
which
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
impossible
nonsense
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
How
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
knitting
her
dark
brows
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
im
-
possible
nonsense
,
Ma
,
"
returned
Lavvy
,
"
and
George
Sampson
knows
it
is
,
as
well
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
suddenly
becoming
petrified
,
fixed
her
indignant
eyes
upon
the
wretched
George
:
who
,
divided
between
the
support
due
from
him
to
his
love
,
and
the
support
due
from
him
to
his
love
's
mamma
,
supported
nobody
,
not
even
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
true
point
is
,
"
pursued
Lavinia
,
"
that
Bella
has
behaved
in
a
most
unsisterly
way
to
me
,
and
might
have
severely
compromised
me
with
George
and
with
George
's
family
,
by
making
off
and
getting
married
in
this
very
low
and
disreputable
manner
---
with
some
pew
-
opener
or
other
,
I
suppose
,
for
a
bridesmaid
---
when
she
ought
to
have
confided
in
me
,
and
ought
to
have
said
,
`
`
If
,
Lavvy
,
you
consider
it
due
to
your
engagement
with
George
,
that
you
should
countenance
the
occasion
by
being
present
,
then
Lavvy
,
I
beg
you
to
be
present
,
keeping
my
secret
from
Ma
and
Pa.
"
<EOS>
"
As
of
course
I
should
have
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
of
course
you
would
have
done
?
<EOS>
Ingrate
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
"
Viper
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
<EOS>
You
know
ma'am
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
honor
you
must
n't
,
"
 
Mr.
Sampson
remonstrated
,
shaking
his
head
seriously
,
"
With
the
highest
respect
for
you
,
ma'am
,
upon
my
life
you
must
n't
.
<EOS>
No
really
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
with
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
finds
himself
engaged
to
a
young
lady
,
and
it
comes
(
even
on
the
part
of
a
member
of
the
family
)
to
vipers
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
---
I
would
merely
put
it
to
your
own
good
feeling
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr.
Sampson
,
in
rather
lame
conclusion
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
baleful
stare
at
the
young
gentleman
in
acknowledgment
of
his
obliging
interference
was
of
such
a
nature
that
Miss
Lavinia
burst
into
tears
,
and
caught
him
round
the
neck
for
his
protection
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
own
unnatural
mother
,
"
screamed
the
young
lady
,
"
wants
to
annihilate
George
!
<EOS>
But
you
sha
n't
be
annihilated
,
George
.
<EOS>
I
'll
die
first
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sampson
,
in
the
arms
of
his
mistress
,
still
struggled
to
shake
his
head
at
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
and
to
remark
:
"
With
every
sentiment
of
respect
for
you
,
you
know
,
ma'am
---
vipers
really
does
n't
do
you
credit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
be
annihilated
,
George
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Lavinia
.
<EOS>
"
Ma
shall
destroy
me
first
,
and
then
she
'll
be
contented
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
oh
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
Have
I
lured
George
from
his
happy
home
to
expose
him
to
this
!
<EOS>
George
,
dear
,
be
free
!
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
ever
dearest
George
,
to
Ma
and
to
my
fate
.
<EOS>
Give
my
love
to
your
aunt
,
George
dear
,
and
implore
her
not
to
curse
the
viper
that
has
crossed
your
path
and
blighted
your
existence
.
<EOS>
Oh

oh

oh

"
<EOS>
The
young
lady
who
,
hysterically
speaking
,
was
only
just
come
of
age
,
and
had
never
gone
off
yet
,
here
fell
into
a
highly
creditable
crisis
,
which
,
regarded
as
a
first
performance
,
was
very
successful
;
Mr.
Sampson
,
bending
over
the
body
meanwhile
,
in
a
state
of
distraction
,
which
induced
him
to
address
Mrs.
Wilfer
in
the
inconsistent
expressions
:
  
"
Demon
---
with
the
highest
respect
for
you
---
behold
your
work
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
cherub
stood
helplessly
rubbing
his
chin
and
looking
on
,
but
on
the
whole
was
inclined
to
welcome
this
diversion
as
one
in
which
,
by
reason
of
the
absorbent
properties
of
hysterics
,
the
previous
question
would
become
absorbed
.
<EOS>
And
so
,
indeed
,
it
proved
,
for
the
Irrepressible
gradually
coming
to
herself
,
and
asking
with
wild
emotion
,
"
George
dear
,
are
you
safe
?
"
and
further
,
"
<EOS>
George
love
,
what
has
happened
?
<EOS>
Where
is
Ma
?
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Sampson
,
with
words
of
comfort
,
raised
her
prostrate
form
,
and
handed
her
to
Mrs.
Wilfer
as
if
the
young
lady
were
something
in
the
nature
of
refreshments
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
with
dignity
partaking
of
the
refreshments
,
by
kissing
her
once
on
the
brow
(
as
if
accepting
an
oyster
)
,
Miss
Lavvy
,
tottering
,
returned
to
the
protection
of
Mr.
Sampson
;
to
whom
she
said
,
"
George
dear
,
I
am
afraid
I
have
been
foolish
;
but
I
am
still
a
little
weak
and
giddy
;
do
n't
let
go
my
hand
,
George
!
"
<EOS>
And
whom
she
afterwards
greatly
agitated
at
intervals
,
by
giving
utterance
,
when
least
expected
,
to
a
sound
between
a
sob
and
a
bottle
of
soda
water
,
that
seemed
to
rend
the
bosom
of
her
frock
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
most
remarkable
effects
of
this
crisis
may
be
mentioned
its
having
,
when
peace
was
restored
,
an
inexplicable
moral
influence
,
of
an
elevating
kind
,
on
Miss
Lavinia
,
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
and
Mr.
George
Sampson
,
from
which
R.
W.
was
altogether
excluded
,
as
an
outsider
and
non
-
sympathizer
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
assumed
a
modest
air
of
having
distinguished
herself
;
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
a
serene
air
of
forgiveness
and
resignation
;
Mr.
Sampson
,
an
air
of
having
been
improved
and
chastened
.
<EOS>
The
influence
pervaded
the
spirit
in
which
they
returned
to
the
previous
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
George
dear
,
"
said
Lavvy
,
with
a
melancholy
smile
,
"
after
what
has
passed
,
I
am
sure
Ma
will
tell
Pa
that
he
may
tell
Bella
we
shall
all
be
glad
to
see
her
and
her
husband
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sampson
said
he
was
sure
of
it
too
;
murmuring
how
eminently
he
respected
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
and
ever
must
,
and
ever
would
.
<EOS>
Never
more
eminently
,
he
added
,
than
after
what
had
passed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Far
be
it
from
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
making
deep
proclamation
from
her
corner
,
"
to
run
counter
to
the
feelings
of
a
child
of
mine
,
and
of
a
Youth
<EOS>
,
"
Mr.
Sampson
hardly
seemed
to
like
that
word
,
"
who
is
the
object
of
her
maiden
preference
.
<EOS>
I
may
feel
---
nay
,
know
---
that
I
have
been
deluded
and
deceived
.
<EOS>
I
may
feel
---
nay
,
know
---
that
I
have
been
set
aside
and
passed
over
.
<EOS>
I
may
feel
---
  
<EOS>
nay
,
know
---
that
after
having
so
far
overcome
my
repugnance
towards
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
as
to
receive
them
under
this
roof
,
and
to
consent
to
your
daughter
Bella
's
,
"
here
turning
to
her
husband
,
"
residing
under
theirs
,
it
were
well
if
your
daughter
Bella
,
"
again
turning
to
her
husband
,
"
had
profited
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
by
a
connection
so
distasteful
,
so
disreputable
.
<EOS>
I
may
feel
---
nay
,
know
---
  
that
in
uniting
herself
to
Mr.
Rokesmith
she
has
united
herself
to
one
who
is
,
in
spite
of
shallow
sophistry
,
a
Mendicant
.
<EOS>
And
I
may
feel
well
assured
that
your
daughter
Bella
,
"
again
turning
to
her
husband
,
"
does
not
exalt
her
family
by
becoming
a
Mendicant
's
bride
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppress
what
I
feel
,
and
say
nothing
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sampson
murmured
that
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
you
might
expect
from
one
who
had
ever
in
her
own
family
been
an
example
and
never
an
outrage
.
<EOS>
And
ever
more
so
(
Mr.
Sampson
added
,
with
some
degree
of
obscurity
,
)
and
never
more
so
,
than
in
and
through
what
had
passed
.
<EOS>
He
must
take
the
liberty
of
adding
,
that
what
was
true
of
the
mother
was
true
of
the
youngest
daughter
,
and
that
he
could
never
forget
the
touching
feelings
that
the
conduct
of
both
had
awakened
within
him
.
<EOS>
In
conclusion
,
he
did
hope
that
there
was
n't
a
man
with
a
beating
heart
who
was
capable
of
something
that
remained
undescribed
,
in
consequence
of
Miss
Lavinia
's
stopping
him
as
he
reeled
in
his
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Therefore
,
R.
W.
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
resuming
her
discourse
and
turning
to
her
lord
again
,
"
let
your
daughter
Bella
come
when
she
will
,
and
she
will
be
received
.
<EOS>
So
,
"
after
a
short
pause
,
and
an
air
of
having
taken
medicine
in
it
,
"
so
will
her
husband
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
beg
,
Pa
,
"
said
Lavinia
,
"
that
you
will
not
tell
Bella
what
I
have
undergone
.
<EOS>
It
can
do
no
good
,
and
it
might
cause
her
to
reproach
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dearest
girl
,
"
urged
Mr.
Sampson
,
"
she
ought
to
know
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
George
,
"
said
Lavinia
,
in
a
tone
of
resolute
self
-
denial
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
dearest
George
,
let
it
be
buried
in
oblivion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sampson
considered
that
,
"
too
noble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
is
too
noble
,
dearest
George
,
"
returned
Lavinia
.
"
<EOS>
And
Pa
,
I
hope
you
will
be
careful
not
to
refer
before
Bella
,
if
you
can
help
it
,
to
my
engagement
to
George
.
<EOS>
It
might
seem
like
reminding
her
of
her
having
cast
herself
away
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
,
Pa
,
that
you
will
think
it
equally
right
to
avoid
mentioning
George
's
rising
prospects
,
when
Bella
is
present
.
<EOS>
It
might
seem
like
taunting
her
with
her
own
poor
fortunes
.
<EOS>
Let
me
ever
remember
that
I
am
her
younger
sister
,
and
ever
spare
her
painful
contrasts
,
which
could
not
but
wound
her
sharply
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sampson
expressed
his
belief
that
such
was
the
demeanour
of
Angels
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lavvy
replied
with
solemnity
,
"
No
,
dearest
George
,
I
am
but
too
well
aware
that
I
am
merely
human
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
for
her
part
,
still
further
improved
the
occasion
by
sitting
with
her
eyes
fastened
on
her
husband
,
like
two
great
black
notes
of
interrogation
,
severely
inquiring
,
Are
you
looking
into
your
breast
?
<EOS>
Do
you
deserve
your
blessings
?
<EOS>
Can
you
lay
your
hand
upon
your
heart
and
say
that
you
are
worthy
of
so
hysterical
a
daughter
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
ask
you
if
you
are
worthy
of
such
a
wife
---
put
Me
out
of
the
question
---
but
are
you
sufficiently
conscious
of
,
and
thankful
for
,
the
pervading
moral
grandeur
of
the
family
spectacle
on
which
you
are
gazing
?
<EOS>
These
inquiries
proved
very
harassing
to
R.
W.
who
,
besides
being
a
little
disturbed
by
wine
,
was
in
perpetual
terror
of
committing
himself
by
the
utterance
of
stray
words
that
would
betray
his
guilty
foreknowledge
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
scene
being
over
,
and
---
all
things
considered
---
well
over
,
he
sought
refuge
in
a
doze
;
which
gave
his
lady
immense
offence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
think
of
your
daughter
Bella
,
and
sleep
?
<EOS>
"
she
disdainfully
inquired
.
  
<EOS>
To
which
he
mildly
answered
,
"
Yes
,
I
think
I
can
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
solemn
indignation
,
"
I
would
recommend
you
,
if
you
have
a
human
feeling
,
to
retire
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
dear
,
"
he
replied
;
"
I
think
it
is
the
best
place
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
with
these
unsympathetic
words
very
gladly
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
Within
a
few
weeks
afterwards
,
the
Mendicant
's
bride
(
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
the
Mendicant
)
came
to
tea
,
in
fulfilment
of
an
engagement
made
through
her
father
.
<EOS>
And
the
way
in
which
the
Mendicant
's
bride
dashed
at
the
unassailable
position
so
considerately
to
be
held
by
Miss
Lavvy
,
and
scattered
the
whole
of
the
works
in
all
directions
in
a
moment
,
was
triumphant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Ma
,
"
cried
Bella
,
running
into
the
room
with
a
radiant
face
,
<EOS>
"
how
do
you
do
,
dearest
Ma
?
"
<EOS>
And
then
embraced
her
,
joyously
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lavvy
darling
,
how
do
you
do
,
and
how
's
George
Sampson
,
and
how
is
he
getting
on
,
and
when
are
you
going
to
be
married
,
and
how
rich
are
you
going
to
grow
?
<EOS>
You
must
tell
me
all
about
it
,
<EOS>
Lavvy
dear
,
immediately
.
<EOS>
John
,
love
,
kiss
Ma
and
Lavvy
,
and
then
we
shall
all
be
at
home
and
comfortable
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
stared
,
but
was
helpless
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
stared
,
but
was
helpless
.
<EOS>
Apparently
with
no
compunction
,
and
assuredly
with
no
ceremony
,
Bella
tossed
her
bonnet
away
,
and
sat
down
to
make
the
tea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dearest
Ma
and
Lavvy
,
you
both
take
sugar
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
And
Pa
(
you
good
little
Pa
)
,
you
do
n't
take
milk
.
<EOS>
John
does
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
before
I
was
married
;
but
I
do
now
,
because
John
does
.
<EOS>
John
dear
,
did
you
kiss
Ma
and
Lavvy
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
you
did
!
<EOS>
Quite
correct
,
John
dear
;
but
I
did
n't
see
you
do
it
,
so
I
asked
.
<EOS>
Cut
some
bread
and
butter
,
John
;
 
<EOS>
that
's
a
love
.
<EOS>
Ma
likes
it
doubled
.
<EOS>
And
now
you
must
tell
me
,
dearest
Ma
and
Lavvy
,
upon
your
words
and
honours
!
<EOS>
Did
n't
you
for
a
moment
---
just
a
moment
---
think
I
was
a
dreadful
little
wretch
when
I
wrote
to
say
I
had
run
away
?
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Mrs.
Wilfer
could
wave
her
gloves
,
the
Mendicant
's
bride
in
her
merriest
affectionate
manner
went
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
must
have
made
you
rather
cross
,
dear
Ma
and
Lavvy
,
and
I
know
I
deserved
that
you
should
be
very
cross
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
I
had
been
such
a
heedless
,
heartless
creature
,
and
had
led
you
so
to
expect
that
I
should
marry
for
money
,
and
so
to
make
sure
that
I
was
incapable
of
marrying
for
love
,
that
I
thought
you
could
n't
believe
me
.
<EOS>
Because
,
you
see
,
you
did
n't
know
how
much
of
Good
,
Good
,
<EOS>
Good
,
I
had
learnt
from
John
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
So
I
was
sly
about
it
,
and
ashamed
of
what
you
supposed
me
to
be
,
and
fearful
that
we
could
n't
understand
one
another
and
might
come
to
words
,
which
we
should
all
be
sorry
for
afterwards
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
said
to
John
that
if
he
liked
to
take
me
without
any
fuss
,
he
might
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
did
like
,
I
let
him
.
<EOS>
And
we
were
married
at
Greenwich
church
in
the
presence
of
nobody
---
except
an
unknown
individual
who
dropped
in
,
"
here
her
eyes
sparkled
more
brightly
,
"
and
half
a
pensioner
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
is
n't
it
nice
,
dearest
Ma
and
Lavvy
,
to
know
that
no
words
have
been
said
which
any
of
us
can
be
sorry
for
,
and
that
we
are
all
the
best
of
friends
at
the
pleasantest
of
teas
!
"
  
<EOS>
Having
got
up
and
kissed
them
again
she
slipped
back
to
her
chair
(
after
a
loop
on
the
road
to
squeeze
her
husband
round
the
neck
)
and
again
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
will
naturally
want
to
know
,
dearest
Ma
and
Lavvy
,
how
we
live
,
and
what
we
have
got
to
live
upon
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
And
so
we
live
on
Blackheath
,
in
the
charm
---
ingest
of
dolls
'
houses
,
de
---
lightfully
furnished
,
and
we
have
a
clever
little
servant
who
is
de
---
cidedly
pretty
,
and
we
are
economical
and
orderly
,
and
do
everything
by
clockwork
,
and
we
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
,
and
we
have
all
we
want
,
and
more
.
<EOS>
And
lastly
,
if
you
would
like
to
know
in
confidence
,
as
perhaps
you
may
,
what
is
my
opinion
of
my
husband
,
my
opinion
is
---
that
I
almost
love
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
if
you
would
like
to
know
in
confidence
,
as
perhaps
you
may
,
"
said
her
husband
,
smiling
,
as
he
stood
by
her
side
,
without
her
having
detected
his
approach
,
"
my
opinion
of
my
wife
,
my
opinion
is
---
.
<EOS>
"
But
Bella
started
up
,
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
sir
!
<EOS>
No
,
John
,
dear
!
<EOS>
Seriously
!
<EOS>
Please
not
yet
a
while
!
<EOS>
I
want
to
be
something
so
much
worthier
than
the
doll
in
the
doll
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
,
are
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
half
,
not
a
quarter
,
so
much
worthier
as
I
hope
you
may
some
day
find
me
!
<EOS>
Try
me
through
some
reverse
,
John
---
try
me
through
some
trial
---
and
tell
them
after
that
,
what
you
think
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
my
Life
,
"
said
John
.
<EOS>
"
I
promise
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
dear
John
.
<EOS>
And
you
wo
n't
speak
a
word
now
;
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
wo
n't
,
"
said
John
,
with
a
very
expressive
look
of
admiration
around
him
,
"
speak
a
word
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
laid
her
laughing
cheek
upon
his
breast
to
thank
him
,
and
said
,
looking
at
the
rest
of
them
<EOS>
sideways
out
of
her
bright
eyes
<EOS>
:
"
I
'll
go
further
,
Pa
and
Ma
and
Lavvy
.
<EOS>
John
do
n't
suspect
it
---
he
has
no
idea
of
it
---
but
I
quite
love
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Even
Mrs.
Wilfer
relaxed
under
the
influence
of
her
married
daughter
,
and
seemed
in
a
majestic
manner
to
imply
remotely
that
if
R.
W.
had
been
a
more
deserving
object
,
she
too
might
have
condescended
to
come
down
from
her
pedestal
for
his
beguilement
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lavinia
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
strong
doubts
of
the
policy
of
the
course
of
treatment
,
and
whether
it
might
not
spoil
Mr.
Sampson
,
if
experimented
on
in
the
case
of
that
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
R.
W.
himself
was
for
his
part
convinced
that
he
was
father
of
one
of
the
most
charming
of
girls
,
and
that
Rokesmith
was
the
most
favoured
of
men
;
which
opinion
,
if
propounded
to
him
,
Rokesmith
would
probably
not
have
contested
.
  
<EOS>
The
newly
-
married
pair
left
early
,
so
that
they
might
walk
at
leisure
to
their
starting
-
place
from
London
,
for
Greenwich
.
<EOS>
At
first
they
were
very
cheerful
and
talked
much
;
but
after
a
while
,
Bella
fancied
that
her
husband
was
turning
somewhat
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
So
she
asked
him
:
  
"
<EOS>
John
dear
<EOS>
,
what
's
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Matter
,
my
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
tell
me
,
"
said
Bella
,
looking
up
into
his
face
,
"
what
you
are
thinking
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
not
much
in
the
thought
,
my
soul
.
<EOS>
I
was
thinking
whether
you
would
n't
like
me
to
be
rich
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
rich
,
John
?
"
repeated
Bella
,
shrinking
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
really
rich
.
<EOS>
Say
,
as
rich
as
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
You
would
like
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
almost
afraid
to
try
,
John
dear
.
<EOS>
Was
he
much
the
better
for
his
wealth
?
<EOS>
Was
I
much
the
better
for
the
little
part
I
once
had
in
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
all
people
are
not
the
worse
for
riches
,
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Most
people
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bella
musingly
suggested
with
raised
eyebrows
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nor
even
most
people
,
it
may
be
hoped
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
rich
,
for
instance
,
you
would
have
a
great
power
of
doing
good
to
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
for
instance
,
"
Bella
playfully
rejoined
;
"
but
should
I
exercise
the
power
,
for
instance
?
<EOS>
And
again
,
sir
,
for
instance
;
should
I
,
at
the
same
time
,
have
a
great
power
of
doing
harm
to
myself
?
"
  
<EOS>
Laughing
and
pressing
her
arm
,
he
retorted
:
"
But
still
,
again
for
instance
;
would
you
exercise
that
power
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Bella
,
thoughtfully
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
.
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
so
easy
to
hope
not
and
think
not
,
without
the
riches
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
you
say
,
my
darling
---
instead
of
that
phrase
---
being
poor
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
looking
earnestly
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
do
n't
I
say
,
being
poor
!
<EOS>
Because
I
am
not
poor
.
<EOS>
Dear
John
,
it
's
not
possible
that
you
suppose
I
think
we
are
poor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
my
love
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
John
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Understand
me
,
sweetheart
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
I
am
rich
beyond
all
wealth
in
having
you
;
but
I
think
of
you
,
and
think
for
you
.
<EOS>
In
such
a
dress
as
you
are
wearing
now
,
you
first
charmed
me
,
and
in
no
dress
could
you
ever
look
,
to
my
thinking
,
more
graceful
or
more
beautiful
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
admired
many
finer
dresses
this
very
day
;
 
and
is
it
not
natural
that
I
wish
I
could
give
them
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
nice
that
you
should
wish
it
,
John
.
<EOS>
It
brings
these
tears
of
grateful
pleasure
into
my
eyes
,
to
hear
you
say
so
with
such
tenderness
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
want
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Again
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
we
are
now
walking
through
the
muddy
streets
.
<EOS>
I
love
those
pretty
feet
so
dearly
,
that
I
feel
as
if
I
could
not
bear
the
dirt
to
soil
the
sole
of
your
shoe
.
<EOS>
Is
it
not
natural
that
I
wish
you
could
ride
in
a
carriage
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
nice
,
"
said
Bella
,
glancing
downward
at
the
feet
in
question
,
"
to
know
that
you
admire
them
so
much
,
John
dear
,
and
since
you
do
,
I
am
sorry
that
these
shoes
are
a
full
size
too
large
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
want
a
carriage
,
believe
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
like
one
if
you
could
have
one
,
Bella
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
like
it
for
its
own
sake
,
half
so
well
as
such
a
wish
for
it
.
<EOS>
Dear
John
,
your
wishes
are
as
real
to
me
as
the
wishes
in
the
Fairy
story
,
that
were
all
fulfilled
as
soon
as
spoken
.
<EOS>
Wish
me
everything
that
you
can
wish
for
the
woman
you
dearly
love
,
and
I
have
as
good
as
got
it
,
John
.
<EOS>
I
have
better
than
got
it
,
John
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
the
less
happy
for
such
talk
,
and
home
was
not
the
less
home
for
coming
after
it
.
<EOS>
Bella
was
fast
developing
a
perfect
genius
for
home
.
<EOS>
All
the
loves
and
graces
seemed
(
her
husband
thought
)
to
have
taken
domestic
service
with
her
,
and
to
help
her
to
make
home
engaging
.
  
<EOS>
Her
married
life
glided
happily
on
.
<EOS>
She
was
alone
all
day
,
for
,
after
an
early
breakfast
her
husband
repaired
every
morning
to
the
City
,
and
did
not
return
until
their
late
dinner
hour
.
<EOS>
He
was
"
in
a
China
house
,
"
he
explained
to
Bella
:
which
she
found
quite
satisfactory
,
without
pursuing
the
China
house
into
minuter
details
than
a
wholesale
vision
of
tea
,
rice
,
odd
-
smelling
silks
,
carved
boxes
,
and
tight
-
eyed
people
in
more
than
double
-
soled
shoes
,
with
their
pigtails
pulling
their
heads
of
hair
off
,
painted
on
transparent
porcelain
.
<EOS>
She
always
walked
with
her
husband
to
the
railroad
,
and
was
always
there
again
to
meet
him
;
her
old
coquettish
ways
a
little
sobered
down
(
but
not
much
)
,
and
her
dress
as
daintily
managed
as
if
she
managed
nothing
else
.
<EOS>
But
,
John
gone
to
business
and
Bella
<EOS>
returned
home
,
the
dress
would
be
laid
aside
,
trim
little
wrappers
and
aprons
would
be
substituted
,
and
Bella
,
putting
back
her
hair
with
both
hands
,
as
if
she
were
making
the
most
business
-
like
arrangements
for
going
dramatically
distracted
,
would
enter
on
the
household
affairs
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Such
weighing
and
mixing
and
chopping
and
grating
,
such
dusting
and
washing
and
polishing
,
such
snipping
and
weeding
and
trowelling
and
other
small
gardening
,
such
making
and
mending
and
folding
and
airing
,
such
diverse
arrangements
,
and
above
all
such
severe
study
!
<EOS>
For
Mrs.
J.
R.
,
who
had
never
been
wo
nt
to
do
too
much
at
home
as
Miss
B.
W.
,
was
under
the
constant
necessity
of
referring
for
advice
and
support
to
a
sage
volume
entitled
The
Complete
British
Family
Housewife
,
which
she
would
sit
consulting
,
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
her
temples
on
her
hands
,
like
some
perplexed
enchantress
poring
over
the
Black
Art
.
<EOS>
This
,
principally
because
the
Complete
British
Housewife
,
however
sound
a
Briton
at
heart
,
was
by
no
means
an
expert
Briton
at
expressing
herself
with
clearness
in
the
British
tongue
,
and
sometimes
might
have
issued
her
directions
to
equal
purpose
in
the
Kamskatchan
language
.
<EOS>
In
any
crisis
of
this
nature
,
Bella
would
suddenly
exclaim
aloud
,
"
Oh
you
ridiculous
old
thing
,
what
do
you
mean
by
that
?
<EOS>
You
must
have
been
drinking
!
"
<EOS>
And
having
made
this
marginal
note
,
would
try
the
Housewife
again
,
with
all
her
dimples
screwed
into
an
expression
of
profound
research
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
likewise
a
coolness
on
the
part
of
the
British
Housewife
,
which
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
found
highly
exasperating
.
<EOS>
She
would
say
,
"
Take
a
salamander
,
"
as
if
a
general
should
command
a
private
to
catch
a
Tartar
.
<EOS>
Or
,
she
would
casually
issue
the
order
,
"
Throw
in
a
handful
---
"
of
something
entirely
unattainable
.
<EOS>
In
these
,
the
Housewife
's
most
glaring
moments
of
unreason
,
Bella
would
shut
her
up
and
knock
her
on
the
table
,
apostrophising
her
with
the
compliment
,
"
O
you
   
ARE
a
stupid
old
Donkey
!
<EOS>
Where
am
I
to
get
it
,
do
you
think
?
"
  
<EOS>
Another
branch
of
study
claimed
the
attention
of
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
for
a
regular
period
every
day
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
mastering
of
the
newspaper
,
so
that
she
might
be
close
up
with
John
on
general
topics
when
John
came
home
.
<EOS>
In
her
desire
to
be
in
all
things
his
companion
,
she
would
have
set
herself
with
equal
zeal
to
master
Algebra
,
or
Euclid
,
if
he
had
divided
his
soul
between
her
and
either
.
<EOS>
Wonderful
was
the
way
in
which
she
would
store
up
the
City
Intelligence
,
and
beamingly
shed
it
upon
John
in
the
course
of
the
evening
;
incidentally
mentioning
the
commodities
that
were
looking
up
in
the
markets
,
and
how
much
gold
had
been
taken
to
the
Bank
,
and
trying
to
look
wise
and
serious
over
it
until
she
would
laugh
at
herself
most
charmingly
and
would
say
,
kissing
him
:
"
It
all
comes
of
my
love
,
John
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
For
a
City
man
,
John
certainly
did
appear
to
care
as
little
as
might
be
for
the
looking
up
or
looking
down
of
things
,
as
well
as
for
the
gold
that
got
taken
to
the
Bank
.
<EOS>
But
he
cared
,
beyond
all
expression
,
for
his
wife
,
as
a
most
precious
and
sweet
commodity
that
was
always
looking
up
,
and
that
never
was
worth
less
than
all
the
gold
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
And
she
,
being
inspired
by
her
affection
,
and
having
a
quick
wit
and
a
fine
ready
instinct
,
made
amazing
progress
in
her
domestic
efficiency
,
though
,
as
an
endearing
creature
,
she
made
no
progress
at
all
.
<EOS>
This
was
her
husband
's
verdict
,
and
he
justified
it
by
telling
her
that
she
had
begun
her
married
life
as
the
most
endearing
creature
that
could
possibly
be
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
such
a
cheerful
spirit
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
fondly
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
like
a
bright
light
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
truly
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
truly
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Only
much
more
,
and
much
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
John
dear
,
"
said
Bella
,
taking
him
by
a
button
of
his
coat
,
"
that
I
sometimes
,
at
odd
moments
---
do
n't
laugh
,
John
,
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nothing
should
induce
John
to
do
it
,
when
she
asked
him
not
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
That
I
sometimes
think
,
John
,
I
feel
a
little
serious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
too
much
alone
,
my
darling
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
O
dear
,
no
,
John
!
<EOS>
The
time
is
so
short
that
I
have
not
a
moment
too
much
in
the
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
serious
,
my
life
,
then
?
<EOS>
When
serious
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
laugh
,
I
think
,
"
said
Bella
,
laughing
as
she
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
believe
,
sir
,
that
I
feel
serious
now
?
<EOS>
But
I
do
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
laughed
again
,
and
something
glistened
in
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
like
to
be
rich
,
pet
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
her
coaxingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rich
,
John
!
<EOS>
How
can
you
ask
such
goose
's
questions
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
regret
anything
,
my
love
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Regret
anything
?
<EOS>
No
!
"
<EOS>
Bella
confidently
answered
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
suddenly
changing
,
she
said
,
between
laughing
and
glistening
:
"
Oh
yes
,
I
do
though
.
<EOS>
I
regret
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
,
too
,
regret
that
separation
very
much
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
it
is
only
temporary
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
things
may
so
fall
out
,
as
that
you
may
sometimes
see
her
again
---
as
that
we
may
sometimes
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
"
Bella
might
be
very
anxious
on
the
subject
,
but
she
scarcely
seemed
so
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
With
an
absent
air
,
she
was
investigating
that
button
on
her
husband
's
coat
,
when
Pa
came
in
to
spend
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Pa
had
his
special
chair
and
his
special
corner
reserved
for
him
on
all
occasions
,
and
---
without
disparagement
of
his
domestic
joys
---
was
far
happier
there
,
than
anywhere
.
<EOS>
It
was
always
pleasantly
droll
to
see
Pa
and
Bella
together
;
but
on
this
present
evening
her
husband
thought
her
more
than
usually
fantastic
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
good
little
boy
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
to
come
unexpectedly
,
as
soon
as
you
could
get
out
of
school
.
<EOS>
And
how
have
they
used
you
at
school
to
-
day
,
you
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
pet
,
"
replied
the
cherub
,
smiling
and
rubbing
his
hands
as
she
sat
him
down
in
his
chair
,
"
I
attend
two
schools
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
Mincing
Lane
establishment
,
and
there
's
your
mother
's
Academy
.
<EOS>
Which
might
you
mean
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Both
,
"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
Both
,
eh
?
Why
,
to
say
the
truth
,
both
have
taken
a
little
out
of
me
to
-
day
,
my
dear
,
but
that
was
to
be
expected
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
royal
road
to
learning
;
and
what
is
life
but
learning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
when
you
have
got
your
learning
by
heart
,
you
silly
child
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
cherub
,
after
a
little
consideration
,
"
I
suppose
I
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
bad
boy
,
"
retorted
Bella
,
"
to
talk
about
dismal
things
and
be
out
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
Bella
,
"
rejoined
her
father
,
"
I
am
not
out
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
gay
as
a
lark
.
<EOS>
"
Which
his
face
confirmed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
if
you
are
sure
and
certain
it
's
not
you
,
I
suppose
it
must
be
I
,
"
said
Bella
;
"
so
I
wo
n't
do
so
any
more
.
<EOS>
John
dear
,
we
must
give
this
little
fellow
his
supper
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
must
,
my
darling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
grubbing
and
grubbing
at
school
,
"
said
Bella
,
looking
at
her
father
's
hand
and
lightly
slapping
it
,
"
till
he
's
not
fit
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
O
what
a
grubby
child
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
my
dear
,
"
said
her
father
,
"
I
was
going
to
ask
to
be
allowed
to
wash
my
hands
,
only
you
find
me
out
so
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
here
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
,
taking
him
by
the
front
of
his
coat
,
"
come
here
and
be
washed
directly
.
<EOS>
You
are
not
to
be
trusted
to
do
it
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
Come
here
,
sir
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
cherub
,
to
his
genial
amusement
,
was
accordingly
conducted
to
a
little
washing
-
room
,
where
Bella
soaped
his
face
and
rubbed
his
face
,
and
soaped
his
hands
and
rubbed
his
hands
,
and
splashed
him
and
rinsed
him
and
towelled
him
,
until
he
was
as
red
as
beetroot
,
even
to
his
very
ears
:
"
Now
you
must
be
brushed
and
combed
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
,
busily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hold
the
light
,
John
.
<EOS>
Shut
your
eyes
,
sir
,
and
let
me
take
hold
of
your
chin
.
<EOS>
Be
good
directly
,
and
do
as
you
are
told
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
father
being
more
than
willing
to
obey
,
she
dressed
his
hair
in
her
most
elaborate
manner
,
brushing
it
out
straight
,
parting
it
,
winding
it
over
her
fingers
,
sticking
it
up
on
end
,
and
constantly
falling
back
on
John
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
effect
of
it
.
<EOS>
Who
always
received
her
on
his
disengaged
arm
,
and
detained
her
,
while
the
patient
cherub
stood
waiting
to
be
finished
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
said
Bella
,
when
she
had
at
last
completed
the
final
touches
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
are
something
like
a
genteel
boy
!
<EOS>
Put
your
jacket
on
,
and
come
and
have
your
supper
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
cherub
investing
himself
with
his
coat
was
led
back
to
his
corner
---
<EOS>
where
,
but
for
having
no
egotism
in
his
pleasant
nature
,
he
would
have
answered
well
enough
for
that
radiant
though
self
-
sufficient
boy
,
Jack
Horner
---
Bella
with
her
own
hands
laid
a
cloth
for
him
,
and
brought
him
his
supper
on
a
tray
.
"
<EOS>
Stop
a
moment
,
"
 
said
she
,
"
we
must
keep
his
little
clothes
clean
;
"
and
tied
a
napkin
under
his
chain
,
in
a
very
methodical
manner
.
  
<EOS>
While
he
took
his
supper
,
Bella
sat
by
him
,
sometimes
admonishing
him
to
hold
his
fork
by
the
handle
,
like
a
polite
child
,
and
at
other
times
carving
for
him
,
or
pouring
out
his
drink
.
<EOS>
Fantastic
as
it
all
was
,
and
accustomed
as
she
ever
had
been
to
make
a
plaything
of
her
good
father
,
ever
delighted
that
she
should
put
him
to
that
account
,
still
there
was
an
occasional
something
on
Bella
's
part
that
was
new
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
said
that
she
was
less
playful
,
whimsical
,
or
natural
,
than
she
always
had
been
;
but
it
seemed
,
her
husband
thought
,
as
if
there
were
some
rather
graver
reason
than
he
had
supposed
for
what
she
had
so
lately
said
,
and
as
if
,
throughout
all
this
,
there
were
glimpses
of
an
underlying
seriousness
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
circumstance
in
support
of
this
view
of
the
case
,
that
when
she
had
lighted
her
father
's
pipe
,
and
mixed
him
his
glass
of
grog
,
she
sat
down
on
a
stool
between
her
father
and
her
husband
,
leaning
her
arm
upon
the
latter
,
and
was
very
quiet
.
<EOS>
So
quiet
,
that
when
her
father
rose
to
take
his
leave
,
she
looked
round
with
a
start
,
as
if
she
had
forgotten
his
being
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
go
a
little
way
with
Pa
,
John
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
written
to
Lizzie
Hexam
since
I
wrote
and
told
her
that
I
really
had
a
lover
---
a
whole
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
thought
I
would
like
to
tell
her
how
right
she
was
when
she
pretended
to
read
in
the
live
coals
that
I
would
go
through
fire
and
water
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
the
humour
to
tell
her
so
to
-
night
,
John
,
and
I
'll
stay
at
home
and
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
tired
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
tired
,
John
dear
,
but
in
the
humour
to
write
to
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
dear
Pa.
Good
night
,
you
dear
,
good
,
gentle
Pa
!
"
  
<EOS>
Left
to
herself
,
she
sat
down
to
write
,
and
wrote
Lizzie
a
long
letter
.
<EOS>
She
had
but
completed
it
and
read
it
over
,
when
her
husband
came
back
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
just
in
time
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
;
"
I
am
going
to
give
you
your
first
curtain
lecture
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
a
parlour
-
curtain
lecture
.
<EOS>
You
shall
take
this
chair
of
mine
when
I
have
folded
my
letter
,
and
I
will
take
the
stool
(
though
you
ought
to
take
it
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
,
sir
,
if
it
's
the
stool
of
repentance
)
,
and
you
'll
soon
find
yourself
taken
to
task
soundly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
letter
folded
,
sealed
,
and
directed
,
and
her
pen
wiped
,
and
her
middle
finger
wiped
,
and
her
desk
locked
up
and
put
away
,
and
these
transactions
performed
with
an
air
of
severe
business
sedateness
,
which
the
Complete
British
Housewife
might
have
assumed
,
and
certainly
would
not
have
rounded
off
and
broken
down
in
with
a
musical
laugh
,
as
Bella
did
:
she
placed
her
husband
in
his
chair
,
and
placed
herself
upon
her
stool
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sir
!
<EOS>
To
begin
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
What
is
your
name
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
question
more
decidedly
rushing
at
the
secret
he
was
keeping
from
her
,
could
not
have
astounded
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
kept
his
countenance
and
his
secret
,
and
answered
,
"
John
Rokesmith
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
boy
!
<EOS>
Who
gave
you
that
name
?
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
returning
suspicion
that
something
might
have
betrayed
him
to
her
,
he
answered
,
interrogatively
,
"
<EOS>
My
godfathers
and
my
godmothers
,
dear
love
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
good
!
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
Not
goodest
good
,
because
you
hesitate
about
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
you
know
your
Catechism
fairly
,
so
far
,
I
'll
let
you
off
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
am
going
to
examine
you
out
of
my
own
head
.
<EOS>
John
dear
,
why
did
you
go
back
,
this
evening
,
to
the
question
you
once
asked
me
before
---
would
I
like
to
be
rich
?
"
  
<EOS>
Again
,
his
secret
!
<EOS>
He
looked
down
at
her
as
she
looked
up
at
him
,
with
her
hands
folded
on
his
knee
,
and
it
was
as
nearly
told
as
ever
secret
was
.
  
<EOS>
Having
no
reply
ready
,
he
could
do
no
better
than
embrace
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
dear
John
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
this
is
the
topic
of
my
lecture
:
I
want
nothing
on
earth
,
and
I
want
you
to
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
that
's
all
,
the
lecture
may
be
considered
over
,
for
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
not
all
,
John
dear
,
"
Bella
hesitated
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
Firstly
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
dreadful
Secondly
,
and
a
dreadful
Thirdly
to
come
---
as
I
used
to
say
to
myself
in
sermon
-
time
when
I
was
a
very
smallsized
sinner
at
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
them
come
,
my
dearest
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
,
John
dear
;
are
you
absolutely
certain
in
your
innermost
heart
of
hearts
---
 
---
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Which
is
not
in
my
keeping
,
"
he
rejoined
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
John
,
but
the
key
is
.
<EOS>
---
Are
you
absolutely
certain
that
down
at
the
bottom
of
that
heart
of
hearts
,
which
you
have
given
to
me
as
I
have
given
mine
to
you
,
there
is
no
remembrance
that
I
was
once
very
mercenary
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
if
there
were
no
remembrance
in
me
of
the
time
you
speak
of
,
"
he
softly
asked
her
with
his
lips
to
hers
,
"
could
I
love
you
quite
as
well
as
I
do
;
could
I
have
in
the
Calendar
of
my
life
the
brightest
of
its
days
;
<EOS>
could
I
whenever
I
look
at
your
dear
face
,
or
hear
your
dear
voice
,
see
and
hear
my
noble
champion
?
<EOS>
It
can
never
have
been
that
which
made
you
serious
,
darling
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
John
,
it
was
n't
that
,
and
still
less
was
it
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
,
though
I
love
her
.
<EOS>
Wait
a
moment
,
and
I
'll
go
on
with
the
lecture
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
moment
,
because
I
like
to
cry
for
joy
.
<EOS>
It
's
so
delicious
,
John
dear
,
to
cry
for
joy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
so
on
his
neck
,
and
,
still
clinging
there
,
laughed
a
little
when
she
said
,
"
I
think
I
am
ready
now
for
Thirdly
,
John
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
for
Thirdly
,
"
said
John
,
"
whatever
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
,
John
,
"
pursued
Bella
,
"
that
you
believe
that
I
believe
---
 
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
"
cried
her
husband
gaily
,
"
what
a
quantity
of
believing
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
there
?
"
said
Bella
,
with
another
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
knew
such
a
quantity
!
<EOS>
It
's
like
verbs
in
an
exercise
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
get
on
with
less
believing
.
<EOS>
I
'll
try
again
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
dear
John
,
that
you
believe
that
I
believe
that
we
have
as
much
money
as
we
require
,
and
that
we
want
for
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
strictly
true
,
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
our
money
should
by
any
means
be
rendered
not
so
much
 
---
if
we
had
to
stint
ourselves
a
little
in
purchases
that
we
can
afford
to
make
now
---
would
you
still
have
the
same
confidence
in
my
being
quite
contented
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Precisely
the
same
confidence
,
my
soul
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
John
dear
,
thousands
upon
thousands
of
times
.
<EOS>
And
I
may
take
it
for
granted
,
no
doubt
,
"
with
a
little
faltering
,
"
that
you
would
be
quite
as
contented
yourself
,
John
?
<EOS>
But
,
yes
,
I
know
I
may
.
<EOS>
For
,
knowing
that
I
should
be
so
,
how
surely
I
may
know
that
you
would
be
so
;
you
who
are
so
much
stronger
,
and
firmer
,
and
more
reasonable
and
more
generous
,
than
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
said
her
husband
,
"
I
must
not
hear
that
.
<EOS>
You
are
all
wrong
there
,
though
otherwise
as
right
as
can
be
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
am
brought
to
a
little
piece
of
news
,
my
dearest
,
that
I
might
have
told
you
earlier
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
have
strong
reason
for
confidently
believing
that
we
shall
never
be
in
the
receipt
of
a
smaller
income
than
our
present
income
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
might
have
shown
herself
more
interested
in
the
intelligence
;
 
but
she
had
returned
to
the
investigation
of
the
coat
-
button
that
had
engaged
her
attention
a
few
hours
before
,
and
scarcely
seemed
to
heed
what
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
we
have
got
to
the
bottom
of
it
at
last
,
"
cried
her
husband
,
rallying
her
,
"
and
this
is
the
thing
that
made
you
serious
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
dear
,
"
said
Bella
,
twisting
the
button
and
shaking
her
head
,
"
it
was
n't
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
then
,
Lord
bless
this
little
wife
of
mine
,
there
's
a
Fourthly
!
"
exclaimed
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
worried
me
a
little
,
and
so
did
Secondly
,
"
said
Bella
,
occupied
with
the
button
,
"
but
<EOS>
it
was
quite
another
sort
of
seriousness
---
 
a
much
deeper
and
quieter
sort
of
seriousness
---
that
I
spoke
of
,
John
dear
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
bent
his
face
to
hers
,
she
raised
hers
to
meet
it
,
and
laid
her
little
right
hand
on
his
eyes
,
and
kept
it
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
,
John
,
on
the
day
we
were
married
,
Pa
's
speaking
of
the
ships
that
might
be
sailing
towards
us
from
the
unknown
seas
?

<EOS>
"
Perfectly
,
my
darling
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
.....
<EOS>
among
them

there
is
a
ship
upon
the
ocean

bringing

to
you

A
CRY
FOR
HELP
.
 
<EOS>
The
Paper
Mill
had
stopped
work
for
the
night
,
and
the
paths
and
roads
in
its
neighbourhood
were
sprinkled
with
clusters
of
people
going
home
from
their
day
's
labour
in
it
.
<EOS>
There
were
men
,
women
,
and
children
in
the
groups
,
and
there
was
no
want
of
lively
colour
to
flutter
in
the
gentle
evening
wind
.
<EOS>
The
mingling
of
various
voices
and
the
sound
of
laughter
made
a
cheerful
impression
upon
the
ear
,
analogous
to
that
of
the
fluttering
colours
upon
the
eye
.
<EOS>
Into
the
sheet
of
water
reflecting
the
flushed
sky
in
the
foreground
of
the
living
picture
,
a
knot
of
urchins
were
casting
stones
,
and
watching
the
expansion
of
the
rippling
circles
.
<EOS>
So
,
in
the
rosy
evening
,
one
might
watch
the
ever
-
widening
beauty
of
the
landscape
---
beyond
the
newly
-
released
workers
wending
home
---
beyond
the
silver
river
---
beyond
the
deep
green
fields
of
corn
,
so
prospering
,
that
the
loiterers
in
their
narrow
threads
of
pathway
seemed
to
float
immersed
breast
-
high
---
beyond
the
hedgerows
and
the
clumps
of
trees
---
beyond
the
windmills
on
the
ridge
---
  
away
to
where
the
sky
appeared
to
meet
the
earth
,
as
if
there
were
no
immensity
of
space
between
mankind
and
Heaven
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
Saturday
evening
,
and
at
such
a
time
the
village
dogs
,
always
much
more
interested
in
the
doings
of
humanity
than
in
the
affairs
of
their
own
species
,
were
particularly
active
.
<EOS>
At
the
general
shop
,
at
the
butcher
's
and
at
the
public
-
house
,
they
evinced
an
inquiring
spirit
never
to
be
satiated
.
<EOS>
Their
especial
interest
in
the
public
-
house
would
seem
to
imply
some
latent
rakishness
in
the
canine
character
;
for
little
was
eaten
there
,
and
<EOS>
they
,
having
no
taste
for
beer
or
tobacco
<EOS>
(
Mrs.
Hubbard
's
dog
is
said
to
have
smoked
,
but
proof
is
wanting
)
<EOS>
,
could
only
have
been
attracted
fiddle
played
within
;
a
fiddle
so
unutterably
vile
,
<EOS>
that
one
lean
long
-
bodied
cur
,
with
a
better
ear
than
the
rest
,
found
himself
under
compulsion
at
intervals
to
go
round
the
corner
and
howl
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
even
he
returned
to
the
public
-
house
on
each
occasion
with
the
tenacity
of
a
confirmed
drunkard
.
  
<EOS>
Fearful
to
relate
,
there
was
even
a
sort
of
little
Fair
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
Some
despairing
gingerbread
that
had
been
vainly
trying
to
dispose
of
itself
all
over
the
country
,
and
had
cast
a
quantity
of
dust
upon
its
head
in
its
mortification
,
again
appealed
to
the
public
from
an
infirm
booth
.
<EOS>
So
did
a
heap
of
nuts
,
long
,
long
exiled
from
Barcelona
,
and
yet
speaking
English
so
indifferently
as
to
call
fourteen
of
themselves
a
pint
.
<EOS>
A
Peep
-
show
which
had
originally
started
with
the
Battle
of
Waterloo
,
and
had
since
made
it
every
other
battle
of
later
date
by
altering
the
Duke
of
Wellington
's
nose
,
tempted
the
student
of
illustrated
history
.
<EOS>
A
Fat
Lady
,
perhaps
in
part
sustained
upon
postponed
pork
,
her
professional
associate
being
a
Learned
Pig
,
displayed
her
life
-
size
picture
in
a
low
dress
as
she
appeared
when
presented
at
Court
,
several
yards
round
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
a
vicious
spectacle
as
any
poor
idea
of
amusement
on
the
part
of
the
rougher
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
in
this
land
of
England
<EOS>
ever
is
and
shall
be
.
<EOS>
They
must
not
vary
the
rheumatism
with
amusement
.
<EOS>
They
may
vary
it
with
fever
and
ague
,
or
with
as
many
rheumatic
variations
as
they
have
joints
;
but
positively
not
with
entertainment
after
their
own
manner
.
  
<EOS>
The
various
sounds
arising
from
this
scene
of
depravity
,
and
floating
away
into
the
still
evening
air
,
made
the
evening
,
at
any
point
which
they
just
reached
fitfully
,
mellowed
by
the
distance
,
more
still
by
contrast
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
stillness
of
the
evening
to
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
as
he
walked
by
the
river
with
his
hands
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
walked
slowly
,
and
with
the
measured
step
and
preoccupied
air
of
one
who
was
waiting
.
<EOS>
He
walked
between
the
two
points
,
an
osier
-
bed
at
this
end
and
some
floating
lilies
at
that
,
and
at
each
point
stopped
and
looked
expectantly
in
one
direction
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
quiet
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
quiet
.
<EOS>
Some
sheep
were
grazing
on
the
grass
by
the
river
-
side
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
before
heard
the
crisp
tearing
sound
with
which
they
cropped
it
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
idly
,
and
looked
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
stupid
enough
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
are
clever
enough
to
get
through
life
tolerably
to
your
satisfaction
,
you
have
got
the
better
of
me
,
Man
as
I
am
,
and
Mutton
as
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
rustle
in
a
field
beyond
the
hedge
attracted
his
attention
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
here
to
do
?
"
he
asked
himself
,
leisurely
going
towards
the
gate
and
looking
over
.
"
<EOS>
No
jealous
paper
-
miller
?
<EOS>
No
pleasures
of
the
chase
in
this
part
of
the
country
?
<EOS>
Mostly
fishing
hereabouts
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
field
had
been
newly
mown
,
and
there
were
yet
the
marks
of
the
scythe
on
the
yellow
-
green
ground
,
and
the
track
of
wheels
where
the
hay
had
been
carried
.
<EOS>
Following
the
tracks
with
his
eyes
,
the
view
closed
with
the
new
hayrick
in
a
corner
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
if
he
had
gone
on
to
the
hayrick
,
and
gone
round
it
?
<EOS>
But
,
say
that
the
event
was
to
be
,
as
the
event
fell
out
,
and
how
idle
are
such
suppositions
!
<EOS>
Besides
,
if
he
had
gone
;
what
is
there
of
warning
in
a
Bargeman
lying
on
his
face
?
  
<EOS>
"
A
bird
flying
to
the
hedge
,
"
was
all
he
thought
about
it
;
and
came
back
,
and
resumed
his
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
not
a
reliance
on
her
being
truthful
,
"
said
Eugene
,
after
taking
some
half
-
dozen
turns
,
"
I
should
begin
to
think
she
had
given
me
the
slip
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
But
she
promised
,
and
she
is
a
girl
of
her
word
.
"
  
<EOS>
Turning
again
at
the
water
-
lilies
,
he
saw
her
coming
,
and
advanced
to
meet
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
saying
to
myself
,
Lizzie
,
that
you
were
sure
to
come
,
though
you
were
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
to
linger
through
the
village
as
if
I
had
no
object
before
me
,
and
I
had
speak
to
several
people
in
passing
along
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
the
lads
of
the
village
---
and
the
ladies
---
such
scandal
-
mongers
?
"
 
he
asked
,
as
he
took
her
hand
and
drew
it
through
his
arm
  
She
submitted
to
walk
slowly
on
,
with
downcast
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
,
and
she
quietly
drew
it
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
walk
beside
me
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
and
not
touch
me
?
"
 
<EOS>
For
,
his
arm
was
already
stealing
round
her
waist
.
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
again
,
and
gave
him
an
earnest
supplicating
look
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Lizzie
,
well
!
"
said
he
,
in
an
easy
way
though
ill
at
ease
with
himself
,
"
don;'t
be
unhappy
,
do
n't
be
reproachful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
help
being
unhappy
,
but
I
do
not
mean
to
be
reproachful
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
I
implore
you
to
go
away
from
this
neighbourhood
,
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie

Lizzie

Lizzie

"
he
remonstrated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
well
be
reproachful
as
wholly
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Faith

"
said
Eugene
in
his
airily
candid
manner
.
<EOS>
"
Because
you
wo
n't
let
me
.
<EOS>
Mind
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
reproachful
either
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
complain
that
you
design
to
keep
me
here

<EOS>
But
you
do
it

you
do
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
walk
beside
me
,
and
not
touch
me
,
"
for
,
his
arm
was
coming
about
her
again
;
"
while
I
speak
to
you
very
seriously
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
anything
within
the
limits
possibility
,
for
you

Lizzie

"
he
answered
with
pleasant
gaiety
as
he
folded
his
arms
.
"
<EOS>
See
here
!
<EOS>
Napoleon
Buonaparte
at
St.
Helena

"
  
<EOS>
"
When
you
spoke
to
me
as
I
came
the
Mill
the
night
before
last
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
fixing
her
eyes
upon
him
with
the
look
of
supplication
which
troubled
his
better
nature
,
"
you
told
me
that
you
were
much
surprised
to
see
me
,
and
that
you
were
on
a
solitary
fishing
excursion
.
<EOS>
Was
it
true
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
,
"
replied
Eugene
composedly
,
"
in
the
least
true
.
<EOS>
I
came
here
,
because
I
had
information
that
I
should
find
you
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
imagine
why
I
left
London
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
Lizzie
,
"
he
openly
answered
,
"
that
you
left
London
to
get
rid
of
me
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
flattering
to
my
self
-
love
,
but
I
am
afraid
you
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
could
you
be
so
cruel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
"
she
answered
,
suddenly
breaking
into
tears
,
"
is
the
cruelty
on
my
side
!
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
is
there
no
cruelty
in
your
being
here
to

night

"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
all
that
'
good

and
that
is
not
conjuring
you
in
my
own
name

for
Heaven

---
said
Eugene
,
"
do
n't
be
distressed

"
  
<EOS>
"
What
else
can
I
be
,
when
I
know
the
distance
and
the
difference

<EOS>
What
else
can
I
be
,
when
to
tell
me
why
you
came
here
,
is
to
put
me
to
shame
!
"
<EOS>
said
Lizzie
,
covering
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
with
a
real
sentiment
of
remorseful
tenderness
and
pity
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
strong
enough
to
impel
him
to
sacrifice
himself
and
spare
her
,
but
it
was
a
strong
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
I
never
thought
before
,
that
there
was
a
woman
in
the
world
who
could
affect
me
so
much
by
saying
so
little
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
be
hard
in
your
construction
of
me
.
<EOS>
You
don;t
know
what
my
state
of
mind
towards
you
is
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
how
you
haunt
me
and
bewilder
me
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
know
how
the
cursed
carelessness
that
is
over
-
officious
in
helping
me
at
every
other
turning
of
my
life
,
   
WON'T
help
me
here
.
<EOS>
You
have
struck
it
dead
,
I
think
,
and
I
sometimes
almost
wish
you
had
struck
me
dead
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
not
been
prepared
for
such
passionate
expressions
,
and
they
awakened
some
natural
sparks
of
feminine
pride
and
joy
in
her
breast
.
<EOS>
To
consider
,
wrong
as
he
was
,
that
he
could
care
so
much
for
her
,
and
that
she
had
the
power
to
move
him
so
!
  
<EOS>
"
It
grieves
you
to
see
me
distressed

Mr.
Wrayburn

it
grieves
me

see
you
distressed

I
do

reproach

<EOS>
Indeed
I
do
n't
reproach
you

<EOS>
You
have
not
felt
this

I
feel
it

being
so
different
from
me

and
beginning
from
another
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
thought

<EOS>
But
I
entreat
you
to
think
now

think
now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
am
I
to
think
of
?
"
asked
Eugene
,
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
how
not

think

you
'll
change
me
altogether

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
Think
of
me
,
as
belonging
to
another
station
,
and
quite
cut
off
from
you
in
honor
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
I
have
no
protector
near
me
,
unless
I
have
one
in
your
noble
heart
.
<EOS>
Respect
my
good
name

<EOS>
If
you
feel
towards
me
,
in
one
particular
,
as
you
might
if
I
was
a
lady
,
give
me
the
full
claims
of
a
lady
upon
your
generous
behaviour
.
<EOS>
I
am
removed
from
you
and
your
family
by
being
a
working
girl
.
<EOS>
How
true
a
gentleman
to
be
as
considerate
of
me
as
if
I
was
removed
by
being
a
Queen
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
base
indeed
to
have
stood
untouched
by
her
appeal
.
<EOS>
His
face
expressed
contrition
and
indecision
as
he
asked
:
  
"
Have
I
injured
you
so
much
,
Lizzie
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
You
may
set
me
quite
right
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
speak
of
the
past
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
but
of
the
present
and
the
future
.
<EOS>
Are
we
not
here
now
,
because
through
two
days
you
have
followed
me
so
closely
where
there
are
so
many
eyes
to
see
you
,
that
I
consented
to
this
appointment
as
an
escape
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Again
,
not
very
flattering
to
my
self
-
love

"
said
Eugene
,
moodily
;
 
"
<EOS>
but
yes
.
<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
beseech
you
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
I
beg
and
pray
you
,
leave
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
not
,
consider
to
what
you
will
drive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
consider
within
himself
for
a
moment
or
two
,
and
then
retorted
,
"
Drive
you
?
<EOS>
To
what
shall
I
drive
you
,
Lizzie
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
drive
me
away

<EOS>
I
live
here
peacefully

respected

I
am
well
employed
here

<EOS>
You
will
force
me
to
quit
this
place
as
I
quitted
London
,
and
---
by
following
me
again
---
will
force
me
to
quit
the
next
place
in
which
I
may
find
refuge
,
as
I
quitted
this

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
so
determined

Lizzie

forgive
the
word

going
to
use

for
its
literal
truth

to
fly
from
a
lover

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
determined
,
"
she
answered
resolutely
,
though
trembling
,
"
to
fly
from
such
a
lover

<EOS>
There
was
a
poor
woman
died
here
but
a
little
while
ago
,
scores
of
years
older
than
I
am
,
whom
I
found
by
chance
,
lying
on
the
wet
earth

<EOS>
You
may
have
heard
some
account
of
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
,
"
he
answered
,
"
if
her
name
was
Higden
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
name
was
Higden
.
<EOS>
Though
she
was
so
weak
and
old
,
she
kept
true
to
one
purpose
to
the
very
last
.
<EOS>
Even
at
the
very
last
,
she
made
me
promise
that
her
purpose
should
be
kept
to
,
after
she
was
dead
,
so
settled
was
her
determination
.
<EOS>
What
she
did
,
I
can
do
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
if
I
believed
---
but
I
do
not
believe
---
that
you
could
be
so
cruel
to
me
as
to
drive
me
from
place
to
place
to
wear
me
out
,
you
should
drive
me
to
death
and
not
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
full
at
her
handsome
face
,
and
in
his
own
handsome
face
there
was
a
light
of
blended
admiration
,
anger
,
and
reproach
,
<EOS>
which
she
---
who
loved
him
so
in
secret
---
whose
heart
had
long
been
so
full
,
and
he
the
cause
of
its
overflowing
---
drooped
before
.
<EOS>
She
tried
hard
to
retain
her
firmness
,
but
he
saw
it
melting
away
under
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
In
the
moment
of
its
dissolution
,
and
of
his
first
full
knowledge
of
his
influence
upon
her
,
she
dropped
,
and
he
caught
her
on
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
Rest
so
a
moment

<EOS>
Answer
what
I
ask
you

<EOS>
If

what

<EOS>
"
How
can
I
,
Mr.

?
<EOS>
How
can
I
tell
you
what
I
should
have
done
,
if
you
had
not

what

are

"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
not
been
what
you
make
me
out
to
be

he
struck
in
,
skilfully
changing
the
form
of
words
,
"
would
you
still
have
hated
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
"
she
replied
appealingly
,
and
weeping
,
"
you

"
O
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
"
she
answered
as
before
,
"
you
know
me
better
than
that
too

"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
attitude
of
her
whole
figure
as
he
supported
it
,
and
she
hung
her
head
,
which
besought
him
to
be
merciful
and
not
force
her
to
disclose
her
heart
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
merciful
with
her
,
and
he
made
her
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
If

so
much
more
from
yourself

how

dealt

It
is
impossible
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
think
of
you
as
being
on
equal
terms
with
me

<EOS>
If
my
mind
could
put
you
on
equal
terms
with
me
,
you
could
not
be
yourself

<EOS>
How
could
I
remember
,
then
,
the
night
when
I
first
saw
you
,
and
when
I
went
out
of
the
room
because
you
looked
at
me
so
attentively
?
<EOS>
Or
,
the
night
that
passed
into
the
morning
when
you
broke
to
me
that
my
father
was
dead
?
<EOS>
Or
,
the
nights
when
you
used
to
come
to
see
me
at
my
next
home
?
<EOS>
Or
,
your
having
known
how
uninstructed
I
was
,
and
having
caused
me
to
be
taught
better
?
<EOS>
Or
,
my
having
so
looked
up
to
you
and
wondered
at
you
,
and
at
first
thought
you
so
good
to
be
at
all
mindful
of
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
`
`
at
first
"
"
thought
me
so
good
,
Lizzie

<EOS>
What
did
you
think
me
after
`
`
at
first
"
"
?
<EOS>
So
bad
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
that
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
that
.
<EOS>
But
after
the
first
wonder
and
pleasure
of
being
noticed
by
one
so
different
from
any
one
who
had
ever
spoken
to
me
,
I
began
to
feel
that
it
might
have
been
better
if
I
had
never
seen
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
were
so
different
,
"
she
answered
in
a
lower
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Because
it
was
so
endless
,
so
hopeless
.
<EOS>
Spare
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
think
for
me
at
all
,
Lizzie

"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
as
if
he
were
a
little
stung
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
much
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
Not
much
until
to
-
night

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
tell
me
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
supposed
until
to
-
night
that
you
needed
to
be
thought
for
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
do
need
to
be
;
if
you
do
truly
feel
at
heart
that
you
have
indeed
been
towards
me
what
you
have
called
yourself
to
-
night
,
and
that
there
is
nothing
for
us
in
this
life
but
separation
;
then
Heaven
help
you
,
and
Heaven
bless
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
purity
with
which
in
these
she
expressed
something
of
her
own
love
and
her
own
suffering
,
made
a
deep
impression
on
him
for
the
passing
time
.
<EOS>
He
held
her
,
almost
as
if
she
were
sanctified
to
him
by
death
,
and
kissed
her
,
once
,
almost
as
he
might
have
kissed
the
dead
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
promised
that
I
would
not
accompany
you
,
nor
follow
you

<EOS>
Shall
I
keep
you
in
view

<EOS>
You
have
been
agitated

and
it
's
growing
dark

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
used
to
be
out
alone
at
this
hour

and
I
entreat
you
not
to
do
so

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
promise
.
<EOS>
I
can
bring
myself
to
promise
nothing
more
to
night
,
Lizzie
,
except
that
I
will
try
what
I
can
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
but
one
means
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
,
of
sparing
yourself
and
of
sparing
me
,
every
way
.
<EOS>
Leave
this
neighbourhood
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
the
words
in
a
grave
voice
,
she
put
her
hand
in
his
,
removed
it
,
and
went
away
by
the
river
-
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
could
Mortimer
believe
this
?
"
<EOS>
murmured
Eugene
,
still
remaining
,
after
a
while
,
where
she
had
left
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Can
I
even
believe
it
myself
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
referred
to
the
circumstance
that
there
were
tears
upon
his
hand
,
as
he
stood
covering
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
A
most
ridiculous
position
this
,
to
be
found
out
in
!
<EOS>
"
was
his
next
thought
.
<EOS>
And
his
next
struck
its
root
in
a
little
rising
resentment
against
the
cause
of
the
tears
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
have
gained
a
wonderful
power
over
her
,
too
,
let
her
be
as
much
in
earnest
as
she
will
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
reflection
brought
back
the
yielding
of
her
face
and
form
as
she
had
drooped
under
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
Contemplating
the
reproduction
,
he
seemed
to
see
,
for
the
second
time
,
in
the
appeal
and
in
the
confession
of
weakness
,
a
little
fear
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
she
loves
me
.
<EOS>
And
so
earnest
a
character
must
be
very
earnest
in
that
passion
.
<EOS>
She
can
not
choose
for
herself
to
be
strong
in
this
fancy
,
wavering
in
that
,
and
weak
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
She
must
go
through
with
her
nature
,
as
I
must
go
through
with
mine
.
<EOS>
If
mine
exacts
its
pains
and
penalties
all
round
,
so
must
hers
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Pursuing
the
inquiry
into
his
own
nature
,
he
thought
,
"
Now
,
if
I
married
her
.
<EOS>
If
,
outfacing
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
in
correspondence
with
M.
R.
F.
,
I
astonished
M.
R.
F.
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
respected
powers
,
by
informing
him
that
I
had
married
her
,
how
would
M.
R.
F.
reason
with
the
legal
mind
?
`
`
You
would
n't
marry
for
some
money
and
some
station
,
because
you
were
frightfully
likely
to
become
bored
.
<EOS>
Are
you
less
frightfully
likely
to
become
bored
,
marrying
for
no
money
and
no
station
?
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
of
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
"
Legal
mind
,
in
spite
of
forensic
protestations
,
must
secretly
admit
,
`
`
Good
reasoning
on
the
part
of
M.
R.
F.
Not
sure
of
myself
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
In
the
very
act
of
calling
this
tone
of
levity
to
his
aid
,
he
felt
it
to
be
profligate
and
worthless
,
and
asserted
her
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
I
should
like
to
see
the
fellow
(
Mortimer
excepted
)
who
would
undertake
to
tell
me
that
this
was
not
a
real
sentiment
on
my
part
,
won
out
of
me
by
her
beauty
and
her
worth
,
in
spite
of
myself
,
and
that
I
would
not
be
true
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
should
particularly
like
to
see
the
fellow
to
-
night
who
would
tell
me
so
,
or
who
would
tell
me
anything
that
could
be
construed
to
her
disadvantage
;
 
for
I
am
wearily
out
of
sorts
with
one
Wrayburn
who
cuts
a
sorry
figure
,
and
I
would
far
rather
be
out
of
sorts
with
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
`
`
Eugene
,
Eugene
,
Eugene
,
this
is
a
bad
business
.
"
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
So
go
the
Mortimer
Lightwood
bells
,
and
they
sound
melancholy
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Strolling
on
,
he
thought
of
something
else
to
take
himself
to
task
for
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
the
analogy
,
Brute
Beast
,
"
he
said
impatiently
,
"
between
a
woman
whom
your
father
coolly
finds
out
for
you
and
a
woman
whom
you
have
found
out
for
yourself
,
and
have
ever
drifted
after
with
more
and
more
of
constancy
since
you
first
set
eyes
upon
her
?
<EOS>
Ass
!
<EOS>
Can
you
reason
no
better
than
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
again
he
subsided
into
a
reminiscence
of
his
first
full
knowledge
of
his
power
just
now
,
and
of
her
disclosure
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
To
try
no
more
to
go
away
,
and
to
try
her
again
,
was
the
reckless
conclusion
it
turned
uppermost
.
<EOS>
And
yet
again
,
"
Eugene
,
Eugene
,
Eugene
,
this
is
a
bad
business
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
"
I
wish
I
could
stop
the
Lightwood
peal
,
<EOS>
for
it
sounds
like
a
knell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Looking
above
,
he
found
that
the
young
moon
was
up
,
and
that
the
stars
were
beginning
to
shine
in
the
sky
from
which
the
tones
of
red
and
yellow
were
flickering
out
,
in
favour
of
the
calm
blue
of
a
summer
night
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
by
the
river
-
side
.
<EOS>
Turning
suddenly
,
he
met
a
man
,
so
close
upon
him
that
Eugene
,
surprised
,
stepped
back
,
to
avoid
a
collision
.
<EOS>
The
man
carried
something
over
his
shoulder
which
might
have
been
a
broken
oar
,
or
spar
,
or
bar
,
and
took
no
notice
of
him
,
but
passed
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Halloa
,
friend
!
<EOS>
"
said
Eugene
,
calling
after
him
,
"
are
you
blind
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
made
no
reply
,
but
went
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
Wrayburn
went
the
opposite
way
,
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
his
purpose
in
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
He
passed
the
sheep
,
and
passed
the
gate
,
and
came
within
hearing
of
the
village
sounds
,
and
came
to
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
The
inn
where
he
stayed
,
like
the
village
and
the
mill
,
was
not
across
the
river
,
but
on
that
side
of
the
stream
on
which
he
walked
.
<EOS>
However
,
knowing
the
rushy
bank
and
the
backwater
on
the
other
side
to
be
a
retired
place
,
and
feeling
out
of
humour
for
noise
or
company
,
he
crossed
the
bridge
,
and
sauntered
on
:
looking
up
at
the
stars
as
they
seemed
one
by
one
to
be
kindled
in
the
sky
,
and
looking
down
at
the
river
as
the
same
stars
seemed
to
be
kindled
deep
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
A
landing
-
place
overshadowed
by
a
willow
,
and
a
pleasure
-
boat
lying
moored
there
among
some
stakes
,
caught
his
eye
as
he
passed
along
.
<EOS>
The
spot
was
in
such
dark
shadow
,
that
he
paused
to
make
out
what
was
there
,
and
then
passed
on
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
rippling
of
the
river
seemed
to
cause
a
correspondent
stir
in
his
uneasy
reflections
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
laid
them
asleep
if
he
could
,
but
they
were
in
movement
,
like
the
stream
,
and
all
tending
one
way
with
a
strong
current
.
<EOS>
As
the
ripple
under
the
moon
broke
unexpectedly
now
and
then
,
and
palely
flashed
in
a
new
shape
and
with
a
new
sound
,
so
parts
of
his
thoughts
started
,
<EOS>
unbidden
,
from
the
rest
,
and
revealed
their
wickedness
.
<EOS>
"
Out
of
the
question
to
marry
her
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
and
out
of
the
question
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
The
crisis
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
sauntered
far
enough
.
<EOS>
Before
turning
to
retrace
his
steps
,
he
stopped
upon
the
margin
,
to
look
down
at
the
reflected
night
.
<EOS>
In
an
instant
,
with
a
dreadful
crash
,
the
reflected
night
turned
crooked
,
flames
shot
jaggedly
across
the
air
,
and
the
moon
and
stars
came
bursting
from
the
sky
.
  
<EOS>
Was
he
struck
by
lightning
?
<EOS>
With
some
incoherent
half
-
formed
thought
to
that
effect
,
he
turned
under
the
blows
that
were
blinding
him
and
mashing
his
life
,
and
closed
with
a
murderer
,
whom
he
caught
by
a
red
neckerchief
---
unless
the
raining
down
of
his
own
blood
gave
it
that
hue
.
  
<EOS>
Eugene
was
light
,
active
,
and
expert
;
but
his
arms
were
broken
,
or
he
was
paralyzed
,
and
could
do
no
more
than
hang
on
to
the
man
,
with
his
head
swung
back
,
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
heaving
sky
.
<EOS>
After
dragging
at
the
assailant
,
he
fell
on
the
bank
with
him
,
and
then
there
was
another
great
crash
,
and
then
a
splash
,
and
all
was
done
.
  
<EOS>
Lizzie
Hexam
,
too
,
had
avoided
the
noise
,
and
the
Saturday
movement
of
people
in
the
straggling
street
,
and
chose
to
walk
alone
by
the
water
until
her
tears
should
be
dry
,
and
she
could
so
compose
herself
as
to
escape
remark
upon
her
looking
ill
or
unhappy
on
going
home
.
<EOS>
The
peaceful
serenity
of
the
hour
and
place
,
having
no
reproaches
or
evil
intentions
within
her
breast
to
contend
against
,
sank
healingly
into
its
depths
.
<EOS>
She
had
meditated
and
taken
comfort
.
<EOS>
She
,
too
,
was
turning
homeward
,
when
she
heard
a
strange
sound
.
  
<EOS>
It
startled
her
,
for
it
was
like
a
sound
of
blows
.
<EOS>
She
stood
still
,
and
listened
.
<EOS>
It
sickened
her
,
for
blows
fell
heavily
and
cruelly
on
the
quiet
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
As
she
listened
,
undecided
,
all
was
silent
.
<EOS>
As
she
yet
listened
,
she
heard
a
faint
groan
,
and
a
fall
into
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
Her
old
bold
life
and
habit
instantly
inspired
her
.
<EOS>
Without
vain
waste
of
breath
in
crying
for
help
where
there
were
none
to
hear
,
she
ran
towards
the
spot
from
which
the
sounds
had
come
.
<EOS>
It
lay
between
her
and
the
bridge
,
but
it
was
more
removed
from
her
than
she
had
thought
;
the
night
being
so
very
quiet
,
and
sound
travelling
far
with
the
help
of
water
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
she
reached
a
part
of
the
green
bank
,
much
and
newly
trodden
,
where
there
lay
some
broken
splintered
pieces
of
wood
and
some
torn
fragments
of
clothes
.
<EOS>
Stooping
,
she
saw
that
the
grass
was
bloody
.
<EOS>
Following
the
drops
and
smears
,
she
saw
that
the
watery
margin
of
the
bank
was
bloody
.
<EOS>
Following
the
current
with
her
eyes
,
she
saw
a
bloody
face
turned
up
towards
the
moon
,
and
drifting
away
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
merciful
Heaven
be
thanked
for
that
old
time
,
and
grant
,
O
Blessed
Lord
,
that
through
thy
wonderful
workings
it
may
turn
to
good
at
last
!
<EOS>
To
whomsoever
the
drifting
face
belongs
,
be
it
man
's
or
woman
's
,
help
my
humble
hands
,
Lord
God
,
to
raise
it
from
death
and
restore
it
to
some
one
to
whom
it
must
be
dear
!
  
<EOS>
It
was
thought
,
fervently
thought
,
but
not
for
a
moment
did
the
prayer
check
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
away
before
it
welled
up
in
her
mind
,
away
,
swift
and
true
,
yet
steady
above
all
---
<EOS>
for
without
steadiness
it
could
never
be
done
---
to
the
landing
-
place
under
the
willow
-
tree
,
where
she
also
had
seen
the
boat
lying
moored
among
the
stakes
.
  
<EOS>
A
sure
touch
of
her
old
practised
hand
,
a
sure
step
of
her
old
practised
foot
,
a
sure
light
balance
of
her
body
,
and
she
was
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
A
quick
glance
of
her
practised
eye
showed
her
,
even
through
the
deep
dark
shadow
,
the
sculls
in
a
rack
against
the
red
-
brick
garden
-
wall
.
<EOS>
Another
moment
,
and
she
had
cast
off
(
taking
the
line
with
her
)
,
and
the
boat
had
shot
out
into
the
moonlight
,
and
she
was
rowing
down
the
stream
as
never
other
woman
rowed
on
English
water
.
  
<EOS>
Intently
over
her
shoulder
,
without
slackening
speed
,
she
looked
ahead
for
the
driving
face
.
<EOS>
She
passed
the
scene
of
the
struggle
---
  
yonder
<EOS>
it
was
,
on
her
left
,
well
over
the
boat
's
stern
---
she
passed
on
her
right
,
the
end
of
the
village
street
,
a
hilly
street
that
almost
dipped
into
the
river
;
its
sounds
were
growing
faint
again
,
and
she
slackened
;
looking
as
the
boat
drove
,
everywhere
,
everywhere
,
for
the
floating
face
.
  
<EOS>
She
merely
kept
the
boat
before
the
stream
now
,
and
rested
on
her
oars
,
knowing
well
that
if
the
face
were
not
soon
visible
,
it
had
gone
down
,
and
she
would
overshoot
it
.
<EOS>
An
untrained
sight
would
never
have
seen
by
the
moonlight
what
she
saw
at
the
length
of
a
few
strokes
astern
.
<EOS>
She
saw
the
drowning
figure
rise
to
the
surface
,
slightly
struggle
,
and
as
if
by
instinct
turn
over
on
its
back
to
float
.
<EOS>
Just
so
had
she
first
dimly
seen
the
face
which
she
now
dimly
saw
again
.
  
<EOS>
Firm
of
look
and
firm
of
purpose
,
she
intently
watched
its
coming
on
,
until
it
was
very
near
;
then
,
with
a
touch
unshipped
her
sculls
,
and
crept
aft
in
the
boat
,
between
kneeling
and
crouching
.
<EOS>
Once
,
she
let
the
body
evade
her
,
not
being
sure
of
her
grasp
.
<EOS>
Twice
,
and
she
had
seized
it
by
its
bloody
hair
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
insensible
,
if
not
virtually
dead
;
it
was
mutilated
,
and
streaked
the
water
all
about
it
with
dark
red
streaks
.
<EOS>
As
it
could
not
help
itself
,
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
get
it
on
board
.
<EOS>
She
bent
over
the
stern
to
secure
it
with
the
line
,
and
then
the
river
and
its
shores
rang
to
the
terrible
cry
she
uttered
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
as
if
possessed
by
supernatural
spirit
and
strength
,
she
lashed
it
safe
,
resumed
her
seat
,
and
rowed
in
,
desperately
,
for
the
nearest
shallow
water
where
she
might
run
the
boat
aground
.
<EOS>
Desperately
,
but
not
wildly
,
for
she
knew
that
if
she
lost
distinctness
of
intention
,
all
was
lost
and
gone
.
  
<EOS>
She
ran
the
boat
ashore
,
went
into
the
water
,
released
him
from
the
line
,
and
by
main
strength
lifted
him
in
her
arms
and
laid
him
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
He
had
fearful
wounds
upon
him
,
and
she
bound
them
up
with
her
dress
torn
into
strips
.
<EOS>
Else
,
supposing
him
to
be
still
alive
,
she
foresaw
that
he
must
bleed
to
death
before
he
could
be
landed
at
his
inn
,
which
was
the
nearest
place
for
succour
.
  
<EOS>
This
done
very
rapidly
,
she
kissed
his
disfigured
forehead
,
looked
up
in
anguish
to
the
stars
,
and
blessed
him
and
forgave
him
,
"
if
she
had
anything
to
forgive
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
only
in
that
instant
that
she
thought
of
herself
,
and
then
she
thought
of
herself
only
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
merciful
Heaven
be
thanked
for
that
old
time
,
enabling
me
,
without
a
wasted
moment
,
to
have
got
the
boat
afloat
again
,
and
to
row
back
against
the
stream
!
<EOS>
And
grant
,
O
Blessed
Lord
God
,
that
through
poor
me
he
may
be
raised
from
death
,
and
preserved
to
some
one
else
to
whom
he
may
be
dear
one
day
,
though
never
dearer
than
to
me
!
  
<EOS>
She
rowed
hard
---
rowed
desperately
,
but
never
wildly
---
and
seldom
removed
her
eyes
from
him
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
.
<EOS>
She
had
so
laid
him
there
,
as
that
she
might
see
his
disfigured
face
;
it
was
so
much
disfigured
that
his
mother
might
have
covered
it
,
but
it
was
above
and
beyond
disfigurement
in
her
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
The
boat
touched
the
edge
of
the
patch
of
inn
lawn
,
sloping
gently
to
the
water
.
<EOS>
There
were
lights
in
the
windows
,
but
there
chanced
to
be
no
one
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
She
made
the
boat
fast
,
and
again
by
main
strength
took
him
up
,
and
never
laid
him
down
until
she
laid
him
down
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Surgeons
were
sent
for
,
and
she
sat
supporting
his
head
.
<EOS>
She
had
oftentimes
heard
in
days
that
were
gone
,
how
doctors
would
lift
the
hand
of
an
insensible
wounded
person
,
and
would
drop
it
if
the
person
were
dead
.
<EOS>
She
waited
for
the
awful
moment
when
the
doctors
might
lift
this
hand
,
all
broken
and
bruised
,
and
let
it
fall
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
of
the
surgeons
came
,
and
asked
,
before
proceeding
to
his
examination
,
"
Who
brought
him
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
brought
him
in
,
sir
,
"
answered
Lizzie
,
at
whom
all
present
looked
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
You
could
not
lift
,
far
less
carry
,
this
weight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
not
,
at
another
time
,
sir
;
but
I
am
sure
I
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
surgeon
looked
at
her
with
great
attention
,
and
with
some
compassion
.
<EOS>
Having
with
a
grave
face
touched
the
wounds
upon
the
head
,
and
the
broken
arms
,
he
took
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
would
he
let
it
drop
?
  
<EOS>
He
appeared
irresolute
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
retain
it
,
but
laid
it
gently
down
,
took
a
candle
,
looked
more
closely
at
the
injuries
on
the
head
,
and
at
the
pupils
of
the
eyes
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
replaced
the
candle
and
took
the
hand
again
.
<EOS>
Another
surgeon
then
coming
in
,
the
two
exchanged
a
whisper
,
and
the
second
took
the
hand
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
he
let
it
fall
at
once
,
but
kept
it
for
a
while
and
laid
it
gently
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Attend
to
the
poor
girl
,
"
said
the
first
surgeon
then
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
quite
unconscious
.
<EOS>
She
sees
nothing
and
hears
nothing
.
<EOS>
All
the
better
for
her
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
rouse
her
,
if
you
can
help
it
;
only
move
her
.
<EOS>
Poor
girl
,
poor
girl
!
<EOS>
She
must
be
amazingly
strong
of
heart
,
but
it
is
much
to
be
feared
that
she
has
set
her
heart
upon
the
dead
.
<EOS>
Be
gentle
with
her
.

<EOS>
BETTER
TO
BE
ABEL
THAN
CAIN

<EOS>
Day
was
breaking
at
Plashwater
Weir
Mill
Lock
.
<EOS>
Stars
were
yet
visible
,
but
there
was
dull
light
in
the
east
that
was
not
the
light
of
night
.
<EOS>
The
moon
had
gone
down
,
and
a
mist
crept
along
the
banks
of
the
river
,
seen
through
which
the
trees
were
the
ghosts
of
trees
,
and
the
water
was
the
ghost
of
water
.
<EOS>
This
earth
looked
spectral
,
and
so
did
the
pale
stars
:
<EOS>
while
the
cold
eastern
glare
,
expressionless
as
to
heat
or
colour
,
with
the
eye
of
the
firmament
quenched
,
might
have
been
likened
to
the
stare
of
the
dead
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
so
likened
by
the
lonely
Bargeman
,
standing
on
the
brink
of
the
lock
.
<EOS>
For
certain
,
Bradley
Headstone
looked
that
way
,
when
a
chill
air
came
up
,
and
when
it
passed
on
murmuring
,
as
if
it
whispered
something
that
made
the
phantom
trees
and
water
tremble
---
or
threaten
---
for
fancy
might
have
made
it
either
.
  
<EOS>
He
turned
away
,
and
tried
the
Lock
-
house
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
fastened
on
the
inside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
afraid
of
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
,
knocking
.
  
<EOS>
Rogue
Riderhood
was
soon
roused
,
and
soon
undrew
the
bolt
and
let
him
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
T'otherest
,
I
thought
you
had
been
and
got
lost
!
<EOS>
Two
nights
away
!
<EOS>
I
a'most
believed
as
you
'd
giv
'
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
the
slip
,
and
<EOS>
I
had
as
good
as
half
a
mind
for
to
advertise
you
in
the
newspapers
to
come
for'ard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
's
face
turned
so
dark
on
this
hint
,
that
Riderhood
deemed
it
expedient
to
soften
it
into
a
compliment
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
not
you
,
governor
,
not
you
,
"
he
went
on
,
stolidly
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
For
what
did
I
say
to
myself
after
having
amused
myself
with
that
<EOS>
there
stretch
of
a
comic
idea
,
as
a
sort
of
a
playful
game
?
<EOS>
Why
,
I
says
to
myself
,
`
`
He
's
a
man
o
'
honor
.
"
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
says
to
myself
.
`
<EOS>
`
He
's
<EOS>
a
man
o
'
double
honor
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
Very
remarkably
,
Riderhood
put
no
question
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
looked
at
him
on
opening
the
door
,
and
he
now
looked
at
him
again
(
stealthily
this
time
)
,
and
the
result
of
his
looking
was
,
that
he
asked
him
no
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
for
another
forty
on
'em
,
governor
,
as
I
judges
,
afore
you
turns
your
mind
to
breakfast
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
when
his
visitor
sat
down
,
resting
his
chin
on
his
hand
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
And
very
remarkably
again
:
Riderhood
feigned
to
set
the
scanty
furniture
in
order
,
while
he
spoke
,
to
have
a
show
of
reason
for
not
looking
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
had
better
sleep
,
I
think
,
"
said
Bradley
,
without
changing
his
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
myself
should
recommend
it
,
governor
,
<EOS>
"
assented
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Might
you
be
anyways
dry
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
a
drink
,
"
said
Bradley
;
but
without
appearing
to
attend
much
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Riderhood
got
out
his
bottle
,
and
fetched
his
jug
-
full
of
water
,
and
administered
a
potation
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
shook
the
coverlet
of
his
bed
and
spread
it
smooth
,
and
Bradley
stretched
himself
upon
it
in
the
clothes
he
wore
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Riderhood
poetically
remarking
that
he
would
pick
the
bones
of
his
night
's
rest
,
in
his
wooden
chair
,
sat
in
the
window
as
before
;
but
,
as
before
,
watched
the
sleeper
narrowly
until
he
was
very
sound
asleep
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
rose
and
looked
at
him
close
,
in
the
bright
daylight
,
on
every
side
,
with
great
minuteness
.
<EOS>
He
went
out
to
his
Lock
to
sum
up
what
he
had
seen
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
of
his
sleeves
is
tore
right
away
below
the
elber
,
and
the
t'other
's
had
a
good
rip
at
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
hung
on
to
,
pretty
tight
,
for
his
shirt
's
all
tore
out
of
the
neck
-
gathers
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
in
the
grass
and
he
's
been
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
And
he
's
spotted
,
and
I
know
with
what
,
and
with
whose
.
<EOS>
Hooroar
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
slept
long
.
<EOS>
Early
in
the
afternoon
a
barge
came
down
.
<EOS>
Other
barges
had
passed
through
,
both
ways
,
before
it
;
but
the
Lock
-
keeper
hailed
only
this
particular
barge
,
for
news
,
as
if
he
had
made
a
time
calculation
with
some
nicety
.
<EOS>
The
men
on
board
told
him
a
piece
of
news
,
and
there
was
a
lingering
on
their
part
to
enlarge
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
Twelve
hours
had
intervened
since
Bradley
's
lying
down
,
when
he
got
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
that
I
swaller
it
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
squinting
at
his
Lock
,
when
he
saw
Bradley
coming
out
of
the
house
,
"
as
you
've
been
a
sleeping
all
the
time
,
old
boy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
came
to
him
,
sitting
on
his
wooden
lever
,
and
asked
what
o'clock
it
was
?
<EOS>
Riderhood
told
him
it
was
between
two
and
three
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
are
you
relieved
?
"
asked
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
Day
after
to
-
morrow
,
governor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
sooner
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
inch
sooner
,
governor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
both
sides
,
importance
seemed
attached
to
this
question
of
relief
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
quite
petted
his
reply
;
saying
a
second
time
,
and
prolonging
a
negative
roll
of
his
head
,
"
n
---
<EOS>
n
---
not
a
inch
sooner
,
governor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
I
tell
you
I
was
going
on
to
-
night
?
"
asked
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
governor
,
"
returned
Riderhood
,
in
a
cheerful
,
affable
,
and
conversational
manner
,
"
you
did
not
tell
me
so
.
<EOS>
But
most
like
you
meant
to
it
and
forgot
to
it
.
<EOS>
How
,
otherways
,
could
a
doubt
have
come
into
your
head
about
it
,
governor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
the
sun
goes
down
,
I
intend
to
go
on
,
"
said
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
much
the
more
necessairy
is
a
Peck
,
"
returned
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
and
have
it
,
T'otherest
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
formality
of
spreading
a
tablecloth
not
being
observed
in
Mr.
Riderhood
's
establishment
,
the
serving
of
the
"
peck
"
was
the
affair
of
a
moment
;
it
merely
consisting
in
the
handing
down
of
a
capacious
baking
dish
with
three
-
fourths
of
an
immense
meat
pie
in
it
,
and
the
production
of
two
pocket
-
knives
,
an
earthenware
mug
,
and
a
large
brown
bottle
of
beer
.
  
<EOS>
Both
ate
and
drank
,
but
Riderhood
much
the
more
abundantly
.
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
plates
,
that
honest
man
cut
two
triangular
pieces
from
the
thick
crust
of
the
pie
,
and
laid
them
,
inside
uppermost
,
upon
the
table
:
the
one
before
himself
,
and
the
other
before
his
guest
.
<EOS>
Upon
these
platters
he
placed
two
goodly
portions
of
the
contents
of
the
pie
,
thus
imparting
the
unusual
interest
to
the
entertainment
that
each
partaker
scooped
out
the
inside
of
his
plate
,
and
consumed
it
with
his
other
fare
,
besides
having
the
sport
of
pursuing
the
clots
of
congealed
gravy
over
the
plain
of
the
table
,
and
successfully
taking
them
into
his
mouth
at
last
from
the
blade
of
his
knife
,
in
case
of
their
not
first
sliding
off
it
.
  
<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
was
so
remarkably
awkward
at
these
exercises
,
that
the
Rogue
observed
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
out
,
T'otherest
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
you
'll
cut
your
hand
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
caution
came
too
late
,
for
Bradley
gashed
it
at
the
instant
.
<EOS>
And
,
what
was
more
unlucky
,
in
asking
Riderhood
to
tie
it
up
,
and
in
standing
close
to
him
for
the
purpose
,
he
shook
his
hand
under
the
smart
of
the
wound
,
and
shook
blood
over
Riderhood
's
dress
.
  
<EOS>
When
dinner
was
done
,
and
when
what
remained
of
the
platters
and
what
remained
of
the
congealed
gravy
had
been
put
back
into
what
remained
of
the
pie
,
which
served
as
an
economical
investment
for
all
miscellaneous
savings
,
Riderhood
filled
the
mug
with
beer
and
took
a
long
drink
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
did
look
at
Bradley
,
and
with
an
evil
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
T'otherest
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
hoarsely
,
as
he
bent
across
the
table
to
touch
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
news
has
gone
down
the
river
afore
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
news
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
do
you
think
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
with
a
hitch
of
his
head
,
<EOS>
as
if
he
disdainfully
jerked
the
feint
away
,
"
picked
up
the
body
?
<EOS>
Guess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
good
at
guessing
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
did
.
<EOS>
Hooroar
!
<EOS>
You
had
him
there
again
.
<EOS>
She
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
convulsive
twitching
of
Bradley
Headstone
's
face
,
and
the
sudden
hot
humour
that
broke
out
upon
it
,
showed
how
grimly
the
intelligence
touched
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
said
not
a
single
word
,
good
or
bad
.
<EOS>
He
only
smiled
in
a
lowering
manner
,
and
got
up
and
stood
leaning
at
the
window
,
looking
through
it
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
followed
him
with
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
cast
down
his
eyes
on
his
own
besprinkled
clothes
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
began
to
have
an
air
of
being
better
at
a
guess
than
Bradley
owned
to
being
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
so
long
in
want
of
rest
,
"
said
the
school
-
master
,
"
that
with
your
leave
I
'll
lie
down
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
welcome
,
T'otherest
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
hospitable
answer
of
his
host
.
<EOS>
He
had
laid
himself
down
without
waiting
for
it
,
and
he
remained
upon
the
bed
until
the
sun
was
low
.
<EOS>
When
he
arose
and
came
out
to
resume
his
journey
,
he
found
his
host
waiting
for
him
on
the
grass
by
the
towing
-
path
outside
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Whenever
it
may
be
necessary
that
you
and
I
should
have
any
further
communication
together
,
"
said
Bradley
,
"
I
will
come
back
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
since
no
better
can
be
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
turning
on
his
heel
,
"
Good
-
night
!
<EOS>
"
But
he
turned
again
as
the
other
set
forth
,
and
added
under
his
breath
,
looking
after
him
with
a
leer
:
"
You
would
n't
be
let
to
go
like
that
,
if
my
Relief
warn't
<EOS>
as
good
as
come
.
<EOS>
I
'll
catch
you
up
in
a
mile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
his
real
time
of
relief
being
that
evening
at
sunset
,
his
mate
came
lounging
in
,
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Not
staying
to
fill
up
the
utmost
margin
of
his
time
,
but
borrowing
an
hour
or
so
,
to
be
repaid
again
when
he
should
relieve
his
reliever
,
Riderhood
straightway
followed
on
the
track
of
Bradley
Headstone
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
better
follower
than
Bradley
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
the
calling
of
his
life
to
slink
and
skulk
and
dog
and
waylay
,
and
he
knew
his
calling
well
.
<EOS>
He
effected
such
a
forced
march
on
leaving
the
Lock
House
that
he
was
close
up
with
him
---
that
is
to
say
,
as
close
up
with
him
as
he
deemed
it
convenient
to
be
---
before
another
Lock
was
passed
.
<EOS>
His
man
looked
back
pretty
often
as
he
went
,
but
got
no
hint
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
how
to
take
advantage
of
the
ground
,
and
where
to
put
the
hedge
between
them
,
and
where
the
wall
,
and
when
to
duck
,
and
when
to
drop
,
and
had
a
thousand
arts
beyond
the
doomed
Bradley
's
slow
conception
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
all
his
arts
were
brought
to
a
standstill
,
like
himself
,
when
Bradley
,
turning
into
a
green
lane
or
riding
by
the
river
-
side
---
a
solitary
spot
run
wild
in
nettles
,
briars
,
and
brambles
,
and
encumbered
with
the
scathed
trunks
of
a
whole
hedgerow
of
felled
trees
,
on
the
outskirts
of
a
little
wood
---
began
stepping
on
these
trunks
and
dropping
down
among
them
and
stepping
on
them
again
,
apparently
as
a
schoolboy
might
have
done
,
but
assuredly
with
no
schoolboy
purpose
,
or
want
of
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
up
to
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
Riderhood
,
down
in
the
ditch
,
and
holding
the
hedge
a
little
open
with
both
hands
.
<EOS>
And
soon
his
actions
made
a
most
extraordinary
reply
.
"
<EOS>
By
George
and
the
Draggin
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Riderhood
,
"
if
he
ai
n't
a
going
to
bathe
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
passed
back
,
on
and
among
the
trunks
of
trees
again
,
and
had
passed
on
to
the
water
-
side
and
had
begun
undressing
on
the
grass
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
it
had
a
suspicious
look
of
suicide
,
arranged
to
counterfeit
accident
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
would
n't
have
fetched
a
bundle
under
your
arm
,
from
among
that
timber
,
if
such
was
your
game
!
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
it
was
a
relief
to
him
when
the
bather
after
a
plunge
and
a
few
strokes
came
out
.
<EOS>
"
For
I
should
n't
,
"
he
said
in
a
feeling
manner
,
"
have
liked
to
lose
you
till
I
had
made
more
money
out
of
you
neither
.
"
  
<EOS>
Prone
in
another
ditch
(
he
had
changed
his
ditch
as
his
man
had
changed
his
position
)
,
and
holding
apart
so
small
a
patch
of
the
hedge
that
the
sharpest
eyes
could
not
have
detected
him
,
Rogue
Riderhood
watched
the
bather
dressing
.
<EOS>
And
now
gradually
came
the
wonder
that
he
stood
up
,
completely
clothed
,
another
man
,
and
not
the
Bargeman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Much
as
you
was
dressed
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
see
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
taking
me
with
you
,
now
.
<EOS>
You
're
deep
.
<EOS>
But
I
knows
a
deeper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
bather
had
finished
dressing
,
he
kneeled
on
the
grass
,
doing
something
with
his
hands
,
and
again
stood
up
with
his
bundle
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Looking
all
around
him
with
great
attention
,
he
then
went
to
the
river
's
edge
,
and
flung
it
in
as
far
,
and
yet
as
lightly
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
he
was
so
decidedly
upon
his
way
again
as
to
be
beyond
a
bend
of
the
river
and
for
the
time
out
of
view
,
that
Riderhood
scrambled
from
the
ditch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
was
his
debate
with
himself
,
"
shall
I
foller
you
on
,
or
shall
I
let
you
loose
for
this
once
,
and
go
a
fishing
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
debate
continuing
,
he
followed
,
as
a
precautionary
measure
in
any
case
,
and
got
him
again
in
sight
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
was
to
let
you
loose
this
once
,
"
said
Riderhood
then
,
still
following
,
"
I
could
make
you
come
to
me
again
,
or
I
could
find
you
out
in
one
way
or
another
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
n't
to
go
a
fishing
,
others
might
.
<EOS>
---
I
'll
let
you
loose
this
once
,
and
go
a
fishing
!
"
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
suddenly
dropped
the
pursuit
and
turned
.
  
<EOS>
The
miserable
man
whom
he
had
released
for
the
time
,
but
not
for
long
,
went
on
towards
London
.
<EOS>
Bradley
was
suspicious
of
every
sound
he
heard
,
and
of
every
face
he
saw
,
but
was
under
a
spell
which
very
commonly
falls
upon
the
shedder
of
blood
,
and
had
no
suspicion
of
the
real
danger
that
lurked
in
his
life
,
and
would
have
it
yet
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
was
much
in
his
thoughts
---
had
never
been
out
of
his
thoughts
since
the
night
-
adventure
of
their
first
meeting
;
but
Riderhood
occupied
a
very
different
place
there
,
from
the
place
of
pursuer
;
 
and
Bradley
had
been
at
the
pains
of
devising
so
many
means
of
fitting
that
place
to
him
,
and
of
wedging
him
into
it
,
that
his
mind
could
not
compass
the
possibility
of
his
occupying
any
other
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
another
spell
against
which
the
shedder
of
blood
for
ever
strives
in
vain
.
<EOS>
There
are
fifty
doors
by
which
discovery
may
enter
.
<EOS>
With
infinite
pains
and
cunning
,
he
double
locks
and
bars
forty
-
nine
of
them
,
and
can
not
see
the
fiftieth
standing
wide
open
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
too
,
was
he
cursed
with
a
state
of
mind
more
wearing
and
more
wearisome
than
remorse
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
remorse
;
but
the
evildoer
who
can
hold
that
avenger
at
bay
,
can
not
escape
the
slower
torture
of
incessantly
doing
the
evil
deed
again
and
doing
it
more
efficiently
.
<EOS>
In
the
defensive
declarations
and
pretended
confessions
of
murderers
,
the
pursuing
shadow
of
this
torture
may
be
traced
through
every
lie
they
tell
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
done
it
as
alleged
,
is
it
conceivable
that
I
would
have
made
this
and
this
mistake
?
<EOS>
If
I
had
done
it
as
alleged
,
should
I
have
left
that
unguarded
place
which
that
false
and
wicked
witness
against
me
so
infamously
deposed
to
?
<EOS>
The
state
of
that
wretch
who
continually
finds
the
weak
spots
in
his
own
crime
,
and
strives
to
strengthen
them
when
it
is
unchangeable
,
is
a
state
that
aggravates
the
offence
by
doing
the
deed
a
thousand
times
instead
of
once
;
but
it
is
a
state
,
too
,
that
tauntingly
visits
the
offence
upon
a
sullen
unrepentant
nature
with
its
heaviest
punishment
every
time
.
  
<EOS>
Bradley
toiled
on
,
chained
heavily
to
the
idea
of
his
hatred
and
his
vengeance
,
and
thinking
how
he
might
have
satiated
both
in
many
better
ways
than
the
way
he
had
taken
.
<EOS>
The
instrument
might
have
been
better
,
the
spot
and
the
hour
might
have
been
better
chosen
.
<EOS>
To
batter
a
man
down
from
behind
in
the
dark
,
on
the
brink
of
a
river
,
was
well
enough
,
but
he
ought
to
have
been
instantly
disabled
,
whereas
he
had
turned
and
seized
his
assailant
;
 
and
so
,
to
end
it
before
chance
-
help
came
,
and
to
be
rid
of
him
,
he
had
been
hurriedly
thrown
backward
into
the
river
before
the
life
was
fully
beaten
out
of
him
.
<EOS>
Now
if
it
could
be
done
again
,
it
must
not
be
so
done
.
<EOS>
Supposing
his
head
had
been
held
down
under
water
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
Supposing
the
first
blow
had
been
truer
.
<EOS>
Supposing
he
had
been
shot
.
<EOS>
Supposing
he
had
been
strangled
.
<EOS>
Suppose
this
way
,
that
way
,
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
Suppose
anything
but
getting
unchained
from
the
one
idea
,
for
that
was
inexorably
impossible
.
  
<EOS>
The
school
reopened
next
day
.
<EOS>
The
scholars
saw
little
or
no
change
in
their
master
's
face
,
for
it
always
wore
its
slowly
labouring
expression
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
heard
his
classes
,
he
was
always
doing
the
deed
and
doing
it
better
.
<EOS>
As
he
paused
with
his
piece
of
chalk
at
the
black
board
before
writing
on
it
,
he
was
thinking
of
the
spot
,
and
whether
the
water
was
not
deeper
and
the
fall
straighter
,
a
little
higher
up
,
or
a
little
lower
down
.
<EOS>
He
had
half
a
mind
to
draw
a
line
or
two
upon
the
board
,
and
show
himself
what
he
meant
.
<EOS>
He
was
doing
it
again
and
improving
on
the
manner
,
at
prayers
,
in
his
mental
arithmetic
,
all
through
his
questioning
,
all
through
the
day
.

Charley
Hexam
was
a
master
now
,
in
another
school
,
under
another
head
.
<EOS>
It
was
evening
,
and
Bradley
was
walking
in
his
garden
observed
from
behind
a
blind
by
gentle
little
Miss
Peecher
,
who
contemplated
offering
him
a
loan
of
her
smelling
salts
for
headache
,
when
Mary
Anne
,
in
faithful
attendance
,
held
up
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes

Mary
Anne

"
  
<EOS>
"
Young
Mr.

<EOS>

Very

<EOS>
Again
Mary

held
up
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
speak
,
Mary
Anne
?
"
  
"
Mr.
Headstone
has
beckoned
young
Mr.
Hexam
into
his
house
,
ma'am
,
and
he
has
gone
in
himself
without
waiting
for
young
Mr.
Hexam
to
come
up
,
and
now
he
has
gone
in
too
,
ma'am
,
and
has
shut
the
door

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
my

Mary

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
Mary
Anne
's
telegraphic
arm
worked
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
more
,
Mary
Anne
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
must
find
it
rather
dull
and
dark
,
Miss
Peecher
,
for
the
parlour
blind
's
down
,
and
neither
of
them
pulls
it
up

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
accounting

"
said
good
Miss
Peecher
with
a
little
sad
sigh
which
she
repressed
by
laying
her
hand
on
her
neat
methodical
boddice
,
"
there
is
no
accounting
for
tastes

Mary
Anne

"
  
<EOS>
Charley
,
entering
the
dark
room
,
stopped
short
when
he
saw
his
old
friend
in
its
yellow
shade
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
Hexam
,
come
in

"
  
<EOS>
Charley
advanced
to
take
the
hand
that
was
held
out
to
him
;
but
stopped
again
,
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
heavy
,
bloodshot
eyes
of
the
schoolmaster
,
rising
to
his
face
with
an
effort
,
met
his
look
of
scrutiny
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Headstone
,
what
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Matter

<EOS>
Where
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Headstone
,
have
you
heard
the
news
?
<EOS>
This
news
about
the
fellow
,
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
?
<EOS>
That
he
is
killed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
dead
,
then
!
"
exclaimed
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
Young
Hexam
standing
looking
at
him
,
he
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue
,
looked
about
the
room
,
glanced
at
his
former
pupil
,
and
looked
down
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
of
the
outrage
,
"
said
Bradley
,
trying
to
constrain
his
working
mouth
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
had
not
heard
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
were
you
,
"
said
the
boy
,
advancing
a
step
as
he
lowered
his
voice
,
"
when
it
was
done
?
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
that
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
force
your
confidence
upon
me
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
I
'll
give
up
every
word
of
it
.
<EOS>
Mind
!
<EOS>
Take
notice
.
<EOS>
I
'll
give
up
it
,
and
I
'll
give
up
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
wretched
creature
seemed
to
suffer
acutely
under
this
renunciation
.
<EOS>
A
desolate
air
of
utter
and
complete
loneliness
fell
upon
him
,
like
a
visible
shade
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
for
me
to
speak
,
not
you
,
"
said
the
boy
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
,
you
'll
do
it
at
your
peril
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
put
your
selfishness
before
you
,
Mr.
Headstone
---
your
passionate
,
violent
,
and
ungovernable
selfishness
 
---
to
show
you
why
I
can
,
and
why
I
will
,
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you

"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
young
Hexam
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
a
scholar
to
go
on
with
a
lesson
that
he
knew
by
heart
and
was
deadly
tired
of
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
said
his
last
word
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
any
part
---
I
do
n't
say
what
---
in
this
attack
,
"
pursued
the
boy
;
"
or
if
you
know
anything
about
it
---
I
do
n't
say
how
much
---
  
or
if
you
know
who
did
it
<EOS>
---
I
go
no
closer
---
you
did
an
injury
to
me
that
's
never
to
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
took
you
with
me
to
his
chambers
in
the
Temple
when
I
told
him
my
opinion
of
him
,
and
made
myself
responsible
for
my
opinion
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
took
you
with
me
when
I
was
watching
him
with
a
view
to
recovering
my
sister
and
bringing
her
to
her
senses
;
you
know
that
I
have
allowed
myself
to
be
mixed
up
with
you
,
all
through
this
business
,
in
favouring
your
desire
to
marry
my
sister
.
<EOS>
And
how
do
you
know
that
,
pursuing
the
ends
of
your
own
violent
temper
,
you
have
not
laid
me
open
to
suspicion
?
<EOS>
Is
that
your
gratitude
to
me
,
Mr.
Headstone
?
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
sat
looking
steadily
before
him
at
the
vacant
air
.
<EOS>
As
often
as
young
Hexam
stopped
,
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
him
,
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
him
to
go
on
with
the
lesson
,
and
get
it
done
.
<EOS>
As
often
as
the
boy
resumed
,
Bradley
resumed
his
fixed
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
be
plain
with
you
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
"
said
young
Hexam
,
shaking
his
head
in
a
half
-
threatening
manner
,
"
because
this
is
no
time
for
affecting
not
to
know
things
that
I
do
know
---
except
certain
things
at
which
it
might
not
be
very
safe
for
you
,
to
hint
again
.
<EOS>
What
I
mean
is
this
:
if
you
were
a
good
master
,
I
was
a
good
pupil
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
you
plenty
of
credit
,
and
in
improving
my
own
reputation
I
have
improved
yours
quite
as
much
.
<EOS>
Very
well
then
.
<EOS>
Starting
on
equal
terms
,
I
want
to
put
before
you
how
you
have
shown
your
gratitude
to
me
,
for
doing
all
I
could
to
further
your
wishes
with
reference
to
my
sister
.
<EOS>
You
have
compromised
me
by
being
seen
about
with
me
,
endeavouring
to
counteract
this
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
first
thing
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
If
my
character
,
and
my
now
dropping
you
,
help
me
out
of
that
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
the
deliverance
is
to
be
attributed
to
me
,
and
not
to
you
.
<EOS>
No
thanks
to
you
for
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
boy
stopping
again
,
he
moved
his
eyes
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
on
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
do
n't
you
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
on
to
the
end
,
and
I
have
told
you
beforehand
what
the
end
is
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
know
my
story
.
<EOS>
You
are
as
well
aware
as
I
am
,
that
I
have
had
many
disadvantages
to
leave
behind
me
in
life
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
me
mention
my
father
,
and
you
are
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
the
home
from
which
I
,
as
I
may
say
,
escaped
,
might
have
been
a
more
creditable
one
than
it
was
.
<EOS>
My
father
died
,
and
then
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
my
way
to
respectability
was
pretty
clear
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
For
then
my
sister
begins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
as
confidently
,
and
with
as
entire
an
absence
of
any
tell
-
tale
colour
in
his
cheek
,
as
if
there
were
no
softening
old
time
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Not
wonderful
,
for
there
was
none
in
his
hollow
empty
heart
.
<EOS>
What
is
there
but
self
,
for
selfishness
to
see
behind
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
speak
of
my
sister
,
I
devoutly
wish
that
you
had
never
seen
her
,
Mr.
Headstone
.
<EOS>
However
,
you
did
see
her
,
and
that
's
useless
now
.
<EOS>
I
confided
in
you
about
her
.
<EOS>
I
explained
her
character
to
you
,
and
how
she
interposed
some
ridiculous
fanciful
notions
in
the
way
of
our
being
as
respectable
as
I
tried
for
.
<EOS>
You
fell
in
love
with
her
,
and
I
favoured
you
with
all
my
might
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
be
induced
to
favour
you
,
and
so
we
came
into
collision
with
this
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
have
you
done
?
<EOS>
Why
,
you
have
justified
my
sister
in
being
firmly
set
against
you
from
first
to
last
,
and
you
have
put
me
in
the
wrong
again
!
<EOS>
And
why
have
you
done
it
?
<EOS>
Because
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
you
are
in
all
your
passions
so
selfish
,
and
so
concentrated
upon
yourself
,
that
you
have
not
bestowed
one
proper
thought
on
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
cool
conviction
with
which
the
boy
took
up
and
held
his
position
,
could
have
been
derived
from
no
other
vice
in
human
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
he
went
on
,
actually
with
tears
,
"
an
extraordinary
circumstance
attendant
on
my
life
,
that
every
effort
I
make
towards
perfect
respectability
,
is
impeded
by
somebody
else
through
no
fault
of
mine
!
<EOS>
Not
content
with
doing
what
I
have
put
before
you
,
you
will
drag
my
name
into
notoriety
through
dragging
my
sister
's
---
  
which
you
are
pretty
sure
to
do
,
if
my
suspicions
have
any
foundation
at
all
---
and
the
worse
you
prove
to
be
,
the
harder
it
will
be
for
me
to
detach
myself
from
being
associated
with
you
in
people
's
minds
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
he
had
dried
his
eyes
and
heaved
a
sob
over
his
injuries
,
he
began
moving
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
However
,
I
have
made
up
my
mind
that
I
will
become
respectable
in
the
scale
of
society
,
and
that
I
will
not
be
dragged
down
by
others
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
with
my
sister
as
well
as
with
you
.
<EOS>
Since
she
cares
so
little
for
me
as
to
care
nothing
for
undermining
my
respectability
,
she
shall
go
her
way
<EOS>
and
I
will
go
mine
.
<EOS>
My
prospects
are
very
good
,
and
I
mean
to
follow
them
alone
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Headstone
,
I
do
n't
say
what
you
have
got
upon
your
conscience
,
for
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Whatever
lies
upon
it
,
I
hope
you
will
see
the
justice
of
keeping
wide
and
clear
of
me
,
and
will
find
a
consolation
in
completely
exonerating
all
but
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
before
many
years
are
out
,
to
succeed
the
master
in
my
present
school
,
and
the
mistress
being
a
single
woman
,
though
some
years
older
than
I
am
,
I
might
even
marry
her
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
any
comfort
to
you
to
know
what
plans
I
may
work
out
by
keeping
myself
strictly
respectable
in
the
scale
of
society
,
these
are
the
plans
at
present
occurring
to
me
.
<EOS>
In
conclusion
,
if
you
feel
a
sense
of
having
injured
me
,
and
a
desire
to
make
some
small
reparation
,
I
hope
you
will
think
how
respectable
you
might
have
been
yourself
,
and
will
contemplate
your
blighted
existence
.
"
  
<EOS>
Was
it
strange
that
the
wretched
man
should
take
this
heavily
to
heart
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
taken
the
boy
to
heart
,
first
,
through
some
long
laborious
years
;
perhaps
through
the
same
years
he
had
found
his
drudgery
lightened
by
communication
with
a
brighter
and
more
apprehensive
spirit
than
his
own
;
perhaps
a
family
resemblance
of
face
and
voice
between
the
boy
and
his
sister
,
smote
him
hard
in
the
gloom
of
his
fallen
state
.
<EOS>
For
whichsoever
reason
,
or
for
all
,
he
drooped
his
devoted
head
when
the
boy
was
gone
,
and
shrank
together
on
the
floor
,
and
grovelled
there
,
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
tight
-
clasping
his
hot
temples
,
in
unutterable
misery
,
and
unrelieved
by
a
single
tear
.
  
<EOS>
Rogue
Riderhood
had
been
busy
with
the
river
that
day
.
<EOS>
He
had
fished
with
assiduity
on
the
previous
evening
,
but
the
light
was
short
,
and
he
had
fished
unsuccessfully
.
<EOS>
He
had
fished
again
that
day
with
better
luck
,
and
had
carried
his
fish
home
to
Plashwater
Weir
Mill
Lock
-
house
,
in
a
bundle
.
   
<EOS>
A
FEW

OF

<EOS>
The
dolls
'
dressmaker
went
no
more
to
the
business
-
premises
of
Pubsey
and
Co.
in
St.
Mary
Axe
,
after
chance
had
disclosed
to
her
(
as
she
supposed
)
<EOS>
the
flinty
and
hypocritical
character
of
Mr.
Riah
.
<EOS>
She
often
moralized
over
her
work
on
the
tricks
and
the
manners
of
that
venerable
cheat
,
but
made
her
little
purchases
elsewhere
,
and
lived
a
secluded
life
.
<EOS>
After
much
consultation
with
herself
,
she
decided
not
to
put
Lizzie
Hexam
on
her
guard
against
the
old
man
,
arguing
that
the
disappointment
of
finding
him
out
would
come
upon
her
quite
soon
enough
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
in
her
communication
with
her
friend
by
letter
,
she
was
silent
on
this
theme
,
and
principally
dilated
on
the
backslidings
of
her
bad
child
,
who
every
day
grew
worse
and
worse
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wicked
old
boy
,
"
Miss
Wren
would
say
to
him
,
with
a
menacing
forefinger
,
"
you
'll
force
me
to
run
away
from
you
,
after
all
,
you
will
;
and
then
you
'll
shake
to
bits
,
and
there
'll
be
nobody
to
pick
up
the
pieces
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
foreshadowing
of
a
desolate
decease
,
the
wicked
old
boy
would
whine
and
whimper
,
and
would
sit
shaking
himself
into
the
lowest
of
low
spirits
,
until
such
time
as
he
could
shake
himself
out
of
the
house
and
shake
another
threepennyworth
into
himself
.
<EOS>
But
dead
drunk
or
dead
sober
(
he
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
he
was
least
alive
in
the
latter
state
)
,
it
was
always
on
the
conscience
of
the
paralytic
scarecrow
that
he
had
betrayed
his
sharp
parent
for
sixty
threepennyworths
of
rum
,
which
were
all
gone
,
and
that
her
sharpness
would
infallibly
detect
his
having
done
it
,
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
All
things
considered
therefore
,
and
addition
made
of
the
state
of
his
body
to
the
state
of
his
mind
,
the
bed
on
which
Mr.
Dolls
reposed
was
a
bed
of
roses
from
which
the
flowers
and
leaves
had
entirely
faded
,
leaving
him
to
lie
upon
the
thorns
and
stalks
.
  
<EOS>
On
a
certain
day
,
Miss
Wren
was
alone
at
her
work
,
with
the
house
-
door
set
open
for
coolness
,
and
was
trolling
in
a
small
sweet
voice
a
mournful
little
song
which
might
have
been
the
song
of
the
doll
she
was
dressing
,
bemoaning
the
brittleness
and
meltability
of
wax
,
when
whom
should
she
descry
standing
on
the
pavement
,
looking
in
at
her
,
but
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
Fledgeby
,
coming
up
the
two
steps
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
?
"
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
retorted
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
thought
it
was
you
,
young
man
.
<EOS>
Quite
a
coincidence
.
<EOS>
You
're
not
mistaken
,
and
I
'm
not
mistaken
.
<EOS>
How
clever
we
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
and
how
are
you
?
"
said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
pretty
much
as
usual
,
sir
,
"
replied
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
A
very
unfortunate
parent
,
worried
out
of
my
life
and
senses
by
a
very
bad
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fledgeby
's
small
eyes
opened
so
wide
that
they
might
have
passed
for
ordinary
-
sized
eyes
,
as
he
stared
about
him
for
the
very
young
person
whom
he
supposed
to
be
in
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
're
not
a
parent
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
"
and
consequently
it
's
of
no
use
talking
to
you
upon
a
family
subject
.
<EOS>
---
To
what
am
I
to
attribute
the
honor
and
favor
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
To
a
wish
to
improve
your
acquaintance
,
"
Mr.
Fledgeby
replied
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
,
stopping
to
bite
her
thread
,
looked
at
him
very
knowingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
never
meet
now
,
"
said
Fledgeby
;
"
do
we
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
chopping
off
the
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
I
had
a
mind
,
"
pursued
Fledgeby
,
"
to
come
and
have
a
talk
with
you
about
our
dodging
friend
,
the
child
of
Israel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
he
gave
you
my
address
;
did
he
?
"
asked
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
got
it
out
of
him
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
with
a
stammer
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
see
a
good
deal
of
him
,
"
remarked
Miss
Wren
,
with
shrewd
distrust
.
"
<EOS>
A
good
deal
of
him
<EOS>
you
seem
to
see
,
considering
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Considering
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
n't
you
,
"
inquired
the
dressmaker
,
bending
over
the
doll
on
which
her
art
was
being
exercised
,
"
done
interceding
with
him
yet
?
"
  
"
No
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
shaking
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
La
!
Been
interceding
with
him
all
this
time
,
and
sticking
to
him
still
?
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
busy
with
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sticking
to
him
is
the
word
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
pursued
her
occupation
with
a
concentrated
air
,
and
asked
,
after
an
interval
of
silent
industry
:
  
"
Are
you
in
the
army
?
"
  
"
Not
exactly
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
rather
flattered
by
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
Navy
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
N
---
<EOS>
no
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
He
qualified
these
two
negatives
,
as
if
he
were
not
absolutely
in
either
service
,
but
was
almost
in
both
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
then
?
"
demanded
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
gentleman
,
I
am
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
assented
Jenny
,
screwing
up
her
mouth
with
an
appearance
of
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
That
accounts
for
your
having
so
much
time
to
give
to
interceding
.
<EOS>
But
only
to
think
how
kind
and
friendly
<EOS>
a
gentleman
you
must
be
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
found
that
he
was
skating
round
a
board
marked
Dangerous
,
and
had
better
cut
out
a
fresh
track
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Let
's
get
back
to
the
dodgerest
of
the
dodgers
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
he
up
to
in
the
case
of
your
friend
the
handsome
gal
?
<EOS>
He
must
have
some
object
.
<EOS>
What
's
his
object
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Can
not
undertake
to
say
,
sir
,
I
am
sure
!
"
returned
Miss
Wren
,
composedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
acknowledge
where
she
's
gone
,
"
said
Fledgeby
;
"
and
I
have
a
fancy
that
I
should
like
to
have
another
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
Now
I
know
he
knows
where
she
is
gone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
not
undertake
to
say
,
sir
,
I
am
sure
!
"
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
again
rejoined
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
know
where
she
is
gone
,
"
hazarded
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
not
undertake
to
say
,
sir
,
really
,
"
replied
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
The
quaint
little
chin
met
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
gaze
with
such
a
baffling
hitch
,
that
that
agreeable
gentleman
was
for
some
time
at
a
loss
how
to
resume
his
fascinating
part
in
the
dialogue
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
said
:
  
"
Miss
Jenny
!
<EOS>
---
That
's
your
name
,
if
I
do
n't
mistake
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Probably
you
do
n't
mistake
,
sir
,
"
was
Miss
Wren
's
cool
answer
;
 
"
because
you
had
it
on
the
best
authority
.
<EOS>
Mine
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Jenny
!
<EOS>
Instead
of
coming
up
and
being
dead
,
let
's
come
out
and
look
alive
.
<EOS>
It
'll
pay
better
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
bestowing
an
inveigling
twinkle
or
two
upon
the
dressmaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
it
pay
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
Miss
Jenny
,
holding
out
her
doll
at
arm
's
length
,
and
critically
contemplating
the
effect
of
her
art
with
her
scissors
on
her
lips
and
her
head
thrown
back
,
as
if
her
interest
lay
there
,
and
not
in
the
conversation
;
"
perhaps
you
'll
explain
your
meaning
,
young
man
,
which
is
Greek
to
me
.
<EOS>
---
You
must
have
another
touch
of
blue
in
your
trimming
,
my
dear
.
"
<EOS>
Having
addressed
the
last
remark
to
her
fair
client
,
Miss
Wren
proceeded
to
snip
at
some
blue
fragments
that
lay
before
her
,
among
fragments
of
all
colours
,
and
to
thread
a
needle
from
a
skein
of
blue
silk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
---
"
Are
you
attending
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
attending
,
sir
,
"
replied
Miss
Wren
,
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
so
doing
.
"
<EOS>
Another
touch
of
blue
in
your
trimming
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
look
here
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
rather
discouraged
by
the
circumstances
under
which
he
found
himself
pursuing
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
attending
---
"
  
(
"
Light
blue
,
my
sweet
young
lady
,
"
remarked
Miss
Wren
,
in
a
sprightly
tone
,
"
being
best
suited
to
your
fair
complexion
and
your
flaxen
curls
.
"
)
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
if
you
're
attending
,
"
proceeded
Fledgeby
,
"
it
'll
pay
better
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
It
'll
lead
in
a
roundabout
manner
to
your
buying
damage
and
waste
of
Pubsey
and
Co.
at
a
nominal
price
,
or
even
getting
it
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
"
thought
the
dressmaker
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
are
not
so
roundabout
,
Little
Eyes
,
that
I
do
n't
notice
your
answering
for
Pubsey
and
Co.
after
all
!
<EOS>
Little
Eyes
,
Little
Eyes
,
you
're
too
cunning
by
half
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
take
it
for
granted
,
"
pursued
Fledgeby
,
"
that
to
get
the
most
of
your
materials
for
nothing
would
be
well
worth
<EOS>
your
while
,
Miss
Jenny
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
take
it
for
granted
,
"
returned
the
dressmaker
with
many
knowing
nods
,
"
that
it
's
always
well
worth
my
while
to
make
money
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Fledgeby
approvingly
,
"
you
're
answering
to
a
sensible
purpose
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
're
coming
out
and
looking
alive
!
<EOS>
So
I
make
so
free
,
<EOS>
Miss
Jenny
,
as
to
offer
the
remark
,
that
you
and
Judah
were
too
thick
together
to
last
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
come
to
be
intimate
with
such
a
deep
file
as
Judah
without
beginning
to
see
a
little
way
into
him
,
you
know
,
"
said
Fledgeby
with
a
wink
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
own
,
"
returned
the
dressmaker
,
with
her
eyes
upon
her
work
,
"
that
we
are
not
good
friends
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
're
not
good
friends
at
present
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
pay
off
Judah
,
by
not
letting
him
have
his
own
deep
way
in
everything
.
<EOS>
In
most
things
he
'll
get
it
by
hook
or
by
crook
,
but
---
hang
it
all
!
<EOS>
---
do
n't
let
him
have
his
own
deep
way
in
everything
.
<EOS>
That
's
too
much
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
said
this
with
some
display
of
indignant
warmth
,
as
if
he
was
counsel
in
the
cause
for
Virtue
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
prevent
his
having
his
own
way
?
<EOS>
"
began
the
dressmaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Deep
way
,
I
called
it
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
His
own
deep
way
,
in
anything
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
,
"
said
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
I
like
to
hear
you
ask
it
,
because
it
's
looking
alive
.
<EOS>
It
's
what
I
should
expect
to
find
in
one
of
your
sagacious
understanding
.
<EOS>
Now
,
candidly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
cried
Miss
Jenny
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
now
candidly
,
"
Mr.
Fledgeby
explained
,
a
little
put
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
-
h
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
glad
to
countermine
him
,
respecting
the
handsome
gal
,
your
friend
.
<EOS>
He
means
something
there
.
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
Judah
means
something
there
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
motive
,
and
of
course
his
motive
is
a
dark
motive
.
<EOS>
Now
,
whatever
his
motive
is
,
it
's
necessary
to
his
motive
"
---
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
constructive
powers
were
not
equal
to
the
avoidance
of
some
tautology
here
---
"
that
it
should
be
kept
from
me
,
what
he
has
done
with
her
.
<EOS>
So
I
put
it
to
you
,
who
know
:
<EOS>
What
has
he
done
with
her
?
<EOS>
I
ask
no
more
.
<EOS>
And
is
that
asking
much

Miss
Jenny
Wren
,
who
had
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
bench
again
after
her
last
interruption
,
sat
looking
at
it
,
needle
in
hand
but
not
working
,
for
some
moments
.
<EOS>
She
then
briskly
resumed
her
work
,
and
said
with
a
sidelong
glance
of
her
eyes
and
chin
at
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where

replied
Fledgeby

said
Jenny
,
in
her
abruptest
and
shortest
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
No

time

said
Fledgeby
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
look

pointing

<EOS>
With
a
weird
little
laugh
,
Miss
Jenny
pointed
to
her
crutch
-
stick
as
her
equipage
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
looking
alive

<EOS>
cried
Fledgeby
,
rising
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mark
you

<EOS>
I
promise

nothing

"
said
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
dabbing
two
dabs
at
him
with
her
needle
,
as
if
she
put
out
both
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
no

returned
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
The

Mr.

prepossessing

withdrew
itself
;
and
the
little
dressmaker
,
clipping
and
snipping
and
stitching
,
and
stitching
and
snipping
and
clipping
,
fell
to
work
at
a

musing

,
Piccadilly
,
with

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
the
little
dressmaker
again
dabbed
out
his
eyes
separately
,
and
making
a
loop
in
the
air
of
her
thread
and
deftly
catching
it
into
a
knot
with
her
needle
,
seemed
to
bowstring
him
into
the
bargain
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
terrors
undergone
by
Mr.
Dolls
that
evening
when
his
little
parent
sat
profoundly
meditating
over
her
work
,
and
when
he
imagined
himself
found
out
,
as
often
as
she
changed
her
attitude
;
or
turned
her
eyes
towards
him
,
there
is
no
adequate
name
.
<EOS>
Moreover
it
was
her
habit
to
shake
her
head
at
that
wretched
old
boy
when
ever
she
caught
his
eye
as
he
shivered
and
shook
.
<EOS>
What
are
popularly
called
"
the
trembles
"
being
in
full
force
upon
him
that
evening
,
and
likewise
what
are
popularly
called
"
the
horrors
,
"
he
had
a
very
bad
time
of
it
;
which
was
not
made
better
by
his
being
so
remorseful
as
frequently
to
moan
"
Sixty
threepennorths
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
imperfect
sentence
not
being
at
all
intelligible
as
a
confession
,
but
sounding
like
a
Gargantuan
order
for
a
dram
,
brought
him
into
new
difficulties
by
occasioning
his
parent
to
pounce
at
him
in
a
more
than
usually
snappish
manner
,
and
to
overwhelm
him
with
bitter
reproaches
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
a
bad
time
for
Mr.
Dolls
,
could
not
fail
to
be
a
bad
time
for
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
was
on
the
alert
next
morning
,
and
drove
to
Bond
Street
,
and
set
down
the
two
ladies
punctually
,
and
then
directed
her
equipage
to
conduct
her
to
the
Albany
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
doorway
of
the
house
in
which
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
chambers
were
,
she
found
a
lady
standing
there
in
a
travelling
dress
,
holding
in
her
hand
---
of
all
things
in
the
world
---
a
gentleman
's
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
some
one
?
"
said
the
lady
in
a
stern
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
up
stairs
to
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
do
that
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
gentleman
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
waiting
for
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
His
business
with
Mr.
Fledgeby
will
very
soon
be
transacted
,
and
then
you
can
go
up
.
<EOS>
Until
the
gentleman
comes
down
,
you
must
wait
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
speaking
,
and
afterwards
,
the
lady
kept
watchfully
between
her
and
the
staircase
,
as
if
prepared
to
oppose
her
going
up
,
by
force
.
<EOS>
The
lady
being
of
a
stature
to
stop
her
with
a
hand
,
and
looking
mightily
determined
,
the
dressmaker
stood
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
<EOS>
Why
do
you
listen
?
"
asked
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
listening
,
"
said
the
dressmaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
hear
?
"
asked
the
lady
,
altering
her
phrase
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
kind
of
a
spluttering
somewhere
?
"
said
the
dressmaker
,
with
an
inquiring
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Fledgeby
in
his
shower
-
bath
,
perhaps
,
"
remarked
the
lady
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
somebody
's
beating
a
carpet
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
carpet
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
"
replied
the
smiling
lady
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
had
a
reasonably
good
eye
for
smiles
,
being
well
accustomed
to
them
on
the
part
of
her
young
friends
,
though
their
smiles
mostly
ran
smaller
than
in
nature
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
never
seen
so
singular
a
smile
as
that
upon
this
lady
's
face
.
<EOS>
It
twitched
her
nostrils
open
in
a
remarkable
manner
,
and
contracted
her
lips
and
eyebrows
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
smile
of
enjoyment
too
,
though
of
such
a
fierce
kind
that
Miss
Wren
thought
she
would
rather
not
enjoy
herself
than
do
it
in
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
said
the
lady
,
watching
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
there
's
nothing
the
matter
!
"
said
the
dressmaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
inquired
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
where
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
staring
about
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
never
heard
such
odd
noises
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
I
had
better
call
somebody
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
had
better
not
,
"
returned
the
lady
with
a
significant
frown
,
and
drawing
closer
.
  
<EOS>
On
this
hint
,
the
dressmaker
relinquished
the
idea
,
and
stood
looking
at
the
lady
as
hard
as
the
lady
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
dressmaker
listened
with
amazement
to
the
odd
noises
which
still
continued
,
and
the
lady
listened
too
,
but
with
a
coolness
in
which
there
was
no
trace
of
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
came
a
slamming
and
banging
of
doors
;
and
then
came
running
down
stairs
,
a
gentleman
with
whiskers
,
and
out
of
breath
,
who
seemed
to
be
red
-
hot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
your
business
done
,
Alfred
?
"
inquired
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
thoroughly
done
,
"
replied
the
gentleman
,
as
he
took
his
hat
from
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
go
up
to
Mr.
Fledgeby
as
soon
as
you
like
,
"
said
the
lady
,
moving
haughtily
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
And
you
can
take
these
three
pieces
of
stick
with
you
,
"
added
the
gentleman
politely
,
"
and
say
,
if
you
please
,
that
they
come
from
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
,
with
his
compliments
on
leaving
England
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
.
<EOS>
Be
so
good
as
not
to
forget
the
name
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
three
pieces
of
stick
were
three
broken
and
frayed
fragments
of
a
stout
lithe
cane
.
<EOS>
Miss
Jenny
taking
them
wonderingly
,
and
the
gentleman
repeating
with
a
grin
,
"
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
,
if
you
'll
be
so
good
.
<EOS>
Compliments
,
on
leaving
England
,
"
the
lady
and
gentleman
walked
away
quite
deliberately
,
and
Miss
Jenny
and
her
crutch
-
stick
went
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
Lammle
,
Lammle
,
Lammle
?
"
Miss
Jenny
repeated
as
she
panted
from
stair
to
stair
,
"
where
have
I
heard
that
name
?
<EOS>
Lammle
,
Lammle
?
<EOS>
I
know
!
<EOS>
Saint
Mary
Axe
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
gleam
of
new
intelligence
in
her
sharp
face
,
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
pulled
at
Fledgeby
's
bell
.
<EOS>
No
one
answered
;
but
,
from
within
the
chambers
,
there
proceeded
a
continuous
spluttering
sound
of
a
highly
singular
and
unintelligible
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
!
<EOS>
Is
Little
Eyes
choking
?
"
cried
Miss
Jenny
.
  
<EOS>
Pulling
at
the
bell
again
and
getting
no
reply
,
she
pushed
the
outer
door
,
and
found
it
standing
ajar
.
<EOS>
No
one
being
visible
on
her
opening
it
wider
,
and
the
spluttering
continuing
,
she
took
the
liberty
of
opening
an
inner
door
,
and
then
beheld
the
extraordinary
spectacle
of
Mr.
Fledgeby
in
a
shirt
,
a
pair
of
Turkish
trousers
,
and
a
Turkish
cap
,
rolling
over
and
over
on
his
own
carpet
,
and
spluttering
wonderfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Lord
!
"
gasped
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
my
eye
!
<EOS>
Stop
thief
!
<EOS>
I
am
strangling
.
<EOS>
Fire
!
<EOS>
Oh
my
eye
!
<EOS>
A
glass
of
water
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
glass
of
water
.
<EOS>
Shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
Murder
!
<EOS>
Oh
Lord
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
rolled
and
spluttered
more
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Hurrying
into
another
room
,
Miss
Jenny
got
a
glass
of
water
,
and
brought
it
for
Fledgeby
's
relief
;
who
,
gasping
,
spluttering
,
and
rattling
in
his
throat
betweenwhiles
,
drank
some
water
,
and
laid
his
head
faintly
on
her
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
eye
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fledgeby
,
struggling
anew
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
salt
and
snuff
.
<EOS>
It
's
up
my
nose
,
and
down
my
throat
,
and
in
my
windpipe
.
<EOS>
Ugh
!
<EOS>
Ow
!
<EOS>
Ow
!
<EOS>
Ow
!
<EOS>
Ah
---
h
---
h
---
h
!
"
<EOS>
And
here
,
crowing
fearfully
,
with
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
,
appeared
to
be
contending
with
every
mortal
disease
incidental
to
poultry
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Oh
my
Eye
,
I
'm
so
sore
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fledgeby
,
starting
,
over
on
his
back
,
in
a
spasmodic
way
that
caused
the
dressmaker
to
retreat
to
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
I
smart
so
!
<EOS>
Do
put
something
to
my
back
and
arms
,
and
legs
and
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Ugh
!
<EOS>
It
's
down
my
throat
again
and
ca
n't
come
up
.
<EOS>
Ow
!
<EOS>
Ow
!
<EOS>
Ow
!
<EOS>
Ah
---
h
---
h
---
h
!
<EOS>
Oh
I
smart
so
!
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Fledgeby
bounded
up
,
and
bounded
down
,
and
went
rolling
over
and
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
dolls
'
dressmaker
looked
on
until
he
rolled
himself
into
a
corner
with
his
Turkish
slippers
uppermost
,
and
then
,
resolving
in
the
first
place
to
address
her
ministration
to
the
salt
and
snuff
,
gave
him
more
water
and
slapped
his
back
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
latter
application
was
by
no
means
a
success
,
causing
Mr.
Fledgeby
to
scream
,
and
to
cry
out
,
"
Oh
my
eye
!
<EOS>
do
n't
slap
me
!
<EOS>
I
'm
covered
with
weales
and
<EOS>
I
smart
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
However
,
he
gradually
ceased
to
choke
and
crow
,
saving
at
intervals
,
and
Miss
Jenny
got
him
into
an
easy
-
chair
:
where
with
his
eyes
red
and
watery
,
with
his
features
swollen
,
and
with
some
half
-
dozen
livid
bars
across
his
face
,
he
presented
a
most
rueful
sight
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
ever
possessed
you
to
take
salt
and
snuff
,
young
man
?
"
 
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Jenny
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
take
it
,
"
the
dismal
youth
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
crammed
into
my
mouth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
crammed
it
?
"
asked
Miss
Jenny
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
,
"
answered
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
assassin
.
<EOS>
Lammle

<EOS>
He
rubbed
it
into
my
mouth
and
up
my

and
down
my
throat
---
<EOS>
Ow

Ow

Ah

---
to
prevent
my
crying
out
,
and
then
cruelly
assaulted
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
this
?
"
asked
Miss
Jenny
,
showing
the
pieces
of
cane
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
weapon
,
"
said
Fledgeby
,
eyeing
it
with
the
air
of
an
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
broke
it
over
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
I
smart
so
!
<EOS>
How
did
you
come
by
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
he
ran
down
stairs
and
joined
the
lady
he
had
left
in
the
hall
with
his
hat
"
---
Miss
Jenny
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
groaned
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
writhing
,
"
she
was
holding
his
hat
,
was
she
?
<EOS>
I
might
have
known
she
was
in
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
he
came
down
stairs
and
joined
the
lady
who
would
n't
let
me
come
up
,
he
gave
me
the
pieces
for
you
,
and
I
was
to
say
,
`
`
With
Mr.
Alfred
Lammle
's
compliments
on
his
leaving
England
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
Miss
Jenny
said
it
with
such
spiteful
satisfaction
,
and
such
a
hitch
of
her
chin
and
eyes
as
might
have
added
to
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
miseries
,
if
he
could
have
noticed
either
,
in
his
bodily
pain
with
his
hand
to
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
for
the
police
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Miss
Jenny
,
with
a
nimble
start
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
<EOS>
No
,
do
n't
!
"
cried
Fledgeby
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
,
please
.
<EOS>
We
had
better
keep
it
quiet
.
<EOS>
Will
you
be
so
good
as
shut
the
door
?
<EOS>
Oh
I
do
smart
so
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
testimony
of
the
extent
to
which
he
smarted
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
came
wallowing
out
of
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
took
another
roll
on
the
carpet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
the
door
's
shut
,
"
said
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
sitting
up
in
anguish
,
with
his
Turkish
cap
half
on
and
half
off
,
and
the
bars
on
his
face
getting
bluer
,
"
do
me
the
kindness
to
look
at
my
back
and
shoulders
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
in
an
awful
state
,
for
I
had
n't
got
my
dressing
-
gown
on
,
when
the
brute
came
rushing
in
.
<EOS>
Cut
my
shirt
away
from
the
collar
;
there
's
a
pair
of
scissors
on
that
table
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
groaned
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
with
his
hand
to
his
head
again
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
I
do
smart
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
There
?
"
inquired
Miss
Jenny
,
alluding
to
the
back
and
shoulders
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
Lord
,
yes
!
"
<EOS>
moaned
Fledgeby
,
rocking
himself
.
"
<EOS>
And
all
over
!
<EOS>
Everywhere
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
busy
little
dressmaker
quickly
snipped
the
shirt
away
,
and
laid
bare
the
results
of
as
furious
and
sound
a
threshing
as
even
Mr.
Fledgeby
merited
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
well
smart
,
young
man
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Miss
Jenny
.
<EOS>
And
stealthily
rubbed
her
little
hands
behind
him
,
and
poked
a
few
exultant
pokes
with
her
two
forefingers
over
the
crown
of
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
of
vinegar
and
brown
paper
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
suffering
Fledgeby
,
still
rocking
and
moaning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Does
it
look
as
if
vinegar
and
brown
paper
was
the
sort
of
application
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Miss
Jenny
,
with
a
silent
chuckle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
It
looks
as
if
it
ought
to
be
Pickled
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
collapsed
under
the
word
"
Pickled
,
"
and
groaned
again
.
<EOS>
"
My
kitchen
is
on
this
floor
,
"
he
said
;
"
you
'll
find
brown
paper
in
a
dresser
-
drawer
there
,
and
a
bottle
of
vinegar
on
a
shelf
.
<EOS>
Would
you
have
the
kindness
to
make
a
few
plasters
and
put
'em
on
?
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
kept
too
quiet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
One
,
two
---
hum
---
five
,
six
.
<EOS>
You
'll
want
six
,
"
said
the
dressmaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
smart
enough
,
"
whimpered
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
groaning
and
writhing
again
,
"
for
sixty
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenny
repaired
to
the
kitchen
,
scissors
in
hand
,
found
the
brown
paper
and
found
the
vinegar
,
and
skilfully
cut
out
and
steeped
six
large
plasters
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
all
lying
ready
on
the
dresser
,
an
idea
occurred
to
her
as
she
was
about
to
gather
them
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
said
Miss
Jenny
with
a
silent
laugh
,
"
he
ought
to
have
a
little
pepper
?
<EOS>
Just
a
few
grains
?
<EOS>
I
think
the
young
man
's
tricks
and
manners
make
a
claim
upon
his
friends
for
a
little
pepper
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
's
evil
star
showing
her
the
pepper
-
box
on
the
chimneypiece
<EOS>
,
she
climbed
upon
a
chair
,
and
got
it
down
,
and
sprinkled
all
the
plasters
with
a
judicious
hand
.
<EOS>
She
then
went
back
to
Mr.
Fledgeby
,
and
stuck
them
all
on
him
:
<EOS>
Mr.
Fledgeby
uttering
a
sharp
howl
as
each
was
put
in
its
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
young
man
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
I
hope
you
feel
pretty
comfortable
?
"
  
<EOS>
Apparently
,
Mr.
Fledgeby
did
not
,
for
he
cried
by
way
of
answer
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
---
h
<EOS>
how
I
do
smart
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenny
got
his
Persian
gown
upon
him
,
extinguished
his
eyes
crookedly
with
his
Persian
cap
,
and
helped
him
to
his
bed
:
upon
which
he
climbed
groaning
.
<EOS>
"
Business
between
you
and
me
being
out
of
the
question
to
-
day
,
young
man
,
and
my
time
being
precious
,
"
 
said
Miss
Jenny
then
,
"
I
'll
make
myself
scarce
.
<EOS>
Are
you
comfortable
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
my
eye
!
"
cried
Mr.
Fledgeby
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
ai
n't
.
<EOS>
Oh
---
h
---
h
!
<EOS>
how
I
do
smart
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
last
thing
Miss
Jenny
saw
,
as
she
looked
back
before
closing
the
room
door
,
was
Mr.
Fledgeby
in
the
act
of
plunging
and
gambolling
all
over
his
bed
,
like
a
porpoise
or
dolphin
in
its
native
element
.
<EOS>
She
then
shut
the
bedroom
door
,
and
all
the
other
doors
,
and
going
down
stairs
and
emerging
from
the
Albany
into
the
busy
streets
,
took
omnibus
for
Saint
Mary
Axe
:
pressing
on
the
road
all
the
gaily
-
dressed
ladies
whom
she
could
see
from
the
window
,
and
making
them
unconscious
lay
-
figures
for
dolls
,
while
she
mentally
cut
them
out
and
basted
them
.
   
<EOS>
TWO
PLACES
VACATED
.
 
<EOS>
Set
down
by
the
omnibus
at
the
corner
of
Saint
Mary
Axe
,
and
trusting
to
her
feet
and
her
crutch
-
stick
within
its
precincts
,
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
proceeded
to
the
place
of
business
of
Pubsey
and
<EOS>
Co.
All
there
was
sunny
and
quiet
externally
,
and
shady
and
quiet
internally
.
<EOS>
Hiding
herself
in
the
entry
outside
the
glass
door
,
she
could
see
from
that
post
of
observation
the
old
man
in
his
spectacles
sitting
writing
at
his
desk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Boh
!
"
cried
the
dressmaker
,
popping
in
her
head
at
the
glass
-
door
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Wolf
at
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
took
his
glasses
off
,
and
mildly
laid
them
down
beside
him
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
Jenny
,
is
it
you
?
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
given
me
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
I
had
given
up
the
treacherous
wolf
of
the
forest
,
"
she
replied
;
"
<EOS>
but
,
godmother
,
it
strikes
me
you
have
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
quite
sure
,
because
the
wolf
<EOS>
and
you
change
forms
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
or
two
,
to
find
out
whether
you
are
really
godmother
or
really
wolf
.
<EOS>
May
I
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Jenny
,
yes
.
"
<EOS>
But
Riah
glanced
towards
the
door
,
as
if
he
thought
his
principal
might
appear
there
,
unseasonably
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
're
afraid
of
the
fox
,
"
said
Miss
Jenny
,
"
you
may
dismiss
all
present
expectations
of
seeing
that
animal
.
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
show
himself
abroad
,
for
many
a
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
my
child
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
godmother
,
"
replied
Miss
Wren
,
sitting
down
beside
the
Jew
,
"
that
the
fox
has
caught
a
famous
flogging
,
and
that
if
his
skin
and
bones
are
not
tingling
,
aching
,
and
smarting
at
this
present
instant
,
no
fox
did
ever
tingle
,
ache
,
and
smart
.
"
<EOS>
Therewith
Miss
Jenny
related
what
had
come
to
pass
in
the
Albany
,
omitting
the
few
grains
of
pepper
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
godmother
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
I
particularly
wish
to
ask
you
what
has
taken
place
here
,
since
I
left
the
wolf
here
?
<EOS>
Because
I
have
an
idea
about
the
size
of
a
marble
,
rolling
about
in
my
little
noddle
.
<EOS>
First
and
foremost
,
are
you
Pubsey
and
Co.
,
or
are
you
either
?
<EOS>
Upon
your
solemn
word
and
honour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
shook
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Secondly
,
is
n't
Fledgeby
both
Pubsey
and
Co.
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
answered
with
a
reluctant
nod
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
idea
,
"
exclaimed
Miss
Wren
,
"
is
now
about
the
size
of
an
orange
.
<EOS>
But
before
it
gets
any
bigger
,
welcome
back
,
dear
godmother
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
creature
folded
her
arms
about
the
old
man
's
neck
with
great
earnestness
,
and
kissed
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
humbly
beg
your
forgiveness
,
godmother
.
<EOS>
I
am
truly
sorry
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
had
more
faith
in
you
.
<EOS>
But
what
could
I
suppose
when
you
said
nothing
for
yourself
,
you
know
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
to
offer
that
as
a
justification
,
but
<EOS>
what
could
I
suppose
,
when
you
were
a
silent
party
to
all
he
said
?
<EOS>
It
did
look
bad
;
now
did
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
looked
so
bad
,
Jenny
,
"
responded
the
old
man
,
with
gravity
,
"
that
I
will
straightway
tell
you
what
an
impression
it
wrought
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
hateful
in
mine
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
was
hateful
to
myself
,
in
being
so
hateful
to
the
debtor
and
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
more
than
that
,
and
worse
than
that
,
and
to
pass
out
far
and
broad
beyond
myself
---
I
reflected
that
evening
,
sitting
alone
in
my
garden
on
the
housetop
,
that
I
was
doing
dishonour
to
my
ancient
faith
and
race
.
<EOS>
I
reflected
---
clearly
reflected
for
the
first
time
---
that
in
bending
my
neck
to
the
yoke
I
was
willing
to
wear
,
I
bent
the
unwilling
necks
of
the
whole
Jewish
people
.
<EOS>
For
it
is
not
,
in
Christian
countries
,
with
the
Jews
as
with
other
peoples
.
<EOS>
Men
say
,
`
`
This
is
a
bad
Greek
,
but
there
are
good
Greeks
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
bad
Turk
,
but
there
are
good
Turks
.
"
<EOS>
"
Not
so
with
the
Jews
.
<EOS>
Men
find
the
bad
among
us
easily
enough
---
  
among
what
peoples
are
the
bad
not
easily
found
?
<EOS>
---
but
they
take
the
worst
of
us
as
samples
of
the
best
;
they
take
the
lowest
of
us
as
presentations
of
the
highest
;
and
they
say
`
`
All
Jews
are
alike
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
,
doing
what
I
was
content
to
do
here
,
because
I
was
grateful
for
the
past
and
have
small
need
of
money
now
,
I
had
been
a
Christian
,
I
could
have
done
it
,
compromising
no
one
but
my
individual
self
.
<EOS>
But
doing
it
as
a
Jew
,
I
could
not
choose
but
compromise
the
Jews
of
all
conditions
and
all
countries
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
little
hard
upon
us
,
but
it
is
the
truth
.
<EOS>
I
would
that
all
our
people
remembered
it
!
<EOS>
Though
I
have
little
right
to
say
so
,
seeing
that
it
came
home
so
late
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
dolls
'
dressmaker
sat
holding
the
old
man
by
the
hand
,
and
looking
thoughtfully
in
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thus
I
reflected
,
I
say
,
sitting
that
evening
in
my
garden
on
the
housetop
.
<EOS>
And
passing
the
painful
scene
of
that
day
in
review
before
me
many
times
,
I
always
saw
that
the
poor
gentleman
believed
the
story
readily
,
because
I
was
one
of
the
Jews
---
that
you
believed
the
story
readily
,
my
child
,
because
I
was
one
of
the
Jews
---
that
the
story
itself
first
came
into
the
invention
of
the
originator
thereof
,
because
I
was
one
of
the
Jews
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
result
of
my
having
had
you
three
before
me
,
face
to
face
,
and
seeing
the
thing
visibly
presented
as
upon
a
theatre
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
I
perceived
that
the
obligation
was
upon
me
to
leave
this
service
.
<EOS>
But
Jenny
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Riah
,
breaking
off
,
"
I
promised
that
you
should
pursue
your
questions
,
and
I
obstruct
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
godmother
;
my
idea
is
as
large
now
as
a
pumpkin
 
---
and
you
know
what
a
pumpkin
is
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
So
you
gave
notice
that
you
were
going
?
<EOS>
Does
that
come
next
?
"
asked
Miss
Jenny
with
a
look
of
close
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
indited
a
letter
to
my
master
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
To
that
effect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
said
Tingling
-
Tossing
-
Aching
-
Screaming
-
Scratching
-
Smarter
?
"
 
asked
Miss
Wren
with
an
unspeakable
enjoyment
in
the
utterance
of
those
honorable
titles
and
in
the
recollection
of
the
pepper
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
held
me
to
certain
months
of
servitude
,
which
were
his
lawful
term
of
notice
.
<EOS>
They
expire
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Upon
their
expiration
---
not
before
---
I
had
meant
to
set
myself
right
with
my
Cinderella
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
idea
is
getting
so
immense
now
,
"
cried
Miss
Wren
,
clasping
her
temples
,
"
that
my
head
wo
n't
hold
it
!
<EOS>
Listen
,
godmother
;
 
I
am
going
to
expound
.
<EOS>
Little
Eyes
(
that
's
Screaming
-
Scratching
-
Smarter
)
owes
you
a
heavy
grudge
for
going
.
<EOS>
Little
Eyes
casts
about
how
best
to
pay
you
off
.
<EOS>
Little
Eyes
thinks
of
Lizzie
.
<EOS>
Little
Eyes
says
to
himself
,
`
`
I
'll
find
out
where
he
has
placed
that
girl
,
and
I
'll
betray
his
secret
because
it
's
dear
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
Little
Eyes
thinks
,
`
`
I
'll
make
love
to
her
myself
too
;
"
"
but
that
I
ca
n't
swear
---
all
the
rest
I
can
.
<EOS>
So
,
Little
Eyes
comes
to
me
,
and
I
go
to
Little
Eyes
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
way
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
murder
's
all
out
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sorry
,
"
added
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
rigid
from
head
to
foot
with
energy
as
she
shook
her
little
fist
before
her
eyes
,
"
that
I
did
n't
give
him
Cayenne
pepper
and
chopped
pickled
Capsicum
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
expression
of
regret
being
but
partially
intelligible
to
Mr.
Riah
,
the
old
man
reverted
to
the
injuries
Fledgeby
had
received
,
and
hinted
at
the
necessity
of
his
at
once
going
to
tend
that
beaten
cur
.
  
<EOS>
"
Godmother
,
godmother
,
godmother
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Miss
Wren
irritably
,
"
I
really
lose
all
patience
with
you
.
<EOS>
One
would
think
you
believed
in
the
Good
Samaritan
.
<EOS>
How
can
you
be
so
inconsistent
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jenny
dear
,
"
began
the
old
man
gently
,
"
it
is
the
custom
of
our
people
to
help
---
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Bother
your
people
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Miss
Wren
,
with
a
toss
of
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
If
your
people
do
n't
know
better
than
to
go
and
help
Little
Eyes
,
it
's
a
pity
they
ever
got
out
of
Egypt
.
<EOS>
Over
and
above
that
,
"
she
added
,
"
he
would
n't
take
your
help
if
you
offered
it
.
<EOS>
Too
much
ashamed
.
<EOS>
Wants
to
keep
it
close
and
quiet
,
and
to
keep
you
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
still
debating
this
point
when
a
shadow
darkened
the
entry
,
and
the
glass
door
was
opened
by
a
messenger
who
brought
a
letter
unceremoniously
addressed
,
"
Riah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
which
he
said
there
was
an
answer
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
The
letter
,
which
was
scrawled
in
pencil
uphill
and
downhill
and
round
crooked
corners
,
ran
thus
:
  
"
Old
Riah
,
  
"
Your
accounts
being
all
squared
,
go
.
<EOS>
Shut
up
the
place
,
turn
out
directly
,
and
send
me
the
key
by
bearer
.
<EOS>
Go
.
<EOS>
You
are
an
unthankful
dog
of
a
Jew
.
<EOS>
Get
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
F.
"
  
The
dolls
'
dressmaker
found
it
delicious
to
trace
the
screaming
and
smarting
of
Little
Eyes
in
the
distorted
writing
of
this
epistle
.
<EOS>
She
laughed
over
it
and
jeered
at
it
in
a
convenient
corner
(
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
messenger
)
while
the
old
man
got
his
few
goods
together
in
a
black
bag
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
the
shutters
of
the
upper
windows
closed
,
and
the
office
blind
pulled
down
,
they
issued
forth
upon
the
steps
with
the
attendant
messenger
.
<EOS>
There
,
while
Miss
Jenny
held
the
bag
,
the
old
man
locked
the
house
door
,
and
handed
over
the
key
to
him
;
who
at
once
retired
with
the
same
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
godmother
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
as
they
remained
upon
the
steps
together
,
looking
at
one
another
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
're
thrown
upon
the
world
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
appear
so
,
Jenny
,
and
somewhat
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
to
seek
your
fortune
?
"
asked
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
smiled
,
but
looked
about
him
with
a
look
of
having
lost
his
way
in
life
,
which
did
not
escape
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
.
  
<EOS>
"
Verily
,
Jenny
,
"
said
he
,
"
the
question
is
to
the
purpose
,
and
more
easily
asked
than
answered
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
have
experience
of
the
ready
goodwill
and
good
help
of
those
who
have
given
occupation
to
Lizzie
,
I
think
I
will
seek
them
out
for
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
foot
?
"
asked
Miss
Wren
,
with
a
chop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
I
not
my
staff
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
exactly
because
he
had
his
staff
,
and
presented
so
quaint
an
aspect
,
that
she
mistrusted
his
making
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
thing
you
can
do
,
"
said
Jenny
,
"
for
the
time
being
,
at
all
events
,
is
to
come
home
with
me
,
godmother
.
<EOS>
Nobody
's
there
<EOS>
but
my
bad
child
,
and
Lizzie
's
lodging
stands
empty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
old
man
when
satisfied
that
no
inconvenience
could
be
entailed
on
any
one
by
his
compliance
,
readily
complied
;
and
the
singularly
-
assorted
couple
once
more
went
through
the
streets
together
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
bad
child
having
been
strictly
charged
by
his
parent
to
remain
at
home
in
her
absence
,
of
course
went
out
;
and
,
being
in
the
very
last
stage
of
mental
decrepitude
,
went
out
with
two
objects
;
 
firstly
,
to
establish
a
claim
he
conceived
himself
to
have
upon
any
licensed
victualler
living
,
to
be
supplied
with
threepennyworth
of
rum
for
nothing
;
and
secondly
,
to
bestow
some
maudlin
remorse
on
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
and
see
what
profit
came
of
it
.
<EOS>
Stumblingly
pursuing
these
two
designs
---
they
both
meant
rum
,
the
only
meaning
of
which
he
was
capable
---
the
degraded
creature
staggered
into
Covent
Garden
Market
and
there
bivouacked
,
to
have
an
attack
of
the
trembles
succeeded
by
an
attack
of
the
horrors
,
in
a
doorway
.
  
<EOS>
This
market
of
Covent
Garden
was
quite
out
of
the
creature
's
line
of
road
,
but
it
had
the
attraction
for
him
which
it
has
for
the
worst
of
the
solitary
members
of
the
drunken
tribe
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
the
companionship
of
the
nightly
stir
,
or
it
may
be
the
companionship
of
the
gin
and
beer
that
slop
about
among
carters
and
hucksters
,
or
it
may
be
the
companionship
of
the
trodden
vegetable
refuse
which
is
so
like
their
own
dress
that
perhaps
they
take
the
Market
for
a
great
wardrobe
;
but
be
it
<EOS>
what
it
may
,
you
shall
see
no
such
individual
drunkards
on
doorsteps
anywhere
,
as
there
.
<EOS>
Of
dozing
women
-
drunkards
especially
,
you
shall
come
upon
such
specimens
there
,
in
the
morning
sunlight
,
as
you
might
seek
out
of
doors
in
vain
through
London
.
<EOS>
Such
stale
vapid
rejected
cabbage
-
leaf
and
cabbage
-
stalk
dress
,
such
damaged
-
orange
countenance
,
such
squashed
pulp
of
humanity
,
are
open
to
the
day
nowhere
else
.
<EOS>
So
,
the
attraction
of
the
Market
drew
Mr.
Dolls
to
it
,
and
he
had
out
his
two
fits
of
trembles
and
horrors
in
a
doorway
on
which
a
woman
had
had
out
her
sodden
nap
a
few
hours
before
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
swarm
of
young
savages
always
flitting
about
this
same
place
,
creeping
off
with
fragments
of
orange
-
chests
,
and
mouldy
litter
---
Heaven
knows
into
what
holes
they
can
convey
them
,
having
no
home
!
---
whose
bare
feet
fall
with
a
blunt
dull
softness
on
the
pavement
as
the
policeman
hunts
them
,
and
who
are
(
perhaps
for
that
reason
)
<EOS>
little
heard
by
the
Powers
that
be
,
whereas
in
topboots
they
would
make
a
deafening
clatter
.
<EOS>
These
,
delighting
in
the
trembles
and
the
horrors
of
Mr.
Dolls
,
as
in
a
gratuitous
drama
,
flocked
about
him
in
his
doorway
,
butted
at
him
,
leaped
at
him
,
and
pelted
him
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
when
he
came
out
of
his
invalid
retirement
and
shook
off
that
ragged
train
,
he
was
much
bespattered
,
and
in
worse
case
than
ever
.
<EOS>
But
,
not
yet
at
his
worst
;
for
,
going
into
a
public
-
house
,
and
being
supplied
in
stress
of
business
with
his
rum
,
and
seeking
to
vanish
without
payment
,
he
was
collared
,
searched
,
found
penniless
,
and
admonished
not
to
try
that
again
,
by
having
a
pail
of
dirty
water
cast
over
him
.
<EOS>
This
application
superinduced
another
fit
of
the
trembles
;
after
which
Mr.
Dolls
,
as
finding
himself
in
good
cue
for
making
a
call
on
a
professional
friend
,
addressed
himself
to
the
Temple
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
at
the
chambers
but
Young
Blight
.
<EOS>
That
discreet
youth
,
sensible
of
a
certain
incongruity
in
the
association
of
such
a
client
with
the
business
that
might
be
coming
some
day
,
with
the
best
intentions
temporized
with
Dolls
,
and
offered
a
shilling
for
coach
-
hire
home
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Dolls
,
accepting
the
shilling
,
promptly
laid
it
out
in
two
threepennyworths
of
conspiracy
against
his
life
,
and
two
threepennyworths
of
raging
repentance
.
<EOS>
Returning
to
the
Chambers
with
which
burden
,
he
was
descried
coming
round
into
the
court
,
by
the
wary
young
Blight
watching
from
the
window
:
who
instantly
closed
the
outer
door
,
and
left
the
miserable
object
to
expend
his
fury
on
the
panels
.
  
<EOS>
The
more
the
door
resisted
him
,
the
more
dangerous
and
imminent
became
that
bloody
conspiracy
against
his
life
.
<EOS>
Force
of
police
arriving
,
he
recognized
in
them
the
conspirators
,
and
laid
about
him
hoarsely
,
fiercely
,
staringly
,
convulsively
,
foamingly
.
<EOS>
A
humble
machine
,
familiar
to
the
conspirators
and
called
by
the
expressive
name
of
Stretcher
,
being
unavoidably
sent
for
,
he
was
rendered
a
harmless
bundle
of
torn
rags
by
being
strapped
down
upon
it
,
with
voice
and
consciousness
gone
out
of
him
,
and
life
fast
going
.
<EOS>
As
this
machine
was
borne
out
at
the
Temple
gate
by
four
men
,
the
poor
little
dolls
'
dressmaker
and
her
Jewish
friend
were
coming
up
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
see
what
it
is
,
"
cried
the
dressmaker
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
make
haste
and
look
,
godmother
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
brisk
little
crutch
-
stick
was
but
too
brisk
.
"
<EOS>
O
gentlemen
,
gentlemen
,
he
belongs
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Belongs
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
said
the
head
of
the
party
,
stopping
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
yes
,
dear
gentlemen
,
he
's
my
child
,
out
without
leave
.
<EOS>
My
poor
bad
,
bad
boy
!
<EOS>
and
he
do
n't
know
me
,
he
do
n't
know
me
!
<EOS>
O
what
shall
I
do
,
"
cried
the
little
creature
,
wildly
beating
her
hands
together
,
"
when
my
own
child
do
n't
know
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
head
of
the
party
looked
(
as
well
he
might
)
to
the
old
man
for
explanation
.
<EOS>
He
whispered
,
as
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
bent
over
the
exhausted
form
and
vainly
tried
to
extract
some
sign
of
recognition
from
it
:
"
It
's
her
drunken
father
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
load
was
put
down
in
the
street
,
Riah
drew
the
head
of
the
party
aside
,
and
whispered
that
he
thought
the
man
was
dying
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
surely
not
?
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
he
became
less
confident
,
on
looking
,
and
directed
the
bearers
to
"
bring
him
to
the
nearest
doctor
's
shop
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thither
he
was
brought
;
the
window
becoming
from
within
,
a
wall
of
faces
,
deformed
into
all
kinds
of
shapes
through
the
agency
of
globular
red
bottles
,
green
bottles
,
blue
bottles
,
and
other
coloured
bottles
.
<EOS>
A
ghastly
light
shining
upon
him
that
he
did
n't
need
,
the
beast
so
furious
but
a
few
minutes
gone
<EOS>
,
was
quiet
enough
now
,
with
a
strange
mysterious
writing
on
his
face
,
reflected
from
one
of
the
great
bottles
,
as
if
Death
had
marked
him
:
"
Mine
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
medical
testimony
was
more
precise
and
more
to
the
purpose
than
it
sometimes
is
in
a
Court
of
Justice
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
send
for
something
to
cover
it
.
<EOS>
All
's
over
.
"
  
<EOS>
Therefore
,
the
police
sent
for
something
to
cover
it
,
and
it
was
covered
and
borne
through
the
streets
,
the
people
falling
away
.
<EOS>
After
it
,
went
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
hiding
her
face
in
the
Jewish
skirts
,
and
clinging
to
them
with
one
hand
,
while
with
the
other
she
plied
her
stick
.
<EOS>
It
was
carried
home
,
and
,
by
reason
that
the
staircase
was
very
narrow
,
it
was
put
down
in
the
parlour
---
<EOS>
the
little
working
-
bench
being
set
aside
to
make
room
for
it
---
and
there
,
in
the
midst
of
the
dolls
with
no
speculation
in
their
eyes
,
lay
Mr.
Dolls
with
no
speculation
in
his
.
  
<EOS>
Many
flaunting
dolls
had
to
be
gaily
dressed
,
before
the
money
was
in
the
dressmaker
's
pocket
to
get
mourning
for
Mr.
Dolls
.
<EOS>
As
the
old
man
,
Riah
,
sat
by
,
helping
her
in
such
small
ways
as
he
could
,
he
found
it
difficult
to
make
out
whether
she
really
did
realize
that
the
deceased
had
been
her
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
my
poor
boy
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
had
been
brought
up
better
,
he
might
have
done
better
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
reproach
myself
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
no
cause
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
indeed
,
Jenny
,
I
am
very
certain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
godmother
.
<EOS>
It
cheers
me
to
hear
you
say
so
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
it
is
so
hard
to
bring
up
a
child
<EOS>
well
,
when
you
work
,
work
,
work
,
all
day
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
out
of
employment
,
I
could
n't
always
keep
him
near
me
.
<EOS>
He
got
fractious
and
nervous
,
and
I
was
obliged
to
let
him
go
into
the
streets
.
<EOS>
And
he
never
did
well
in
the
streets
,
he
never
did
well
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
How
often
it
happens
with
children
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Too
often
,
even
in
this
sad
sense
!
"
thought
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
say
what
I
might
have
turned
out
myself
,
but
for
my
back
having
been
so
bad
and
<EOS>
my
legs
so
queer
,
when
I
was
young
!
"
 
<EOS>
the
dressmaker
would
go
on
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
nothing
to
do
but
work
,
and
so
I
worked
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
play
.
<EOS>
But
my
poor
unfortunate
child
could
play
,
and
it
turned
out
the
worse
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
not
for
him
alone
,
Jenny
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
,
godmother
.
<EOS>
He
suffered
heavily
,
did
my
unfortunate
boy
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
,
very
ill
sometimes
.
<EOS>
And
I
called
him
a
quantity
of
names
;
"
shaking
her
head
over
her
work
,
and
dropping
tears
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
his
going
wrong
was
much
the
worse
for
me
.
<EOS>
If
it
ever
was
,
let
us
forget
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
good
girl
,
you
are
a
patient
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
patience
,
"
she
would
reply
with
a
shrug
,
"
not
much
of
that
,
godmother
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
patient
,
I
should
never
have
called
him
names
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
I
did
it
for
his
good
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
I
felt
my
responsibility
as
a
mother
,
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
tried
reasoning
,
and
reasoning
failed
.
<EOS>
I
tried
coaxing
,
and
coaxing
failed
.
<EOS>
I
tried
scolding
,
and
scolding
failed
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
bound
to
try
everything
,
you
know
,
with
such
a
charge
upon
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Where
would
have
been
my
duty
to
my
poor
lost
boy
,
if
I
had
not
tried
everything
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
such
talk
,
mostly
in
a
cheerful
tone
on
the
part
of
the
industrious
little
creature
,
the
day
-
work
and
the
night
-
work
were
beguiled
until
enough
of
smart
dolls
had
gone
forth
to
bring
into
the
kitchen
,
where
the
working
-
bench
now
stood
,
the
sombre
stuff
that
the
occasion
required
,
and
to
bring
into
the
house
the
other
sombre
preparations
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
said
Miss
Jenny
,
"
having
knocked
off
my
rosy
-
cheeked
young
friends
,
I
'll
knock
off
my
white
-
cheeked
self
.
<EOS>
"
This
referred
to
her
making
her
own
dress
,
which
at
last
was
done
.
"
<EOS>
The
disadvantage
of
making
for
yourself
,
"
said
Miss
Jenny
,
as
she
stood
upon
a
chair
to
look
at
the
result
in
the
glass
,
"
is
,
that
you
ca
n't
charge
anybody
else
for
the
job
,
and
the
advantage
is
,
that
you
have
n't
to
go
out
to
try
on
.
<EOS>
Humph
!
<EOS>
Very
fair
indeed
!
<EOS>
If
He
could
see
me
now
(
whoever
he
is
)
<EOS>
I
hope
he
would
n't
repent
of
his
bargain
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
simple
arrangements
were
of
her
own
making
,
and
were
stated
to
Riah
thus
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
go
alone
,
godmother
,
in
my
usual
carriage
,
and
you
'll
be
so
kind
as
keep
house
while
I
am
gone
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
return
,
we
'll
have
a
cup
of
tea
,
and
a
chat
over
future
arrangements
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
very
plain
last
house
that
I
have
been
able
to
give
my
poor
unfortunate
boy
;
but
he
'll
accept
the
will
for
the
deed
,
if
he
knows
anything
about
it
;
and
if
he
does
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
"
with
a
sob
,
and
wiping
her
eyes
,
"
why
,
it
wo
n't
matter
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
service
in
the
Prayer
-
book
says
,
that
we
brought
nothing
into
this
world
and
it
is
certain
we
can
take
nothing
out
.
<EOS>
It
comforts
me
for
not
being
able
to
hire
a
lot
of
stupid
undertaker
's
things
for
my
poor
child
,
and
seeming
as
if
I
was
trying
to
smuggle
'em
out
of
this
world
with
him
,
when
of
course
I
must
break
down
in
the
attempt
,
and
bring
'em
all
back
again
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
there
'll
be
nothing
to
bring
back
<EOS>
but
me
,
and
that
's
quite
consistent
,
for
I
sha
n't
be
brought
back
,
some
day
!
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
previous
carrying
of
him
in
the
streets
,
the
wretched
old
fellow
seemed
to
be
twice
buried
.
<EOS>
He
was
taken
on
the
shoulders
of
half
a
dozen
blossom
-
faced
men
,
who
shuffled
with
him
to
the
churchyard
,
and
who
were
preceded
by
another
blossom
-
faced
man
,
affecting
a
stately
stalk
,
as
if
he
were
a
Policeman
of
the
D(eath
)
Division
,
and
ceremoniously
pretending
not
to
know
his
intimate
acquaintances
,
as
he
led
the
pageant
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
the
spectacle
of
only
one
little
mourner
hobbling
after
,
caused
many
people
to
turn
their
heads
with
a
look
of
interest
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
troublesome
deceased
was
got
into
the
ground
,
to
be
buried
no
more
,
and
the
stately
stalker
stalked
back
before
the
solitary
dressmaker
,
as
if
she
were
bound
in
honour
to
have
no
notion
of
the
way
home
.
<EOS>
Those
Furies
,
the
conventionalities
,
being
thus
appeased
,
he
left
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
a
very
short
cry
,
godmother
,
before
I
cheer
up
for
good
,
"
said
the
little
creature
,
coming
in
.
<EOS>
"
Because
after
all
a
child
is
a
child
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
longer
cry
than
might
have
been
expected
.
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
it
wore
itself
out
in
a
shadowy
corner
,
and
then
the
dressmaker
came
forth
,
and
washed
her
face
,
and
made
the
tea
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
n't
mind
my
cutting
out
something
while
we
are
at
tea
,
would
you
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
her
Jewish
friend
,
with
a
coaxing
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cinderella
,
dear
child
,
"
the
old
man
expostulated
,
"
will
you
never
rest
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
It
's
not
work
,
cutting
out
a
pattern
is
n't
,
"
said
Miss
Jenny
,
with
her
busy
little
scissors
already
snipping
at
some
paper
.
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
godmother
,
I
want
to
fix
it
while
I
have
it
correct
in
my
mind
.
"
  
"
Have
you
seen
it
to
-
day
then
?
"
asked
Riah
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
godmother
.
<EOS>
Saw
it
just
now
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
surplice
,
that
's
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
Thing
our
clergymen
wear
,
you
know
,
"
explained
Miss
Jenny
,
in
consideration
of
his
professing
another
faith
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
have
you
to
do
with
that
,
Jenny
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
godmother
,
"
replied
the
dressmaker
,
"
you
must
know
that
we
Professors
who
live
upon
our
taste
and
invention
,
are
obliged
to
keep
our
eyes
always
open
.
<EOS>
And
you
know
already
that
I
have
many
extra
expenses
to
meet
just
now
.
<EOS>
So
,
it
came
into
my
head
while
I
was
weeping
at
my
poor
boy
's
grave
,
that
something
in
my
way
might
be
done
with
a
clergyman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
can
be
done
?
"
asked
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
funeral
,
never
fear
!
"
returned
Miss
Jenny
,
anticipating
his
objection
with
a
nod
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
public
do
n't
like
to
be
made
melancholy
,
I
know
very
well
.
<EOS>
I
am
seldom
called
upon
to
put
my
young
friends
into
mourning
;
not
into
real
mourning
,
that
is
;
Court
mourning
they
are
rather
proud
of
.
<EOS>
But
a
doll
clergyman
,
my
dear
,
 
---
glossy
black
curls
and
whiskers
---
uniting
two
of
my
young
friends
in
matrimony
,
"
said
Miss
Jenny
,
shaking
her
forefinger
,
"
is
quite
another
affair
.
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
see
those
three
at
the
altar
in
Bond
Street
,
in
a
jiffy
,
my
name
's
Jack
Robinson
!
"
  
<EOS>
With
her
expert
little
ways
in
sharp
action
,
she
had
got
a
doll
into
whitey
-
brown
paper
orders
,
before
the
meal
was
over
,
and
was
displaying
it
for
the
edification
of
the
Jewish
mind
,
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
street
-
door
.
<EOS>
Riah
went
to
open
it
,
and
presently
came
back
,
ushering
in
,
with
the
grave
and
courteous
air
that
sat
so
well
upon
him
,
a
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
was
a
stranger
to
the
dressmaker
;
but
even
in
the
moment
of
his
casting
his
eyes
upon
her
,
there
was
something
in
his
manner
which
brought
to
her
remembrance
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
Hexam
's
friend
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
replied
Miss
Jenny
,
instantly
on
the
defensive
.
"
<EOS>
And
Lizzie
Hexam
's
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
note
from
her
,
entreating
you
to
accede
to
the
request
of
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
,
the
bearer
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Riah
chances
to
know
that
I
am
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
,
and
will
tell
you
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Riah
bent
his
head
in
corroboration
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
read
the
note
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
short
,
"
said
Jenny
,
with
a
look
of
wonder
,
when
she
had
read
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
time
to
make
it
longer
.
<EOS>
Time
was
so
very
precious
.
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
is
dying
.
  
<EOS>
The
dressmaker
clasped
her
hands
,
and
uttered
a
little
piteous
cry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
dying
,
"
repeated
Lightwood
,
with
emotion
,
"
at
some
distance
from
here
.
<EOS>
He
is
sinking
under
injuries
received
at
the
hands
of
a
villain
who
attacked
him
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
I
come
straight
from
his
bedside
.
<EOS>
He
is
almost
always
insensible
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
restless
interval
of
sensibility
,
or
partial
sensibility
,
I
made
out
that
he
asked
for
you
to
be
brought
to
sit
by
him
.
<EOS>
Hardly
relying
on
my
own
interpretation
of
the
indistinct
sounds
he
made
,
I
caused
Lizzie
to
hear
them
.
<EOS>
We
were
both
sure
that
he
asked
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
dressmaker
,
with
her
hands
still
clasped
,
looked
affrightedly
from
the
one
to
the
other
of
her
two
companions
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
delay
,
he
may
die
with
his
request
ungratified
,
with
his
last
wish
---
intrusted
to
me
---
we
have
long
been
much
more
than
brothers
---
unfulfilled
.
<EOS>
I
shall
break
down
,
if
I
try
to
say
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
the
black
bonnet
and
the
crutch
-
stick
were
on
duty
,
the
good
Jew
was
left
in
possession
of
the
house
,
and
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
side
by
side
in
a
chaise
with
Mortimer
Lightwood
,
was
posting
out
of
town
.
   
<EOS>
THE
DOLLS
'
<EOS>
DRESSMAKER
<EOS>
DISCOVERS
<EOS>
A
WORD
.
 
<EOS>
A
darkened
and
hushed
room
;
the
river
outside
the
windows
flowing
on
to
the
vast
ocean
;
a
figure
on
the
bed
,
swathed
and
bandaged
and
bound
,
lying
helpless
on
its
back
,
with
its
two
useless
arms
in
splints
at
its
sides
.
<EOS>
Only
two
days
of
usage
so
familiarized
the
little
dressmaker
with
this
scene
,
that
it
held
the
place
occupied
two
days
ago
by
the
recollections
of
years
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
moved
since
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
his
eyes
were
open
,
sometimes
closed
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
open
,
there
was
no
meaning
in
their
unwinking
stare
at
one
spot
straight
before
them
,
unless
for
a
moment
the
brow
knitted
into
a
faint
expression
of
anger
,
or
surprise
.
<EOS>
Then
,
Mortimer
Lightwood
would
speak
to
him
,
and
on
occasions
he
would
be
so
far
roused
as
to
make
an
attempt
to
pronounce
his
friend
's
name
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
an
instant
consciousness
was
gone
again
,
and
no
spirit
of
Eugene
was
in
Eugene
's
crushed
outer
form
.
  
<EOS>
They
provided
Jenny
with
materials
for
plying
her
work
,
and
she
had
a
little
table
placed
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
.
<EOS>
Sitting
there
,
with
her
rich
shower
of
hair
falling
over
the
chair
-
back
,
they
hoped
she
might
attract
his
notice
.
<EOS>
With
the
same
object
,
she
would
sing
,
just
above
her
breath
,
when
he
opened
his
eyes
,
or
she
saw
his
brow
knit
into
that
faint
expression
,
so
evanescent
that
it
was
like
a
shape
made
in
water
.
<EOS>
But
as
yet
he
had
not
heeded
.
<EOS>
The
"
they
"
here
mentioned
,
were
the
medical
attendant
;
Lizzie
,
who
was
there
in
all
her
intervals
of
rest
;
and
Lightwood
,
who
never
left
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
days
became
three
,
and
the
three
days
became
four
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
quite
unexpectedly
,
he
said
something
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
was
it
,
my
dear
Eugene
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
,
Mortimer
---
"
  
"
Will
I
---
?
"
   
---
"
Send
for
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
,
she
is
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
Quite
unconscious
of
the
long
blank
,
he
supposed
that
they
were
still
speaking
together
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
dressmaker
stood
up
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
humming
her
song
,
and
nodded
to
him
brightly
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
shake
hands
,
Jenny
,
"
 
said
Eugene
,
with
something
of
his
old
look
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
repeated
this
to
her
,
for
it
could
only
be
made
out
by
bending
over
him
and
closely
watching
his
attempts
to
say
it
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
while
,
he
added
:
  
"
<EOS>
Ask
her
if
she
has
seen
the
children
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
could
not
understand
this
,
neither
could
Jenny
herself
,
until
he
added
:
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
her
if
she
has
smelt
the
flowers
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
know
!
"
cried
Jenny
.
<EOS>
"
I
understand
him
now
!
"
<EOS>
Then
,
Lightwood
yielded
his
place
to
her
quick
approach
,
and
she
said
,
bending
over
the
bed
,
with
that
better
look
:
"
<EOS>
You
mean
my
long
bright
slanting
rows
of
children
,
who
used
to
bring
me
ease
and
rest
?
<EOS>
You
mean
the
children
who
used
to
take
me
up
,
and
make
me
light
?
<EOS>
"
  
Eugene
smiled
,
"
Yes
.
"
  
"
I
have
not
seen
them
since
I
saw
you
.
<EOS>
I
never
see
them
now
,
but
I
am
hardly
ever
in
pain
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
pretty
fancy
,
"
said
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
heard
my
birds
sing
,
"
cried
the
little
creature
,
"
and
I
have
smelt
my
flowers
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
I
have
!
<EOS>
And
both
were
most
beautiful
and
most
Divine
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stay
and
help
to
nurse
me
,
"
said
Eugene
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
you
to
have
the
fancy
here
,
before
I
die
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
touched
his
lips
with
her
hand
,
and
shaded
her
eyes
with
that
same
hand
as
she
went
back
to
her
work
and
her
little
low
song
.
<EOS>
He
heard
the
song
with
evident
pleasure
,
until
she
allowed
it
gradually
to
sink
away
into
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
can
give
me
anything
to
keep
me
here
for
only
a
few
minutes
---
"
  
"
To
keep
you
here
,
Eugene
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
prevent
my
wandering
away
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
where
---
for
I
begin
to
be
sensible
that
I
have
just
come
back
,
and
that
I
shall
lose
myself
again
---
do
so
,
dear
boy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
gave
him
such
stimulants
as
could
be
given
him
with
safety
(
they
were
always
at
hand
,
ready
)
,
and
bending
over
him
once
more
,
was
about
to
caution
him
,
when
he
said
:
  
"
Do
n't
tell
me
not
to
speak
,
for
I
must
speak
.
<EOS>
If
you
knew
the
harassing
anxiety
that
gnaws
and
wears
me
when
I
am
wandering
in
those
places
---
<EOS>
where
are
those
endless
places
,
Mortimer
?
<EOS>
They
must
be
at
an
immense
distance
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
saw
in
his
friend
's
face
that
he
was
losing
himself
;
for
he
added
after
a
moment
:
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
---
I
am
not
gone
yet
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wanted
to
tell
me
something
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
My
poor
dear
fellow
,
you
wanted
to
say
something
to
your
old
friend
---
to
the
friend
who
has
always
loved
you
,
admired
you
,
imitated
you
,
founded
himself
upon
you
,
been
nothing
without
you
,
and
who
,
God
knows
,
would
be
here
in
your
place
if
he
could
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tut
,
tut
!
"
said
Eugene
with
a
tender
glance
as
the
other
put
his
hand
before
his
face
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
worth
it
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
that
I
like
it
,
dear
boy
,
but
I
am
not
worth
it
.
<EOS>
This
attack
,
my
dear
Mortimer
;
this
murder
---
"
  
<EOS>
His
friend
leaned
over
him
with
renewed
attention
,
saying
:
"
You
and
I
suspect
some
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
than
suspect
.
<EOS>
But
,
Mortimer
,
while
I
lie
here
,
and
when
I
lie
here
no
longer
,
I
trust
to
you
that
the
perpetrator
is
never
brought
to
justice
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eugene
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Her
innocent
reputation
would
be
ruined
,
my
friend
.
<EOS>
She
would
be
punished
,
not
he
.
<EOS>
I
have
wronged
her
enough
in
fact
;
I
have
wronged
her
still
more
in
intention
.
<EOS>
You
recollect
what
pavement
is
said
to
be
made
of
good
intentions
.
<EOS>
It
is
made
of
bad
intentions
too
.
<EOS>
Mortimer
,
I
am
lying
on
it
,
and
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
  
"
Be
comforted
,
my
dear
Eugene
.
"
  
"
I
will
,
when
you
have
promised
me
.
<EOS>
Dear
Mortimer
,
the
man
must
never
be
pursued
.
<EOS>
If
he
should
be
accused
,
you
must
keep
him
silent
and
save
him
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
of
avenging
me
;
think
only
of
hushing
the
story
and
protecting
her
.
<EOS>
You
can
confuse
the
case
,
and
turn
aside
the
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
what
I
say
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
schoolmaster
,
Bradley
Headstone
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
me
?
<EOS>
Twice
;
it
was
not
the
schoolmaster
,
Bradley
Headstone
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
me
?
<EOS>
Three
times
;
it
was
not
the
schoolmaster
,
Bradley
Headstone
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
exhausted
.
<EOS>
His
speech
had
been
whispered
,
broken
,
and
indistinct
;
but
by
a
great
effort
he
had
made
it
plain
enough
to
be
unmistakeable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
fellow
,
I
am
wandering
away
.
<EOS>
Stay
me
for
another
moment
,
if
you
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
lifted
his
head
at
the
neck
,
and
put
a
wine
-
glass
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
He
rallied
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
long
ago
it
was
done
,
whether
weeks
,
days
,
or
hours
.
<EOS>
No
matter
.
<EOS>
There
is
inquiry
on
foot
,
and
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Say
!
<EOS>
Is
there
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Check
it
;
divert
it
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
her
be
brought
in
question
.
<EOS>
Shield
her
.
<EOS>
The
guilty
man
,
brought
to
justice
,
would
poison
her
name
.
<EOS>
Let
the
guilty
man
go
unpunished
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
and
my
reparation
before
all
!
<EOS>
Promise
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eugene
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
promise
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
act
of
turning
his
eyes
gratefully
towards
his
friend
,
he
wandered
away
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
stood
still
,
and
settled
into
that
former
intent
unmeaning
stare
.
  
<EOS>
Hours
and
hours
,
days
and
nights
<EOS>
,
he
remained
in
this
same
condition
.
<EOS>
There
were
times
when
he
would
calmly
speak
to
his
friend
after
a
long
period
of
unconsciousness
,
and
would
say
he
was
better
,
and
would
ask
for
something
.
<EOS>
Before
it
could
be
given
him
,
he
would
be
gone
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
all
softened
compassion
now
,
watched
him
with
an
earnestness
that
never
relaxed
.
<EOS>
She
would
regularly
change
the
ice
,
or
the
cooling
spirit
,
on
his
head
,
and
would
keep
her
ear
at
the
pillow
between
whiles
,
listening
for
any
faint
words
that
fell
from
him
in
his
wanderings
.
<EOS>
It
was
amazing
through
how
many
hours
at
a
time
she
would
remain
beside
him
,
in
a
crouching
attitude
,
attentive
to
his
slightest
moan
.
<EOS>
As
he
could
not
move
a
hand
,
he
could
make
no
sign
of
distress
;
but
,
through
this
close
watching
(
if
through
no
secret
sympathy
or
power
)
the
little
creature
attained
an
understanding
of
him
that
Lightwood
did
not
possess
.
<EOS>
Mortimer
would
often
turn
to
her
,
as
if
she
were
an
interpreter
between
this
sentient
world
and
the
insensible
man
;
and
she
would
change
the
dressing
of
a
wound
,
or
ease
a
ligature
,
or
turn
his
face
,
or
alter
the
pressure
of
the
bedclothes
on
him
,
with
an
absolute
certainty
of
doing
right
.
<EOS>
The
natural
lightness
and
delicacy
of
touch
which
had
become
very
refined
by
practice
in
her
miniature
work
,
no
doubt
was
involved
in
this
;
but
her
perception
was
at
least
as
fine
.
  
<EOS>
The
one
word
,
Lizzie
,
he
muttered
millions
of
times
.
<EOS>
In
a
certain
phase
of
his
distressful
state
,
which
was
the
worst
to
those
who
tended
him
,
he
would
roll
his
head
upon
the
pillow
,
incessantly
repeating
the
name
in
a
hurried
and
impatient
manner
,
with
the
misery
of
a
disturbed
mind
,
and
the
monotony
of
a
machine
.
<EOS>
Equally
,
when
he
lay
still
and
staring
,
he
would
repeat
it
for
hours
without
cessation
,
but
then
,
always
in
a
tone
of
subdued
warning
and
horror
.
<EOS>
Her
presence
and
her
touch
upon
his
breast
or
face
would
often
stop
this
,
and
then
they
learned
to
expect
that
he
would
for
some
time
remain
still
,
with
his
eyes
closed
,
and
that
he
would
be
conscious
on
opening
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
heavy
disappointment
of
their
hope
---
revived
by
the
welcome
silence
of
the
room
---
was
,
that
his
spirit
would
glide
away
again
and
be
lost
,
in
the
moment
of
their
joy
that
it
was
there
.
  
<EOS>
This
frequent
rising
of
a
drowning
man
from
the
deep
,
to
sink
again
,
was
dreadful
to
the
beholders
.
<EOS>
But
,
gradually
the
change
stole
upon
him
that
it
became
dreadful
to
himself
.
<EOS>
His
desire
to
impart
something
that
was
on
his
mind
,
his
unspeakable
yearning
to
have
speech
with
his
friend
and
make
a
communication
to
him
,
so
troubled
him
when
he
recovered
consciousness
,
that
its
term
was
thereby
shortened
.
<EOS>
As
the
man
rising
from
the
deep
would
disappear
the
sooner
for
fighting
with
the
water
,
so
he
in
his
desperate
struggle
went
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
One
afternoon
when
he
had
been
lying
still
,
and
Lizzie
,
unrecognized
,
had
just
stolen
out
of
the
room
to
pursue
her
occupation
,
he
uttered
Lightwood
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Eugene
,
I
am
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
is
this
to
last
,
Mortimer
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Still
,
Eugene
,
you
are
no
worse
than
you
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
know
there
's
no
hope
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
pray
it
may
last
long
enough
for
you
to
do
me
one
last
service
,
and
for
me
to
do
one
last
action
.
<EOS>
Keep
me
here
a
few
moments
,
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
Try
,
try
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
friend
gave
him
what
aid
he
could
,
and
encouraged
him
to
believe
that
he
was
more
composed
,
though
even
then
his
eyes
were
losing
the
expression
they
so
rarely
recovered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
me
here
,
dear
fellow
,
if
you
can
.
<EOS>
Stop
my
wandering
away
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
,
not
yet
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
,
dear
Eugene
,
what
is
it
I
shall
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
me
here
for
only
a
single
minute
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
away
again
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
go
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
speak
first
.
<EOS>
Stop
me
---
stop
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
poor
Eugene
,
try
to
be
calm
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
try
.
<EOS>
I
try
so
hard
.
<EOS>
If
you
only
knew
how
hard
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
wander
till
I
have
spoken
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
little
more
wine
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
complied
.
<EOS>
Eugene
,
with
a
most
pathetic
struggle
against
the
unconsciousness
that
was
coming
over
him
,
and
with
a
look
of
appeal
that
affected
his
friend
profoundly
,
said
:
  
"
You
can
leave
me
with
Jenny
,
while
you
speak
to
her
and
tell
her
what
I
beseech
of
her
.
<EOS>
You
can
leave
me
with
Jenny
,
while
you
are
gone
.
<EOS>
There
's
not
much
for
you
to
do
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
be
long
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
no
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
what
it
is
that
I
shall
do
,
Eugene
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
!
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
hold
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
in
a
word
,
Eugene
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
fixed
again
,
and
the
only
word
that
came
from
his
lips
was
the
word
millions
of
times
repeated
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
Lizzie
,
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
watchful
little
dressmaker
had
been
vigilant
as
ever
in
her
watch
,
and
she
now
came
up
and
touched
Lightwood
's
arm
as
he
looked
down
at
his
friend
,
despairingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
her
finger
on
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
eyes
are
closing
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
conscious
when
he
next
opens
them
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
give
you
a
leading
word
to
say
to
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
Jenny
,
if
you
could
only
give
me
the
right
word
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
.
<EOS>
Stoop
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stooped
,
and
she
whispered
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
She
whispered
in
his
ear
one
short
word
of
a
single
syllable
.
<EOS>
Lightwood
started
,
and
looked
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Try
it
,
"
said
the
little
creature
,
with
an
excited
and
exultant
face
.
<EOS>
She
then
bent
over
the
unconscious
man
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
kissed
him
on
the
check
,
and
kissed
the
poor
maimed
hand
that
was
nearest
to
her
.
<EOS>
Then
,
she
withdrew
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Some
two
hours
afterwards
,
Mortimer
Lightwood
saw
his
consciousness
come
back
,
and
instantly
,
but
very
tranquilly
,
bent
over
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
speak
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
Do
no
more
than
look
at
me
,
and
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
follow
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
moved
his
head
in
assent
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
on
from
the
point
where
we
broke
off
.
<EOS>
Is
the
word
we
should
soon
have
come
to
<EOS>
---
is
it
---
Wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
O
God
bless
you
,
Mortimer
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
agitated
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
,
dear
Eugene
.
<EOS>
Your
mind
will
be
more
at
peace
,
lying
here
,
if
you
make
Lizzie
your
wife
.
<EOS>
You
wish
me
to
speak
to
her
,
and
tell
her
so
,
and
entreat
her
to
be
your
wife
.
<EOS>
You
ask
her
to
kneel
at
this
bedside
and
be
married
to
you
,
that
your
reparation
may
be
complete
.
<EOS>
Is
that
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
done
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
Trust
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
to
go
away
for
some
few
hours
,
to
give
effect
to
your
wishes
.
<EOS>
You
see
this
is
unavoidable
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
friend
,
I
said
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
not
the
clue
then
.
<EOS>
How
do
you
think
I
got
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Glancing
wistfully
around
,
Eugene
saw
Miss
Jenny
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
looking
at
him
with
her
elbows
on
the
bed
,
and
her
head
upon
her
hands
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
trace
of
his
whimsical
air
upon
him
,
as
he
tried
to
smile
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
indeed
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
"
the
discovery
was
hers
.
<EOS>
Observe
,
my
dear
Eugene
;
while
I
am
away
you
will
know
that
I
have
discharged
my
trust
with
Lizzie
,
by
finding
her
here
,
in
my
present
place
at
your
bedside
,
to
leave
you
no
more
.
<EOS>
A
final
word
before
I
go
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
right
course
of
a
true
man
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
And
I
solemnly
believe
,
with
all
my
soul
,
that
if
Providence
should
mercifully
restore
you
to
us
,
you
will
be
blessed
with
a
noble
wife
in
the
preserver
of
your
life
,
whom
you
will
dearly
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Amen
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
not
come
through
it
,
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
be
the
less
hopeful
or
less
strong
,
for
this
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
Touch
my
face
with
yours
,
in
case
I
should
not
hold
out
till
you
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
,
Mortimer
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
uneasy
for
me
while
you
are
gone
.
<EOS>
If
my
dear
brave
girl
will
take
me
,
I
feel
persuaded
that
I
shall
live
long
enough
to
be
married
,
dear
fellow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Jenny
gave
up
altogether
on
this
parting
taking
place
between
the
friends
,
and
,
sitting
with
her
back
towards
the
bed
in
the
bower
made
by
her
bright
hair
,
wept
heartily
,
though
noiselessly
.
<EOS>
Mortimer
Lightwood
was
soon
gone
.
<EOS>
As
the
evening
light
lengthened
the
heavy
reflections
of
the
trees
in
the
river
,
another
figure
came
with
a
soft
step
into
the
sick
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
conscious
?
"
asked
the
little
dressmaker
,
as
the
figure
took
its
station
by
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
For
,
Jenny
had
given
place
to
it
immediately
,
and
could
not
see
the
sufferer
's
face
,
in
the
dark
room
,
from
her
new
and
removed
position
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
conscious
,
Jenny
,
"
murmured
Eugene
for
himself
.
"
<EOS>
He
knows
his
wife
.

EFFECT
IS
GIVEN
TO
THE
DOLLS
'
DRESSMAKER
'S
DISCOVERY
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
sat
at
needlework
in
her
neat
little
room
,
beside
a
basket
of
neat
little
articles
of
clothing
,
which
presented
so
much
of
the
appearance
of
being
in
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
's
way
of
business
,
that
one
might
have
supposed
she
was
going
to
set
up
in
opposition
to
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
Complete
British
Family
Housewife
had
imparted
sage
counsel
anent
them
,
did
not
appear
,
but
probably
not
,
as
that
cloudy
oracle
was
nowhere
visible
.
<EOS>
For
certain
,
however
,
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
stitched
at
them
with
so
dexterous
a
hand
,
that
she
must
have
taken
lessons
of
somebody
.
<EOS>
Love
is
in
all
things
a
most
wonderful
teacher
,
and
perhaps
love
(
from
a
pictorial
point
of
view
,
with
nothing
on
but
a
thimble
)
,
had
been
teaching
this
branch
of
needle
work
to
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
near
John
's
time
for
coming
home
,
but
as
Mrs.
John
was
desirous
to
finish
a
special
triumph
of
her
skill
before
dinner
,
she
did
not
go
out
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Placidly
,
though
rather
consequentially
smiling
,
she
sat
stitching
away
with
a
regular
sound
,
like
a
sort
of
dimpled
little
charming
Dresden
-
china
clock
by
the
very
best
maker
.
  
<EOS>
A
knock
at
the
door
,
and
a
ring
at
the
bell
.
<EOS>
Not
John
;
or
Bella
would
have
flown
out
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Then
who
,
if
not
John
?
<EOS>
Bella
was
asking
herself
the
question
,
when
that
fluttering
little
fool
of
a
servant
fluttered
in
,
saying
,
"
Mr.
Lightwood
!
"
  
<EOS>
Oh
good
gracious
!
  
<EOS>
Bella
had
but
time
to
throw
a
handkerchief
over
the
basket
,
when
Mr.
Lightwood
made
his
bow
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
amiss
with
Mr.
Lightwood
,
for
he
was
strangely
grave
and
looked
ill
.
  
<EOS>
With
a
brief
reference
to
the
happy
time
when
it
had
been
his
privilege
to
know
Mrs.
Rokesmith
as
Miss
Wilfer
,
Mr.
Lightwood
explained
what
was
amiss
with
him
and
why
he
came
.
<EOS>
He
came
bearing
Lizzie
Hexam
's
earnest
hope
that
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
would
see
her
married
.
  
<EOS>
Bella
was
so
fluttered
by
the
request
,
and
by
the
short
narrative
he
had
feelingly
given
her
,
that
there
never
was
a
more
timely
smellingbottle
than
John
's
knock
.
<EOS>
"
My
husband
,
"
said
Bella
;
"
I
'll
bring
him
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
that
turned
out
to
be
more
easily
said
than
done
;
for
,
the
instant
she
mentioned
Mr.
Lightwood
's
name
,
John
stopped
,
with
his
hand
upon
the
lock
of
the
room
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
up
stairs
,
my
darling
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
was
amazed
by
the
flush
in
his
face
,
and
by
his
sudden
turning
away
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
it
mean
?
<EOS>
"
she
thought
,
as
she
accompanied
him
up
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
life
,
"
said
John
,
taking
her
on
his
knee
,
"
tell
me
all
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
All
very
well
to
say
,
"
Tell
me
all
about
it
;
"
but
John
was
very
much
confused
.
<EOS>
His
attention
evidently
trailed
off
,
now
and
then
,
even
while
Bella
told
him
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
knew
that
he
took
a
great
interest
in
Lizzie
and
her
fortunes
.
<EOS>
What
could
it
mean
?
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
to
this
marriage
with
me
,
John
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
N
---
<EOS>
no
,
my
love
;
I
ca
n't
do
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
do
that
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
it
's
quite
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
Not
to
be
thought
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
go
alone
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
you
will
go
with
Mr.
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
time
we
went
down
to
Mr.
Lightwood
,
John
dear
?
<EOS>
"
Bella
insinuated
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
,
it
's
almost
time
you
went
,
but
I
must
ask
you
to
excuse
me
to
him
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
mean
,
John
dear
,
that
you
are
not
going
to
see
him
?
<EOS>
Why
,
he
knows
you
have
come
home
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
little
unfortunate
,
but
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
<EOS>
Unfortunate
or
fortunate
<EOS>
,
I
positively
can
not
see
him
,
my
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
cast
about
in
her
mind
what
could
be
his
reason
for
this
unaccountable
behaviour
,
as
she
sat
on
his
knee
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
and
pouting
a
little
.
<EOS>
A
weak
reason
presented
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
dear
,
you
never
can
be
jealous
of
Mr.
Lightwood
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
my
precious
child
,
"
returned
her
husband
,
laughing
outright
:
"
how
could
I
be
jealous
of
him
?
<EOS>
Why
should
I
be
jealous
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
,
you
know
,
John
,
"
pursued
Bella
,
pouting
a
little
more
,
"
though
he
did
rather
admire
me
once
,
it
was
not
my
fault
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
your
fault
that
I
admired
you
,
"
returned
her
husband
,
with
a
look
of
pride
in
her
,
"
and
why
not
your
fault
that
he
admired
you
?
<EOS>
But
,
I
jealous
on
that
account
?
<EOS>
Why
,
I
must
go
distracted
for
life
,
if
I
turned
jealous
of
every
one
who
used
to
find
my
wife
beautiful
and
winning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
half
angry
with
you
,
John
dear
,
"
said
Bella
,
laughing
a
little
,
"
and
half
pleased
with
you
;
because
you
are
such
a
stupid
old
fellow
,
and
yet
you
say
nice
things
,
as
if
you
meant
them
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
mysterious
,
sir
.
<EOS>
What
harm
do
you
know
of
Mr.
Lightwood
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
,
my
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
has
he
ever
done
to
you
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
never
done
anything
to
me
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
I
know
no
more
against
him
than
I
know
against
Mr.
Wrayburn
;
he
has
never
done
anything
to
me
;
neither
has
Mr.
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
have
exactly
the
same
objection
to
both
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
John
!
"
retorted
Bella
,
as
if
she
were
giving
him
up
for
a
bad
job
,
as
she
used
to
give
up
herself
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
nothing
better
than
a
sphinx
!
<EOS>
And
a
married
sphinx
is
n't
a
---
is
n't
a
nice
confidential
husband
,
"
said
Bella
,
in
a
tone
of
injury
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bella
,
my
life
,
"
said
John
Rokesmith
,
touching
her
cheek
,
with
a
grave
smile
,
as
she
cast
down
her
eyes
and
pouted
again
;
"
look
at
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
speak
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
earnest
,
Blue
Beard
of
the
secret
chamber
?
"
asked
Bella
,
clearing
her
pretty
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
earnest
.
<EOS>
And
I
confess
to
the
secret
chamber
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
that
you
asked
me
not
to
declare
what
I
thought
of
your
higher
qualities
until
you
had
been
tried
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
John
dear
.
<EOS>
And
I
fully
meant
it
,
and
I
fully
mean
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
time
will
come
,
my
darling
---
I
am
no
prophet
,
but
I
say
so
,
---
when
you
will
be
tried
.
<EOS>
The
time
will
come
,
I
think
,
when
you
will
undergo
a
trial
through
which
you
will
never
pass
quite
triumphantly
for
me
,
unless
you
can
put
perfect
faith
in
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
may
be
sure
of
me
,
John
dear
,
for
I
can
put
perfect
faith
in
you
,
and
I
do
,
<EOS>
and
I
always
,
always
will
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
judge
me
by
a
little
thing
like
this
,
John
.
<EOS>
In
little
things
,
I
am
a
little
thing
myself
---
I
always
was
.
<EOS>
But
in
great
things
,
I
hope
not
;
I
do
n't
mean
to
boast
,
John
dear
,
<EOS>
but
I
hope
not
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
even
better
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
she
said
than
she
was
,
as
he
felt
her
loving
arms
about
him
.
<EOS>
If
the
Golden
Dustman
's
riches
had
been
his
to
stake
,
he
would
have
staked
them
to
the
last
farthing
on
the
fidelity
through
good
and
evil
of
her
affectionate
and
trusting
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
'll
go
down
to
,
and
go
away
with
,
Mr.
Lightwood
,
"
said
Bella
,
springing
up
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
most
creasing
and
tumbling
Clumsy
-
Boots
of
a
packer
,
John
,
that
ever
was
;
but
if
you
're
quite
good
,
and
will
promise
never
to
do
so
any
more
(
though
I
do
n't
know
what
you
have
done
!
)
<EOS>
you
may
pack
me
a
little
bag
for
a
night
,
while
I
get
my
bonnet
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
gaily
complied
,
and
she
tied
her
dimpled
chin
up
,
and
shook
her
head
into
her
bonnet
,
and
pulled
out
the
bows
of
her
bonnetstrings
,
and
got
her
gloves
on
,
finger
by
finger
,
and
finally
got
them
on
her
little
plump
hands
,
and
bade
him
good
-
bye
and
went
down
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
's
impatience
was
much
relieved
when
he
found
her
dressed
for
departure
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Rokesmith
goes
with
us
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
hesitating
,
with
a
look
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
forgot
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
best
compliments
.
<EOS>
His
face
is
swollen
to
the
size
of
two
faces
,
and
he
is
to
go
to
bed
directly
,
poor
fellow
,
to
wait
for
the
doctor
,
who
is
coming
to
lance
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
curious
,
"
observed
Lightwood
,
"
that
I
have
never
yet
seen
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
though
we
have
been
engaged
in
the
same
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Really
?
"
said
the
unblushing
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
,
"
observed
Lightwood
,
"
that
I
never
shall
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
These
things
happen
so
oddly
sometimes
,
"
said
Bella
with
a
steady
countenance
,
"
that
there
seems
a
kind
of
fatality
in
them
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
quite
ready
,
Mr.
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
started
directly
,
in
a
little
carriage
that
Lightwood
had
brought
with
him
from
never
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
Greenwich
;
and
from
Greenwich
they
started
directly
for
London
;
and
in
London
they
waited
at
a
railway
station
until
such
time
as
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
,
and
Margaretta
his
wife
,
with
whom
Mortimer
Lightwood
had
been
already
in
conference
,
should
come
and
join
them
.
  
<EOS>
That
worthy
couple
were
delayed
by
a
portentous
old
parishioner
of
the
female
gender
,
who
was
one
of
the
plagues
of
their
lives
,
and
with
whom
they
bore
with
most
exemplary
sweetness
and
good
-
humour
,
notwithstanding
her
having
an
infection
of
absurdity
about
her
,
that
communicated
itself
to
everything
with
which
,
and
everybody
with
whom
,
she
came
in
contact
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
member
of
the
Reverend
Frank
's
congregation
,
and
made
a
point
of
distinguishing
herself
in
that
body
,
by
conspicuously
weeping
at
everything
,
however
cheering
,
<EOS>
said
by
the
Reverend
Frank
in
his
public
ministration
;
 
also
by
applying
to
herself
the
various
lamentations
of
David
,
and
complaining
in
a
personally
injured
manner
(
much
in
arrear
of
the
clerk
and
the
rest
of
the
respondents
)
that
her
enemies
were
digging
pit
-
falls
about
her
,
and
breaking
her
with
rods
of
iron
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
this
old
widow
discharged
herself
of
that
portion
of
the
Morning
and
Evening
Service
as
if
she
were
lodging
a
complaint
on
oath
and
applying
for
a
warrant
before
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
her
most
inconvenient
characteristic
,
for
that
took
the
form
of
an
impression
,
usually
recurring
in
inclement
weather
and
at
about
daybreak
,
that
she
had
something
on
her
mind
and
stood
in
immediate
need
of
the
Reverend
Frank
to
come
and
take
it
off
.
<EOS>
Many
a
time
had
that
kind
creature
got
up
,
and
gone
out
to
Mrs.
Sprodgkin
(
such
was
the
disciple
's
name
)
,
suppressing
a
strong
sense
of
her
comicality
by
his
strong
sense
of
duty
,
and
perfectly
knowing
that
nothing
but
a
cold
would
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
beyond
themselves
,
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
and
Mrs.
Milvey
seldom
hinted
that
Mrs.
Sprodgkin
was
hardly
worth
the
trouble
she
gave
;
but
both
made
the
best
of
her
,
as
they
did
of
all
their
troubles
.
  
<EOS>
This
very
exacting
member
of
the
fold
appeared
to
be
endowed
with
a
sixth
sense
,
in
regard
of
knowing
when
the
Reverend
Frank
Milvey
least
desired
her
company
,
and
with
promptitude
appearing
in
his
little
hall
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
when
the
Reverend
Frank
had
willingly
engaged
that
he
and
his
wife
would
accompany
Lightwood
back
,
he
said
,
as
a
matter
of
course
:
"
We
must
make
haste
to
get
out
.
<EOS>
Margaretta
,
my
dear
,
or
we
shall
be
descended
on
by
Mrs.
Sprodgkin
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
Mrs.
Milvey
replied
,
in
her
pleasantly
emphatic
way
,
"
Oh
yes
,
for
she
is
such
a
marplot
,
Frank
,
and
does
worry
so
!
"
<EOS>
Words
that
were
scarcely
uttered
when
their
theme
was
announced
as
in
faithful
attendance
below
,
desiring
counsel
on
a
spiritual
matter
.
<EOS>
The
points
on
which
Mrs.
Sprodgkin
sought
elucidation
being
seldom
of
a
pressing
nature
(
<EOS>
as
Who
begat
Whom
,
or
some
information
concerning
the
Amorites
)
,
Mrs.
Milvey
on
this
special
occasion
resorted
to
the
device
of
buying
her
off
with
a
present
of
tea
and
sugar
,
and
a
loaf
and
butter
.
<EOS>
These
gifts
Mrs.
Sprodgkin
accepted
,
but
still
insisted
on
dutifully
remaining
in
the
hall
,
to
curtsey
to
the
Reverend
Frank
as
he
came
forth
.
<EOS>
Who
,
incautiously
saying
in
his
genial
manner
,
"
Well
,
Sally
,
there
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
involved
himself
in
a
discursive
address
from
Mrs.
Sprodgkin
,
revolving
around
the
result
that
she
regarded
tea
and
sugar
in
the
light
of
myrrh
and
frankincense
,
and
considered
bread
and
butter
identical
with
locusts
and
wild
honey
.
<EOS>
Having
communicated
this
edifying
piece
of
information
,
Mrs.
Sprodgkin
was
left
still
unadjourned
in
the
hall
,
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Milvey
hurried
in
a
heated
condition
to
the
railway
station
.
<EOS>
All
of
which
is
here
recorded
to
the
honor
of
that
good
Christian
pair
,
representatives
of
hundreds
of
other
good
Christian
pairs
as
conscientious
and
as
useful
,
who
merge
the
smallness
of
their
work
in
its
greatness
,
and
feel
in
no
danger
of
losing
dignity
when
they
adapt
themselves
to
incomprehensible
humbugs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Detained
at
the
last
moment
by
one
who
had
a
claim
upon
me
,
"
 
was
the
Reverend
Frank
's
apology
to
Lightwood
,
taking
no
thought
of
himself
.
<EOS>
To
which
Mrs.
Milvey
added
,
taking
thought
for
him
,
like
the
championing
little
wife
she
was
;
"
Oh
yes
,
detained
at
the
last
moment
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
the
claim
,
Frank
,
I
must
say
that
I
do
think
you
are
over
-
considerate
sometimes
,
and
allow
that
to
be
a
little
abused
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
felt
conscious
,
in
spite
of
her
late
pledge
for
herself
,
that
her
husband
's
absence
would
give
disagreeable
occasion
for
surprise
to
the
Milveys
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
she
appear
quite
at
her
ease
when
Mrs.
Milvey
asked
:
  
"
How
is
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
and
is
he
gone
before
us
,
or
does
he
follow
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
It
becoming
necessary
,
upon
this
,
to
send
him
to
bed
again
and
hold
him
in
waiting
to
be
lanced
again
,
Bella
did
it
.
<EOS>
But
not
half
as
well
on
the
second
occasion
as
on
the
first
;
for
,
a
twice
-
told
white
one
seems
almost
to
become
a
black
one
,
when
you
are
not
used
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
!
"
said
Mrs.
Milvey
,
"
I
am
so
sorry
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Rokesmith
took
such
an
interest
in
Lizzie
Hexam
,
when
we
were
there
before
.
<EOS>
And
if
we
had
only
known
of
his
face
,
we
could
have
given
him
something
that
would
have
kept
it
down
long
enough
for
so
short
a
purpose
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
way
of
making
the
white
one
whiter
,
Bella
hastened
to
stipulate
that
he
was
not
in
pain
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Milvey
was
so
glad
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
"
said
Mrs.
Milvey
,
"
and
I
am
sure
you
do
n't
,
Frank
,
but
the
clergy
and
their
wives
seem
to
cause
swelled
faces
.
<EOS>
Whenever
I
take
notice
of
a
child
in
the
school
,
it
seems
to
me
as
if
its
face
swelled
instantly
.
<EOS>
Frank
never
makes
acquaintance
with
a
new
old
woman
,
but
she
gets
the
face
-
ache
.
<EOS>
And
another
thing
is
,
we
do
make
the
poor
children
sniff
so
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
we
do
it
,
and
I
should
be
so
glad
not
to
;
but
the
more
we
take
notice
of
them
,
the
more
they
sniff
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
do
when
the
text
is
given
out
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Frank
,
that
's
a
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
somewhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
reference
was
to
a
young
man
of
reserved
appearance
,
in
a
coat
and
waistcoat
of
black
,
and
pantaloons
of
pepper
and
salt
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
into
the
office
of
the
station
,
from
its
interior
,
in
an
unsettled
way
,
immediately
after
Lightwood
had
gone
out
to
the
train
:
and
he
had
been
hurriedly
reading
the
printed
bills
and
notices
on
the
wall
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
a
wandering
interest
in
what
was
said
among
the
people
waiting
there
and
passing
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
He
had
drawn
nearer
,
at
about
the
time
when
Mrs.
Milvey
mentioned
Lizzie
Hexam
,
and
had
remained
near
,
since
:
though
always
glancing
towards
the
door
by
which
Lightwood
had
gone
out
.
<EOS>
He
stood
with
his
back
towards
them
,
and
his
gloved
hands
clasped
behind
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
now
so
evident
a
faltering
upon
him
,
<EOS>
expressive
of
indecision
<EOS>
whether
or
no
he
should
express
his
having
heard
himself
referred
to
,
that
Mr.
Milvey
spoke
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
recall
your
name
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
remember
to
have
seen
you
in
your
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Bradley
Headstone
,
sir
,
"
he
replied
,
backing
into
a
more
retired
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ought
to
have
remembered
it
,
"
said
Mr.
Milvey
,
giving
him
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
are
well
?
<EOS>
A
little
overworked
,
I
am
afraid
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
overworked
just
at
present
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Had
no
play
in
your
last
holiday
time
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
work
and
no
play
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
will
not
make
dulness
,
in
your
case
,
I
dare
say
;
but
it
will
make
dyspepsia
,
if
you
do
n't
take
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
endeavour
to
take
care
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Might
I
beg
leave
to
speak
to
you
,
outside
,
a
moment
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
evening
,
and
the
office
was
well
lighted
.
<EOS>
The
schoolmaster
,
who
had
never
remitted
his
watch
on
Lightwood
's
door
,
now
moved
by
another
door
to
a
corner
without
,
where
there
was
more
shadow
than
light
;
and
said
,
plucking
at
his
gloves
:
  
"
One
of
your
ladies
,
sir
,
mentioned
within
my
hearing
a
name
that
I
am
acquainted
with
;
I
may
say
,
well
acquainted
with
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
the
sister
of
an
old
pupil
of
mine
.
<EOS>
He
was
my
pupil
for
a
long
time
,
and
has
got
on
and
gone
upward
rapidly
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
Hexam
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
Lizzie
Hexam
.
"
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
a
shy
man
,
struggling
against
nervousness
,
and
spoke
in
a
very
constrained
way
.
<EOS>
The
break
he
set
between
his
two
last
sentences
was
quite
embarrassing
to
his
hearer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Mr.
Milvey
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
going
down
to
see
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
gathered
as
much
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
hope
there
is
nothing
amiss
with
the
sister
of
my
old
pupil
?
<EOS>
I
hope
no
bereavement
has
befallen
her
.
<EOS>
I
hope
she
is
in
no
affliction
?
<EOS>
Has
lost
no
---
relation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Milvey
thought
this
a
man
with
a
very
odd
manner
,
and
a
dark
downward
look
;
but
he
answered
in
his
usual
open
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
tell
you
,
Mr.
Headstone
,
that
the
sister
of
your
old
pupil
has
not
sustained
any
such
loss
.
<EOS>
You
thought
I
might
be
going
down
to
bury
some
one
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
may
have
been
the
connexion
of
ideas
,
sir
,
with
your
clerical
character
,
but
I
was
not
conscious
of
it
.
<EOS>
---
Then
you
are
not
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
man
with
a
very
odd
manner
indeed
,
and
with
a
lurking
look
that
was
quite
oppressive
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
"
said
Mr.
Milvey
,
"
since
you
are
so
interested
in
the
sister
of
your
old
pupil
,
I
may
as
well
tell
you
that
I
am
going
down
to
marry
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
schoolmaster
started
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
to
marry
her
,
myself
,
"
said
Mr.
Milvey
,
with
a
smile
,
"
because
I
have
a
wife
already
.
<EOS>
To
perform
the
marriage
service
at
her
wedding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
Headstone
caught
hold
of
a
pillar
behind
him
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Milvey
knew
an
ashy
face
when
he
saw
it
,
he
saw
it
then
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
ill
,
Mr.
Headstone
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
much
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
will
pass
over
very
soon
.
<EOS>
I
am
accustomed
to
be
seized
with
giddiness
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
detain
you
,
sir
;
I
stand
in
need
of
no
assistance
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
Much
obliged
by
your
sparing
me
these
minutes
of
your
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Milvey
,
who
had
no
more
minutes
to
spare
,
made
a
suitable
reply
and
turned
back
into
the
office
,
he
observed
the
schoolmaster
to
lean
against
the
pillar
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
to
pull
at
his
neckcloth
as
if
he
were
trying
to
tear
it
off
.
<EOS>
The
Reverend
Frank
accordingly
directed
the
notice
of
one
of
the
attendants
to
him
,
by
saying
:
"
There
is
a
person
outside
who
seems
to
be
really
ill
,
and
to
require
some
help
,
though
he
says
he
does
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
had
by
this
time
secured
their
places
,
and
the
departure
-
bell
was
about
to
be
rung
.
<EOS>
They
took
their
seats
,
and
were
beginning
to
move
out
of
the
station
,
when
the
same
attendant
came
running
along
the
platform
,
looking
into
all
the
carriages
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
You
are
here
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
springing
on
the
step
,
and
holding
the
window
-
frame
by
his
elbow
,
as
the
carriage
moved
.
<EOS>
"
That
person
you
pointed
out
to
me
is
in
a
fit
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
infer
from
what
he
told
me
that
he
is
subject
to
such
attacks
.
<EOS>
He
will
come
to
,
in
the
air
,
in
a
little
while
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
took
very
bad
to
be
sure
,
and
was
biting
and
knocking
about
him
(
the
man
said
)
furiously
.
<EOS>
Would
the
gentleman
give
him
his
card
,
as
he
had
seen
him
first
?
<EOS>
The
gentleman
did
so
,
with
the
explanation
that
he
knew
no
more
of
the
man
attacked
than
that
he
was
a
man
of
a
very
respectable
occupation
,
who
had
said
he
was
out
of
health
,
as
his
appearance
would
of
itself
have
indicated
.
<EOS>
The
attendant
received
the
card
,
watched
his
opportunity
for
sliding
down
,
slid
down
,
and
so
it
ended
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
the
train
rattled
among
the
house
-
tops
,
and
among
the
ragged
sides
of
houses
torn
down
to
make
way
for
it
,
and
over
the
swarming
streets
,
and
under
the
fruitful
earth
,
until
it
shot
across
the
river
:
bursting
over
the
quiet
surface
like
a
bomb
-
shell
,
and
gone
again
as
if
it
had
exploded
in
the
rush
of
smoke
and
steam
and
glare
.
<EOS>
A
little
more
,
and
again
it
roared
across
the
river
,
a
great
rocket
:
spurning
the
watery
turnings
and
doublings
with
ineffable
contempt
,
and
going
straight
to
its
end
,
as
Father
Time
goes
to
his
.
<EOS>
To
whom
it
is
no
matter
what
living
waters
run
high
or
low
,
reflect
the
heavenly
lights
and
darknesses
,
produce
their
little
growth
of
weeds
and
flowers
,
turn
here
,
turn
there
,
are
noisy
or
still
,
are
troubled
or
at
rest
,
for
their
course
has
one
sure
termination
,
though
their
sources
and
devices
are
many
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
a
carriage
ride
succeeded
,
near
the
solemn
river
,
stealing
away
by
night
,
as
all
things
steal
away
,
by
night
and
by
day
,
so
quietly
yielding
to
the
attraction
of
the
loadstone
rock
of
Eternity
;
and
the
nearer
they
drew
to
the
chamber
where
Eugene
lay
,
the
more
they
feared
that
they
might
find
his
wanderings
done
.
<EOS>
At
last
they
saw
its
dim
light
shining
out
,
and
it
gave
them
hope
:
though
Lightwood
faltered
as
he
thought
:
"
If
he
were
gone
,
she
would
still
be
sitting
by
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
lay
quiet
,
half
in
stupor
,
half
in
sleep
.
<EOS>
Bella
,
entering
with
a
raised
admonitory
finger
,
kissed
Lizzie
softly
,
but
said
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
any
of
them
speak
,
but
all
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
silently
waiting
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
in
this
night
-
watch
,
mingling
with
the
flow
of
the
river
and
with
the
rush
of
the
train
,
came
the
questions
into
Bella
's
mind
again
:
<EOS>
What
could
be
in
the
depths
of
that
mystery
of
John
's
?
<EOS>
Why
was
it
that
he
had
never
been
seen
by
Mr.
Lightwood
,
whom
he
still
avoided
?
<EOS>
When
would
that
trial
come
,
through
which
her
faith
in
,
and
her
duty
to
,
her
dear
husband
,
was
to
carry
her
,
rendering
him
triumphant
?
<EOS>
For
,
that
had
been
his
term
.
<EOS>
Her
passing
through
the
trial
was
to
make
the
man
she
loved
with
all
her
heart
,
triumphant
.
<EOS>
Term
not
to
sink
out
of
sight
in
Bella
's
breast
.
  
<EOS>
Far
on
in
the
night
,
Eugene
opened
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
was
sensible
,
and
said
at
once
:
"
How
does
the
time
go
?
<EOS>
Has
our
Mortimer
come
back
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lightwood
was
there
immediately
,
to
answer
for
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Eugene
,
and
all
is
ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
boy
!
"
returned
Eugene
with
a
smile
,
"
we
both
thank
you
heartily
.
<EOS>
Lizzie
,
tell
them
how
welcome
they
are
,
and
that
I
would
be
eloquent
if
I
could
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
need
,
"
said
Mr.
Milvey
.
<EOS>
"
We
know
it
.
<EOS>
Are
you
better
,
Mr.
Wrayburn
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
happier
,
"
said
Eugene
.
  
<EOS>
"
Much
better
too
,
I
hope
?
"
  
<EOS>
Eugene
turned
his
eyes
towards
Lizzie
,
as
if
to
spare
her
,
and
answered
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
they
all
stood
around
the
bed
,
and
Mr.
Milvey
,
opening
his
book
,
began
the
service
;
so
rarely
associated
with
the
shadow
of
death
;
so
inseparable
in
the
mind
from
a
flush
of
life
and
gaiety
and
hope
and
health
and
joy
.
<EOS>
Bella
thought
how
different
from
her
own
sunny
little
wedding
,
and
wept
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Milvey
overflowed
with
pity
,
and
wept
too
.
<EOS>
The
dolls
'
dressmaker
,
with
her
hands
before
her
face
,
wept
in
her
golden
bower
.
<EOS>
Reading
in
a
low
clear
voice
,
and
bending
over
Eugene
,
who
kept
his
eyes
upon
him
,
Mr.
Milvey
did
his
office
with
suitable
simplicity
.
<EOS>
As
the
bridegroom
could
not
move
his
hand
,
they
touched
his
fingers
with
the
ring
,
and
so
put
it
on
the
bride
.
<EOS>
When
the
two
plighted
their
troth
,
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
,
and
kept
it
there
.
<EOS>
When
the
ceremony
was
done
,
and
all
the
rest
departed
from
the
room
,
she
drew
her
arm
under
his
head
,
and
laid
her
own
head
down
upon
the
pillow
by
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Undraw
the
curtains
,
my
dear
girl
,
"
said
Eugene
,
after
a
while
,
"
and
let
us
see
our
wedding
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
sun
was
rising
,
and
his
first
rays
struck
into
the
room
,
as
she
came
back
,
and
put
her
lips
to
his
.
<EOS>
"
I
bless
the
day
!
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
I
bless
the
day
!
"
said
Lizzie
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
made
a
poor
marriage
of
it
,
my
sweet
wife
,
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
shattered
graceless
fellow
,
stretched
at
his
length
here
,
and
next
to
nothing
for
you
when
you
are
a
young
widow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
the
marriage
that
I
would
have
given
all
the
world
to
dare
to
hope
for
,
"
she
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
thrown
yourself
away
,
"
said
Eugene
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
followed
the
treasure
of
your
heart
.
<EOS>
My
justification
is
,
that
you
had
thrown
that
away
first
,
dear
girl
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
I
had
given
it
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
same
thing
,
my
poor
Lizzie
!
"
  
"
Hush
,
hush
!
<EOS>
A
very
different
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
were
tears
in
his
eyes
,
and
she
besought
him
to
close
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
"
said
Eugene
,
again
shaking
his
head
;
"
let
me
look
at
you
,
Lizzie
,
while
I
can
.
<EOS>
You
brave
devoted
girl
!
<EOS>
You
heroine
!
"
  
<EOS>
Her
own
eyes
filled
under
his
praises
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
mustered
strength
to
move
his
wounded
head
a
very
little
way
,
and
lay
it
on
her
bosom
,
the
tears
of
both
fell
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lizzie
,
"
said
Eugene
,
after
a
silence
:
"
when
you
see
me
wandering
away
from
this
refuge
that
I
have
so
ill
deserved
,
speak
to
me
by
my
name
,
and
I
think
I
shall
come
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
There
!
"
he
exclaimed
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
gone
then
,
but
for
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
while
afterwards
,
when
he
appeared
to
be
sinking
into
insensibility
,
she
said
,
in
a
calm
loving
voice
:
"
Eugene
,
my
dear
husband
!
"
<EOS>
He
immediately
answered
:
"
There
again
!
<EOS>
You
see
how
you
can
recall
me
!
"
<EOS>
And
afterwards
,
when
he
could
not
speak
,
he
still
answered
by
a
slight
movement
of
his
head
upon
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
The
sun
was
high
in
the
sky
,
when
she
gently
disengaged
herself
to
give
him
the
stimulants
and
nourishment
he
required
.
<EOS>
The
utter
helplessness
of
the
wreck
of
him
that
lay
cast
ashore
there
,
now
alarmed
her
,
but
he
himself
appeared
a
little
more
hopeful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
beloved
Lizzie
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
How
shall
I
ever
pay
all
I
owe
you
,
if
I
recover
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
ashamed
of
me
,
"
she
replied
,
"
and
you
will
have
more
than
paid
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
require
a
life
,
Lizzie
,
to
pay
all
;
more
than
a
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Live
for
that
,
then
;
live
for
me
,
Eugene
;
live
to
see
how
hard
I
will
try
to
improve
myself
,
and
never
to
discredit
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
darling
girl
,
"
he
replied
,
rallying
more
of
his
old
manner
than
he
had
ever
yet
got
together
.
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
I
have
been
thinking
whether
it
is
not
the
best
thing
I
can
do
,
to
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
thing
you
can
do
,
to
leave
me
with
a
broken
heart
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
that
,
my
dear
girl
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
thinking
of
that
.
<EOS>
What
I
was
thinking
of
was
this
.
<EOS>
Out
of
your
compassion
for
me
,
in
this
maimed
and
broken
state
,
you
make
so
much
of
me
---
you
think
so
well
of
me
<EOS>
---
you
love
me
so
dearly
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
knows
I
love
you
dearly
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
Heaven
knows
I
prize
it
!
<EOS>
Well
.
<EOS>
If
I
live
,
you
'll
find
me
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
find
out
that
my
husband
has
a
mine
of
purpose
and
energy
,
and
will
turn
it
to
the
best
account
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
dearest
Lizzie
,
"
said
Eugene
,
wistfully
,
and
yet
somewhat
whimsically
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
summon
the
vanity
to
think
so
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
think
so
,
looking
back
on
such
a
trifling
wasted
youth
as
mine
!
<EOS>
I
humbly
hope
it
;
but
I
dare
n't
believe
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
sharp
misgiving
in
my
conscience
that
if
I
were
to
live
,
I
should
disappoint
your
good
opinion
and
my
own
---
and
that
I
ought
to
die
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
THE
PASSING
SHADOW
.
 
<EOS>
The
winds
and
tides
rose
and
fell
a
certain
number
of
times
<EOS>
,
the
earth
moved
round
the
sun
a
certain
number
of
times
,
the
ship
upon
the
ocean
made
her
voyage
safely
,
and
brought
a
baby
-
Bella
home
.
<EOS>
Then
who
so
blest
and
happy
as
Mrs.
John
Rokesmith
,
saving
and
excepting
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
!
  
<EOS>
"
Would
you
not
like
to
be
rich
now
,
my
darling
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
ask
me
such
a
question
,
John
dear
?
<EOS>
Am
I
not
rich
?
"
  
<EOS>
These
were
among
the
first
words
spoken
near
the
baby
Bella
as
she
lay
asleep
.
<EOS>
She
soon
proved
to
be
a
baby
of
wonderful
intelligence
,
evincing
the
strongest
objection
to
her
grandmother
's
society
,
and
being
invariably
seized
with
a
painful
acidity
of
the
stomach
when
that
dignified
lady
honoured
her
with
any
attention
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
charming
to
see
Bella
contemplating
this
baby
,
and
finding
out
her
own
dimples
in
that
tiny
reflection
,
as
if
she
were
looking
in
the
glass
without
personal
vanity
.
<EOS>
Her
cherubic
father
justly
remarked
to
her
husband
that
the
baby
seemed
to
make
her
younger
than
before
,
reminding
him
of
the
days
when
she
had
a
pet
doll
and
used
to
talk
to
it
as
she
carried
it
about
.
<EOS>
The
world
might
have
been
challenged
to
produce
another
baby
who
had
such
a
store
of
pleasant
nonsense
said
and
sung
to
it
,
as
Bella
said
and
sung
to
this
baby
;
or
who
was
dressed
and
undressed
as
in
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
as
Bella
dressed
and
undressed
this
baby
:
or
who
was
held
behind
doors
and
poked
out
to
stop
its
father
's
way
when
he
came
home
,
as
this
baby
was
;
or
,
in
a
word
,
who
did
half
the
number
of
baby
things
,
through
the
lively
invention
of
a
gay
and
proud
young
mother
,
that
this
inexhaustible
baby
did
.
  
<EOS>
The
inexhaustible
baby
was
two
or
three
months
old
,
when
Bella
began
to
notice
a
cloud
upon
her
husband
's
brow
.
<EOS>
Watching
it
,
she
saw
a
gathering
and
deepening
anxiety
there
,
which
caused
her
great
disquiet
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
,
she
awoke
him
muttering
in
his
sleep
;
and
,
though
he
muttered
nothing
worse
than
her
own
name
,
it
was
plain
to
her
that
his
restlessness
originated
in
some
load
of
care
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
Bella
at
length
put
in
her
claim
to
divide
this
load
,
and
bear
her
half
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
John
dear
,
"
she
said
,
cheerily
reverting
to
their
former
conversation
,
"
that
I
hope
I
may
safely
be
trusted
in
great
things
.
<EOS>
And
it
surely
can
not
be
a
little
thing
that
causes
you
so
much
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
considerate
of
you
to
try
to
hide
from
me
that
you
are
uncomfortable
about
something
,
but
it
's
quite
impossible
to
be
done
,
John
love
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
admit
that
I
am
rather
uneasy
,
my
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
please
to
tell
me
what
about
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
no
,
he
evaded
that
.
"
<EOS>
Never
mind
!
"
<EOS>
thought
Bella
,
resolutely
.
"
<EOS>
John
requires
me
to
put
perfect
faith
in
him
,
and
he
shall
not
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
went
up
to
London
one
day
,
to
meet
him
,
in
order
that
they
might
make
some
purchases
.
<EOS>
She
found
him
waiting
for
her
at
her
journey
's
end
,
and
they
walked
away
together
through
the
streets
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
gay
spirits
,
though
still
harping
on
that
notion
of
their
being
rich
;
and
he
said
,
now
let
them
make
believe
that
yonder
fine
carriage
was
theirs
,
and
that
it
was
waiting
to
take
them
home
to
a
fine
house
they
had
;
what
would
Bella
,
in
that
case
,
best
like
to
find
in
the
house
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Bella
did
n't
know
:
already
having
everything
she
wanted
,
she
could
n't
say
.
<EOS>
But
,
by
degrees
she
was
led
on
to
confess
that
she
would
like
to
have
for
the
inexhaustible
baby
such
a
nursery
as
never
was
seen
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
"
a
very
rainbow
for
colours
,
"
 
as
she
was
quite
sure
baby
noticed
colours
;
and
the
staircase
was
to
be
adorned
with
the
most
exquisite
flowers
,
as
she
was
absolutely
certain
baby
noticed
flowers
;
and
there
was
to
be
an
aviary
somewhere
,
of
the
loveliest
little
birds
,
as
there
was
not
the
smallest
doubt
in
the
world
that
baby
noticed
birds
.
<EOS>
Was
there
nothing
else
?
<EOS>
No
,
John
dear
.
<EOS>
The
predilections
of
the
inexhaustible
baby
being
provided
for
,
Bella
could
think
of
nothing
else
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
chatting
on
in
this
way
,
and
John
had
suggested
,
"
No
jewels
for
your
own
wear
,
for
instance
?
"
<EOS>
and
Bella
had
replied
laughing
.
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
if
he
came
to
that
,
yes
,
there
might
be
a
beautiful
ivory
case
of
jewels
on
her
dressing
-
table
;
when
these
pictures
were
in
a
moment
darkened
and
blotted
out
.
  
<EOS>
They
turned
a
corner
,
and
met
Mr.
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
as
if
he
were
petrified
by
the
sight
of
Bella
's
husband
,
who
in
the
same
moment
had
changed
colour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Lightwood
and
I
have
met
before
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Met
before
,
John
?
"
<EOS>
Bella
repeated
in
a
tone
of
wonder
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
told
me
he
had
never
seen
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
then
know
that
I
had
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
discomposed
on
her
account
.
<EOS>
"
I
believed
that
I
had
only
heard
of
---
Mr.
Rokesmith
.
"
 
With
an
emphasis
on
the
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
Mr.
Lightwood
saw
me
,
my
love
,
"
observed
her
husband
,
not
avoiding
his
eye
,
but
looking
at
him
,
"
my
name
was
Julius
Handford
.
"
  
<EOS>
Julius
Handford
!
<EOS>
The
name
that
Bella
had
so
often
seen
in
old
newspapers
,
when
she
was
an
inmate
of
Mr.
Boffin
's
house
!
<EOS>
Julius
Handford
,
who
had
been
publicly
entreated
to
appear
,
and
for
intelligence
of
whom
a
reward
had
been
publicly
offered
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
avoided
mentioning
it
in
your
presence
,
"
said
Lightwood
to
Bella
,
delicately
;
"
but
since
your
husband
mentions
it
himself
,
I
must
confirm
his
strange
admission
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
as
Mr.
Julius
Handford
,
and
I
afterwards
(
unquestionably
to
his
knowledge
)
took
great
pains
to
trace
him
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
my
object
or
my
interest
,
"
said
Rokesmith
,
quietly
,
"
to
be
traced
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
looked
from
the
one
to
the
other
,
in
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Lightwood
,
"
pursued
her
husband
,
"
as
chance
has
brought
us
face
to
face
at
last
---
which
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
,
for
the
wonder
is
,
that
,
in
spite
of
all
my
pains
to
the
contrary
,
chance
has
not
confronted
us
together
sooner
<EOS>
---
I
have
only
to
remind
you
that
you
have
been
at
my
house
,
and
to
add
that
I
have
not
changed
my
residence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
Lightwood
,
with
a
meaning
glance
towards
Bella
,
"
my
position
is
a
truly
painful
one
.
<EOS>
I
hope
that
no
complicity
in
a
very
dark
transaction
may
attach
to
you
,
but
you
can
not
fail
to
know
that
your
own
extraordinary
conduct
has
laid
you
under
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
has
,
"
was
all
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
professional
duty
,
"
said
Lightwood
hesitating
,
with
another
glance
towards
Bella
,
"
is
greatly
at
variance
with
my
personal
inclination
;
but
I
doubt
,
Mr.
Handford
,
or
Mr.
Rokesmith
,
whether
I
am
justified
in
taking
leave
of
you
here
,
with
your
whole
course
unexplained
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
caught
her
husband
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
my
darling
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Lightwood
will
find
that
he
is
quite
justified
in
taking
leave
of
me
here
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
"
 
added
Rokesmith
,
"
he
will
find
that
I
mean
to
take
leave
of
him
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
sir
,
"
said
Lightwood
,
"
you
can
scarcely
deny
that
when
I
came
to
your
house
on
the
occasion
to
which
you
have
referred
,
you
avoided
me
of
a
set
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Lightwood
,
I
assure
you
I
have
no
disposition
to
deny
it
,
or
intention
to
deny
it
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
continued
to
avoid
you
,
in
pursuance
of
the
same
set
purpose
,
for
a
short
time
longer
,
if
we
had
not
met
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
straight
home
,
and
shall
remain
at
home
to
-
morrow
until
noon
.
<EOS>
Hereafter
,
I
hope
we
may
be
better
acquainted
.
<EOS>
Good
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
Lightwood
stood
irresolute
,
but
Bella
's
husband
passed
him
in
the
steadiest
manner
,
with
Bella
on
his
arm
;
and
they
went
home
without
encountering
any
further
remonstrance
or
molestation
from
any
one
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
had
dined
and
were
alone
,
John
Rokesmith
said
to
his
wife
,
who
had
preserved
her
cheerfulness
:
"
<EOS>
And
you
do
n't
ask
me
,
my
dear
,
why
I
bore
that
name
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
John
love
.
<EOS>
I
should
dearly
like
to
know
,
of
course
;
"
(
which
her
anxious
face
confirmed
;
)
"
<EOS>
but
I
wait
until
you
can
tell
me
of
your
own
free
will
.
<EOS>
You
asked
me
if
I
could
have
perfect
faith
in
you
,
and
I
said
yes
,
<EOS>
and
I
meant
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
did
not
escape
Bella
's
notice
that
he
began
to
look
triumphant
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
no
strengthening
in
her
firmness
;
but
if
she
had
had
need
of
any
,
she
would
have
derived
it
from
his
kindling
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
have
been
prepared
,
my
dearest
,
for
such
a
discovery
as
that
this
mysterious
Mr.
Handford
was
identical
with
your
husband
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
John
dear
,
of
course
not
.
<EOS>
But
you
told
me
to
prepare
to
be
tried
,
and
I
prepared
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
drew
her
to
nestle
closer
to
him
,
and
told
her
it
would
soon
be
over
,
and
the
truth
would
soon
appear
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
lay
stress
,
my
dear
,
on
these
words
that
I
am
going
to
add
.
<EOS>
I
stand
in
no
kind
of
peril
,
and
I
can
by
possibility
be
hurt
at
no
one
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
,
quite
sure
of
that
,
John
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
hair
of
my
head
!
<EOS>
Moreover
,
I
have
done
no
wrong
,
and
have
injured
no
man
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
swear
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
John
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
,
laying
her
hand
upon
his
lips
,
with
a
proud
look
.
"
<EOS>
Never
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
circumstances
,
"
he
went
on
"
---
I
can
,
and
I
will
,
disperse
them
in
a
moment
---
have
surrounded
me
with
one
of
the
strangest
suspicions
ever
known
.
<EOS>
You
heard
Mr.
Lightwood
speak
of
a
dark
transaction
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
John
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
prepared
to
hear
explicitly
what
he
meant
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
John
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
life
,
he
meant
the
murder
of
John
Harmon
,
your
allotted
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
fast
palpitating
heart
Bella
grasped
him
by
the
arm
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
be
suspected
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
love
,
I
can
be
---
for
I
am
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
between
them
,
as
she
sat
looking
in
his
face
,
with
the
colour
quite
gone
from
her
own
face
and
lips
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
dare
they
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
at
length
,
in
a
burst
of
generous
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
My
beloved
husband
,
how
dare
they
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
caught
her
in
his
arms
as
she
opened
hers
,
and
held
her
to
his
heart
.
"
<EOS>
Even
knowing
this
,
you
can
trust
me
,
Bella
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
trust
you
,
John
dear
,
with
all
my
soul
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
not
trust
you
,
I
should
fall
dead
at
your
feet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
kindling
triumph
in
his
face
was
bright
indeed
,
as
he
looked
up
and
rapturously
exclaimed
,
what
had
he
done
to
deserve
the
blessing
of
this
dear
confiding
creature
's
heart
!
<EOS>
Again
she
put
her
hand
upon
his
lips
,
saying
,
"
Hush
!
"
and
then
told
him
,
in
her
own
little
natural
pathetic
way
,
that
if
all
the
world
were
against
him
,
she
would
be
for
him
;
that
if
all
the
world
repudiated
him
,
she
would
believe
him
;
that
if
he
were
infamous
in
other
eyes
,
he
would
be
honored
in
hers
;
and
that
,
under
the
worst
unmerited
suspicion
,
she
could
devote
her
life
to
consoling
him
,
and
imparting
her
own
faith
in
him
to
their
little
child
.
  
<EOS>
A
twilight
calm
of
happiness
then
succeeding
to
their
radiant
noon
,
they
remained
at
peace
,
until
a
strange
voice
in
the
room
startled
them
both
.
<EOS>
The
room
being
by
that
time
dark
,
the
voice
said
,
"
Do
n't
let
the
lady
be
alarmed
by
my
striking
a
light
,
"
and
immediately
a
match
rattled
,
and
glimmered
in
a
hand
.
<EOS>
The
hand
and
the
match
and
the
voice
were
then
seen
by
John
Rokesmith
to
belong
to
Mr.
Inspector
,
once
meditatively
active
in
this
chronicle
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
take
the
liberty
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
in
a
business
-
like
manner
,
"
to
bring
myself
to
the
recollection
of
Mr.
Julius
Handford
,
who
gave
me
his
name
and
address
down
at
our
place
a
considerable
time
ago
.
<EOS>
Would
the
lady
object
to
my
lighting
the
pair
of
candles
on
the
chimneypiece
,
to
throw
a
further
light
upon
the
subject
?
<EOS>
No
?
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
Now
,
we
look
cheerful
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
,
in
a
dark
-
blue
buttoned
-
up
frock
coat
and
pantaloons
,
presented
a
serviceable
,
half
-
pay
,
Royal
Arms
kind
of
appearance
,
as
he
applied
his
pocket
handkerchief
to
his
nose
and
bowed
to
the
lady
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
favoured
me
,
Mr.
Handford
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
"
by
writing
down
your
name
and
address
,
and
I
produce
the
piece
of
paper
on
which
you
wrote
it
.
<EOS>
Comparing
the
same
with
the
writing
on
the
fly
-
leaf
of
this
book
on
the
table
---
and
a
sweet
pretty
volume
<EOS>
it
is
---
I
find
the
writing
of
the
entry
,
`
`
Mrs
.
John
Rokesmith
.
<EOS>
From
her
husband
on
her
birthday
"
"
---
and
very
gratifying
to
the
feelings
such
memorials
are
---
to
correspond
exactly
.
<EOS>
Can
I
have
a
word
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
.
<EOS>
Here
,
if
you
please
,
"
was
the
reply
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
retorted
Mr.
Inspector
,
again
using
his
pocket
handkerchief
,
"
though
there
's
nothing
for
the
lady
to
be
at
all
alarmed
at
still
,
ladies
are
apt
to
take
alarm
at
matters
of
business
---
<EOS>
being
of
that
fragile
sex
that
they
're
not
accustomed
to
them
when
not
of
a
strictly
domestic
character
---
<EOS>
and
I
do
generally
make
it
a
rule
to
propose
retirement
from
the
presence
of
ladies
,
before
entering
upon
business
topics
.
<EOS>
Or
perhaps
,
"
Mr.
Inspector
hinted
,
"
if
the
lady
was
to
step
up
-
stairs
,
and
take
a
look
at
baby
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Rokesmith
,
"
---
her
husband
was
beginning
;
when
Mr.
Inspector
,
regarding
the
words
as
an
introduction
,
said
,
"
Happy
,
I
am
sure
,
to
have
the
honor
.
"
<EOS>
And
bowed
,
with
gallantry
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Rokesmith
,
"
resumed
her
husband
,
"
is
satisfied
that
she
can
have
no
reason
for
being
alarmed
,
whatever
the
business
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Really
?
<EOS>
Is
that
so
?
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
a
sex
to
live
and
learn
from
,
and
there
's
nothing
a
lady
ca
n't
accomplish
when
she
once
fully
gives
her
mind
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
case
with
my
own
wife
.
<EOS>
Well
,
ma'am
,
this
good
gentleman
of
yours
has
given
rise
to
a
rather
large
amount
of
trouble
which
might
have
been
avoided
if
he
had
come
forward
and
explained
himself
.
<EOS>
Well
you
see
!
<EOS>
He
did
n't
come
forward
and
explain
himself
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
now
that
we
meet
,
him
and
me
,
you
'll
say
---
and
say
right
---
that
there
's
nothing
to
be
alarmed
at
,
in
my
proposing
to
him
to
come
forward
---
or
,
putting
the
same
meaning
in
another
form
,
to
come
along
with
me
---
and
explain
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
Mr.
Inspector
put
it
in
that
other
form
,
"
to
come
along
with
me
,
"
there
was
a
relishing
roll
in
his
voice
,
and
his
eye
beamed
with
an
official
lustre
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
propose
to
take
me
into
custody
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
John
Rokesmith
,
very
coolly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
argue
?
"
returned
Mr.
Inspector
in
a
comfortable
sort
of
remonstrance
;
"
ai
n't
it
enough
that
I
propose
that
you
shall
come
along
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
what
reason
?
"
  
"
Lord
bless
my
soul
and
body
!
"
returned
Mr.
Inspector
,
"
I
wonder
at
it
in
a
man
of
your
education
.
<EOS>
Why
argue
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
charge
against
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
at
you
before
a
lady
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
,
shaking
his
head
reproachfully
:
"
I
wonder
,
brought
up
as
you
have
been
,
you
have
n't
a
more
delicate
mind
!
<EOS>
I
charge
you
,
then
,
with
being
some
way
concerned
in
the
Harmon
Murder
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
whether
before
,
or
in
,
or
after
,
the
fact
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
whether
with
having
some
knowledge
of
it
that
has
n't
come
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
surprise
me
.
<EOS>
I
foresaw
your
visit
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
!
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
why
argue
?
<EOS>
It
's
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
whatever
you
say
,
will
be
used
against
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
it
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
tell
you
it
will
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
having
received
the
caution
,
do
you
still
say
that
you
foresaw
my
visit
this
afternoon
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
And
I
will
say
something
more
,
if
you
will
step
with
me
into
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
reassuring
kiss
on
the
lips
of
the
frightened
Bella
,
her
husband
(
to
whom
Mr.
Inspector
obligingly
offered
his
arm
)
,
took
up
a
candle
,
and
withdrew
with
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
They
were
a
full
halfhour
in
conference
.
<EOS>
When
they
returned
,
Mr.
Inspector
looked
considerably
astonished
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
invited
this
worthy
officer
,
my
dear
,
"
said
John
,
"
to
make
a
short
excursion
with
me
in
which
you
shall
be
a
sharer
.
<EOS>
He
will
take
something
to
eat
and
drink
,
I
dare
say
,
on
your
invitation
,
while
you
are
getting
your
bonnet
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
declined
eating
,
but
assented
to
the
proposal
of
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
.
<EOS>
Mixing
this
cold
,
and
pensively
consuming
it
,
he
broke
at
intervals
into
such
soliloquies
as
that
he
never
did
know
such
a
move
,
that
he
never
had
been
so
gravelled
,
and
that
what
a
game
was
this
to
try
the
sort
of
stuff
a
man
's
opinion
of
himself
was
made
of
!
<EOS>
Concurrently
with
these
comments
,
he
more
than
once
burst
out
a
laughing
,
with
the
half
-
enjoying
and
half
-
piqued
air
of
a
man
,
who
had
given
up
a
good
conundrum
,
after
much
guessing
,
and
been
told
the
answer
.
<EOS>
Bella
was
so
timid
of
him
,
that
she
noted
these
things
in
a
half
-
shrinking
,
half
-
perceptive
way
,
and
similarly
noted
that
there
was
a
great
change
in
his
manner
towards
John
.
<EOS>
That
coming
-
along
-
with
-
him
deportment
was
now
lost
in
long
musing
looks
at
John
and
at
herself
,
and
sometimes
in
slow
heavy
rubs
of
his
hand
across
his
forehead
,
as
if
he
were
ironing
out
the
creases
which
his
deep
pondering
made
there
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
some
coughing
and
whistling
satellites
secretly
gravitating
towards
him
about
the
premises
,
but
they
were
now
dismissed
,
and
he
eyed
John
as
if
he
had
meant
to
do
him
a
public
service
,
but
had
unfortunately
been
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Whether
Bella
might
have
noted
anything
more
,
if
she
had
been
less
afraid
of
him
,
she
could
not
determine
;
but
it
was
all
inexplicable
to
her
,
and
not
the
faintest
flash
of
the
real
state
of
the
case
broke
in
upon
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
's
increased
notice
of
herself
,
and
knowing
way
of
raising
his
eyebrows
when
their
eyes
by
any
chance
met
,
as
if
he
put
the
question
"
Do
n't
you
see
?
"
augmented
her
timidity
,
and
,
consequently
,
her
perplexity
.
<EOS>
For
all
these
reasons
,
when
he
and
she
and
John
,
at
towards
nine
o'clock
of
a
winter
evening
went
to
London
,
and
began
driving
from
London
Bridge
,
among
low
-
lying
water
-
side
wharves
and
docks
and
strange
places
,
Bella
was
in
the
state
of
a
dreamer
;
perfectly
unable
to
account
for
her
being
there
,
perfectly
unable
to
forecast
what
would
happen
next
,
or
whither
<EOS>
she
was
going
,
or
why
;
certain
of
nothing
in
the
immediate
present
,
but
that
she
confided
in
John
,
and
that
John
seemed
somehow
to
be
getting
more
triumphant
.
<EOS>
But
what
a
certainty
was
that
!
  
<EOS>
They
alighted
at
last
at
the
corner
of
a
court
,
where
there
was
a
building
with
a
bright
lamp
and
a
wicket
gate
.
<EOS>
Its
orderly
appearance
was
very
unlike
that
of
the
surrounding
neighbourhood
,
and
was
explained
by
the
inscription
Police
Station
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
going
in
here
,
John
?
"
said
Bella
,
clinging
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
;
but
of
our
own
accord
.
<EOS>
We
shall
come
out
again
as
easily
,
never
fear
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
whitewashed
room
was
pure
white
as
of
old
,
the
methodical
book
-
keeping
was
in
peaceful
progress
as
of
old
,
and
some
distant
howler
was
banging
against
a
cell
door
as
of
old
.
<EOS>
The
sanctuary
was
not
a
permanent
abiding
-
place
,
but
a
kind
of
criminal
Pickford
's
.
<EOS>
The
lower
passions
and
vices
were
regularly
ticked
off
in
the
books
,
warehoused
in
the
cells
,
carted
away
as
per
accompanying
invoice
,
and
left
little
mark
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
placed
two
chairs
for
his
visitors
,
before
the
fire
,
and
communed
in
a
low
voice
with
a
brother
of
his
order
(
also
of
a
half
-
pay
,
and
Royal
Arms
aspect
)
,
who
,
judged
only
by
his
occupation
at
the
moment
,
might
have
been
a
writing
-
master
,
setting
copies
.
<EOS>
Their
conference
done
,
Mr.
Inspector
returned
to
the
fireplace
,
and
,
having
observed
that
he
would
step
round
to
the
Fellowships
and
see
how
matters
stood
,
went
out
.
<EOS>
He
soon
came
back
again
,
saying
,
"
Nothing
could
be
better
,
for
they
're
at
supper
with
Miss
Abbey
in
the
bar
;
"
and
then
they
all
three
went
out
together
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
as
in
a
dream
,
Bella
found
herself
entering
a
snug
oldfashioned
public
-
house
,
and
found
herself
smuggled
into
a
little
three
-
cornered
room
nearly
opposite
the
bar
of
that
establishment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
achieved
the
smuggling
of
herself
and
John
into
this
queer
room
,
called
Cosy
in
an
inscription
on
the
door
,
by
entering
in
the
narrow
passage
first
in
order
,
and
suddenly
turning
round
upon
them
with
extended
arms
,
as
if
they
had
been
two
sheep
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
lighted
for
their
reception
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Mr.
Inspector
to
John
,
turning
the
gas
lower
;
"
I
'll
mix
with
'em
in
a
casual
way
,
and
when
I
say
Identification
,
perhaps
you
'll
show
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
nodded
,
and
Mr.
Inspector
went
alone
to
the
half
-
door
of
the
bar
.
<EOS>
From
the
dim
doorway
of
Cosy
,
within
which
Bella
and
her
husband
stood
,
they
could
see
a
comfortable
little
party
of
three
persons
sitting
at
supper
in
the
bar
,
and
could
hear
everything
that
was
said
.
  
<EOS>
The
three
persons
were
Miss
Abbey
and
two
male
guests
.
<EOS>
To
whom
collectively
,
Mr.
Inspector
remarked
that
the
weather
was
getting
sharp
for
the
time
of
year
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
need
be
sharp
to
suit
your
wits
,
sir
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
you
got
in
hand
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thanking
you
for
your
compliment
:
not
much
,
Miss
Abbey
,
"
was
Mr.
Inspector
's
rejoinder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
have
you
got
in
Cosy
?
"
asked
Miss
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
a
gentleman
and
his
wife
,
<EOS>
Miss.
"
  
"
And
who
are
they
?
<EOS>
If
one
may
ask
it
without
detriment
to
your
deep
plans
in
the
interests
of
the
honest
public
?
"
said
Miss
Abbey
,
proud
of
Mr.
Inspector
as
an
administrative
genius
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
strangers
in
this
part
of
the
town
,
Miss
Abbey
.
<EOS>
They
are
waiting
till
I
shall
want
the
gentleman
to
show
himself
somewhere
,
for
half
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
While
they
're
waiting
,
"
said
Miss
Abbey
,
"
could
n't
you
join
us
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Inspector
immediately
slipped
into
the
bar
,
and
sat
down
at
the
side
of
the
half
-
door
,
with
his
back
towards
the
passage
,
and
directly
facing
the
two
guests
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
take
my
supper
till
later
in
the
night
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
therefore
I
wo
n't
disturb
the
compactness
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
take
a
glass
of
flip
,
if
that
's
flip
in
the
jug
in
the
fender
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
flip
,
"
replied
Miss
Abbey
,
"
and
it
's
my
making
,
and
if
even
you
can
find
out
better
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
know
where
.
<EOS>
"
Filling
him
,
with
hospitable
hands
,
a
steaming
tumbler
,
Miss
Abbey
replaced
the
jug
by
the
fire
;
the
company
not
having
yet
arrived
at
the
flipstage
of
their
supper
,
but
being
as
yet
skirmishing
with
strong
ale
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
---
h
!
"
cried
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
smack
!
<EOS>
There
's
not
a
Detective
in
the
Force
,
Miss
Abbey
,
that
could
find
out
better
stuff
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
hear
you
say
so
,
"
rejoined
Miss
Abbey
.
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
know
,
if
anybody
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Job
Potterson
,
"
Mr.
Inspector
continued
,
"
I
drink
your
health
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Jacob
Kibble
,
I
drink
yours
.
<EOS>
Hope
you
have
made
a
prosperous
voyage
home
,
gentlemen
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kibble
,
an
unctuous
broad
man
of
few
words
and
many
mouthfuls
,
said
,
more
briefly
than
pointedly
,
raising
his
ale
to
his
lips
:
"
<EOS>
Same
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Job
Potterson
,
a
semi
-
seafaring
man
of
obliging
demeanour
,
said
,
"
Thank
you
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
my
soul
and
body
!
"
cried
Mr.
Inspector
.
<EOS>
"
Talk
of
trades
,
Miss
Abbey
,
and
the
way
they
set
their
marks
on
men
"
(
a
subject
which
nobody
had
approached
)
;
"
who
would
n't
know
your
brother
to
be
a
Steward
!
<EOS>
There
's
a
bright
and
ready
twinkle
in
his
eye
,
there
's
a
neatness
in
his
action
,
there
's
a
smartness
in
his
figure
,
there
's
an
air
of
reliability
about
him
in
case
you
wanted
a
basin
,
which
points
out
the
steward
!
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Kibble
;
ai
n't
he
Passenger

all
over

<EOS>
While
there
's
that
mercantile
cut
upon
him
which
would
make
you
happy
to
give
him
credit
for
five
hundred
pound

n't
you
see
the
salt
sea
shining
on
him
too

<EOS>
"
You
do
,
I
dare
say
,
"
returned
Miss
Abbey
,
"
but
I
do
n't

<EOS>
And
as
for
stewarding
,
I
think
it
's
time
my
brother
gave
that
up
,
and
took
this
House
in
hand
on
his
sister
's
retiring
.
<EOS>
The
House
will
go
to
pieces

<EOS>
I
would

it

That

subscribed

Inspector
went
on
slowly
,
with
his
eyes
narrowly
observant
of
the
two
guests
,
"
since
we
three
very
men
,
at
an
Inquest
in
this
very
house
---
Mr.
Kibble
?
<EOS>
Taken
ill
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Kibble
had
staggered
up
,
with
his
lower
jaw
dropped
,
catching
Potterson
by
the
shoulder
,
and
pointing
to
the
half
-
door
.
<EOS>
He
now
cried
out
:
"
Potterson
!
<EOS>
Look
!
<EOS>
Look
there
!
"
<EOS>
Potterson
started
up
,
started
back
,
and
exclaimed
:
"
Heaven
defend
us
,
what
's
that
!
"
 
<EOS>
Bella
's
husband
stepped
back
to
Bella
,
took
her
in
his
arms
(
for
she
was
terrified
by
the
unintelligible
terror
of
the
two
men
)
,
and
shut
the
door
of
the
little
room
.
<EOS>
A
hurry
of
voices
succeeded
,
in
which
Mr.
Inspector
's
voice
was
busiest
;
it
gradually
slackened
and
sank
;
 
and
Mr.
Inspector
reappeared
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sharp
's
the
word
,
sir
!
"
he
said
,
looking
in
with
a
knowing
wink
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
get
your
lady
out
at
once
.
"
 
<EOS>
Immediately
,
Bella
and
her
husband
were
under
the
stars
,
making
their
way
back
alone
,
to
the
vehicle
they
had
kept
in
waiting
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
was
most
extraordinary
,
and
Bella
could
make
nothing
of
it
but
that
John
was
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
How
in
the
right
,
and
how
suspected
of
being
in
the
wrong
,
she
could
not
divine
.
<EOS>
Some
vague
idea
that
he
had
never
really
assumed
the
name
of
Handford
,
and
that
there
was
a
remarkable
likeness
between
him
and
that
mysterious
person
,
was
her
nearest
approach
to
any
definite
explanation
.
<EOS>
But
John
was
triumphant
;
that
much
was
made
apparent
;
and
she
could
wait
for
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
When
John
came
home
to
dinner
next
day
,
he
said
,
sitting
down
on
the
sofa
by
Bella
and
baby
-
Bella
:
"
My
dear
,
I
have
a
piece
of
news
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
left
the
China
House
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
seemed
to
like
having
left
it
,
Bella
took
it
for
granted
that
there
was
no
misfortune
in
the
case
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
word
,
my
love
,
"
said
John
,
"
<EOS>
the
China
House
is
broken
up
and
abolished
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
such
thing
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
are
you
already
in
another
House
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
darling
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
another
way
of
business
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
rather
better
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
inexhaustible
baby
was
instantly
made
to
congratulate
him
,
and
to
say
,
with
appropriate
action
on
the
part
of
a
very
limp
arm
and
a
speckled
fist
:
"
Three
cheers
,
ladies
and
gemplemorums
.
<EOS>
Hoo
---
ray
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
,
my
life
,
"
said
John
,
"
that
you
have
become
very
much
attached
to
this
cottage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Afraid
I
have
,
John
?
<EOS>
Of
course
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
reason
why
I
said
afraid
,
"
returned
John
,
"
is
,
because
we
must
move
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
O
John
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
we
must
move
.
<EOS>
We
must
have
our
head
-
quarters
in
London
now
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
there
's
a
dwelling
-
house
rent
-
free
,
attached
to
my
new
position
,
and
we
must
occupy
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
gain
,
John
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
it
is
undoubtedly
a
gain
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
gave
her
a
very
blithe
look
,
and
a
very
sly
look
.
<EOS>
Which
occasioned
the
inexhaustible
baby
to
square
at
him
with
the
speckled
fists
,
and
demand
in
a
threatening
manner
what
he
meant
?
  
<EOS>
"
My
love
,
you
said
it
was
a
gain
,
and
I
said
it
was
a
gain
.
<EOS>
A
very
innocent
remark
,
surely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
,
"
said
the
inexhaustible
baby
,
"
---
<EOS>
allow
---
you
---
to
make
 
---
game
---
of
---
my
---
venerable
---
Ma
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
each
division
administering
a
soft
facer
with
one
of
the
speckled
fists
.
  
<EOS>
John
having
stooped
down
to
receive
these
punishing
visitations
,
Bella
asked
him
,
would
it
be
necessary
to
move
soon
?
<EOS>
Why
yes
,
indeed
(
said
John
)
,
he
did
propose
that
they
should
move
very
soon
.
<EOS>
Taking
the
furniture
with
them
,
of
course
?
<EOS>
(
said
Bella
)
.
<EOS>
Why
,
no
(
said
John
)
,
the
fact
was
,
that
the
house
was
---
in
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
a
way
---
furnished
already
.
  
<EOS>
The
inexhaustible
baby
,
hearing
this
,
resumed
the
offensive
,
and
said
:
"
<EOS>
But
there
's
no
nursery
for
me
,
sir
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
,
marble
-
hearted
parent
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
which
the
marble
-
hearted
parent
rejoined
that
there
was
a
---
sort
of
a
kind
of
a
---
nursery
,
and
it
might
be
"
made
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
"
Made
to
do
?
"
returned
the
inexhaustible
,
administering
more
punishment
,
"
what
do
you
take
me
for
?
"
<EOS>
And
was
then
turned
over
on
its
back
in
Bella
's
lap
,
and
smothered
with
kisses
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
really
,
John
dear
,
"
said
Bella
,
flushed
in
quite
a
lovely
manner
by
these
exercises
,
"
will
the
new
house
,
just
as
it
stands
,
do
for
baby
?
<EOS>
That
's
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
felt
that
to
be
the
question
,
"
he
returned
,
"
and
therefore
I
arranged
that
you
should
come
with
me
and
look
at
it
,
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
Appointment
made
,
accordingly
,
for
Bella
to
go
up
with
him
to
-
morrow
morning
;
John
kissed
;
and
Bella
delighted
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
reached
London
in
pursuance
of
their
little
plan
,
they
took
coach
and
drove
westward
.
<EOS>
Not
only
drove
westward
,
but
drove
into
that
particular
westward
division
,
which
Bella
had
seen
last
when
she
turned
her
face
from
Mr.
Boffin
's
door
.
<EOS>
Not
only
drove
into
that
particular
division
,
but
drove
at
last
into
that
very
street
.
<EOS>
Not
only
drove
into
that
very
street
,
but
stopped
at
last
at
that
very
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
dear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
,
looking
out
of
window
in
a
flutter
.
<EOS>
"
De
you
see
where
we
are
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
love
.
<EOS>
The
coachman
's
quite
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
house
-
door
was
opened
without
any
knocking
or
ringing
,
and
John
promptly
helped
her
out
.
<EOS>
The
servant
who
stood
holding
the
door
,
asked
no
question
of
John
,
neither
did
he
go
before
them
or
follow
them
as
they
went
straight
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
her
husband
's
encircling
arm
,
urging
her
on
,
that
prevented
Bella
from
stopping
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
.
<EOS>
As
they
ascended
,
it
was
seen
to
be
tastefully
ornamented
with
most
beautiful
flowers
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
John
!
"
said
Bella
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
,
my
darling
,
nothing
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Going
on
a
little
higher
,
they
came
to
a
charming
aviary
,
in
which
a
number
of
tropical
birds
,
more
gorgeous
in
colour
than
the
flowers
,
were
flying
about
;
and
among
those
birds
were
gold
and
silver
fish
,
and
mosses
,
and
water
-
lilies
,
and
a
fountain
,
and
all
manner
of
wonders
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
my
dear
John
!
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
What
does
this
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Nothing
,
my
darling
,
nothing
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
on
,
until
they
came
to
a
door
.
<EOS>
As
John
put
out
his
hand
to
open
it
,
Bella
caught
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
it
means
,
but
it
's
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
Hold
me
,
John
,
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
John
caught
her
up
in
his
arm
,
and
lightly
dashed
into
the
room
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
Behold
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
beaming
!
<EOS>
Behold
Mrs.
Boffin
clapping
her
hands
in
an
ecstacy
,
running
to
Bella
with
tears
of
joy
pouring
down
her
comely
face
,
and
folding
her
to
her
breast
,
with
the
words
:
"
My
deary
deary
,
deary
girl
,
that
Noddy
and
me
saw
married
and
could
n't
wish
joy
to
,
or
so
much
as
speak
to
!
<EOS>
My
deary
,
deary
,
deary

wife
of
John
and
mother
of
his
little
child

My

Welcome

"
   
<EOS>
SHOWING
HOW
THE
GOLDEN
DUSTMAN
HELPED
TO
SCATTER
DUST
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
the
first
bewilderment
of
her
wonder
,
the
most
bewilderingly
wonderful
thing
to
Bella
was
the
shining
countenance
of
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
That
his
wife
should
be
joyous
,
open
-
hearted
,
and
genial
,
or
that
her
face
should
express
every
quality
that
was
large
and
trusting
,
and
no
quality
that
was
little
or
mean
,
was
accordant
with
Bella
's
experience
.
<EOS>
But
,
that
he
,
with
a
perfectly
beneficent
air
and
a
plump
rosy
face
,
should
be
standing
there
,
looking
at
her
and
John
,
like
some
jovial
good
spirit
,
was
marvellous
.
<EOS>
For
,
how
had
he
looked
when
she
last
saw
him
in
that
very
room
<EOS>
(
it
was
the
room
in
which
she
had
given
him
that
piece
of
her
mind
at
parting
)
,
and
what
had
become
of
all
those
crooked
lines
of
suspicion
,
avarice
,
and
distrust
,
that
twisted
his
visage
then
?
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
seated
Bella
on
the
large
ottoman
,
and
seated
herself
beside
her
,
and
John
her
husband
seated
himself
on
the
other
side
of
her
,
and
Mr.
Boffin
stood
beaming
at
every
one
and
everything
he
could
see
,
with
surpassing
jollity
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
was
then
taken
with
a
laughing
fit
of
clapping
her
hands
,
and
clapping
her
knees
,
and
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
,
and
then
with
another
laughing
fit
of
embracing
Bella
,
and
rocking
her
to
and
fro
---
<EOS>
both
fits
,
of
considerable
duration
.
  
<EOS>
"
Old
lady

old
lady

said
Mr.
Boffin
,
at
length
;
"
if
you
do
n't
begin
somebody
else
must

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
going

begin

Noddy

my

returned
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Only
it
is
n't
easy
for
a
person
to
know
where
to
begin

when
a
person
is
in
this
state
of
delight
and
happiness

<EOS>
Bella

my

Tell

Who

My

Ah

But

No

Not

<EOS>
"
No

<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
,
again
clapping
her
hands
and
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bit
of
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
his
name
is
John

I
suppose

"
said
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah

<EOS>
I
should
think
so

deary

"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
hope
so

<EOS>
Many
and
many
is
the
time
I
have
called
him
by
his
name
of
John

<EOS>
But
what
's
his
other
name
,
his
true
other
name
?
<EOS>
Give
a
guess

my
pretty

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
guess

"
said
Bella
,
turning
her
pale
face
from
one
to
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
and
what
's
more
,
I
did
!
<EOS>
I
found
him
out
,
all
in
a
flash
as
I
may
say
,
one
night
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
,
Noddy
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
That
the
old
lady
did

said
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
stout
pride
in
the
circumstance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Harkee
to
me
,
deary

"
pursued
Mrs.
Boffin
,
taking
Bella
's
hands
between
her
own
,
and
gently
beating
on
them
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
after
a
particular
night
when
John
had
been
disappointed
 
---
as
he
thought
---
in
his
affections
.
<EOS>
It
was
after
a
night
when
John
had
made
an
offer
to
a
certain
young
lady
,
and
the
certain
young
lady
had
refused
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
after
a
particular
night
,
when
he
felt
himself
cast
-
away
-
like
,
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
go
seek
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
very
next
night
.
<EOS>
My
Noddy
wanted
a
paper
out
of
his
Secretary
's
room
,
and
I
says
to
Noddy
,
`
`
I
am
going
by
the
door
,
and
I
'll
ask
him
for
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
tapped
at
his
door
,
and
he
did
n't
hear
me
.
<EOS>
I
looked
in
,
and
saw
him
a
sitting
lonely
by
his
fire
,
brooding
over
it
.
<EOS>
He
chanced
to
look
up
with
a
pleased
kind
of
smile
in
my
company
when
he
saw
me
,
and
then
in
a
single
moment
every
grain
of
the
gunpowder
that
had
been
lying
sprinkled
thick
about
him
ever
since
I
first
set
eyes
upon
him
as
a
man
at
the
Bower
,
took
fire
!
<EOS>
Too
many
a
time
had
I
seen
him
sitting
lonely
,
when
he
was
a
poor
child
,
to
be
pitied
,
heart
and
hand
!
<EOS>
Too
many
a
time
had
I
seen
him
in
need
of
being
brightened
up
with
a
comforting
word
!
<EOS>
Too
many
and
too
many
a
time
to
be
mistaken
,
when
that
glimpse
of
him
come
at
last
!
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
just
makes
out
to
cry
,
`
`
I
know
you
now
!
<EOS>
You
're
John
!
"
<EOS>
"
And
he
catches
me
as
I
drops
.

<EOS>
So
what
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
breaking
off
in
the
rush
of
her
speech
to
smile
most
radiantly
,
"
might
you
think
by
this
time
that
your
husband
's
name
was
,
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
,
"
returned
Bella
,
with
quivering
lips
;
"
not
Harmon
?
<EOS>
That
's
not
possible
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tremble
.
<EOS>
Why
not
possible
,
deary
,
when
so
many
things
are
possible
?
"
demanded
Mrs.
Boffin
,
in
a
soothing
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
killed
,
"
gasped
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thought
to
be
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
ever
John
Harmon
drew
the
breath
of
life
on
earth
,
that
is
certainly
John
Harmon
's
arm
round
your
waist
now
,
my
pretty
.
<EOS>
If
ever
John
Harmon
had
a
wife
on
earth
,
that
wife
is
certainly
you
.
<EOS>
If
ever
John
Harmon
and
his
wife
had
a
child
on
earth
,
that
child
is
certainly
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
a
master
-
stroke
of
secret
arrangement
,
the
inexhaustible
baby
here
appeared
at
the
door
,
suspended
in
mid
-
air
by
invisible
agency
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
,
plunging
at
it
,
brought
it
to
Bella
's
lap
,
where
both
Mrs.
and
Mr.
Boffin
(
as
the
saying
is
)
"
took
it
out
of
"
the
Inexhaustible
in
a
shower
of
caresses
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
this
timely
appearance
that
kept
Bella
from
swooning
.
<EOS>
This
,
and
her
husband
's
earnestness
in
explaining
further
to
her
how
it
had
come
to
pass
that
he
had
been
supposed
to
be
slain
,
and
had
even
been
suspected
of
his
own
murder
;
also
,
how
he
had
put
a
pious
fraud
upon
her
which
had
preyed
upon
his
mind
,
as
the
time
for
its
disclosure
approached
,
lest
she
might
not
make
full
allowance
for
the
object
with
which
it
had
originated
,
and
in
which
it
had
fully
developed
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
bless
ye
,
my
beauty
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
,
taking
him
up
short
at
this
point
,
with
another
hearty
clap
of
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
n't
John
only
that
was
in
it
.
<EOS>
We
was
all
of
us
in
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
"
said
Bella
,
looking
vacantly
from
one
to
another
,
"
yet
understand
---
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
you
do
n't
,
my
deary

"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
till
you
're
told
!
<EOS>
So
now
I
am
a
going
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
So
you
put
your
two
hands
between
my
two
hands
again
,
"
cried
the
comfortable
creature
,
embracing
her
,
"
with
that
blessed
little
picter
lying
on
your
lap
,
and
you
shall
be
told
all
the
story

<EOS>
Now
,
I
'm
a
going
to
tell
the
story
.
<EOS>
Once
,
twice
,
three
times
,
and
the
horses
is
off
.
<EOS>
Here
they
go
!
<EOS>
When
I
cries
out
that
night

`

I
know
you
now

you
're
John

<EOS>

which
was
my
exact
words
;
was
n't
they
,
John
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
exact
words

"
said
John
,
laying
his
hand
on
hers
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
very
good
arrangement
,
"
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Keep
it
there
,
John
.
<EOS>
And
as
we
was
all
of
us
in
it
,
Noddy
you
come
and
lay
yours
a
top
of
his
,
and
we
wo
n't
break
the
pile
till
the
story
's
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
hitched
up
a
chair
,
and
added
his
broad
brown
right
hand
to
the
heap
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
capital
!
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
giving
it
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
"
Seems
quite
a
family
building
;
do
n't
it
?
<EOS>
But
the
horses
is
off
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
When
I
cries
out
that
night
,
`
`
I
know
you
now
!
<EOS>
you
now
!
<EOS>
you
're
John
!
"
<EOS>
"
John
catches
of
me
,
it
is
true
;
but
I
ai
n't
a
light
weight
,
bless
ye
,
and
he
's
forced
to
let
me
down
.
<EOS>
Noddy
,
he
hears
a
noise
,
and
in
he
trots
,
and
as
soon
as
I
anyways
comes
to
myself
I
calls
to
him
,
`
`
<EOS>
Noddy
,
well
I
might
say
as
I
did
say
,
that
night
at
the
Bower
,
for
the
Lord
be
thankful
<EOS>
this
is
John
!
"
<EOS>
"
On
which
he
gives
a
heave
,
and
down
he
goes
likewise
,
with
his
head
under
the
writing
-
table
.
<EOS>
This
brings
me
round
comfortable
,
and
that
brings
him
round
comfortable
,
and
then
John
and
him
and
me
we
all
fall
a
crying
for
joy
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
They
cry
for
joy
,
my
darling
,
"
her
husband
struck
in
.
<EOS>
"
You
understand
?
<EOS>
These
two
,
whom
I
come
to
life
to
disappoint
and
dispossess
,
cry
for
joy
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
looked
at
him
confusedly
,
and
looked
again
at
Mrs.
Boffin
's
radiant
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
my
dear
,
do
n't
you
mind
him
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
stick
to
me
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Then
we
sits
down
,
gradually
gets
cool
,
and
holds
a
confabulation
.
<EOS>
John
,
he
tells
us
how
he
is
despairing
in
his
mind
on
accounts
of
a
certain
fair
young
person
,
and
how
,
if
I
had
n't
found
him
out
,
he
was
going
away
to
seek
his
fortune
far
and
wide
,
and
had
fully
meant
never
to
come
to
life
,
but
to
leave
the
property
as
our
wrongful
inheritance
for
ever
and
a
day
.
<EOS>
At
which
you
never
see
a
man
so
frightened
as
my
Noddy
was
.
<EOS>
For
to
think
that
he
should
have
come
into
the
property
wrongful
,
however
innocent
,
and
 
---
more
than
that
---
might
have
gone
on
keeping
it
to
his
dying
day
,
turned
him
whiter
than
chalk
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
you
too
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
mind
him
,
neither
,
my
deary
,
"
resumed
Mrs.
Boffin
;
 
"
stick
to
me
.
<EOS>
This
brings
up
a
confabulation
regarding
the
certain
fair
young
person
;
when
Noddy
he
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
she
is
a
deary
creetur
.
<EOS>
`
`
She
may
be
a
leetle
spoilt
,
and
nat'rally
spoilt
,
"
"
he
says
,
`
`
by
circumstances
,
but
that
's
only
on
the
surface
,
and
I
lay
my
life
,
"
"
he
says
,
`
<EOS>
`
that
she
's
the
true
golden
gold
at
heart
.
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
"
So
did
you
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
mind
him
a
single
morsel
,
my
dear
,
"
proceeded
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
but
stick
to
me
.
<EOS>
Then
says
John
,
O
,
if
he
could
but
prove
so
!
<EOS>
Then
we
both
of
us
ups
and
says
,
that
minute
,
`
`
Prove
so
!
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
With
a
start
,
Bella
directed
a
hurried
glance
towards
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
But
,
he
was
sitting
thoughtfully
smiling
at
that
broad
brown
hand
of
his
,
and
either
did
n't
see
it
,
or
would
take
no
notice
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
`
`
Prove
it
,
John
!
"
<EOS>
"
we
says
,
"
repeated
Mrs.
Boffin
.
"
<EOS>
`
`
Prove
it
and
overcome
your
doubts
with
triumph
,
and
be
happy
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
,
and
for
the
rest
of
your
life
.
"
<EOS>
"
This
puts
John
in
a
state
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Then
we
says
,
`
`
What
will
content
you
?
<EOS>
If
she
was
to
stand
up
for
you
when
you
was
slighted
,
if
she
was
to
show
herself
of
a
generous
mind
when
you
was
oppressed
,
if
she
was
to
be
truest
to
you
when
you
was
poorest
and
friendliest
,
and
all
this
against
her
own
seeming
interest
,
how
would
that
do
?
"
<EOS>
"
`
`
Do
?
"
"
says
John
,
`
`
it
would
raise
me
to
the
skies
.
"
<EOS>
"
`
`
Then
,
"
"
says
my
Noddy
,
`
`
make
your
preparations
for
the
ascent
,
John
,
it
being
my
firm
belief
that
up
you
go
!
"
<EOS>
"
"
  
Bella
caught
Mr.
Boffin
's
twinkling
eye
for
half
an
instant
;
but
he
got
it
away
from
her
,
and
restored
it
to
his
broad
brown
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
From
the
first
,
you
was
always
a
special
favourite
of
Noddy
's
,
"
 
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
shaking
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
O
you
were
!
<EOS>
And
if
I
had
been
inclined
to
be
jealous
,
I
do
n't
know
what
I
might
n't
have
done
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
was
n't
---
why
,
my
beauty
,
"
with
a
hearty
laugh
and
an
embrace
,
"
I
made
you
a
special
favourite
of
my
own
too
.
<EOS>
But
the
horses
is
coming
round
the
corner
.
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Then
says
my
Noddy
,
shaking
his
sides
till
he
was
fit
to
make
'em
ache
again
:
`
`
Look
out
for
being
slighted
and
oppressed
,
John
,
for
if
ever
a
man
had
a
hard
master
,
you
shall
find
me
from
this
present
time
to
be
such
to
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
then
he
began
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Boffin
,
in
an
ecstacy
of
admiration
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
bless
you
,
then
he
began
!
<EOS>
And
how
he
did
begin
;
did
n't
he
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
looked
half
frightened
,
and
yet
half
laughed
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
bless
you
,
"
pursued
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
if
you
could
have
seen
him
of
a
night
,
at
that
time
of
it
!
<EOS>
The
way
he
'd
sit
and
chuckle
over
himself
!
<EOS>
The
way
he
'd
say
`
`
I
've
been
a
regular
brown
bear
to
-
day
,
"
"
and
take
himself
in
his
arms
and
hug
himself
at
the
thoughts
of
the
brute
he
had
pretended
.
<EOS>
But
every
night
he
says
to
me
:
`
`
Better
and
better
,
old
lady
.
<EOS>
What
did
we
say
of
her
?
<EOS>
She
'll
come
through
it
,
the
true
golden
gold
.
<EOS>
This'll
be
the
happiest
piece
of
work
we
ever
done
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
then
he
'd
say
,
`
`
I
'll
be
a
grislier
old
growler
to
-
morrow
!
"
<EOS>
"
and
laugh
,
he
would
,
till
John
and
me
was
often
forced
to
slap
his
back
,
and
bring
it
out
of
his
windpipes
with
a
little
water
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
with
his
face
bent
over
his
heavy
hand
,
made
no
sound
,
but
rolled
his
shoulders
when
thus
referred
to
,
as
if
he
were
vastly
enjoying
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
my
good
and
pretty
,
"
pursued
Mrs.
Boffin
,
"
you
was
married
,
and
there
was
we
hid
up
in
the
church
-
organ
by
this
husband
of
yours
;
for
he
would
n't
let
us
out
with
it
then
,
as
was
first
meant
.
<EOS>
`
`
No
,
"
"
he
says
,
`
`
She
's
so
unselfish
and
contented
,
that
I
ca
n't
afford
to
be
rich
yet
.
<EOS>
I
must
wait
a
little
longer
.
"
<EOS>
"
Then
,
when
baby
was
expected
,
he
says
,
`
`
She
is
such
a
cheerful
,
glorious
housewife
that
I
ca
n't
afford
to
be
rich
yet
.
<EOS>
I
must
wait
a
little
longer
.
"
<EOS>
"
Then
when
baby
was
born
,
he
says
,
`
`
She
is
so
much
better
than
she
ever
was
,
that
I
ca
n't
afford
to
be
rich
yet
.
<EOS>
I
must
wait
a
little
longer
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
so
he
goes
on
and
on
,
till
I
says
outright
,
`
`
Now
,
John
,
if
you
do
n't
fix
a
time
for
setting
her
up
in
her
own
house
and
home
,
and
letting
us
walk
out
of
it
,
I
'll
turn
Informer
.
"
<EOS>
"
Then
he
says
he
'll
only
wait
to
triumph
beyond
what
we
ever
thought
possible
,
and
to
show
her
to
us
better
than
even
we
ever
supposed
;
and
he
says
,
`
`
She
shall
see
me
under
suspicion
of
having
murdered
myself
,
and
you
shall
see
how
trusting
and
how
true
she
'll
be
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Noddy
and
me
agreed
to
that
,
and
he
was
right
,
and
here
you
are
,
and
the
horses
is
in
,
and
the
story
is
done
,
and
God
bless
you
my
Beauty
,
and
God
bless
us
all
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
pile
of
hands
dispersed
,
and
Bella
and
Mrs.
Boffin
took
a
good
long
hug
of
one
another
:
to
the
apparent
peril
of
the
inexhaustible
baby
,
lying
staring
in
Bella
's
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
the
story
done
?
"
said
Bella
,
pondering
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
there
no
more
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
more
of
it
should
there
be
,
deary
?
"
<EOS>
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
,
full
of
glee
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
sure
you
have
left
nothing
out
of
it
?
"
asked
Bella
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
I
have
,
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
,
archly
.
  
<EOS>
"
John
dear
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
you
're
a
good
nurse
;
will
you
please
hold
baby
?
<EOS>
"
Having
deposited
the
Inexhaustible
in
his
arms
with
those
words
,
Bella
looked
hard
at
Mr.
Boffin
,
who
had
moved
to
a
table
where
he
was
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hand
with
his
face
turned
away
,
and
,
quietly
settling
herself
on
her
knees
at
his
side
,
and
drawing
one
arm
over
his
shoulder
,
said
:
"
Please
I
beg
your
pardon
,
and
I
made
a
small
mistake
of
a
word
when
I
took
leave
of
you
last
.
<EOS>
Please
I
think
you
are
better
(
not
worse
)
than
Hopkins
,
better
(
not
worse
)
than
Dancer
,
better
(
not
worse
)
than
Blackberry
Jones
,
better
(
not
worse
)
than
any
of
them
!
<EOS>
Please
something
more
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
,
with
an
exultant
ringing
laugh
as
she
struggled
with
him
and
forced
him
to
turn
his
delighted
face
to
hers
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Please
I
have
found
out
something
not
yet
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Please
I
do
n't
believe
you
are
a
hard
-
hearted
miser
at
all
,
and
please
I
do
n't
believe
you
ever
for
one
single
minute
were
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
,
Mrs.
Boffin
fairly
screamed
with
rapture
,
and
sat
beating
her
feet
upon
the
floor
,
clapping
her
hands
,
and
bobbing
herself
backwards
and
forwards
,
like
a
demented
member
of
some
Mandarin
's
family
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
,
I
understand
you
now
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
neither
you
nor
any
one
else
to
tell
me
the
rest
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
it
to
you
,
now
,
if
you
would
like
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Can
you
,
my
dear
?
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
it
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
?
"
cried
Bella
,
holding
him
prisoner
by
the
coat
with
both
hands
.
<EOS>
"
When
you
saw
what
a
greedy
little
wretch
you
were
the
patron
of
,
you
determined
to
show
her
how
much
misused
and
misprized
riches
could
do
,
and
often
had
done
,
to
spoil
people
;
did
you
?
<EOS>
Not
caring
what
she
thought
of
you
(
and
Goodness
knows
that
was
of
no
consequence
!
)
<EOS>
you
showed
her
,
in
yourself
,
the
most
detestable
sides
of
wealth
,
saying
in
your
own
mind
,
"
This
shallow
creature
would
never
work
the
truth
out
of
her
own
weak
soul
,
if
she
had
a
hundred
years
to
do
it
in
;
but
a
glaring
instance
kept
before
her
may
open
even
her
eyes
and
set
her
thinking
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
you
said
to
yourself
;
was
it
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
said
anything
of
the
sort
,
"
Mr.
Boffin
declared
in
a
state
of
the
highest
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
ought
to
have
said
it
,
sir
,
"
returned
Bella
,
giving
him
two
pulls
and
one
kiss
,
"
for
you
must
have
thought
and
meant
it
.
<EOS>
You
saw
that
good
fortune
was
turning
my
stupid
head
and
hardening
my
silly
heart
---
was
making
me
grasping
,
calculating
,
insolent
,
insufferable
---
<EOS>
and
you
took
the
pains
to
be
the
dearest
and
kindest
fingerpost
that
over
was
set
up
anywhere
,
pointing
out
the
road
that
I
was
taking
and
<EOS>
the
end
it
led
to
.
<EOS>
Confess
instantly
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
John
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
one
broad
piece
of
sunshine
from
head
to
foot
,
"
I
wish
you
'd
help
me
out
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
heard
by
counsel
,
sir
,
"
returned
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
speak
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
Confess
instantly
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
the
truth
is
,
that
when
we
did
go
in
for
the
little
scheme
that
my
old
lady
has
pinted
out
,
I
did
put
it
to
John
,
what
did
he
think
of
going
in
for
some
such
general
scheme
as
you
have
pinted
out
?
<EOS>
But
I
did
n't
in
any
way
<EOS>
so
word
it
,
because
I
did
n't
in
any
way
<EOS>
so
mean
it
.
<EOS>
I
only
said
to
John
,
would
n't
it
be
more
consistent
<EOS>
,
me
going
in
for
being
a
reg'lar
brown
bear
respecting
him
,
to
go
in
as
a
reg'lar
brown
bear
all
round
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Confess
this
minute
,
sir
,
"
said
Bella
,
"
that
you
did
it
to
correct
and
amend
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
my
dear
child
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
I
did
n't
do
it
to
harm
you
;
you
may
be
sure
of
that
.
<EOS>
And
I
did
hope
it
might
just
hint
a
caution
.
<EOS>
Still
,
it
ought
to
be
mentioned
that
no
sooner
had
my
old
lady
found
out
John
,
than
John
made
known
to
her
and
me
that
he
had
had
his
eye
upon
a
thankless
person
by
the
name
of
Silas
Wegg
.
<EOS>
Partly
for
the
punishment
of
which
Wegg
,
by
leading
him
on
in
a
very
unhandsome
and
underhanded
game
that
he
was
playing
,
them
books
that
you
and
me
bought
so
many
of
together
(
and
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
my
dear
,
he
was
n't
Blackberry
Jones
,
but
<EOS>
Blewberry
)
was
read
aloud
to
me
by
that
person
of
the
name
of
Silas
Wegg
aforesaid
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bella
,
who
was
still
on
her
knees
at
Mr.
Boffin
's
feet
,
gradually
sank
down
into
a
sitting
posture
on
the
ground
,
as
she
meditated
more
and
more
thoughtfully
,
with
her
eyes
upon
his
beaming
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
,
"
said
Bella
,
after
this
meditative
pause
,
"
there
remain
two
things
that
I
can
not
understand
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
never
supposed
any
part
of
the
change
in
Mr.
Boffin
to
be
real
;
did
she
?
---
<EOS>
You
never
did
;
 
did
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Bella
,
turning
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
returned
Mrs.
Boffin
,
with
a
most
rotund
and
glowing
negative
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
you
took
it
very
much
to
heart
,
"
said
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
its
making
you
very
uneasy
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ecod
,
you
see
Mrs.
John
has
a
sharp
eye
,
John
!
"
cried
Mr.
Boffin
,
shaking
his
head
with
an
admiring
air
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
right
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
The
old
lady
nearly
blowed
us
into
shivers
and
smithers
,
many
times
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
asked
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
How
did
that
happen
,
when
she
was
in
your
secret
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
was
a
weakness
in
the
old
lady
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
;
"
and
yet
,
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
,
I
'm
rather
proud
of
it
.
<EOS>
My
dear
,
the
old
lady
thinks
so
high
of
me
that
she
could
n't
abear
to
see
and
hear
me
coming
out
as
a
reg'lar
brown
one
.
<EOS>
Could
n't
abear
to
make
-
believe
as
I
meant
it
!
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
which
,
we
was
everlastingly
in
danger
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
laughed
heartily
at
herself
;
but
a
certain
glistening
in
her
honest
eyes
revealed
that
she
was
by
no
means
cured
of
that
dangerous
propensity
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
that
on
the
celebrated
day
when
I
made
what
has
since
been
agreed
upon
to
be
my
grandest
demonstration
---
I
allude
to
Mew
<EOS>
says
the
cat
<EOS>
,
Quack
quack
says
the
duck
,
and
<EOS>
Bow
-
wow
-
wow
says
the
dog
<EOS>
---
I
assure
you
,
my
dear
,
that
on
that
celebrated
day
,
them
flinty
and
unbelieving
words
hit
my
old
lady
so
hard
on
my
account
,
that
I
had
to
hold
her
,
to
prevent
her
running
out
after
you
,
and
defending
me
by
saying
I
was
playing
a
part
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Boffin
laughed
heartily
again
,
and
her
eyes
glistened
again
,
and
it
then
appeared
,
not
only
that
in
that
burst
of
sarcastic
eloquence
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
was
considered
by
his
two
fellow
-
conspirators
to
have
outdone
himself
,
but
that
in
his
own
opinion
it
was
a
remarkable
achievement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Never
thought
of
it
afore
the
moment
,
my
dear
!
"
<EOS>
he
observed
to
Bella
.
<EOS>
"
When
John
said
,
if
he
had
been
so
happy
as
to
win
your
affections
and
possess
your
heart
,
it
come
into
my
head
to
turn
round
upon
him
with
`
`
Win
her
affections
and
possess
her
heart
!
<EOS>
Mew
says
the
cat
,
Quack
quack
says
the
duck
,
and
Bow
-
wow
-
wow
says
the
dog
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
tell
you
how
it
come
into
my
head
or
where
from
,
but
it
had
so
much
the
sound
of
a
rasper
that
I
own
to
you
it
astonished
myself
.
<EOS>
I
was
awful
nigh
bursting
out
a
laughing
though
,
when
it
made
John
stare
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
said
,
my
pretty
,
"
Mrs.
Boffin
reminded
Bella
,
"
that
there
was
one
other
thing
you
could
n't
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
O
yes
!
"
cried
Bella
,
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
;
"
but
that
I
never
shall
be
able
to
understand
as
long
as
I
live
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
how
John
could
love
me
<EOS>
so
when
I
so
little
deserved
it
,
and
how
you
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
could
be
so
forgetful
of
yourselves
,
and
take
such
pains
and
trouble
,
to
make
me
a
little
better
,
and
after
all
to
help
him
to
so
unworthy
a
wife
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
very
very
grateful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
John
Harmon
's
turn
then
---
John
Harmon
now
for
good
,
and
John
Rokesmith
for
nevermore
---
to
plead
with
her
(
quite
unnecessarily
)
in
behalf
of
his
deception
,
and
to
tell
her
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
it
had
been
prolonged
by
her
own
winning
graces
in
her
supposed
station
of
life
.
<EOS>
This
led
on
to
many
interchanges
of
endearment
and
enjoyment
on
all
sides
,
in
the
midst
of
which
the
Inexhaustible
being
observed
staring
,
in
a
most
imbecile
manner
,
on
Mrs.
Boffin
's
breast
,
was
pronounced
to
be
supernaturally
intelligent
as
to
the
whole
transaction
,
and
was
made
to
declare
to
the
ladies
and
gemplemorums
,
with
a
wave
of
the
speckled
fist
(
with
difficulty
detached
from
an
exceedingly
short
waist
)
,
"
I
have
already
informed
my
venerable
Ma
that
I
know
all
about
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
said
John
Harmon
,
would
Mrs.
John
Harmon
come
and
see
her
house
?
<EOS>
And
a
dainty
house
it
was
,
and
a
tastefully
beautiful
;
 
and
they
went
through
it
in
procession
;
the
Inexhaustible
on
Mrs.
Boffin
's
bosom
(
still
staring
)
occupying
the
middle
station
,
and
Mr.
Boffin
bringing
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
And
on
Bella
's
exquisite
toilette
table
was
an
ivory
casket
,
and
in
the
casket
were
jewels
the
like
of
which
she
had
never
dreamed
of
,
and
aloft
on
an
upper
floor
was
a
nursery
garnished
as
with
rainbows
;
"
though
we
were
hard
put
to
it
,
"
said
John
Harmon
,
"
to
get
it
done
in
so
short
a
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
house
inspected
,
emissaries
removed
the
Inexhaustible
,
who
was
shortly
afterwards
heard
screaming
among
the
rainbows
;
whereupon
Bella
withdrew
herself
from
the
presence
and
knowledge
of
gemplemorums
,
and
the
screaming
ceased
,
and
smiling
Peace
associated
herself
with
that
young
olive
branch
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
look
in
,
Noddy
!
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
to
Mr.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
,
submitting
to
be
led
on
tiptoe
to
the
nursery
door
,
looked
in
with
immense
satisfaction
,
although
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
<EOS>
Bella
in
a
musing
state
of
happiness
,
seated
in
a
little
low
chair
upon
the
hearth
,
with
her
child
in
her
fair
young
arms
,
and
her
soft
eyelashes
shading
her
eyes
from
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
looks
as
if
the
old
man
's
spirit
had
found
rest
at
last
;
do
n't
it
?
"
said
Mrs.
Boffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
if
his
money
had
turned
bright
again
,
after
a
long
long
rust
in
the
dark
,
and
was
at
last
a
beginning
to
sparkle
in
the
sunlight
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
it
makes
a
pretty
and
a
promising
picter
;
do
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
old
lady
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
aware
at
the
instant
of
a
fine
opening
for
a
point
,
Mr.
Boffin
quenched
that
observation
in
this
---
delivered
in
the
grisliest
growling
of
the
regular
brown
bear
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
pretty
and
a
hopeful
picter
?
<EOS>
Mew
,
Quack
quack
,
Bow
-
wow
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
trotted
silently
downstairs
,
with
his
shoulders
in
a
state
of
the
liveliest
commotion
.
   
<EOS>
CHECKMATE
TO
THE
FRIENDLY
MOVE
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Harmon
had
so
timed
their
taking
possession
of
their
rightful
name
and
their
London
house
,
that
the
event
befel
on
the
very
day
when
the
last
waggon
-
load
of
the
last
Mound
was
driven
out
at
the
gates
of
Boffin
's
Bower
.
<EOS>
As
it
jolted
away
,
Mr.
Wegg
felt
that
the
last
load
was
correspondingly
removed
from
his
mind
,
and
hailed
the
auspicious
season
when
that
black
sheep
,
Boffin
,
was
to
be
closely
sheared
.
  
<EOS>
Over
the
whole
slow
process
of
levelling
the
Mounds
,
Silas
had
kept
watch
with
rapacious
eyes
.
<EOS>
But
,
eyes
no
less
rapacious
had
watched
the
growth
of
the
Mounds
in
years
bygone
,
and
had
vigilantly
sifted
the
dust
of
which
they
were
composed
.
<EOS>
No
valuables
turned
up
.
<EOS>
How
should
there
be
any
,
seeing
that
the
old
hard
jailer
of
Harmony
Jail
had
coined
every
waif
and
stray
into
money
,
long
before
?
  
<EOS>
Though
disappointed
by
this
bare
result
,
Mr.
Wegg
felt
too
sensibly
relieved
by
the
close
of
the
labour
,
to
grumble
to
any
great
extent
.
<EOS>
A
foreman
-
representative
of
the
dust
contractors
,
purchasers
of
the
Mounds
,
had
worn
Mr.
Wegg
down
to
skin
and
bone
.
<EOS>
This
supervisor
of
the
proceedings
,
asserting
his
employers
'
rights
to
cart
off
by
daylight
,
nightlight
,
torchlight
,
when
they
would
,
must
have
been
the
death
of
Silas
if
the
work
had
lasted
much
longer
.
<EOS>
Seeming
never
to
need
sleep
himself
,
he
would
reappear
,
with
a
tiedup
broken
head
,
in
fantail
hat
and
velveteen
smalls
,
like
an
accursed
goblin
,
at
the
most
unholy
and
untimely
hours
.
<EOS>
Tired
out
by
keeping
close
ward
over
a
long
day
's
work
in
fog
and
rain
,
Silas
would
have
just
crawled
to
bed
and
be
dozing
,
when
a
horrid
shake
and
rumble
under
his
pillow
would
announce
an
approaching
train
of
carts
,
escorted
by
this
Demon
of
Unrest
,
to
fall
to
work
again
.
<EOS>
At
another
time
,
he
would
be
rumbled
up
out
of
his
soundest
sleep
,
in
the
dead
of
the
night
;
at
another
,
would
be
kept
at
his
post
eight
-
and
-
forty
hours
on
end
.
<EOS>
The
more
his
persecutor
besought
him
not
to
trouble
himself
to
turn
out
<EOS>
,
the
more
suspicious
was
the
crafty
Wegg
that
indications
had
been
observed
of
something
hidden
somewhere
,
and
that
attempts
were
on
foot
to
circumvent
him
.
<EOS>
So
continually
broken
was
his
rest
through
these
means
,
that
he
led
the
life
of
having
wagered
to
keep
ten
thousand
dog
-
watches
in
ten
thousand
hours
,
and
looked
piteously
upon
himself
as
always
getting
up
and
yet
never
going
to
bed
.
<EOS>
So
gaunt
and
haggard
had
he
grown
at
last
,
that
his
wooden
leg
showed
disproportionate
,
and
presented
a
thriving
appearance
in
contrast
with
the
rest
of
his
plagued
body
,
which
might
almost
have
been
termed
chubby
.
  
<EOS>
However
.
<EOS>
Wegg
's
comfort
was
,
that
all
his
disagreeables
were
now
over
,
and
that
he
was
immediately
coming
into
his
property
.
<EOS>
Of
late
,
the
grindstone
did
undoubtedly
appear
to
have
been
whirling
at
his
own
nose
rather
than
Boffin
's
,
but
Boffin
's
nose
was
now
to
be
sharpened
fine
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
,
Mr.
Wegg
had
let
his
dusty
friend
off
lightly
,
having
been
baulked
in
that
amiable
design
of
frequently
dining
with
him
,
by
the
machinations
of
the
sleepless
dustman
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
constrained
to
depute
Mr.
Venus
to
keep
their
dusty
friend
,
Boffin
,
under
inspection
,
while
he
himself
turned
lank
and
lean
at
the
Bower
.
  
<EOS>
To
Mr.
Venus
's
museum
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
repaired
when
at
length
the
Mounds
were
down
and
gone
.
<EOS>
It
being
evening
,
he
found
that
gentleman
,
as
he
expected
,
seated
over
his
fire
;
but
did
not
find
him
,
as
he
expected
,
floating
his
powerful
mind
in
tea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
smell
rather
comfortable
here
!
"
<EOS>
said
Wegg
,
seeming
to
take
it
ill
,
and
stopping
and
sniffing
as
he
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
rather
comfortable
,
sir
,
"
said
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
use
lemon
in
your
business
,
do
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Wegg
,
sniffing
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
said
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
use
it
at
all
,
I
mostly
use
it
in
cobblers
'
punch
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
cobblers
'
punch
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Wegg
,
in
a
worse
humour
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
difficult
to
impart
the
receipt
for
it
,
sir
,
"
returned
Venus
,
"
because
,
however
particular
you
may
be
in
allotting
your
materials
,
so
much
will
still
depend
upon
the
individual
gifts
,
and
there
being
a
feeling
thrown
into
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
groundwork
is
gin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
a
Dutch
bottle
?
"
said
Wegg
gloomily
,
as
he
sat
himself
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
sir
,
very
good
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
partake
,
sir
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
I
partake
?
"
returned
Wegg
very
surlily
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
of
course
I
will
!
<EOS>
Will
a
man
partake
,
as
has
been
tormented
out
of
his
five
senses
by
an
everlasting
dustman
with
his
head
tied
up
!
<EOS>
Will
he
,
too
!
<EOS>
As
if
he
would
n't
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
it
put
you
out
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
seem
in
your
usual
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
If
you
,
come
to
that
,
you
do
n't
seem
in
your
usual
spirits
,
"
 
growled
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
setting
up
for
lively
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
circumstance
appeared
,
in
his
then
state
of
mind
,
to
give
Mr.
Wegg
uncommon
offence
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
've
been
having
your
hair
cut
!
"
<EOS>
said
Wegg
,
missing
the
usual
dusty
shock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
let
that
put
you
out
,
either
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
blest
if
you
ai
n't
getting
fat
!
"
<EOS>
said
Wegg
,
with
culminating
discontent
.
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
going
to
do
next
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
said
Venus
,
smiling
in
a
sprightly
manner
<EOS>
,
"
I
suspect
you
could
hardly
guess
what
I
am
going
to
do
next
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
guess
,
"
retorted
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
've
got
to
say
is
,
that
it
's
well
for
you
that
the
diwision
of
labour
has
been
what
it
has
been
.
<EOS>
It
's
well
for
you
to
have
had
so
light
a
part
in
this
business
,
when
mine
has
been
so
heavy
.
<EOS>
You
have
n't
had
your
rest
broke
,
I
'll
be
bound
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
at
all
,
sir
,
"
said
Venus
.
<EOS>
"
Never
rested
so
well
in
all
my
life
,
I
thank
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
grumbled
Wegg
<EOS>
,
"
you
should
have
been
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
been
me
,
and
had
been
fretted
out
of
your
bed
,
and
your
sleep
,
and
your
meals
,
and
your
mind
,
for
a
stretch
of
months
together
<EOS>
,
you
'd
have
been
out
of
condition
and
out
of
sorts
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Certainly
,
it
has
trained
you
down
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
said
Venus
,
con
templating
his
figure
with
an
artist
's
eye
.
<EOS>
"
Trained
you
down
very
low
,
it
has
!
<EOS>
So
weazen
and
yellow
is
the
kivering
upon
your
bones
,
that
one
might
almost
fancy
you
had
come
to
give
a
look
-
in
upon
the
French
gentleman
in
the
corner
,
instead
of
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
glancing
in
great
dudgeon
towards
the
French
gentleman
's
corner
,
seemed
to
notice
something
new
there
,
which
induced
him
to
glance
at
the
opposite
corner
,
and
then
to
put
on
his
glasses
and
stare
at
all
the
nooks
and
corners
of
the
dim
shop
in
succession
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
've
been
having
the
place
cleaned
up
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Mr.
Wegg
.
<EOS>
By
the
hand
of
adorable
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
what
you
're
going
to
do
next
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
is
to
get
married
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
took
off
his
glasses
again
---
finding
himself
too
intensely
disgusted
by
the
sprightly
appearance
of
his
friend
and
partner
,
to
bear
a
magnified
view
of
him
---
and
made
the
inquiry
:
  
"
To
the
old
party
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wegg
!
"
said
Venus
,
with
a
sudden
flush
of
wrath
.
<EOS>
"
The
lady
in
question
is
not
a
old
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
,
"
explaimed
Wegg
,
testily
,
"
to
the
party
as
formerly
objected
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
said
Venus
,
"
in
a
case
of
so
much
delicacy
,
I
must
trouble
you
to
say
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
There
are
strings
that
must
not
be
played
upon
.
<EOS>
No
sir
!
<EOS>
Not
sounded
,
unless
in
the
most
respectful
and
tuneful
manner
.
<EOS>
Of
such
melodious
strings
is
Miss
Pleasant
Riderhood
formed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
is
the
lady
as
formerly
objected
?
"
said
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
Venus
with
dignity
,
"
I
accept
the
altered
phrase
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
lady
as
formerly
objected
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
is
it
to
come
off
?
"
asked
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
said
Venus
,
with
another
flush
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
permit
it
to
be
put
in
the
form
of
a
Fight
.
<EOS>
I
must
temperately
but
firmly
call
upon
you
,
sir
,
to
amend
that
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
is
the
lady
,
"
Wegg
reluctantly
demanded
,
constraining
his
ill
temper
in
remembrance
of
the
partnership
and
its
stock
in
trade
,
"
a
going
to
give
her
'
and
<EOS>
where
she
has
already
given
her
'
art
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returned
Venus
,
"
I
again
accept
the
altered
phrase
,
and
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
The
lady
is
a
going
to
give
her
'
and
where
she
has
already
given
her
'
art
,
next
Monday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Then
the
lady
's
objection
has
been
met
?
"
said
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
said
Venus
,
"
as
I
did
name
to
you
,
I
think
,
on
a
former
occasion
,
if
not
on
former
occasions
---
"
  
"
On
former
occasions
,
"
interrupted
Wegg
.
  
<EOS>
"
---
What
,
"
pursued
Venus
,
"
what
the
nature
of
the
lady
's
objection
was
,
<EOS>
I
may
impart
,
without
violating
any
of
the
tender
confidences
since
sprung
up
between
the
lady
and
myself
,
how
it
has
been
met
,
through
the
kind
interference
of
two
good
friends
of
mine
:
one
,
previously
acquainted
with
the
lady
:
and
one
,
not
.
<EOS>
The
pint
was
thrown
out
,
sir
,
by
those
two
friends
when
they
did
me
the
great
service
of
waiting
on
the
lady
to
try
if
a
union
betwixt
the
lady
and
me
could
not
be
brought
to
bear
---
the
pint
,
I
say
,
was
thrown
out
by
them
,
sir
,
whether
if
,
after
marriage
,
I
confined
myself
to
the
articulation
of
men
,
children
,
and
the
lower
animals
,
it
might
not
relieve
the
lady
's
mind
of
her
feeling
respecting
being
---
as
a
lady
---
  
regarded
in
a
bony
light
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
happy
thought
,
sir
,
and
it
took
root
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
seem
,
Mr.
Venus
,
"
observed
Wegg
,
with
a
touch
of
distrust
,
"
that
you
are
flush
of
friends
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pretty
well
,
sir
,
"
that
gentleman
answered
,
in
a
tone
of
placid
mystery
.
"
<EOS>
So
-
so
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Pretty
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
said
Wegg
,
after
eyeing
him
with
another
touch
of
distrust
,
"
I
wish
you
joy
.
<EOS>
One
man
spends
his
fortune
in
one
way
,
and
another
in
another
.
<EOS>
You
are
going
to
try
matrimony
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
try
travelling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
Mr.
Wegg
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Change
of
air
,
sea
-
scenery
,
and
my
natural
rest
,
I
hope
may
bring
me
round
after
the
persecutions
I
have
undergone
from
the
dustman
with
his
head
tied
up
,
which
I
just
now
mentioned
.
<EOS>
The
tough
job
being
ended
and
the
Mounds
laid
low
,
the
hour
is
come
for
Boffin
to
stump
up
.
<EOS>
Would
ten
to
-
morrow
morning
suit
you
,
partner
,
for
finally
bringing
Boffin
's
nose
to
the
grindstone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Ten
to
-
morrow
morning
would
quite
suit
Mr.
Venus
for
that
excellent
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
him
well
under
inspection
,
I
hope
?
"
said
Silas
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
had
had
him
under
inspection
pretty
well
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
you
was
just
to
step
round
to
-
night
then
,
and
give
him
orders
from
me
---
I
say
from
me
,
because
he
knows
I
wo
n't
be
played
with
---
to
be
ready
with
his
papers
,
his
accounts
,
and
his
cash
,
at
that
time
in
the
morning

said
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
as
a
matter
of
form
,
which
will
be
agreeable
to
your
own
feelings

before
we
go
out

(
for
I
'll
walk
with
you
part

my
leg

under
me

weariness

,
let
's
have
a
look
at
the
stock
in
trade

"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
produced
it
,
and
it
was
perfectly
correct
;
Mr.
Venus
undertook
to
produce
it
again
in
the
morning
,
and
to
keep
tryst
with
Mr.
Wegg
on
Boffin
's
doorstep
as
the
clock
struck
ten
.
<EOS>
At
a
certain
point
of
the
road
between
Clerkenwell
and
Boffin
's
house
(
Mr.
Wegg
expressly
insisted
that
there
should
be
no
prefix
to
the
Golden
Dustman
's
name
)
<EOS>
the
partners
separated
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
bad
night
;
to
which
succeeded
a
very
bad
morning
.
<EOS>
The
streets
were
so
unusually
slushy
,
muddy
,
and
miserable
,
in
the
morning
,
that
Wegg
rode
to
the
scene
of
action
;
arguing
that
a
man
who
was
,
as
it
were
,
going
to
the
Bank
to
draw
out
a
handsome
property
,
could
well
afford
that
trifling
expense
.
  
<EOS>
Venus
was
punctual
,
and
Wegg
undertook
to
knock
at
the
door
,
and
conduct
the
conference
.
<EOS>
Door
knocked
at
.
<EOS>
Door
opened
.
  
<EOS>
"
Boffin
at
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
servant
replied
that
Mr.
Boffin
was
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
'll
do
,
"
said
Wegg
,
"
though
it
ai
n't
what
I
call
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
servant
inquired
if
they
had
any
appointment
?
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
tell
you
what
,
young
fellow
,
"
said
Wegg
,
"
I
wo
n't
have
it
.
<EOS>
This
wo
n't
do
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
menials
.
<EOS>
I
want
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
shown
into
a
waiting
-
room
,
where
the
all
-
powerful
Wegg
were
his
hat
,
and
whistled
,
and
with
his
forefinger
stirred
up
a
clock
that
stood
upon
the
chimneypiece
,
until
he
made
it
strike
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
they
were
shown
upstairs
into
what
used
to
be
Boffin
's
room
;
which
,
besides
the
door
of
entrance
,
had
folding
-
doors
in
it
,
to
make
it
one
of
a
suite
of
rooms
when
occasion
required
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Boffin
was
seated
at
a
library
-
table
,
and
here
Mr.
Wegg
,
having
imperiously
motioned
the
servant
to
withdraw
,
drew
up
a
chair
and
seated
himself
,
in
his
hat
,
close
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Here
,
also
,
Mr.
Wegg
instantly
underwent
the
remarkable
experience
of
having
his
hat
twitched
off
his
head
and
thrown
out
of
a
window
,
which
was
opened
and
shut
for
the
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
Be
careful
<EOS>
what
insolent
liberties
you
take
in
that
gentleman
's
presence
,
"
said
the
owner
of
the
hand
which
had
done
this
,
"
or
I
will
throw
you
after
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Wegg
involuntarily
clapped
his
hand
to
his
bare
head
,
and
stared
at
the
Secretary
.
<EOS>
For
,
it
was
he
addressed
him
with
a
severe
countenance
,
and
who
had
come
in
quietly
by
the
folding
-
doors
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Wegg
,
as
soon
as
he
recovered
his
suspended
power
of
speech
.
"
<EOS>
Very
good
!
<EOS>
I
gave
directions
for
you
to
be
dismissed
.
<EOS>
And
you
ai
n't
gone
,
ai
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
We
'll
look
into
this
presently
,
Very
good
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
nor
I
ai
n't
gone
,
"
said
another
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Somebody
else
had
come
in
quietly
by
the
folding
-
doors
.
<EOS>
Turning
his
head
,
Wegg
beheld
his
persecutor
,
the
ever
-
wakeful
dustman
,
accoutred
with
fantail
hat
and
velveteen
smalls
complete
.
<EOS>
Who
,
untying
his
tied
-
up
broken
head
,
revealed
a
head
that
was
whole
,
and
a
face
that
was
Sloppy
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
,
gentlemen
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Sloppy
in
a
peal
of
laughter
,
and
with
immeasureable
relish
.
"
<EOS>
He
never
thought
as
I
could
sleep
standing
,
and
often
done
it
when
I
turned
for
Mrs.
Higden
!
<EOS>
He
never
thought
as
I
used
to
give
Mrs.
Higden
the
Police
-
news
in
different
voices
!
<EOS>
But
I
did
lead
him
a
life
all
through
it
,
gentlemen
<EOS>
,
I
hope
I
really
and
truly
   
DID
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
Mr.
Sloppy
opening
his
mouth
to
a
quite
alarming
extent
,
and
throwing
back
his
head
to
peal
again
,
revealed
incalculable
buttons
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
said
Wegg
,
slightly
discomfited
,
but
not
much
as
yet
:
<EOS>
"
one
and
one
is
two
not
dismissed
,
is
it
?
<EOS>
Bof
<EOS>
---
fin
!
<EOS>
Just
let
me
ask
a
question
.
<EOS>
Who
set
this
chap
on
,
in
this
dress
,
when
the
carting
began
?
<EOS>
Who
employed
this
fellow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
"
<EOS>
remonstrated
Sloppy
,
jerking
his
head
forward
.
"
<EOS>
No
fellows
,
or
I
'll
throw
you
out
of
winder
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boffin
appeased
him
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
,
and
said
:
"
I
employed
him
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
You
employed
him
,
Boffin
?
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Venus
,
we
raise
our
terms
,
and
we
ca
n't
do
better
than
proceed
to
business
.
<EOS>
Bof
---
fin
!
<EOS>
I
want
the
room
cleared
of
these
two
scum
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
not
going
to
be
done
,
Wegg
,
"
replied
Mr.
Boffin
,
sitting
composedly
on
the
library
-
table
,
at
one
end
,
while
the
Secretary
sat
composedly
on
it
at
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bof
---
fin
!
<EOS>
Not
going
to
be
done
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
Not
at
your
peril
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Wegg
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
shaking
his
head
good
-
humouredly
.
<EOS>
"
Not
at
my
peril
,
and
not
on
any
other
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
Wegg
reflected
a
moment
,
and
then
said
:
"
Mr.
Venus
,
will
you
be
so
good
as
hand
me
over
that
same
dockyment
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
sir
,
"
replied
Venus
,
handing
it
to
him
with
much
politeness
.
<EOS>
"
There
it
is
.
<EOS>
Having
now
,
sir
,
parted
with
it
,
I
wish
to
make
a
small
observation
:
not
so
much
because
it
is
anyways
necessary
,
or
expresses
any
new
doctrine
or
discovery
,
as
because
it
is
a
comfort
to
my
mind
.
<EOS>
Silas
Wegg
,
you
are
a
precious
old
rascal
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Wegg
,
who
,
as
if
anticipating
a
compliment
,
had
been
beating
time
with
the
paper
to
the
other
's
politeness
until
this
unexpected
conclusion
came
upon
him
,
stopped
rather
abruptly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Silas
Wegg
,
"
said
Venus
,
"
know
that
I
took
the
liberty
of
taking
Mr.
Boffin
into
our
concern
as
a
sleeping
partner
,
at
a
very
early
period
of
our
firm
's
existence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
true
,
"
added
Mr.
Boffin
;
"
and
I
tested
Venus
by
making
him
a
pretended
proposal
or
two
;
and
I
found
him
on
the
whole
a
very
honest
man
,
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
So
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
his
indulgence
,
is
pleased
to
say
,
"
Venus
remarked
:
"
though
in
the
beginning
of
this
dirt
,
my
hands
were
not
,
for
a
few
hours
,
quite
as
clean
as
I
could
wish
.
<EOS>
But
I
hope
I
made
early
and
full
amends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Venus
,
you
did
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Certainly
,
certainly
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Venus
inclined
his
head
with
respect
and
gratitude
.
"
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
sir
,
for
all
.
<EOS>
For
your
good
opinion
now
,
for
your
way
of
receiving
and
encouraging
me
when
I
first
put
myself
in
communication
with
you
,
and
for
the
influence
since
so
kindly
brought
to
bear
upon
a
certain
lady
,
both
by
yourself
and
by
Mr.
John
Harmon
.
<EOS>
"
To
whom
,
when
thus
making
mention
of
him
,
he
also
bowed
.
  
<EOS>
Wegg
followed
the
name
with
sharp
ears
,
and
the
action
with
sharp
eyes
,
and
a
certain
cringing
air
was
infusing
itself
into
his
bullying
air
,
when
his
attention
was
re
-
claimed
by
Venus
.
  
<EOS>
"
Everything
else
between
you
and
me
,
Mr.
Wegg
,
"
said
Venus
,
"
now
explains
itself
,
and
you
can
now
make
out
,
sir
,
without
further
words
from
me
.
<EOS>
But
totally
to
prevent
any
unpleasantness
or
mistake
that
might
arise
on
what
I
consider
an
important
point
,
to
be
made
quite
clear
at
the
close
of
our
acquaintance
,
I
beg
the
leave
of
Mr.
Boffin
and
Mr.
John
Harmon
to
repeat
an
observation
which
I
have
already
had
the
pleasure
of
bringing
under
your
notice
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
precious
old
rascal
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
fool
,
"
said
Wegg
,
with
a
snap
of
his
fingers
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
'd
have
got
rid
of
you
before
now
,
if
I
could
have
struck
out
any
way
of
doing
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
it
over
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
go
,
and
welcome
.
<EOS>
You
leave
the
more
for
me
.
<EOS>
Because
,
you
know
,
"
said
Wegg
,
dividing
his
next
observation
between
Mr.
Boffin
and
Mr.
Harmon
,
"
I
am
worth
my
price
,
and
I
mean
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
This
getting
off
is
all
very
well
in
its
way
,
and
it
tells
with
such
an
anatomical
Pump
as
this
one
,
"
pointing
out
Mr.
Venus
,
"
but
it
wo
n't
do
with
a
Man
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
to
be
bought
off
,
and
I
have
named
my
figure
.
<EOS>
Now
,
buy
me
,
or
leave
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
leave
you
,
Wegg
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
laughing
,
"
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bof
---
fin
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Wegg
,
turning
upon
him
with
a
severe
air
,
"
I
understand
your
new
-
born
boldness
.
<EOS>
I
see
the
brass
underneath
your
silver
plating
.
<EOS>
You
have
got
your
nose
put
out
of
joint
.
<EOS>
Knowing
that
you
've
nothing
at
stake
,
you
can
afford
to
come
the
independent
game
.
<EOS>
Why
,
you
're
just
so
much
smeary
glass
to
see
through
,
you
know
!
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Harmon
is
in
another
sitiwation
.
<EOS>
What
Mr.
Harmon
risks
,
is
quite
another
pair
of
shoes
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
've
heerd
something
lately
about
this
being
Mr.
Harmon
---
I
make
out
now
<EOS>
,
some
hints
that
I
've
met
on
that
subject
in
the
newspaper
---
<EOS>
and
I
drop
you
,
Bof
---
<EOS>
fin
,
as
beneath
my
notice
.
<EOS>
I
ask
Mr.
Harmon
whether
he
has
any
idea
of
the
contents
of
this
present
paper
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
will
of
my
late
father
's
,
of
more
recent
date
than
the
will
proved
by
Mr.
Boffin
(
address
whom
again
,
as
you
have
addressed
him
already
,
and
I
'll
knock
you
down
)
,
leaving
the
whole
of
his
property
to
the
Crown
,
"
said
John
Harmon
,
with
as
much
indifference
as
was
compatible
with
extreme
sternness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Right
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Wegg
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
"
screwing
the
weight
of
his
body
upon
his
wooden
leg
,
and
screwing
his
wooden
head
very
much
on
one
side
,
and
screwing
up
one
eye
:
"
then
,
I
put
the
question
to
you
,
what
's
this
paper
worth
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
,
"
said
John
Harmon
.
  
<EOS>
Wegg
had
repeated
the
word
with
a
sneer
,
and
was
entering
on
some
sarcastic
retort
,
when
,
to
his
boundless
amazement
,
he
found
himself
gripped
by
the
cravat
;
shaken
until
his
teeth
chattered
;
 
shoved
back
,
staggering
,
into
a
corner
of
the
room
;
and
pinned
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
scoundrel
!
"
said
John
Harmon
,
whose
seafaring
hold
was
like
that
of
a
vice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
knocking
my
head
against
the
wall
,
"
urged
Silas
faintly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
knock
your
head
against
the
wall
,
"
returned
John
Harmon
,
suiting
his
action
to
his
words
,
with
the
heartiest
good
will
;
 
"
and
I
'd
give
a
thousand
pounds
for
leave
to
knock
your
brains
out
.
<EOS>
Listen
,
you
scoundrel
,
and
look
at
that
Dutch
bottle
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sloppy
held
it
up
,
for
his
edification
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
Dutch
bottle
,
scoundrel
,
contained
the
latest
will
of
the
many
wills
made
by
my
unhappy
self
-
tormenting
father
.
<EOS>
That
will
gives
everything
absolutely
to
my
noble
benefactor
and
yours
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
excluding
and
reviling
me
,
and
my
sister
(
then
already
dead
of
a
broken
heart
)
,
by
name
.
<EOS>
That
Dutch
bottle
was
found
by
my
noble
benefactor
and
yours
,
after
he
entered
on
possession
of
the
estate
.
<EOS>
That
Dutch
bottle
distressed
him
beyond
measure
,
because
,
though
I
and
my
sister
were
both
no
more
,
it
cast
a
slur
upon
our
memory
which
he
knew
we
had
done
nothing
in
our
miserable
youth
,
to
deserve
.
<EOS>
That
Dutch
bottle
,
therefore
,
he
buried
in
the
Mound
belonging
to
him
,
and
there
it
lay
while
you
,
you
thankless
wretch
,
were
prodding
and
poking
---
often
very
near
it
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
His
intention
was
,
that
it
should
never
see
the
light
;
but
he
was
afraid
to
destroy
it
,
lest
to
destroy
such
a
document
,
even
with
his
great
generous
motive
,
might
be
an
offence
at
law
.
<EOS>
After
the
discovery
was
made
here
who
I
was
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
still
restless
on
the
subject
,
told
me
,
upon
certain
conditions
impossible
for
such
a
hound
as
you
to
appreciate
,
the
secret
of
that
Dutch
bottle
.
<EOS>
I
urged
upon
him
the
necessity
of
its
being
dug
up
,
and
the
paper
being
legally
produced
and
established
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
you
saw
him
do
,
and
the
second
thing
has
been
done
without
your
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Consequently
,
the
paper
now
rattling
in
your
hand
as
I
shake
you
---
and
I
should
like
to
shake
the
life
out
of
you
---
is
worth
less
than
the
rotten
cork
of
the
Dutch
bottle
,
do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Judging
from
the
fallen
countenance
of
Silas
as
his
head
wagged
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
most
uncomfortable
manner
,
he
did
understand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
scoundrel
,
"
said
John
Harmon
,
taking
another
sailor
-
like
turn
on
his
cravat
and
holding
him
in
his
corner
at
arms
'
length
<EOS>
,
"
I
shall
make
two
more
short
speeches
to
you
,
because
I
hope
they
will
torment
you
.
<EOS>
Your
discovery
was
a
genuine
discovery
(
such
as
it
was
)
,
for
nobody
had
thought
of
looking
into
that
place
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
we
know
you
had
made
it
,
until
Venus
spoke
to
Mr.
Boffin
,
though
I
kept
you
under
good
observation
from
my
first
appearance
here
,
and
though
Sloppy
has
long
made
it
the
chief
occupation
and
delight
of
his
life
,
to
attend
you
like
your
shadow
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
this
,
that
you
may
know
we
knew
enough
of
you
to
persuade
Mr.
Boffin
to
let
us
lead
you
on
,
deluded
,
to
the
last
possible
moment
,
in
order
that
your
disappointment
might
be
the
heaviest
possible
disappointment
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
first
short
speech
,
do
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
,
John
Harmon
assisted
his
comprehension
with
another
shake
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
scoundrel
,
"
he
pursued
,
"
I
am
going
to
finish
.
<EOS>
You
supposed
me
just
now
,
to
be
the
possessor
of
my
father
's
property
.
<EOS>
---
  
<EOS>
So
I
am
.
<EOS>
But
through
any
act
of
my
father
's
,
or
by
any
right
I
have
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Through
the
munificence
of
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
The
conditions
that
he
made
with
me
,
before
parting
with
the
secret
of
the
Dutch
bottle
,
were
,
that
I
should
take
the
fortune
,
and
that
he
should
take
his
Mound
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
I
owe
everything
I
possess
,
solely
to
the
disinterestedness
,
uprightness
,
tenderness
,
goodness
<EOS>
(
there
are
no
words
to
satisfy
me
)
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
And
when
,
knowing
what
I
knew
,
I
saw
such
a
mud
-
worm
as
you
presume
to
rise
in
this
house
against
this
noble
soul
,
the
wonder
is
,
"
added
John
Harmon
through
his
clenched
teeth
,
and
with
a
very
ugly
turn
indeed
on
Wegg
's
cravat
,
"
that
I
did
n't
try
to
twist
your
head
off
,
and
fling
that
out
of
window
!
<EOS>
So
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
last
short
speech
,
do
you
understand
?
"
  
<EOS>
Silas
,
released
,
put
his
hand
to
his
throat
,
cleared
it
,
and
looked
as
if
he
had
a
rather
large
fishbone
in
that
region
.
<EOS>
Simultaneously
with
this
action
on
his
part
in
his
corner
,
a
singular
,
and
on
the
surface
an
incomprehensible
,
movement
was
made
by
Mr.
Sloppy
:
who
began
backing
towards
Mr.
Wegg
along
the
wall
,
in
the
manner
of
a
porter
or
heaver
who
is
about
to
lift
a
sack
of
flour
or
coals
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
Wegg
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
,
in
his
clemency
,
"
that
my
old
lady
and
I
ca
n't
have
a
better
opinion
of
you
than
the
bad
one
we
are
forced
to
entertain
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
n't
like
to
leave
you
,
after
all
said
and
done
,
worse
off
in
life
than
I
found
you
.
<EOS>
Therefore
say
in
a
word
,
before
we
part
,
what
it
'll
cost
to
set
you
up
in
another
stall
.
"
  
"
And
in
another
place
,
"
John
Harmon
struck
in
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
come
outside
these
windows
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
returned
Wegg
in
avaricious
humiliation
:
"
when
I
first
had
the
honor
of
making
your
acquaintance
,
I
had
got
together
a
collection
of
ballads
which
was
,
I
may
say
,
above
price
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
they
ca
n't
be
paid
for
,
"
said
John
Harmon
,
"
and
you
had
better
not
try
,
my
dear
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
Mr.
Boffin
,
"
resumed
Wegg
,
with
a
malignant
glance
in
the
last
speaker
's
direction
,
"
I
was
putting
the
case
to
you
,
who
,
if
my
senses
did
not
deceive
me
,
put
the
case
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
very
choice
collection
of
ballads
,
and
there
was
a
new
stock
of
gingerbread
in
the
tin
box
.
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
,
but
would
rather
leave
it
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
difficult
to
name
what
's
right
,
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
uneasily
,
with
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
"
and
I
do
n't
want
to
go
beyond
what
's
right
,
because
you
really
have
turned
out
such
a
very
bad
fellow
.
<EOS>
So
artful
,
and
so
ungrateful
you
have
been
,
Wegg
;
for
when
did
I
ever
injure
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
also
,
"
Mr.
Wegg
went
on
,
in
a
meditative
manner
,
"
a
errand
connection
,
in
which
I
was
much
respected
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
wish
to
be
deemed
covetuous
,
and
I
would
rather
leave
it
to
you
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
do
n't
know
what
to
put
it
at
,
"
the
Golden
Dustman
muttered
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
likewise
,
"
resumed
Wegg
,
"
a
pair
of
trestles
,
for
which
alone
a
Irish
person
,
who
was
deemed
a
judge
of
trestles
,
offered
five
and
six
---
a
sum
I
would
not
hear
of
,
for
I
should
have
lost
by
it
---
  
<EOS>
and
there
was
a
stool
,
a
umbrella
,
a
clothes
-
horse
,
and
a
tray
.
<EOS>
But
I
leave
it
to
you
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Golden
Dustman
seeming
to
be
engaged
in
some
abstruse
calculation
,
Mr.
Wegg
assisted
him
with
the
following
additional
items
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
,
further
,
Miss
Elizabeth
,
Master
George
,
Aunt
Jane
,
and
Uncle
Parker
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
When
a
man
thinks
of
the
loss
of
such
patronage
as
that
;
when
a
man
finds
so
fair
a
garden
rooted
up
by
pigs
;
he
finds
it
hard
indeed
,
without
going
high
,
to
work
it
into
money
.
<EOS>
But
I
leave
it
wholly
to
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sloppy
still
continued
his
singular
,
and
on
the
surface
his
incomprehensible
,
movement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leading
on
has
been
mentioned
,
"
said
Wegg
with
a
melancholy
air
,
"
and
it
's
not
easy
to
say
how
far
the
tone
of
my
mind
may
have
been
lowered
by
unwholesome
reading
on
the
subject
of
Misers
,
when
you
was
leading
me
and
others
on
to
think
you
one
yourself
,
sir
.
<EOS>
All
I
can
say
is
,
that
I
felt
my
tone
of
mind
a
lowering
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
And
how
can
a
man
put
a
price
upon
his
mind
!
<EOS>
There
was
likewise
a
hat
just
now
.
<EOS>
But
I
leave
the
ole
to
you
,
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
!
"
said
Mr.
Boffin
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
couple
of
pound
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
In
justice
to
myself
,
I
could
n't
take
it
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
words
were
but
out
of
his
mouth
when
John
Harmon
lifted
his
finger
,
and
Sloppy
,
who
was
now
close
to
Wegg
,
backed
to
Wegg
's
back
,
stooped
,
grasped
his
coat
collar
behind
with
both
hands
,
and
deftly
swung
him
up
like
the
sack
of
flour
or
coals
before
mentioned
.
<EOS>
A
countenance
of
special
discontent
and
amazement
Mr.
Wegg
exhibited
in
this
position
,
with
his
buttons
almost
as
prominently
on
view
as
Sloppy
's
own
,
and
with
his
wooden
leg
in
a
highly
unaccommodating
state
.
<EOS>
But
,
not
for
many
seconds
was
his
countenance
visible
in
the
room
;
for
,
Sloppy
lightly
trotted
out
with
him
and
trotted
down
the
staircase
,
Mr.
Venus
attending
to
open
the
street
door
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Sloppy
's
instructions
had
been
to
deposit
his
burden
in
the
road
;
but
;
a
scavenger
's
cart
happening
to
stand
unattended
at
the
corner
,
with
its
little
ladder
planted
against
the
wheel
,
Mr.
S.
found
it
impossible
to
resist
the
temptation
of
shooting
Mr.
Silas
Wegg
into
the
cart
's
contents
.
<EOS>
A
somewhat
difficult
feat
,
achieved
with
great
dexterity
,
and
with
a
prodigious
splash
.
   
<EOS>
WHAT
WAS
CAUGHT
IN
THE
TRAPS
THAT
WERE
SET
.
 
<EOS>
How
Bradley
Headstone
had
been
racked
and
riven
in
his
mind
since
the
quiet
evening
when
by
the
river
-
side
he
had
risen
,
as
it
were
,
out
of
the
ashes
of
the
Bargeman
,
none
but
he
could
have
told
.
<EOS>
Not
even
he
could
have
told
,
for
such
misery
can
only
be
felt
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
he
had
to
bear
the
combined
weight
of
the
knowledge
of
what
he
had
done
,
of
that
haunting
reproach
that
he
might
have
done
it
so
much
better
,
and
of
the
dread
of
discovery
.
<EOS>
This
was
load
enough
to
crush
him
,
and
he
laboured
under
it
day
and
night
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
heavy
on
him
in
his
scanty
sleep
,
as
in
his
red
-
eyed
waking
hours
.
<EOS>
It
bore
him
down
with
a
dread
unchanging
monotony
,
in
which
there
was
not
a
moment
's
variety
.
<EOS>
The
overweighted
beast
of
burden
,
or
the
overweighted
slave
,
can
for
certain
instants
shift
the
physical
load
,
and
find
some
slight
respite
even
in
enforcing
additional
pain
upon
such
a
set
of
muscles
or
such
a
limb
.
<EOS>
Not
even
that
poor
mockery
of
relief
could
the
wretched
man
obtain
,
under
the
steady
pressure
of
the
infernal
atmosphere
into
which
he
had
entered
.
  
<EOS>
Time
went
by
,
and
no
visible
suspicion
dogged
him
;
time
went
by
,
and
in
such
public
accounts
of
the
attack
as
were
renewed
at
intervals
,
he
began
to
see
Mr.
Lightwood
(
who
acted
as
lawyer
for
the
injured
man
)
straying
further
from
the
fact
,
going
wider
of
the
issue
,
and
evidently
slackening
in
his
zeal
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
a
glimmering
of
the
cause
of
this
began
to
break
on
Bradley
's
sight
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
chance
encounter
with
Mr.
Milvey
at
the
railway
station
(
where
he
often
lingered
in
his
leisure
hours
,
as
a
place
where
any
fresh
news
of
his
deed
would
be
circulated
,
or
any
placard
referring
to
it
would
be
posted
)
,
and
then
he
saw
in
the
light
what
he
had
brought
about
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
then
he
saw
that
through
his
desperate
attempt
to
separate
those
two
for
ever
,
he
had
been
made
the
means
of
uniting
them
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
dipped
his
hands
in
blood
,
to
mark
himself
a
miserable
fool
and
tool
.
<EOS>
That
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
for
his
wife
's
sake
,
set
him
aside
and
left
him
to
crawl
along
his
blasted
course
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
Fate
,
or
Providence
,
or
be
the
directing
Power
what
it
might
,
as
having
put
a
fraud
upon
him
---
overreached
him
---
and
in
his
impotent
mad
rage
bit
,
and
tore
,
and
had
his
fit
.
  
<EOS>
New
assurance
of
the
truth
came
upon
him
in
the
next
few
following
days
,
when
it
was
put
forth
how
the
wounded
man
had
been
married
on
his
bed
,
and
to
whom
,
and
how
,
though
always
in
a
dangerous
condition
,
he
was
a
shade
better
.
<EOS>
Bradley
would
far
rather
have
been
seized
for
his
murder
,
than
he
would
have
read
that
passage
,
knowing
himself
spared
,
and
knowing
why
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
not
to
be
still
further
defrauded
and
overreached
---
which
he
would
be
,
if
implicated
by
Riderhood
,
and
punished
by
the
law
for
his
abject
failure
,
as
though
it
had
been
a
success
---
he
kept
close
in
his
school
during
the
day
,
ventured
out
warily
at
night
,
and
went
no
more
to
the
railway
station
.
<EOS>
He
examined
the
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
for
any
sign
that
Riderhood
acted
on
his
hinted
threat
of
so
summoning
him
to
renew
their
acquaintance
,
but
found
none
.
<EOS>
Having
paid
him
handsomely
for
the
support
and
accommodation
he
had
had
at
the
Lock
House
,
and
knowing
him
to
be
a
very
ignorant
man
who
could
not
write
,
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
was
to
be
feared
at
all
,
or
whether
they
need
ever
meet
again
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
his
mind
was
never
off
the
rack
,
and
his
raging
sense
of
having
been
made
to
fling
himself
across
the
chasm
which
divided
those
two
,
and
bridge
it
over
for
their
coming
together
,
never
cooled
down
.
<EOS>
This
horrible
condition
brought
on
other
fits
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
said
how
many
,
or
when
;
but
he
saw
in
the
faces
of
his
pupils
that
they
had
seen
him
in
that
state
,
and
that
they
were
possessed
by
a
dread
of
his
relapsing
.
  
<EOS>
One
winter
day
when
a
slight
fall
of
snow
was
feathering
the
sills
and
frames
of
the
schoolroom
windows
,
he
stood
at
his
black
board
,
crayon
in
hand
,
about
to
commence
with
a
class
;
when
,
reading
in
the
countenances
of
those
boys
that
there
was
something
wrong
,
and
that
they
seemed
in
alarm
for
him
,
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
door
towards
which
they
faced
.
<EOS>
He
then
saw
a
slouching
man
of
forbidding
appearance
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
school
,
with
a
bundle
under
his
arm
;
and
saw
that
it
was
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
on
a
stool
which
one
of
his
boys
put
for
him
,
and
he
had
a
passing
knowledge
that
he
was
in
danger
of
falling
,
and
that
his
face
was
becoming
distorted
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
fit
went
off
for
that
time
,
and
he
wiped
his
mouth
,
and
stood
up

"
Beg
your

governor

By

"
said
Riderhood
,
knuckling
his
forehead
,
with
a
chuckle
and
a
leer
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
place
may
this
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
school
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
young
folks
learns
wot
's
right

said
Riderhood
gravely
nodding
.
<EOS>
"
Beg
your
pardon

governor

<EOS>
By
your
leave

<EOS>
But
who
teaches
this
school

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do

<EOS>
"
You
're

are
you

"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes

<EOS>
I
am
the
master

<EOS>
"
  
"
And
a
lovely
thing
it
must
be

"
said
Riderhood
,
"
fur
to
learn
young
folks
<EOS>
wot
's
right
,
and
fur
to
know
wot
<EOS>
they
know

wot
<EOS>
you

Beg
your

---
<EOS>
That
there
black
board
;
wot
's
it
for
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
for
drawing
on
,
or
writing
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
though
!
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Who
'd
have
thought
it
,
from
the
locks
on
it
!
<EOS>
Would
you
be
so
kind
as
write
your
name
upon
it
,
learned
governor
?
"
<EOS>
(
in
a
wheedling
tone
.
)
  
<EOS>
Bradley
hesitated
for
a
moment
;
but
placed
his
usual
signature
,
enlarged
,
upon
the
board
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ai
n't
a
learned
character
myself
,
"
said
Riderhood
surveying
the
class
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
do
admire
learning
in
others
.
<EOS>
I
should
dearly
like
to
hear
these
here
young
folks
read
that
there
name
off
,
from
the
writing
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
arms
of
the
class
went
up
.
<EOS>
At
the
miserable
master
's
nod
,
the
shrill
chorus
arose
:
"
Bradley
Headstone
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
cried
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
it
?
<EOS>
Headstone
!
<EOS>
Why
,
that
's
in
a
churchyard
.
<EOS>
Hooroar
for
another
turn
!
"
  
<EOS>
Another
tossing
of
arms
,
another
nod
,
and
another
shrill
chorus
:
"
Bradley
Headstone
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
it
now
!
"
<EOS>
said
Riderhood
,
after
attentively
listening
,
and
internally
repeating
:
"
Bradley
.
<EOS>
I
see
.
<EOS>
Chris'en
name
,
Bradley
sim'lar
to
Roger
which
is
my

<EOS>
Eh

<EOS>
Fam'ly
name
,
Headstone
,
sim'lar
to
Riderhood
which
is
my
own

<EOS>
Eh
?
"
  
Shrill
chorus
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Might
you
be
acquainted
,
learned
governor
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
"
with
a
person
of
about
your
own
height
and
breadth
,
and
wot
'
ud
pull
down
in
a
scale
about
your
own
weight
,
answering
to
a
name
sounding
summat
like
Totherest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
desperation
in
him
that
made
him
perfectly
quiet
,
though
his
jaw
was
heavily
squared
;
with
his
eyes
upon
Riderhood
:
and
with
traces
of
quickened
breathing
in
his
nostrils
;
the
schoolmaster
replied
,
in
a
suppressed
voice
,
after
a
pause
:
"
<EOS>
I
think
I
know
the
man
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
knowed
the
man
I
mean
,
learned
governor

<EOS>
I
want
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
half
glance
around
him
at
his
pupils
,
Bradley
returned
:
"
<EOS>
Do
you
suppose
he
is
here
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Begging
your
pardon
,
learned
governor
,
and
by
your
leave
<EOS>
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
with
a
laugh
,
"
how
could
I
suppose
he
's
here
,
when
there
's
nobody
here

but
you
,
and
me
,
and
these
young
lambs
<EOS>
wot
<EOS>
you
're
a
learning
on

<EOS>
But
he
is
most
excellent
company

that
man

I
want
him
to

see
me
at
my
Lock

up
the

"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
him
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
D'ye

he
'll

"
asked
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
he
will
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Having
got
your
word
for
him

"
said
Riderhood
,
"
I
shall
count
upon
him

P'raps

so

<EOS>
"
He
shall
know
it

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thankee
.
<EOS>
As
I
says
a
while
ago
,
"
pursued
Riderhood
,
changing
his
hoarse
tone
and
leering
round
upon
the
class
again
,
"
though
not
a
learned
character
<EOS>
my
own
self
,
I
do
admire
learning
in
others

to
be
sure

<EOS>
Being
here
and
having
met
with
your
kind
attention
,
Master
,
might
I
,
afore
I
go
,
ask
a
question
of
these
here
young
lambs
of
yourn

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
in
the
way
of
school
,
"
said
Bradley
,
always
sustaining
his
dark
look
at
the
other
,
and
speaking
in
his
suppressed
voice
,
"
you
may
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
It
's
in
the
way
of
school
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pound
it
,
Master
,
to
be
in
the
way
of
school

<EOS>
Wot
's
the
diwisions
of
water
,
my
lambs

<EOS>
Wot
sorts
of
water
is
there
on
the
land
?
"
  
<EOS>
Shrill
chorus
:
"
Seas
,
rivers
,
lakes
,
and
ponds
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Seas
,
rivers
,
lakes
,
and
ponds

"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
They
've
got
all
the
lot
,
Master
!
<EOS>
Blowed
if
I
should
n't
have
left
out
lakes

never
having
clapped
eyes
upon

Seas

it

lambs

as
they
ketches

"
  
<EOS>
Shrill
chorus
(
with
some
contempt
for
the
ease
of
the
question
)
:
"
Fish
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
a
-
gin
!
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
But
wot
else
is
it
,
my
lambs
,
as
they
sometimes
ketches
in
rivers
?
"
  
<EOS>
Chorus
at
a
loss
.
<EOS>
One
shrill
voice
:
"
Weed
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
agin
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
ai
n't
weed
neither
.
<EOS>
You
'll
never
guess
,
my
dears

<EOS>
Wot
is
it
,
besides
fish
,
as
they
sometimes
ketches
in
rivers
?
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
.
<EOS>
It
's
suits
o
'
clothes
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
's
face
changed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leastways
,
lambs
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
observing
him
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
<EOS>
,
"
that
's
wot
<EOS>
I
my
own
self
sometimes
ketches
in
rivers
.
<EOS>
For
strike
me
blind
,
my
lambs
,
if
I
did
n't
ketch
in
a
river
the
wery
bundle
under
my
arm
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
class
looked
at
the
master
,
as
if
appealing
from
the
irregular
entrapment
of
this
mode
of
examination
.
<EOS>
The
master
looked
at
the
examiner
,
as
if
he
would
have
torn
him
to
pieces
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
your
pardon
,
learned
governor
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
smearing
his
sleeve
across
his
mouth
as
he
laughed
with
a
relish
,
"
tain't
<EOS>
fair
to
the
lambs
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
It
wos
a
bit
of
fun
of
mine
.
<EOS>
But
upon
my
soul
!
<EOS>
I
drawed
this
here
bundle
out
of
a
river
!
<EOS>
It
's
a
Bargeman
's
suit
of
clothes
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
it
had
been
sunk
there
by
the
man
as
wore
it
,
and
I
got
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
it
was
sunk
by
the
man
who
wore
it
?
"
asked
Bradley
.
  
<EOS>
"
'Cause
I
see
him
do
it
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
  
<EOS>
They
looked
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
Bradley
,
slowly
withdrawing
his
eyes
,
turned
his
face
to
the
black
board
and
slowly
wiped
his
name
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
heap
of
thanks
,
Master
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
"
for
bestowing
so
much
of
your
time
,
and
of
the
lambses
'
time
,
upon
a
man
as
has
n't
got
no
other
recommendation
to
you
than
being
a
honest
man
.
<EOS>
Wishing
to
see
at
my
Lock
up
the
river
,
the
person
as
we
've
spoke
of
,
and
as
you
've
answered
for
,
I
takes
my
leave
of
the
lambs
and
of
their
learned
governor
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
,
he
slouched
out
of
the
school
,
leaving
the
master
to
get
through
his
weary
work
as
he
might
,
and
leaving
the
whispering
pupils
to
observe
the
master
's
face
until
he
fell
into
the
fit
which
had
been
long
impending
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
but
one
was
Saturday
,
and
a
holiday
.
<EOS>
Bradley
rose
early
,
and
set
out
on
foot
for
Plashwater
Weir
Mill
Lock
.
<EOS>
He
rose
so
early
that
it
was
not
yet
light
when
he
began
his
journey
.
<EOS>
Before
extinguishing
the
candle
by
which
he
had
dressed
himself
,
he
made
a
little
parcel
of
his
decent
silver
watch
and
its
decent
guard
,
and
wrote
inside
the
paper
:
"
Kindly
take
care
of
these
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
addressed
the
parcel
to
Miss
Peecher
,
and
left
it
on
the
most
protected
corner
of
the
little
seat
in
her
little
porch
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
cold
hard
easterly
morning
when
he
latched
the
garden
gate
and
turned
away
.
<EOS>
The
light
snowfall
which
had
feathered
his
schoolroom
windows
on
the
Thursday
,
still
lingered
in
the
air
,
and
was
falling
white
,
while
the
wind
blew
black
.
<EOS>
The
tardy
day
did
not
appear
until
he
had
been
on
foot
two
hours
,
and
had
traversed
a
great
part
of
London
from
east
to
west
.
<EOS>
Such
breakfast
as
he
had
,
he
took
at
the
comfortless
public
-
house
where
he
had
parted
from
Riderhood
on
the
occasion
of
their
night
-
walk
.
<EOS>
He
took
it
,
standing
at
the
littered
bar
,
and
looked
loweringly
at
a
man
who
stood
where
Riderhood
had
stood
that
early
morning
.
  
<EOS>
He
outwalked
the
short
day
,
and
was
on
the
towing
-
path
by
the
river
,
somewhat
footsore
,
when
the
night
closed
in
.
<EOS>
Still
two
or
three
miles
short
of
the
Lock
,
he
slackened
his
pace
then
,
but
went
steadily
on
.
<EOS>
The
ground
was
now
covered
with
snow
,
though
thinly
,
and
there
were
floating
lumps
of
ice
in
the
more
exposed
parts
of
the
river
,
and
broken
sheets
of
ice
under
the
shelter
of
the
banks
.
<EOS>
He
took
heed
of
nothing
<EOS>
but
the
ice
,
the
snow
,
and
the
distance
,
until
he
saw
a
light
ahead
,
which
he
knew
gleamed
from
the
Lock
House
window
.
<EOS>
It
arrested
his
steps
,
and
he
looked
all
around
.
<EOS>
The
ice
,
and
the
snow
,
and
he
,
and
the
one
light
,
had
absolute
possession
of
the
dreary
scene
.
<EOS>
In
the
distance
before
him
,
lay
the
place
where
he
had
struck
the
worse
than
useless
blows
that
mocked
him
with
Lizzie
's
presence
there
as
Eugene
's
wife
.
<EOS>
In
the
distance
behind
him
,
lay
the
place
where
the
children
with
pointing
arms
had
seemed
to
devote
him
to
the
demons
in
crying
out
his
name
.
<EOS>
Within
there
,
where
the
light
was
,
was
the
man
who
as
to
both
distances
could
give
him
up
to
ruin
.
<EOS>
To
these
limits
had
his
world
shrunk
.
  
<EOS>
He
mended
his
pace
,
keeping
his
eyes
upon
the
light
with
a
strange
intensity
,
as
if
he
were
taking
aim
at
it
.
<EOS>
When
he
approached
it
so
nearly
as
that
it
parted
into
rays
,
they
seemed
to
fasten
themselves
to
him
and
draw
him
on
.
<EOS>
When
he
struck
the
door
with
his
hand
,
his
foot
followed
so
quickly
on
his
hand
,
that
he
was
in
the
room
before
he
was
bidden
to
enter
.
  
<EOS>
The
light
was
the
joint
product
of
a
fire
and
a
candle
.
<EOS>
Between
the
two
,
with
his
feet
on
the
iron
fender
,
sat
Riderhood
,
pipe
in
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
up
with
a
surly
nod
when
his
visitor
came
in
.
<EOS>
His
visitor
looked
down
with
a
surly
nod
.
<EOS>
His
outer
clothing
removed
,
the
visitor
then
took
a
seat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
smoker
,
I
think
?
"
said
Riderhood
,
pushing
a
bottle
to
him
across
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
both
lapsed
into
silence
,
with
their
eyes
upon
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
need
to
be
told
I
am
here
,
"
said
Bradley
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
begin
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
begin
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
"
when
I
've
smoked
this
here
pipe
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
finished
it
with
great
deliberation
,
knocked
out
the
ashes
on
the
hob
,
and
put
it
by
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
begin
,
"
he
then
repeated
,
"
Bradley
Headstone
,
Master
,
if
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wish
it
?
<EOS>
I
wish
to
know
what
you
want
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
shall
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Riderhood
had
looked
hard
at
his
hands
and
his
pockets
,
apparently
as
a
precautionary
measure
lest
he
should
have
any
weapon
about
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
he
now
leaned
forward
,
turning
the
collar
of
his
waistcoat
with
an
inquisitive
finger
,
and
asked
,
"
Why
,
where
's
your

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
left
it
behind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
can
be
fetched
.
<EOS>
I
've
took
a
fancy
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
answered
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
it
,
"
repeated
Riderhood
,
in
a
louder
voice
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
mean
to
have
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
what
you
want
of
me
,
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
still
louder
;
"
it
's
on'y
part
of
what
I
want
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
want
money
of
you
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Anything
else
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Everything
else
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Riderhood
,
in
a
very
loud
and
furious
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Answer
me
like
that
,
and
I
wo
n't
talk
to
you
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
looked
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
so
much
as
look
at
me
like
that
,
or
I
wo
n't
talk
to
you
at
all
,
"
vociferated
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
instead
of
talking
,
I
'll
bring
my
hand
down
upon
you
with
all
its
weight
,
"
heavily
smiting
the
table
with
great
force
,
"
and
smash
you
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
"
said
Bradley
,
after
moistening
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
!
<EOS>
I
'm
a
going
on
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
fear
<EOS>
but
I
'll
go
on
full
-
fast
enough
for
you
,
and
fur
enough
for
you
,
without
your
telling
.
<EOS>
Look
here
,
Bradley
Headstone
,
Master
.
<EOS>
You
might
have
split
the
T'other
governor
to
chips
and
wedges
,
without
my
caring
,
except
that
I
might
have
come
upon
you
for
a
glass
or
so
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
Else
why
have
to
do
with
you
at
all
?
<EOS>
But
when
you
copied
my
clothes
,
and
when
you
copied
my
neckhankercher
,
and
when
you
shook
blood
upon
me
after
you
had
done
the
trick
,
you
did
wot
<EOS>
I
'll
be
paid
for
and
paid
heavy
for
.
<EOS>
If
it
come
to
be
throw'd
upon
you
,
you
was
to
be
ready
to
throw
it
upon
me
,
was
you
?
<EOS>
Where
else
but
in
Plashwater
Weir
Mill
Lock
was
there
a
man
dressed
according
as
described
?
<EOS>
Where
else
but
in
Plashwater
Weir
Mill
Lock
was
there
a
man
as
had
had
words
with
him
coming
through
in
his
boat
?
<EOS>
Look
at
the
Lock
-
keeper
in
Plashwater
Weir
Mill
Lock
,
in
them
same
answering
clothes
and
with
that
same
answering
red
neckhankercher
,
and
see
whether
his
clothes
happens
to
be
bloody
or
not
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
they
do
happen
to
be
bloody
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
you
sly
devil
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
,
very
white
,
sat
looking
at
him
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
two
could
play
at
your
game
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
snapping
his
fingers
at
him
half
a
dozen
times
,
"
and
I
played
it
long
ago
:
<EOS>
long
afore
you
tried
your
clumsy
hand
at
it
;
in
days
when
you
had
n't
begun
croaking
your
lecters
or
what
not
in
your
school
.
<EOS>
I
know
to
a
figure
how
you
done
it
.
<EOS>
Where
you
stole
away
,
I
could
steal
away
arter
you
,
and
do
it
knowinger
than
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
how
you
come
away
from
London
in
your
own
clothes
,
and
where
you
changed
your
clothes
,
and
hid
your
clothes
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
with
my
own
eyes
take
your
own
clothes
from
their
hiding
-
place
among
them
felled
trees
,
and
take
a
dip
in
the
river
to
account
for
your
dressing
yourself
,
to
any
one
as
might
come
by
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
rise
up
Bradley
Headstone
,
Master
,
where
you
sat
down
Bargeman
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
pitch
your
Bargeman
's
bundle
into
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
hocked
your
Bargeman
's
bundle
out
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
your
Bargeman
's
clothes
,
tore
this
way
and
that
way
with
the
scuffle
,
stained
green
with
the
grass
,
and
spattered
all
over
the
with
what
bust
from
the
blows
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
them
,
and
I
've
got
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
a
curse
for
the
T'other
governor
,
alive
or
dead
,
but
I
care
a
many
curses
for
my
own
self
.
<EOS>
And
as
you
laid
your
plots
again
me
and
was
a
sly
again
me
,
I
'll
be
paid
for
it
<EOS>
---
I
'll
be
paid
for
it
---
I
'll
be
paid
for
it
---
till
I
've
drained
you
dry
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
looked
at
the
fire
,
with
a
working
face
,
and
was
silent
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
with
what
seemed
an
inconsistent
composure
of
voice
and
feature
:
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
get
blood
out
of
a
stone
,
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
get
money
out
of
a
schoolmaster
though
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
get
out
of
me
what
is
not
in
me
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
wrest
from
me
what
I
have
not
got
.
<EOS>
Mine
is
but
a
poor
calling
.
<EOS>
You
have
had
more
than
two
guineas
from
me
,
already
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
how
long
it
has
taken
me
(
allowing
for
a
long
and
arduous
training
)
to
earn
such
a
sum
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
nor
I
do
n't
care
.
<EOS>
Yours
is
a
'
spectable
calling
.
<EOS>
To
save
your
'
spectability
,
it
's
worth
your
while
to
pawn
every
article
of
clothes
you
've
got
,
sell
every
stick
in
your
house
,
and
beg
and
borrow
every
penny
you
can
get
trusted
with
.
<EOS>
When
you
've
done
that
and
handed
over
,
I
'll
leave
you
.
<EOS>
Not
afore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
mean
,
you
'll
leave
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
as
I
'll
keep
you
company
,
wherever
you
go
,
when
you
go
away
from
here
.
<EOS>
Let
the
Lock
take
care
of
itself
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
care
of
you
,
once
I
've
got
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
again
looked
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Eyeing
him
aside
,
Riderhood
took
up
his
pipe
,
refilled
it
,
lighted
it
,
and
sat
smoking
.
<EOS>
Bradley
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
his
head
upon
his
hands
,
and
looked
at
the
fire
with
a
most
intent
abstraction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Riderhood
,
"
he
said
,
raising
himself
in
his
chair
,
after
a
long
silence
,
and
drawing
out
his
purse
and
putting
it
on
the
table
.
"
<EOS>
Say
I
part
with
this
,
which
is
all
the
money
I
have
;
say
I
let
you
have
my
watch
;
say
that
every
quarter
,
when
I
draw
my
salary
,
I
pay
you
a
certain
portion
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
nothink
of
the
sort
,
"
retorted
Riderhood
,
shaking
his
head
as
he
smoked
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
away
once
,
and
I
wo
n't
run
the
chance
agin
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
trouble
enough
to
find
you
,
and
should
n't
have
found
you
,
if
I
had
n't
seen
you
slipping
along
the
street
over
-
night
,
and
watched
you
till
you
was
safe
housed
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
one
settlement
with
you
for
good
and
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Riderhood
,
I
am
a
man
who
has
lived
a
retired
life
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
resources
beyond
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
absolutely
no
friends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
lie
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
one
friend
as
I
knows
of
;
one
as
is
good
for
a
Savings
-
Bank
book
,
or
I
'm
a
blue
monkey
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
's
face
darkened
,
and
his
hand
slowly
closed
on
the
purse
and
drew
it
back
,
as
he
sat
listening
for
what
the
other
should
go
on
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
went
into
the
wrong
shop
,
fust
,
last
Thursday
,
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Found
myself
among
the
young
ladies
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
Over
the
young
ladies
,
I
see
a
Missis
.
<EOS>
That
Missis
is
sweet
enough
upon
you
,
Master
,
to
sell
herself
up
,
slap
,
to
get
you
out
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
Make
her
do
it
then
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
stared
at
him
so
very
suddenly
that
Riderhood
,
not
quite
knowing
how
to
take
it
,
affected
to
be
occupied
with
the
encircling
smoke
from
his
pipe
;
fanning
it
away
with
his
hand
,
and
blowing
it
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
spoke
to
the
mistress
,
did
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Bradley
,
with
that
former
composure
of
voice
and
feature
that
seemed
inconsistent
,
and
with
averted
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poof
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
withdrawing
his
attention
from
the
smoke
.
<EOS>
"
I
spoke
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
say
much
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
put
in
a
fluster
by
my
dropping
in
among
the
young
ladies
<EOS>
(
I
never
did
set
up
for
a
lady
's
man
)
,
and
she
took
me
into
her
parlour
to
hope
as
there
was
nothink
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
tells
her
,
`
`
O
no
,
nothink
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
master
's
my
wery
good
friend
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
I
see
how
the
land
laid
,
and
that
she
was
comfortable
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
put
the
purse
in
his
pocket
,
grasped
his
left
wrist
with
his
right
hand
,
and
sat
rigidly
contemplating
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
could
n't
live
more
handy
to
you
than
she
does
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
"
and
when
I
goes
home
with
you
(
as
of
course
I
am
a
going
)
<EOS>
,
I
recommend
you
to
clean
her
out
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
You
can
marry
her
,
arter
you
and
me
have
come
to
a
settlement
.
<EOS>
She
's
nice
-
looking
,
and
I
know
you
ca
n't
be
keeping
company
with
no
one
else
,
having
been
so
lately
disapinted
in
another
quarter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Not
one
other
word
did
Bradley
utter
all
that
night
.
<EOS>
Not
once
did
he
change
his
attitude
,
or
loosen
his
hold
upon
his
wrist
.
<EOS>
Rigid
before
the
fire
,
as
if
it
were
a
charmed
flame
that
was
turning
him
old
,
he
sat
,
with
the
dark
lines
deepening
in
his
face
,
its
stare
becoming
more
and
more
haggard
,
its
surface
turning
whiter
and
whiter
as
if
it
were
being
overspread
with
ashes
,
and
the
very
texture
and
colour
of
his
hair
degenerating
.
  
<EOS>
Not
until
the
late
daylight
made
the
window
transparent
,
did
this
decaying
statue
move
.
<EOS>
Then
it
slowly
arose
,
and
sat
in
the
window
looking
out
.
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
had
kept
his
chair
all
night
.
<EOS>
In
the
earlier
part
of
the
night
he
had
muttered
twice
or
thrice
that
it
was
bitter
cold
;
or
that
the
fire
burnt
fast
,
when
he
got
up
to
mend
it
;
but
,
as
he
could
elicit
from
his
companion
neither
sound
nor
movement
,
he
had
afterwards
held
his
peace
.
<EOS>
He
was
making
some
disorderly
preparations
for
coffee
,
when
Bradley
came
from
the
window
and
put
on
his
outer
coat
and
hat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
n't
us
better
have
a
bit
o
'
<EOS>
breakfast
afore
we
start
?
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
good
to
freeze
a
empty
stomach
,
Master
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
a
sign
to
show
that
he
heard
,
Bradley
walked
out
of
the
Lock
House
.
<EOS>
Catching
up
from
the
table
a
piece
of
bread
,
and
taking
his
Bargeman
's
bundle
under
his
arm
,
Riderhood
immediately
followed
him
.
<EOS>
Bradley
turned
towards
London
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
caught
him
up
,
and
walked
at
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
men
trudged
on
,
side
by
side
,
in
silence
,
full
three
miles
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
Bradley
turned
to
retrace
his
course
.
<EOS>
Instantly
,
Riderhood
turned
likewise
,
and
they
went
back
side
by
side
.
  
<EOS>
Bradley
re
-
entered
the
Lock
House
.
<EOS>
So
did
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
Bradley
sat
down
in
the
window
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
warmed
himself
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
After
an
hour
or
more
,
Bradley
abruptly
got
up
again
,
and
again
went
out
,
but
this
time
turned
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
was
close
after
him
,
caught
him
up
in
a
few
paces
,
and
walked
at
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
This
time
,
as
before
,
when
he
found
his
attendant
not
to
be
shaken
off
,
Bradley
suddenly
turned
back
.
<EOS>
This
time
,
as
before
,
Riderhood
turned
back
along
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
,
not
this
time
,
as
before
,
did
they
go
into
the
Lock
House
,
for
Bradley
<EOS>
came
to
a
stand
on
the
snow
-
covered
turf
by
the
Lock
,
looking
up
the
river
and
down
the
river
.
<EOS>
Navigation
was
impeded
by
the
frost
,
and
the
scene
was
a
mere
white
and
yellow
desert
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
Master
,
"
urged
Riderhood
,
at
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
is
a
dry
game
.
<EOS>
And
where
's
the
good
of
it
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
get
rid
of
me
,
except
by
coming
to
a
settlement
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
going
along
with
you
wherever
you
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
a
word
of
reply
,
Bradley
passed
quickly
from
him
over
the
wooden
bridge
on
the
lock
gates
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
there
's
even
less
sense
in
this
move
than
t'other
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
following
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Weir
's
there
,
and
you
'll
have
to
come
back
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Without
taking
the
least
notice
,
Bradley
leaned
his
body
against
a
post
,
in
a
resting
attitude
,
and
there
rested
with
his
eyes
cast
down
.
"
<EOS>
Being
brought
here
,
"
said
Riderhood
,
gruffly
,
"
I
'll
turn
it
to
some
use
by
changing
my
gates
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
a
rattle
and
a
rush
of
water
,
he
then
swung
-
to
the
lock
gates
that
were
standing
open
,
before
opening
the
others
.
<EOS>
So
,
both
sets
of
gates
were
,
for
the
moment
,
closed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'd
better
by
far
be
reasonable
,
Bradley
Headstone
,
Master
,
"
 
said
Riderhood
,
passing
him
,
"
or
<EOS>
I
'll
drain
you
all
the
dryer
for
it
,
when
we
do
settle
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Would
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
had
caught
him
round
the
body
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
girdled
with
an
iron
ring
.
<EOS>
They
were
on
the
brink
of
the
Lock
,
about
midway
between
the
two
sets
of
gates
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
go
!
"
<EOS>
said
Riderhood
,
"
or
I
'll
get
my
knife
out
and
slash
you
wherever
I
can
cut
you
.
<EOS>
Let
go
!
"
  
<EOS>
Bradley
was
drawing
to
the
Lock
-
edge
.
<EOS>
Riderhood
was
drawing
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
strong
grapple
,
and
a
fierce
struggle
,
arm
and
leg
.
<EOS>
Bradley
got
him
round
,
with
his
back
to
the
Lock
,
and
still
worked
him
backward
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
go
!
"
said
Riderhood
.
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
<EOS>
What
are
you
trying
at
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
drown
Me
.
<EOS>
Ai
n't
I
told
you
that
the
man
as
has
come
through
drowning
can
never
be
drowned
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
be
drowned
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
be
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Bradley
,
in
a
desperate
,
clenched
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
resolved
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
'll
hold
you
living
,
and
I
'll
hold
you
dead

<EOS>
Come
down
!
"
  
<EOS>
Riderhood
went
over
into
the
smooth
pit
,
backward
,
and
Bradley
Headstone
upon
him
.
<EOS>
When
the
two
were
found
,
lying
under
the
ooze
and
scum
behind
one
of
the
rotting
gates
,
Riderhood
's
hold
had
relaxed
,
probably
in
falling
,
and
his
eyes
were
staring
upward
.
<EOS>
But
,
he
was
girdled
still
with
Bradley
's
iron
ring
,
and
the
rivets
of
the
iron
ring
held
tight
.
   
<EOS>
PERSONS
AND
THINGS
IN
GENERAL
.
 
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Harmon
's
first
delightful
occupation
was
,
to
set
all
matters
right
that
had
strayed
in
any
way
wrong
,
or
that
might
,
could
,
would
,
or
should
,
have
strayed
in
any
way
wrong
,
while
their
name
was
in
abeyance
.
<EOS>
In
tracing
out
affairs
for
which
John
's
fictitious
death
was
to
be
considered
in
any
way
responsible
,
they
used
a
very
broad
and
free
construction
;
regarding
,
for
instance
,
the
dolls
'
dressmaker
as
having
a
claim
on
their
protection
,
because
of
her
association
with
Mrs.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
and
because
of
Mrs.
Eugene
's
old
association
,
in
her
turn
,
with
the
dark
side
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
It
followed
that
the
old
man
,
Riah
,
as
a
good
and
serviceable
friend
to
both
,
was
not
to
be
disclaimed
.
<EOS>
Nor
even
Mr.
Inspector
,
as
having
been
trepanned
into
an
industrious
hunt
on
a
false
scent
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
remarked
,
in
connexion
with
that
worthy
officer
,
that
a
rumour
shortly
afterwards
pervaded
the
Force
,
to
the
effect
that
he
had
confided
to
Miss
Abbey
Potterson
,
over
a
jug
of
mellow
flip
in
the
bar
of
the
Six
Jolly
Fellowship
Porters
,
that
he
"
did
n't
stand
to
lose
a
farthing
"
through
Mr.
Harmon
's
coming
to
life
,
but
was
quite
as
well
satisfied
as
if
that
gentleman
had
been
barbarously
murdered
,
and
he
(
Mr.
Inspector
)
had
pocketed
the
government
reward
.
  
<EOS>
In
all
their
arrangements
of
such
nature
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Harmon
derived
much
assistance
from
their
eminent
solicitor
,
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
;
who
laid
about
him
professionally
with
such
unwonted
despatch
and
intention
,
that
a
piece
of
work
was
vigorously
pursued
as
soon
as
cut
out
;
whereby
Young
Blight
was
acted
on
as
by
that
transatlantic
dram
which
is
poetically
named
An
Eye
-
Opener
,
and
found
himself
staring
at
real
clients
instead
of
out
of
window
.
<EOS>
The
accessibility
of
Riah
proving
very
useful
as
to
a
few
hints
towards
the
disentanglement
of
Eugene
's
affairs
,
Lightwood
applied
himself
with
infinite
zest
to
attacking
and
harassing
Mr.
Fledgeby
:
who
,
discovering
himself
in
danger
of
being
blown
into
the
air
by
certain
explosive
transactions
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
,
and
having
been
sufficiently
flayed
under
his
beating
,
came
to
a
parley
and
asked
for
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
harmless
Twemlow
profited
by
the
conditions
entered
into
,
though
he
little
thought
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Riah
unaccountably
melted
;
waited
in
person
on
him
over
the
stable
yard
in
Duke
Street
,
<EOS>
St.
James
's
,
no
longer
ravening
but
mild
,
to
inform
him
that
payment
of
interest
as
heretofore
,
but
henceforth
at
Mr.
Lightwood
's
offices
,
would
appease
his
Jewish
rancour
;
and
departed
with
the
secret
that
Mr.
John
Harmon
had
advanced
the
money
and
become
the
creditor
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
was
the
sublime
Snigsworth
's
wrath
averted
,
and
thus
did
he
snort
no
larger
amount
of
moral
grandeur
at
the
Corinthian
column
in
the
print
over
the
fireplace
,
than
was
normally
in
his
(
and
the
British
)
constitution
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Wilfer
's
first
visit
to
the
Mendicant
's
bride
at
the
new
abode
of
Mendicancy
,
was
a
grand
event
.
<EOS>
Pa
had
been
sent
for
into
the
City
,
on
the
very
day
of
taking
possession
,
and
had
been
stunned
with
astonishment
,
and
brought
-
to
,
and
led
about
the
house
by
one
ear
,
to
behold
its
various
treasures
,
and
had
been
enraptured
and
enchanted
.
<EOS>
Pa
had
also
been
appointed
Secretary
,
and
had
been
enjoined
to
give
instant
notice
of
resignation
to
Chicksey
,
Veneering
,
and
Stobbles
,
for
ever
and
ever
.
<EOS>
But
Ma
came
later
,
and
came
,
as
was
her
due
,
in
state
.
  
<EOS>
The
carriage
was
sent
for
Ma
,
who
entered
it
with
a
bearing
worthy
of
the
occasion
,
accompanied
,
rather
than
supported
,
by
Miss
Lavinia
,
who
altogether
declined
to
recognize
the
maternal
majesty
.
<EOS>
Mr.
George
Sampson
meekly
followed
.
<EOS>
He
was
received
in
the
vehicle
,
by
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
as
if
admitted
to
the
honor
of
assisting
at
a
funeral
in
the
family
,
and
she
then
issued
the
order
,
"
Onward
!
"
to
the
Mendicant
's
menial
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
goodness
,
Ma
,
"
said
Lavvy
,
throwing
herself
back
among
the
cushions
,
with
her
arms
crossed
,
"
that
you
'd
loll
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
!
"
repeated
Mrs.
Wilfer
.
<EOS>
"
Loll
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Ma
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
said
the
impressive
lady
,
"
I
am
incapable
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
look
so
,
Ma
.
<EOS>
But
why
one
should
go
out
to
dine
with
one
's
own
daughter
or
sister
,
as
if
one
's
under
-
petticoat
was
a
backboard
,
I
do
not
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Neither
do
I
understand
,
"
retorted
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
with
deep
scorn
,
"
how
a
young
lady
can
mention
the
garment
in
the
name
of
which
you
have
indulged
.
<EOS>
I
blush
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you

Ma

"
said
Lavvy
,
yawning
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
can
do
it
for
myself
<EOS>
,
I
am
obliged
to
you
,
when
there

any
occasion

"
  
<EOS>
Here
,
Mr.
Sampson
,
with
the
view
of
establishing
harmony
,
which
he
never
under
any
circumstances
succeeded
in
doing
,
said
with
an
agreeable
smile
:
"
After
all
,
you
know
,
ma'am
,
we
know
it
's
there

"
 
<EOS>
And
immediately
felt
that
he
had
committed
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
know
it
's
there

"
said
Mrs.
Wilfer
,
glaring
.
  
<EOS>
"
Really
,
George
,
"
remonstrated
Miss
Lavinia
,
"
I
must
say
that
I
do
n't
understand
your
allusions
,
and
that
I
think
you
might
be
more
delicate
and
less
personal
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr.
Sampson
,
becoming
,
on
the
shortest
notice
,
a
prey
to
despair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes

<EOS>
Go
it

Lavinia
Wilfer

What
you

George

by
your
omnibus

driving
expressions

I
can
not

imagine

<EOS>
Neither

said
Miss
Lavinia

"
Mr.
George
Sampson

do
I
wish

It

enough

me
to
know

heart
that
I

"
having
imprudently
got
into
a
sentence
without
providing
a
way
out
of
it
,
Miss
Lavinia
was
constrained
to
close
with
"
going
to
go
it
.
"
<EOS>
A
weak
conclusion
which
,
however
,
derived
some
appearance
of
strength
from
disdain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes

cried
Mr.
Sampson
,
with
bitterness
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
it
ever
is

I

If
you
mean

Miss
Lavvy
cut
him
short

never
brought
up

<EOS>
(
As

this
were
a
home

thrust

<EOS>
"
Lavinia

"
returned
Mr.
Sampson
,
in
a
dismal
vein
,
"
I
did
not
mean

say

<EOS>
What
I
did
mean

was

that

never
expected
to
retain
my
favoured

Why

Mr.

The

Mrs.

perceiving

here
took

Mrs.

majestically
waving

Mr.

explained

in

Mr.

slapped
his

thinks
of

When

At

it

Mr.

immediately
expressed
his
fervent

"
more
than
human
,
"
and
was
brought
upon
his
knees
at
Miss
Lavinia
's
feet
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
crowning
addition
indispensable
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
both
mother
and
daughter
,
to
bear
Mr.
Sampson
,
a
grateful
captive
,
into
the
glittering
halls
he
had
mentioned
,
and
to
parade
him
through
the
same
,
at
once
a
living
witness
of
their
glory
,
and
a
bright
instance
of
their
condescension
.
<EOS>
Ascending
the
staircase
,
Miss
Lavinia
permitted
him
to
walk
at
her
side
,
with
the
air
of
saying
:
"
Notwithstanding
all
these
surroundings
,
I
am
yours
as
yet
,
George
.
<EOS>
How
long
it
may
last
is
another
question
,
but
I
am
yours
as
yet
.
<EOS>
"
She
also
benignantly
intimated
to
him
,
aloud
,
the
nature
of
the
objects
upon
which
he
looked
,
and
to
which
he
was
unaccustomed
:
as
,
"
Exotics
,
George
,
"
"
An
aviary
,
George
,
"
"
An
ormolu
clock
,
George
,
"
and
the
like
.
<EOS>
While
,
through
the
whole
of
the
decorations
,
Mrs.
Wilfer
led
the
way
with
the
bearing
of
a
Savage
Chief
,
who
would
feel
himself
compromised
by
manifesting
the
slightest
token
of
surprise
or
admiration
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
bearing
of
this
impressive
woman
,
throughout
the
day
,
was
a
pattern
to
all
impressive
women
under
similar
circumstances
.
<EOS>
She
renewed
the
acquaintance
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
,
as
if
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
had
said
of
her
what
she
had
said
of
them
,
and
as
if
Time
alone
could
quite
wear
her
injury
out
.
<EOS>
She
regarded
every
servant
who
approached
her
,
as
her
sworn
enemy
,
expressly
intending
to
offer
her
affronts
with
the
dishes
,
and
to
pour
forth
outrages
on
her
moral
feelings
from
the
decanters
.
<EOS>
She
sat
erect
at
table
,
on
the
right
hand
of
her
son
-
in
-
law
,
as
half
suspecting
poison
in
the
viands
,
and
as
bearing
up
with
native
force
of
character
against
other
deadly
ambushes
.
<EOS>
Her
carriage
towards
Bella
was
as
a
carriage
towards
a
young
lady
of
good
position
,
whom
she
had
met
in
society
a
few
years
ago
.
<EOS>
Even
when
,
slightly
thawing
under
the
influence
of
sparkling
champagne
,
she
related
to
her
son
-
in
-
law
some
passages
of
domestic
interest
concerning
her
papa
,
she
infused
into
the
narrative
such
Arctic
suggestions
of
her
having
been
an
unappreciated
blessing
to
mankind
,
since
her
papa
's
days
,
and
also
of
that
gentleman
's
having
been
a
frosty
impersonation
of
a
frosty
race
,
as
struck
cold
to
the
very
soles
of
the
feet
of
the
hearers
.
<EOS>
The
Inexhaustible
being
produced
,
staring
,
and
evidently
intending
a
weak
and
washy
smile
shortly
,
no
sooner
beheld
her
,
than
it
was
stricken
spasmodic
and
inconsolable
.
<EOS>
When
she
took
her
leave
at
last
,
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
whether
it
was
with
the
air
of
going
to
the
scaffold
herself
,
or
of
leaving
the
inmates
of
the
house
for
immediate
execution
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
John
Harmon
enjoyed
it
all
merrily
,
and
told
his
wife
,
when
he
and
she
were
alone
,
that
her
natural
ways
had
never
seemed
so
dearly
natural
as
beside
this
foil
,
and
that
although
he
did
not
dispute
her
being
her
father
's
daughter
,
he
should
ever
remain
stedfast
in
the
faith
that
she
could
not
be
her
mother
's
.
  
<EOS>
This
visit
was
,
as
has
been
said
,
a
grand
event
.
<EOS>
Another
event
,
not
grand
but
deemed
in
the
house
a
special
one
,
occurred
at
about
the
same
period
;
and
this
was
,
the
first
interview
between
Mr.
Sloppy
and
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
The
doll
's
dressmaker
,
being
at
work
for
the
Inexhaustible
upon
a
full
-
dressed
doll
some
two
sizes
larger
than
that
young
person
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Sloppy
undertook
to
call
for
it
,
and
did
so
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
sir
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
who
was
working
at
her
bench
.
<EOS>
"
And
who
may
you
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sloppy
introduced
himself
by
name
and
buttons
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
indeed
!
"
cried
Jenny
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
looking
forward
to
knowing
you
.
<EOS>
I
heard
of
your
distinguishing
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
,
Miss
?
"
grinned
Sloppy
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
but
I
do
n't
know
how
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pitching
somebody
into
a
mud
-
cart
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
That
way
!
"
cried
Sloppy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
<EOS>
Miss.
"
And
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
us
!
"
exclaimed
Miss
Wren
,
with
a
start
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
open
your
mouth
as
wide
as
that
,
young
man
,
or
it
'll
catch
so
,
and
not
shut
again
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sloppy
opened
it
,
if
possible
,
wider
,
and
kept
it
open
until
his
laugh
was
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
're
like
the
giant
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
"
when
he
came
home
in
the
land
of
Beanstalk
,
and
wanted
Jack
for
supper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
he
good
-
looking
,
Miss
?
"
asked
Sloppy
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ugly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Her
visitor
glanced
round
the
room
---
which
had
many
comforts
in
it
now
,
that
had
not
been
in
it
before
---
and
said
:
"
This
is
a
pretty
place
,
<EOS>
Miss.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Glad
you
think
so
,
sir
,
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
think
of
Me
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
honesty
of
Mr.
Sloppy
being
severely
taxed
by
the
question
,
he
twisted
a
button
,
grinned
,
and
faltered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Out
with
it
!
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
with
an
arch
look
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
me
a
queer
little
comicality
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
shaking
her
head
at
him
after
asking
the
question
,
she
shook
her
hair
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
Sloppy
,
in
a
burst
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
lot
,
and
what
a
colour
!
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
,
with
her
usual
expressive
hitch
,
went
on
with
her
work
.
<EOS>
But
,
left
her
hair
as
it
was
;
not
displeased
by
the
effect
it
had
made
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
live
here
alone
;
do
you
,
Miss
?
"
asked
Sloppy
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Miss
Wren
,
with
a
chop
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Live
here
with
my
fairy
godmother
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
With
;
"
Mr.
Sloppy
could
n't
make
it
out
;
"
with
who
did
you
say
,
Miss
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
replied
Miss
Wren
,
more
seriously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
my
second
father
.
<EOS>
Or
with
my
first
,
for
that
matter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
she
shook
her
head
,
and
drew
a
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
known
a
poor
child
I
used
to
have
here
,
"
she
added
,
"
you
'd
have
understood
me
.
<EOS>
But
you
did
n't
,
and
you
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
All
the
better
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
been
taught
a
long
time
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
glancing
at
the
array
of
dolls
in
hand
,
"
before
you
came
to
work
so
neatly
,
Miss
,
and
<EOS>
with
such
a
pretty
taste
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
was
taught
a
stitch
,
young
man
!
"
returned
the
dressmaker
,
tossing
her
head
.
"
<EOS>
Just
gobbled
and
gobbled
,
till
I
found
out
how
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Badly
enough
at
first
,
but
better
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
here
have
I
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
in
something
of
a
self
-
reproachful
tone
,
"
been
a
learning
and
a
learning
,
and
here
has
Mr.
Boffin
been
a
paying
and
a
paying
,
ever
so
long
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
what
your
trade
is
,
"
observed
Miss
Wren
;
"
it
's
cabinet
-
making
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Sloppy
nodded
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
that
the
Mounds
is
done
with
,
it
is
,
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Miss.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
make
you
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
obliged
.
<EOS>
But
what
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
make
you
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
surveying
the
room
,
"
I
could
make
you
a
handy
set
of
nests
to
lay
the
dolls
in
.
<EOS>
Or
I
could
make
you
a
handy
little
set
of
drawers
,
to
keep
your
silks
and
threads
and
scraps
in
.
<EOS>
Or
I
could
turn
you
a
rare
handle
for
that
crutch
-
stick
,
if
it
belongs
to
him
you
call
your
father
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
belongs
to
me
,
"
returned
the
little
creature
,
with
a
quick
flush
of
her
face
and
neck
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
lame
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Sloppy
flushed
too
,
for
there
was
an
instinctive
delicacy
behind
his
buttons
,
and
his
own
hand
had
struck
it
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
perhaps
,
the
best
thing
in
the
way
of
amends
that
could
be
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
it
's
yours
,
because
I
'd
rather
ornament
it
for
you
than
for
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
Please
may
I
look
at
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Wren
was
in
the
act
of
handing
it
to
him
over
her
bench
,
when
she
paused
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
had
better
see
me
use
it
,
"
she
said
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
way
.
<EOS>
Hoppetty
,
Kicketty
,
Pep
-
peg
-
peg
.
<EOS>
Not
pretty
;
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
to
me
that
you
hardly
want
it
at
all
,
"
said
Sloppy
.
  
<EOS>
The
little
dressmaker
sat
down
again
,
and
gave
it
into
his
hand
,
saying
,
with
that
better
look
upon
her
,
and
with
a
smile
:
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
concerning
the
nests
and
the
drawers
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
after
measuring
the
handle
on
his
sleeve
,
and
softly
standing
the
stick
aside
against
the
wall
,
"
why
,
it
would
be
a
real
pleasure
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
've
heerd
tell
that
you
can
sing
most
beautiful
;
and
I
should
be
better
paid
with
a
song
than
with
any
money
,
for
I
always
loved
the
likes
of
that
,
and
often
giv
'
Mrs.
Higden
and
Johnny
a
comic
song
myself
,
with
`
`
Spoken
"
"
in
it
.
<EOS>
Though
that
's
not
your
sort
,
I
'll
wager
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
very
kind
young
man
,
"
returned
the
dressmaker
;
"
a
really
kind
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
accept
your
offer
.
<EOS>
---
I
suppose
He
wo
n't
mind
,
"
she
added
as
an
afterthought
,
shrugging
her
shoulders
;
"
and
if
he
does
,
he
may
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Meaning
him
that
you
call
your
father
,
Miss
,
"
asked
Sloppy
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
replied
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
Him
,
Him
,
Him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Him
,
him
,
him
?
"
repeated
Sloppy
;
staring
about
,
as
if
for
Him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Him
who
is
coming
to
court
and
marry
me
,
"
returned
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
how
slow
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
Him
!
"
said
Sloppy
.
<EOS>
And
seemed
to
turn
thoughtful
and
a
little
troubled
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
of
him
.
<EOS>
When
is
he
coming
,
Miss
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
question
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he
coming
from
,
Miss
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
good
gracious
,
how
can
I
tell
!
<EOS>
He
is
coming
from
somewhere
or
other
,
I
suppose
,
and
he
is
coming
some
day
or
other
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
any
more
about
him
,
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
tickled
Mr.
Sloppy
as
an
extraordinarily
good
joke
,
and
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
with
measureless
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
At
the
sight
of
him
laughing
in
that
absurd
way
,
the
doll
's
dressmaker
laughed
very
heartily
indeed
.
<EOS>
So
they
both
laughed
,
till
they
were
tired
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
there
!
"
said
Miss
Wren
.
<EOS>
"
For
goodness
'
sake
,
stop
,
Giant
,
or
I
shall
be
swallowed
up
alive
,
before
I
know
it
.
<EOS>
And
to
this
minute
you
have
n't
said
what
you
've
come
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
come
for
little
Miss
Harmonses
doll
,
"
said
Sloppy
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
as
much
,
"
remarked
Miss
Wren
,
"
and
here
is
little
Miss
Harmonses
doll
waiting
for
you
.
<EOS>
She
's
folded
up
in
silver
paper
,
you
see
,
as
if
she
was
wrapped
from
head
to
foot
in
new
Bank
notes
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
her
,
and
there
's
my
hand
,
and
thank
you
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
take
more
care
of
her
than
if
she
was
a
gold
image
,
"
said
Sloppy
,
"
and
there
's
both
my
hands
,
Miss
,
and
I
'll
soon
come
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
greatest
event
of
all
,
in
the
new
life
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Harmon
,
was
a
visit
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Eugene
Wrayburn
.
<EOS>
Sadly
wan
and
worn
was
the
once
gallant
Eugene
,
and
walked
resting
on
his
wife
's
arm
,
and
leaning
heavily
upon
a
stick
.
<EOS>
But
,
he
was
daily
growing
stronger
and
better
,
and
it
was
declared
by
the
medical
attendants
that
he
might
not
be
much
disfigured
by
-
and
-
by
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
grand
event
,
indeed
,
when
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Eugene
Wrayburn
came
to
stay
at
Mr.
and
Mrs.
John
Harmon
's
house
:
where
,
by
the
way
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
(
exquisitely
happy
,
and
daily
cruising
about
,
to
look
at
shops
,
)
were
likewise
staying
indefinitely
.
  
<EOS>
To
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
,
in
confidence
,
did
Mrs.
John
Harmon
impart
what
she
had
known
of
the
state
of
his
wife
's
affections
,
in
his
reckless
time
.
<EOS>
And
to
Mrs.
John
Harmon
,
in
confidence
,
did
Mr.
Eugene
Wrayburn
impart
that
,
please
God
,
she
should
see
how
his
wife
had
changed
him
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
make
no
protestations
,
"
said
Eugene
;
"
---
who
does
,
who
means
them
!
<EOS>
---
I
have
made
a
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
would
you
believe
,
Bella
,
"
interposed
his
wife
,
coming
to
resume
her
nurse
's
place
at
his
side
,
for
he
never
got
on
well
without
her
:
"
that
on
our
wedding
day
he
told
me
he
almost
thought
the
best
thing
he
could
do
,
was
to
die
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
I
did
n't
do
it
,
Lizzie
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
I
'll
do
that
better
thing
you
suggested
---
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
same
afternoon
,
Eugene
lying
on
his
couch
in
his
own
room
upstairs
,
Lightwood
came
to
chat
with
him
,
while
Bella
took
his
wife
out
for
a
ride
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
short
of
force
will
make
her
go
,
"
 
Eugene
had
said
;
so
,
Bella
had
playfully
forced
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
old
fellow
,
"
Eugene
began
with
Lightwood
,
reaching
up
his
hand
,
"
you
could
n't
have
come
at
a
better
time
,
for
my
mind
is
full
,
and
I
want
to
empty
it
.
<EOS>
First
,
of
my
present
,
before
I
touch
upon
my
future
.
<EOS>
M.
R.
F.
,
who
is
a
much
younger
cavalier
than
I
,
and
a
professed
admirer
of
beauty
,
was
so
affable
as
to
remark
the
other
day
(
he
paid
us
a
visit
of
two
days
up
the
river
there
,
and
much
objected
to
the
accommodation
of
the
hotel
)
,
that
Lizzie
ought
to
have
her
portrait
painted
.
<EOS>
Which
,
coming
from
M.
R.
F.
,
may
be
considered
equivalent
to
a
melodramatic
blessing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
getting
well
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Really
,
"
said
Eugene
,
"
I
mean
it
.
<EOS>
When
M.
R.
F.
said
that
,
and
followed
it
up
by
rolling
the
claret
(
for
which
he
called
,
and
I
paid
)
,
in
his
mouth
,
and
saying
,
`
`
My
dear
son
,
why
do
you
drink
this
trash
?
"
<EOS>
"
it
was
tantamount
---
in
him
---
to
a
paternal
benediction
on
our
union
,
accompanied
with
a
gush
of
tears
.
<EOS>
The
coolness
of
M.
R.
F.
is
not
to
be
measured
by
ordinary
standards
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
enough
,
"
said
Lightwood
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
all
,
"
pursued
Eugene
,
"
that
I
shall
ever
hear
from
M.
R.
F.
on
the
subject
,
and
he
will
continue
to
saunter
through
the
world
with
his
hat
on
one
side
.
<EOS>
My
marriage
being
thus
solemnly
recognized
at
the
family
altar
,
I
have
no
further
trouble
on
that
score
.
<EOS>
Next
,
you
really
have
done
wonders
for
me
,
Mortimer
,
in
easing
my
money
-
perplexities
,
and
with
such
a
guardian
and
steward
beside
me
,
as
the
preserver
of
my
life
(
I
am
hardly
strong
yet
,
you
see
,
for
I
am
not
man
enough
to
refer
to
her
without
a
trembling
voice
<EOS>
---
she
is
so
inexpressibly
dear
to
me
,
Mortimer
!
)
,
<EOS>
the
little
that
I
can
call
my
own
will
be
more
than
it
ever
has
been
.
<EOS>
It
need
be
more
,
<EOS>
for
you
know
what
it
always
has
been
in
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Worse
than
nothing
,
I
fancy
,
Eugene
.
<EOS>
My
own
small
income
<EOS>
(
I
devoutly
wish
that
my
grandfather
had
left
it
to
the
Ocean
rather
than
to
me
!
)
<EOS>
has
been
an
effective
Something
,
in
the
way
of
preventing
me
from
turning
to
at
Anything
.
<EOS>
And
I
think
yours
has
been
much
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
spake
the
voice
of
wisdom
,
"
said
Eugene
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
shepherds
both
.
<EOS>
In
turning
to
at
last
,
we
turn
to
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Let
us
say
no
more
of
that
,
for
a
few
years
to
come
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
have
had
an
idea
,
Mortimer
,
of
taking
myself
and
my
wife
to
one
of
the
colonies
,
and
working
at
my
vocation
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
lost
without
you
,
Eugene
;
but
you
may
be
right
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Eugene
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
right
.
<EOS>
Wrong
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
it
with
such
a
lively
---
almost
angry
---
flash
,
that
Mortimer
showed
himself
greatly
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
think
this
thumped
head
of
mine
is
excited
?
"
<EOS>
Eugene
went
on
,
with
a
high
look
;
"
not
so
,
believe
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
say
to
you
of
the
healthful
music
of
my
pulse
what
Hamlet
said
of
his
.
<EOS>
My
blood
is
up
,
but
wholesomely
up
,
when
I
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
!
<EOS>
Shall
I
turn
coward
to
Lizzie
,
and
sneak
away
with
her
,
as
if
I
were
ashamed
of
her
!
<EOS>
Where
would
your
friend
's
part
in
this
world
be
,
Mortimer
,
if
she
had
turned
coward
to
him
,
and
on
immeasurably
better
occasion
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Honorable
and
stanch
,
"
said
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
Eugene
---
"
  
"
And
yet
what
,
Mortimer
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
are
you
sure
that
you
might
not
feel
(
for
her
sake
<EOS>
,
I
say
for
her
sake
)
<EOS>
any
slight
coldness
towards
her
on
the
part
of
---
  
Society
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
You
and
I
may
well
stumble
at
the
word
,
"
returned
Eugene
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
we
mean
our
Tippins
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
   
DO
,
"
said
Mortimer
,
laughing
also
.
  
<EOS>
"
Faith
,
we
   
DO
!
"
<EOS>
returned
Eugene
,
with
great
animation
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
hide
behind
the
bush
and
beat
about
it
,
but
we
   
DO
!
<EOS>
Now
,
my
wife
is
something
nearer
to
my
heart
,
Mortimer
,
than
Tippins
is
,
and
I
owe
her
a
little
more
than
I
owe
to
Tippins
,
and
I
am
rather
prouder
of
her
than
I
ever
was
of
Tippins
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
I
will
fight
it
out
to
the
last
gasp
,
with
her
and
for
her
,
here
,
in
the
open
field
.
<EOS>
When
I
hide
her
,
or
strike
for
her
,
faint
-
heartedly
,
in
a
hole
or
a
corner
,
do
you
whom
I
love
next
best
upon
earth
,
tell
me
what
I
shall
most
righteously
deserve
to
be
told
:
---
that
she
would
have
done
well
to
turn
me
over
with
her
foot
that
night
when
I
lay
bleeding
to
death
,
and
spat
in
my
dastard
face
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
glow
that
shone
upon
him
as
he
spoke
the
words
,
so
irradiated
his
features
that
he
looked
,
for
the
time
,
as
though
he
had
never
been
mutilated
.
<EOS>
His
friend
responded
as
Eugene
would
have
had
him
respond
,
and
they
discoursed
of
the
future
until
Lizzie
came
back
.
<EOS>
After
resuming
her
place
at
his
side
,
and
tenderly
touching
his
hands
and
his
head
,
she
said
:
  
"
Eugene
,
dear
,
you
made
me
go
out
,
but
I
ought
to
have
stayed
with
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
more
flushed
than
you
have
been
for
many
days
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
been
doing
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
replied
Eugene
,
"
but
looking
forward
to
your
coming
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
talking
to
Mr.
Lightwood
,
"
said
Lizzie
,
turning
to
him
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
can
not
have
been
Society
that
disturbed
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Faith
,
my
dear
love
!
"
<EOS>
retorted
Eugene
,
in
his
old
airy
manner
.
<EOS>
as
he
laughed
and
kissed
her
,
"
I
rather
think
it
was
Society
though
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
word
ran
so
much
in
Mortimer
Lightwood
's
thoughts
as
he
went
home
to
the
Temple
that
night
,
that
he
resolved
to
take
a
look
at
Society
,
which
he
had
not
seen
for
a
considerable
period
.
   
<EOS>
THE
VOICE
OF
SOCIETY
.
 
<EOS>
Behoves
Mortimer
Lightwood
,
therefore
,
to
answer
a
dinner
card
from
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Veneering
requesting
the
honor
,
and
to
signify
that
Mr.
Mortimer
Lightwood
will
be
happy
to
have
the
other
honor
.
<EOS>
The
Veneerings
have
been
,
as
usual
,
indefatigably
dealing
dinner
cards
to
Society
,
and
whoever
desires
to
take
a
hand
had
best
be
quick
about
it
,
for
it
is
written
in
the
Books
of
the
Insolvent
Fates
that
Veneering
shall
make
a
resounding
smash
next
week
.
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Having
found
out
the
clue
to
that
great
mystery
how
people
can
contrive
to
live
beyond
their
means
,
and
having
over
-
jobbed
his
jobberies
as
legislator
deputed
to
the
Universe
by
the
pure
electors
of
Pocket
Breeches
,
it
shall
come
to
pass
next
week
that
Veneering
will
accept
the
Chiltern
Hundreds
,
that
the
legal
gentleman
in
Britannia
's
confidence
will
again
accept
the
Pocket
,
Breeches
Thousands
,
and
that
the
Veneerings
will
retire
to
Calais
,
there
to
live
on
Mrs.
Veneering
's
diamonds
(
in
which
Mr.
Veneering
,
as
a
good
husband
,
has
from
time
to
time
invested
considerable
sums
)
,
and
to
relate
to
Neptune
and
others
,
how
that
,
before
Veneering
retired
from
Parliament
,
the
House
of
Commons
was
composed
of
himself
and
the
six
hundred
and
fifty
-
seven
dearest
and
oldest
friends
he
had
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
shall
likewise
come
to
pass
,
at
as
nearly
as
possible
the
same
period
,
that
Society
will
discover
that
it
always
did
despise
Veneering
,
and
distrust
Veneering
,
and
that
when
it
went
to
Veneering
's
to
dinner
it
always
had
misgivings
---
though
very
secretly
at
the
time
,
it
would
seem
,
and
in
a
perfectly
private
and
confidential
manner
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
week
's
books
of
the
Insolvent
Fates
,
however
,
being
not
yet
opened
,
there
is
the
usual
rush
to
the
Veneerings
,
of
the
people
who
go
to
their
house
to
dine
with
one
another
and
not
with
them
.
<EOS>
There
is
Lady
Tippins
.
<EOS>
There
are
Podsnap
the
Great
,
and
Mrs.
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
There
is
Twemlow
.
<EOS>
There
are
Buffer
,
Boots
,
and
Brewer
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
Contractor
,
who
is
Providence
to
five
hundred
thousand
men
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
Chairman
,
travelling
three
thousand
miles
per
week
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
brilliant
genius
who
turned
the
shares
into
that
remarkably
exact
sum
of
three
hundred
and
seventy
five
thousand
pounds
,
no
shillings
,
and
nopence
.
  
<EOS>
To
whom
,
add
Mortimer
Lightwood
,
coming
in
among
them
with
a
reassumption
of
his
old
languid
air
,
founded
on
Eugene
,
and
belonging
to
the
days
when
he
told
the
story
of
the
man
from
Somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
That
fresh
fairy
,
Tippins
,
all
but
screams
at
sight
of
her
false
swain
.
<EOS>
She
summons
the
deserter
to
her
with
her
fan
;
but
the
deserter
,
predetermined
not
to
come
,
talks
Britain
with
Podsnap
.
<EOS>
Podsnap
always
talks
Britain
,
and
talks
as
if
he
were
a
sort
of
Private
Watchman
employed
,
in
the
British
interests
,
against
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
We
know
what
Russia
means
,
sir
,
"
says
Podsnap
;
"
we
know
what
France
wants
:
we
see
what
America
is
up
to
;
but
we
know
what
England
is
.
<EOS>
That
's
enough
for
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
However
,
when
dinner
is
served
,
and
Lightwood
drops
into
his
old
place
over
against
Lady
Tippins
,
she
can
be
fended
off
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Long
banished
Robinson
Crusoe
,
"
says
the
charmer
,
exchanging
salutations
,
"
how
did
you
leave
the
Island
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
says
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
It
made
no
complaint
of
being
in
pain
anywhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
,
how
did
you
leave
the
savages
?
"
asks
Lady
Tippins
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
were
becoming
civilized
when
I
left
Juan
Fernandez
,
"
says
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
they
were
eating
one
another
,
which
looked
like
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tormentor
!
<EOS>
"
returns
the
dear
young
creature
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
mean
,
and
you
trifle
with
my
impatience
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
something
,
immediately
,
about
the
married
pair
.
<EOS>
You
were
at
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Was
I
,
by
-
the
-
by
?
"
<EOS>
Mortimer
pretends
,
at
great
leisure
,
to
consider
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
was
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
was
the
bride
dressed
?
<EOS>
In
rowing
costume
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mortimer
looks
gloomy
,
and
declines
to
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
steered
herself
,
skiffed
herself
,
paddled
herself
,
larboarded
and
starboarded
herself
,
or
whatever
the
technical
term
may
be
,
to
the
ceremony
?
"
proceeds
the
playful
Tippins
.
  
<EOS>
"
However
she
got
to
it
,
she
graced
it
,
"
says
Mortimer
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Tippins
with
a
skittish
little
scream
,
attracts
the
general
attention
.
<EOS>
"
Graced
it
!
<EOS>
Take
care
of
me
if
I
faint
,
Veneering
.
<EOS>
He
means
to
tell
us
,
that
a
horrid
female
waterman
is
graceful
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
tell
you
nothing
,
Lady
Tippins
,
"
replies
Lightwood
.
<EOS>
And
keeps
his
word
by
eating
his
dinner
with
a
show
of
the
utmost
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
escape
me
in
this
way
,
you
morose
backwoods
-
man
,
"
 
retorts
Lady
Tippins
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
evade
the
question
,
to
screen
your
friend
Eugene
,
who
has
made
this
exhibition
of
himself
.
<EOS>
The
knowledge
shall
be
brought
home
to
you
that
such
a
ridiculous
affair
is
condemned
by
the
voice
of
Society
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Mrs.
Veneering
,
do
let
us
resolve
ourselves
into
a
Committee
of
the
whole
House
on
the
subject
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Veneering
,
always
charmed
by
this
rattling
sylph
,
cries
;
"
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
Do
let
us
resolve
ourselves
into
a
Committee
of
the
whole
House
!
<EOS>
So
delicious
!
"
<EOS>
Veneering
says
.
<EOS>
"
As
many
as
are
of
that
opinion
,
say
Aye
,
---
<EOS>
contrary
,
No
---
the
Ayes
have
it
.
"
<EOS>
But
nobody
takes
the
slightest
notice
of
his
joke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
I
am
Chairwoman
of
Committees
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Lady
Tippins
.
  
<EOS>
(
"
What
spirits
she
has
!
"
exclaims
Mrs.
Veneering
;
to
whom
likewise
nobody
attends
.
)
  
<EOS>
"
And
this
,
"
pursues
the
sprightly
one
,
"
is
a
Committee
of
the
whole
House
to
what
-
you
-
may
-
call
-
it
---
elicit
,
I
suppose
---
the
voice
of
Society
.
<EOS>
The
question
before
the
Committee
is
,
whether
a
young
man
of
very
fair
family
,
good
appearance
,
and
some
talent
,
makes
a
fool
or
a
wise
man
of
himself
in
marrying
a
female
waterman
,
turned
factory
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hardly
so
,
I
think
,
"
the
stubborn
Mortimer
strikes
in
.
<EOS>
"
I
take
the
question
to
be
,
whether
such
a
man
as
you
describe
,
Lady
Tippins
.
<EOS>
does
right
or
wrong
in
marrying
a
brave
woman
<EOS>
(
I
say
nothing
of
her
beauty
)
,
who
has
saved
his
life
,
with
a
wonderful
energy
and
address
;
whom
he
knows
to
be
virtuous
,
and
possessed
of
remarkable
qualities
;
whom
he
has
long
admired
,
and
who
is
deeply
attached
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
excuse
me
,
"
says
Podsnap
,
with
his
temper
and
his
shirtcollar
about
equally
rumpled
;
"
was
this
young
woman
ever
a
female
waterman
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
.
<EOS>
But
she
sometimes
rowed
in
a
boat
with
her
father
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
General
sensation
against
the
young
woman
.
<EOS>
Brewer
shakes
his
head
.
<EOS>
Boots
shakes
his
head

<EOS>
Buffer
shakes
his

<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Mr.
Lightwood

was
she
ever

pursues
Podsnap
,
with
his
indignation
rising
high
into
those
hair
-
brushes
of
his
,
"
a
factory
girl
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Never
,
But
she
had
some
employment
in
a
paper
mill
,
I
believe
.

General

repeated

<EOS>
Brewer
says
,
"

Boots

"
Oh

<EOS>
Buffer
says

"
Oh

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
,
in
a
rumbling
tone
of
protest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
all
I
have
to
say
is
,
"
returns
Podsnap
,
putting
the
thing
away
with
his
right
arm
,
"
that
my
gorge
rises
against
such
a
marriage
---
that
it
offends
and
disgusts
me

<EOS>
that
it
makes
me
sick

and
that
I
desire
to
know
no
more
about
it

<EOS>
(
"
Now
I
wonder
,

thinks
Mortimer

amused

"
whether

<EOS>
Your

just
sat
down

<EOS>
Mrs.
Podsnap
is
of
opinion
that
in
these
matters
there
should
be
an
equality
of
station
and
fortune
,
and
that
a
man
accustomed
to
Society
should
look
out
for
a
woman
accustomed
to
Society
and
capable
of
bearing
her
part
in
it
with
---
an
ease
and
elegance
of
carriage
---
  
that
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Podsnap
stops
there
,
delicately
intimating
that
every
such
man
should
look
out
for
a
fine
woman
as
nearly
resembling
herself
as
he
may
hope
to
discover
.
  
<EOS>
(
"
Now
I
wonder
,
"
thinks
Mortimer
,
"
whether
you
are
the
Voice
!
"
<EOS>
)
  
<EOS>
Lady
Tippins
next
canvasses
the
Contractor
,
of
five
hundred
thousand
power
.
<EOS>
It
appears
to
this
potentate
,
that
what
the
man
in
question
should
have
done
,
would
have
been
,
to
buy
the
young
woman
a
boat
and
a
small
annuity
,
and
set
her
up
for
herself
.
<EOS>
These
things
are
a
question
of
beefsteaks
and
porter
.
<EOS>
You
buy
the
young
woman
a
boat
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
You
buy
her
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
small
annuity
.
<EOS>
You
speak
of
that
annuity
in
pounds
sterling
,
but
it
is
in
reality
so
many
pounds
of
beefsteaks
and
so
many
pints
of
porter
.
<EOS>
On
the
one
hand
,
the
young
woman
has
the
boat
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
.
<EOS>
she
consumes
so
many
pounds
of
beefsteaks
and
so
many
pints
of
porter
.
<EOS>
Those
beefsteaks
and
that
porter
are
the
fuel
to
that
young
woman
's
engine
.
<EOS>
She
derives
therefrom
a
certain
amount
of
power
to
row
the
boat
;
that
power
will
produce
so
much
money
;
you
add
that
to
the
small
annuity
;
and
thus
you
get
at
the
young
woman
's
income
.
<EOS>
That
(
it
seems
to
the
Contractor
)
is
the
way
of
looking
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
fair
enslaver
having
fallen
into
one
of
her
gentle
sleeps
during
this
last
exposition
,
nobody
likes
to
wake
her
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
she
comes
awake
of
herself
,
and
puts
the
question
to
the
Wandering
Chairman
.
<EOS>
The
Wanderer
can
only
speak
of
the
case
as
if
it
were
his
own
.
<EOS>
If
such
a
young
woman
as
the
young
woman
described
,
had
saved
his
own
life
,
he
would
have
been
very
much
obliged
to
her
,
would
n't
have
married
her
,
and
would
have
got
her
a
berth
in
an
Electric
Telegraph
Office
,
where
young
women
answer
very
well
.
  
<EOS>
What
does
the
Genius
of
the
three
hundred

seventy
-
five
thousand
pounds
,
no
shillings
,
and
nopence

think

<EOS>
He
ca
n't
say
what
he
thinks
,
without
asking
:
<EOS>
Had
the
young
woman
any
money
?
  
<EOS>
"
No

"
says
Lightwood
,
in
an
uncompromising
voice
;
"
no
money
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Madness
and
moonshine

"
is
then
the
compressed
verdict
of
the
Genius

<EOS>
"
A

anything

<EOS>
But

What

<EOS>
Boots

<EOS>
Lady
Tippins
fancies
she
has
collected
the
suffrages
of
the
whole
Committee
<EOS>
(
nobody
dreaming
of
asking
the
Veneering
for
their
opinion
)
,
when
,
looking
round
the
table
through
her
eyeglass
,
she
perceives
Mr.
Twemlow
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
.
  
<EOS>
Good
gracious
!
<EOS>
My
Twemlow
forgotten
!
<EOS>
My
dearest
!
<EOS>
My
own
!
<EOS>
What
is
his
vote
?
  
<EOS>
Twemlow
has
the
air
of
being
ill
at
ease
,
as
he
takes
his
hand
from
his
forehead
and
replies
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
disposed
to
think
,
"
says
he
,
"
that
this
is
a
question
of
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
gentleman
can
have
no
feelings
who
contracts
such
a
marriage
,
"
 
flushes
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
sir
,
"
says
Twemlow
,
rather
less
mildly
than
usual
,
"
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
.
<EOS>
If
this
gentleman
's
feelings
of
gratitude
,
of
respect
,
of
admiration
,
and
affection
,
induced
him
(
as
I
presume
they
did
)
to
marry
this
lady
---
"
  
"
This
lady
!
"
<EOS>
echoes
Podsnap
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
returns
Twemlow
,
with
his
wristbands
bristling
a
little
,
"
you
repeat
the
word
;
I
repeat
the
word
.
<EOS>
This
lady
.
<EOS>
What
else
would
you
call
her
,
if
the
gentleman
were
present
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
being
something
in
the
nature
of
a
poser
for
Podsnap
,
he
merely
waves
it
away
with
a
speechless
wave
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
"
resumes
Twemlow
,
"
if
such
feelings
on
the
part
of
this
gentleman
,
induced
this
gentleman
to
marry
this
lady
,
I
think
he
is
the
greater
gentleman
for
the
action
,
and
makes
her
the
greater
lady
.
<EOS>
I
beg
to
say
,
that
when
I
use
the
word
,
gentleman
,
I
use
it
in
the
sense
in
which
the
degree
may
be
attained
by
any
man
.
<EOS>
The
feelings
of
a
gentleman
I
hold
sacred
,
and
I
confess
I
am
not
comfortable
when
they
are
made
the
subject
of
sport
or
general
discussion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
know

"
<EOS>
sneers
Podsnap
,
"
whether
your
noble
relation
would
be
of
your
opinion

Mr.
Podsnap

retorts
Twemlow
,
"
permit
me

<EOS>
He
might
be
,

he
might
not
be

<EOS>
I
can
not
say

<EOS>
But
,
I
could
not
allow
even
him
to
dictate
to
me
on
a
point
of
great
delicacy
,
on
which
I
feel
very
strongly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Somehow
,
a
canopy
of
wet
blanket
seems
to
descend
upon
the
company
,
and
Lady
Tippins
was
never
known
to
turn
so
very
greedy
or
so
very
cross
.
<EOS>
Mortimer
Lightwood
alone
brightens

<EOS>
He
has
been
asking
himself

every
other

of
the
Committee
in
turn
,
"
I
wonder
whether
you
are
the
Voice

"
<EOS>
But
he
does
not
ask
himself
the
question
after
Twemlow
has
spoken
,
and
he
glances
in
Twemlow
's
direction
as
if
he
were
grateful
.
<EOS>
When
the

disperse

by

time
Mr.

Mortimer

POSTSCRIPT
,
IN
LIEU
OF
PREFACE
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
devised
this
story
,
I
foresaw
the
likelihood
that
a
class
of
readers
and
commentators
would
suppose
that
I
was
at
great
pains
to
conceal
exactly
what
I
was
at
great
pains
to
suggest
:
namely
,
that
Mr.
John
Harmon
was
not
slain
,
and
that
Mr.
John
Rokesmith
was
he
.
<EOS>
Pleasing
myself
with
the
idea
that
the
supposition
might
in
part
arise
out
of
some
ingenuity
in
the
story
,
and
thinking
it
worth
while
,
in
the
interests
of
art
,
to
hint
to
an
audience
that
an
artist
(
of
whatever
denomination
)
may
perhaps
be
trusted
to
know
what
he
is
about
in
his
vocation
,
if
they
will
concede
him
a
little
patience
,
I
was
not
alarmed
by
the
anticipation
.
  
<EOS>
To
keep
for
a
long
time
unsuspected
,
yet
always
working
itself
out
,
another
purpose
originating
in
that
leading
incident
,
and
turning
it
to
a
pleasant
and
useful
account
at
last
,
was
at
once
the
most
interesting
and
the
most
difficult
part
of
my
design
.
<EOS>
Its
difficulty
was
much
enhanced
by
the
mode
of
publication
;
for
,
it
would
be
very
unreasonable
to
expect
that
many
readers
,
pursuing
a
story
in
portions
from
month
to
month
through
nineteen
months
,
will
,
until
they
have
it
before
them
complete
,
perceive
the
relations
of
its
finer
threads
to
the
whole
pattern
which
is
always
before
the
eyes
of
the
story
-
weaver
at
his
loom
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
that
I
hold
the
advantages
of
the
mode
of
publication
to
outweigh
its
disadvantages
,
may
be
easily
believed
of
one
who
revived
it
in
the
Pickwick
Papers
after
long
disuse
,
and
has
pursued
it
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
sometimes
an
odd
disposition
in
this
country
to
dispute
as
improbable
in
fiction
,
what
are
the
commonest
experiences
in
fact
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
I
note
here
,
though
it
may
not
be
at
all
necessary
,
that
there
are
hundreds
of
Will
Cases
(
as
they
are
called
)
,
far
more
remarkable
than
that
fancied
in
this
book
;
and
that
the
stores
of
the
Prerogative
Office
teem
with
instances
of
testators
who
have
made
,
changed
,
contradicted
,
hidden
,
forgotten
,
left
cancelled
,
and
left
uncancelled
,
each
many
more
wills
than
were
ever
made
by
the
elder
Mr.
Harmon
of
Harmony
Jail
.
  
<EOS>
In
my
social
experiences
since
Mrs.
Betty
Higden
came
upon
the
scene
and
left
it
,
I
have
found
Circumlocutional
champions
disposed
to
be
warm
with
me
on
the
subject
of
my
view
of
the
Poor
Law
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Mr.
Bounderby
could
never
see
any
difference
between
leaving
the
Coketown
"
hands
"
exactly
as
they
were
,
and
requiring
them
to
be
fed
with
turtle
soup
and
venison
out
of
gold
spoons
.
<EOS>
Idiotic
propositions
of
a
parallel
nature
have
been
freely
offered
for
my
acceptance
,
and
I
have
been
called
upon
to
admit
that
I
would
give
Poor
Law
relief
to
anybody
,
anywhere
,
anyhow
.
<EOS>
Putting
this
nonsense
aside
,
I
have
observed
a
suspicious
tendency
in
the
champions
to
divide
into
two
parties
;
the
one
,
contending
that
there
are
no
deserving
Poor
who
prefer
death
by
slow
starvation
and
bitter
weather
,
to
the
mercies
of
some
Relieving
Officers
and
some
Union
Houses
;
the
other
,
admitting
that
there
are
such
Poor
,
but
denying
that
they
have
any
cause
or
reason
for
what
they
do
.
<EOS>
The
records
in
our
newspapers
,
the
late
exposure
by
The
Lancet
,
and
the
common
sense
and
senses
of
common
people
,
furnish
too
abundant
evidence
against
both
defences
.
<EOS>
But
,
that
my
view
of
the
Poor
Law
may
not
be
mistaken
or
misrepresented
,
I
will
state
it
.
<EOS>
I
believe
there
has
been
in
England
,
since
the
days
of
the
Stuarts
,
no
law
so
often
infamously
administered
,
no
law
so
often
openly
violated
,
no
law
habitually
<EOS>
so
ill
-
supervised
.
<EOS>
In
the
majority
of
the
shameful
cases
of
disease
and
death
from
destitution
,
that
shock
the
Public
and
disgrace
the
country
,
the
illegality
is
quite
equal
to
the
inhumanity
 
---
and
known
language
could
say
no
more
of
their
lawlessness
.

On
Friday
the
Ninth
of
June
in
the
present
year
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Boffin
(
in
their
manuscript
dress
of
receiving
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Lammle
at
breakfast
)
were
on
the
South
Eastern
Railway
with
me
,
in
a
terribly
destructive
accident
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
done
what
I
could
to
help
others
,
I
climbed
back
into
my
carriage
---
nearly
turned
over
a
viaduct
,
and
caught
aslant
upon
the
turn
---
to
extricate
the
worthy
couple
.
<EOS>
They
were
much
soiled
,
but
otherwise
unhurt
.
<EOS>
The
same
happy
result
attended
Miss
Bella
Wilfer
on
her
wedding
day
,
and
Mr.
Riderhood
inspecting
Bradley
Headstone
's
red
neckerchief
as
he
lay
asleep
.
<EOS>
I
remember
with
devout
thankfulness
that
I
can
never
be
much
nearer
parting
company
with
my
readers
for
ever
,
than
I
was
then
,
until
there
shall
be
written
against
my
life
,
the
two
words
with
which
I
have
this
book
:
---
The
End
