his
Majesty

<EOS>
@@@Twas
my
fortune
,
my
Lord
,
in
my
juvenile
Years
,
Musas
cum
Marte
commutare
,
and
truly
I
have
Reason
to
blush
,
when
I
consider
the
small
Advantage
I
have
reap'd
from
that
Change
.
<EOS>
But
lest
it
should
be
imputed
to
my
Want
of
Merit
,
I
have
wrote
these
Memoirs
,
and
leave
the
World
to
judge
of
my
Deserts
.
<EOS>
They
are
not
set
forth
by
any
fictitious
Stories
,
nor
imbelished
with
rhetorical
Flourishes
;
plain
Truth
is
certainly
most
becoming
the
Character
of
an
old
Soldier
.
<EOS>
Yet
let
them
be
never
so
meritorious
,
if
not
protected
by
some
noble
Patron
,
some
Persons
may
think
them
to
be
of
no
Value
.
  
<EOS>
To
you
therefore
,
my
Lord
,
I
present
them
;
to
you
,
who
have
so
eminently
distinguished
your
self
,
and
whose
Wisdom
has
been
so
conspicuous
to
the
late
Representatives
of
Great
Britain
,
that
each
revolving
Age
will
speak
in
your
Praise
;
and
if
you
vouchsafe
to
be
the
Mecoenas
of
these
Memoirs
,
your
Name
will
give
them
sufficient
Sanction
.
  
<EOS>
An
old
Soldier
<EOS>
I
may
truly
call
my
self
,
and
my
Family
allows
me
the
Title
of
a
Gentleman
;
yet
I
have
seen
many
Favourites
of
Fortune
,
without
being
able
to
discern
why
they
should
be
so
happy
,
and
my
self
so
unfortunate
;
but
let
not
that
discourage
your
Lordship
from
receiving
these
my
Memoirs
into
your
Patronage
;
for
the
Unhappy
can
not
expect
Favour
but
from
those
who
are
endued
with
generous
Souls
.
  
<EOS>
Give
me
Leave
,
my
Lord
,
to
congratulate
this
good
Fortune
,
that
neither
Whig
nor
Tory
(
in
this
complaining
Age
)
have
found
fault
with
your
Conduct
.
<EOS>
Your
Family
has
produced
Heroes
,
in
defence
of
injured
Kings
;
and
you
,
when
'
twas
necessary
,
have
as
nobly
adher'd
<EOS>
to
the
Cause
of

TO
THE
READER
  
<EOS>
The
Author
of
these
Memoirs
began
early
to
distinguish
himself
in
martial
Affairs
,
otherwise
he
could
not
have
seen
such
Variety
of
Actions
both
by
Sea
and
Land
.
<EOS>
After
the
last
Dutch
War
he
went
into
Flanders
,
where
he
not
only
serv'd
under
the
Command
of
his
Highness
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
whilst
he
was
Generalissimo
of
the
Dutch
Forces
,
but
likewise
all
the
time
he
reign'd
King
of
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
considerable
Passages
and
Events
,
which
happened
during
that
time
,
are
contained
in
the
former
Part
of
this
Book
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
Year
1705
,
the
Regiment
in
which
he
serv'd
as
Captain
was
order'd
to
embark
for
the
West
Indies
;
and
<EOS>
he
,
having
no
Inclination
to
go
thither
,
<EOS>
chang'd
<EOS>
with
an
half
-
pay
Captain
;
and
being
recommended
to
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
by
the
late
Lord
Cutts
,
went
with
him
upon
that
noble
Expedition
into
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
Forces
under
his
Lordship
's
Command
were
landed
near
Barcelona
,
the
Siege
of
that
Place
was
thought
by
several
impracticable
,
not
only
for
want
of
experienc'd
Engineers
,
but
that
the
Besieged
were
as
numerous
as
the
Besiegers
;
yet
the
Courage
of
that
brave
Earl
surmounted
those
Difficulties
,
and
the
Siege
was
resolv'd
upon
.
  
<EOS>
Our
Author
having
obtain'd
,
by
his
long
Service
,
some
Knowledge
of
the
practick
Part
of
an
Engineer
,
and
seeing
at
that
critical
Time
the
great
Want
of
such
,
readily
acted
as
one
,
which
gave
him
the
greater
Opportunity
of
being
an
Eye
-
Witness
of
his
Lordship
's
Actions
;
and
consequently
made
him
capable
of
setting
them
forth
in
these
his
Memoirs
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
perhaps
improper
to
mention
that
the
Author
of
these
Memoirs
was
born
at
Ewelme
in
Oxfordshire
,
descended
from
an
ancient
and
an
honourable
Family
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
Dudley
Carleton
,
who
died
Secretary
of
State
to
King
Charles
I.
was
his
Great
Uncle
;
and
in
the
same
Reign
his
Father
was
Envoy
at
the
Court
of
Madrid
,
whilst
his
Uncle
,
Sir
Dudley
Carleton
,
was
Embassador
to
the
States
of
Holland
,
Men
in
those
Days
respected
both
for
their
Abilities
and
Loyalty

MEMOIRS
  
OF
AN
  
English
Officer
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
In
the
year
one
Thousand
six
Hundred
seventy
two
,
War
being
proclaimed
with
Holland
<EOS>
,
it
was
looked
upon
among
Nobility
and
Gentry
,
as
a
Blemish
,
not
to
attend
the
Duke
of
York
aboard
the
Fleet
,
who
was
then
declared
Admiral
.
<EOS>
With
many
others
,
I
,
at
that
Time
about
twenty
Years
of
Age
,
enter'd
my
self
a
Voluntier
on
board
the
London
,
commanded
by
Sir
Edward
Sprage
,
Vice
-
Admiral
of
the
Red
.
  
<EOS>
The
Fleet
set
Sail
from
the
Buoy
of
the
Nore
about
the
beginning
of
May
,
in
order
to
join
the
French
Fleet
,
then
at
Anchor
in
St.
Hellen
's
Road
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Count
de
Estree
.
<EOS>
But
in
executing
this
Design
we
had
a
very
narrow
Escape
:
For
De
Ruyter
,
the
Admiral
of
the
Dutch
Fleet
,
having
Notice
of
our
Intentions
,
waited
to
have
intercepted
us
at
the
Mouth
of
the
River
,
but
by
the
Assistance
of
a
great
Fog
we
<EOS>
pass'd
Dover
before
he
was
aware
of
it
;
and
thus
he
miscarried
,
with
the
poor
Advantage
of
taking
only
one
small
Tender
.
  
<EOS>
A
Day
or
two
after
the
joining
of
the
English
and
French
,
we
sailed
directly
towards
the
Dutch
Coast
,
where
we
soon
got
sight
of
their
Fleet
;
a
Sand
called
the
Galloper
lying
between
.
<EOS>
The
Dutch
seem'd
willing
there
to
expect
an
Attack
from
us
:
<EOS>
But
in
regard
the
Charles
Man
of
War
had
been
lost
on
those
Sands
the
War
before
;
and
that
our
Ships
drawing
more
Water
than
those
of
the
Enemy
,
an
Engagement
might
be
render'd
<EOS>
very
disadvantageous
;
it
was
resolv'd
in
a
Council
of
War
to
avoid
coming
to
a
Battle
for
the
present
,
and
to
sail
direftly
for
Solebay
,
which
was
accordingly
put
in
Execution
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
not
been
in
Solebay
above
four
or
five
Days
,
when
De
Ruyter
,
hearing
of
it
,
made
his
Signal
for
sailing
in
order
to
surprize
us
;
and
he
had
certainly
had
his
Aim
,
had
there
been
any
Breeze
of
Wind
to
favour
him
.
<EOS>
But
though
they
made
use
of
all
their
Sails
,
there
was
so
little
Air
stirring
,
that
we
could
see
their
Fleet
making
towards
us
long
before
they
came
up
;
<EOS>
notwithstanding
which
,
our
Admirals
found
difficulty
enough
to
form
their
Ships
into
a
Line
of
Battle
,
so
as
to
be
ready
to
receive
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
about
Four
in
the
Morning
of
the
28th
of
May
,
being
Tuesday
in
Whitson
Week
,
when
we
first
made
the
Discovery
;
and
about
Eight
the
same
Morning
the
Blue
Squadron
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Earl
of
Sandwich
,
began
to
engage
with
Admiral
Van
Ghent
,
who
commanded
the
Amsterdam
Squadron
;
and
about
Nine
the
whole
Fleets
were
under
a
general
Engagement
.
<EOS>
The
Fight
lasted
till
Ten
at
Night
,
and
with
equal
Fury
on
all
Sides
,
the
French
excepted
,
who
appeared
stationed
there
rather
as
Spectators
than
Parties
;
and
as
unwilling
to
be
too
much
upon
the
Offensive
,
for
fear
of
offending
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
Fight
the
English
Admiral
had
two
Ships
disabled
under
him
;
and
was
obliged
about
Four
in
the
Afternoon
to
remove
himself
a
third
Time
into
the
London
,
where
he
remain'd
all
the
rest
of
the
Fight
,
and
till
next
Morning
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
on
his
Entrance
upon
the
London
,
which
was
the
Ship
I
was
in
,
and
on
our
Hoisting
the
Standard
,
De
Ruyter
and
his
Squadron
seem'd
to
double
their
Fire
upon
her
,
as
if
they
resolv'd
to
blow
her
out
of
the
Water
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
which
,
the
Duke
of
York
remain'd
all
the
time
upon
Quarter
Deck
,
and
as
the
Bullets
plentifully
whizz'd
<EOS>
around
him
,
would
often
rub
his
Hands
,
and
cry
,
Sprage
,
<EOS>
Sprage
,
they
follow
us
still
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
sensible
later
Times
have
not
been
over
favourable
in
their
Sentiments
of
that
unfortunate
Prince
's
Valour
,
yet
I
can
not
omit
the
doing
a
Piece
of
Justice
to
his
Memory
,
in
relating
a
Matter
of
Fact
,
of
which
my
own
Eyes
were
Witnesses
,
and
saying
,
That
if
Intrepidity
,
and
Undauntedness
,
may
be
reckon'd
any
Parts
of
Courage
,
no
Man
in
the
Fleet
better
deserv'd
the
Title
of
Couragious
,
or
behav'd
himself
with
more
Gallantry
than
he
did
.
  
<EOS>
The
English
lost
the
Royal
James
,
commanded
by
the
Earl
of
Sandwich
,
which
about
Twelve
(
after
the
strenuous
Endeavours
of
her
Sailors
to
disengage
her
from
two
Dutch
Fire
Ships
<EOS>
plac'd
on
her
,
one
athwart
her
Hawsers
,
the
other
on
her
Star
-
board
Side
)
<EOS>
took
Fire
,
blew
up
,
and
perish'd
;
and
with
her
a
great
many
brave
Gentlemen
,
as
well
as
Sailors
;
and
amongst
the
rest
the
Earl
himself
,
concerning
whom
I
shall
further
add
,
that
in
my
Passage
from
Harwich
to
the
Brill
,
a
Year
or
two
after
,
the
Master
of
the
Pacquet
Boat
told
me
,
That
having
observ'd
a
great
Flock
of
Gulls
hovering
in
one
particular
Part
of
the
Sea
,
he
order'd
<EOS>
his
Boat
to
make
up
to
it
;
when
discovering
a
Corpse
,
the
Sailors
would
have
return'd
it
to
the
Sea
,
as
the
Corpse
of
a
Dutch
Man
;
but
keeping
it
in
his
Boat
,
it
proved
to
be
that
of
the
Earl
of
Sandwich
.
<EOS>
There
was
found
about
him
between
twenty
and
thirty
Guineas
,
some
Silver
,
and
his
Gold
Watch
;
restoring
which
to
his
Lady
,
she
kept
the
Watch
,
but
rewarded
their
Honesty
with
all
the
Gold
and
Silver
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
only
Ship
the
English
lost
in
this
long
Engagement
.
<EOS>
For
although
the
Katherine
was
taken
,
and
her
Commander
,
Sir
John
Chicheley
,
made
Prisoner
,
her
Sailors
soon
after
finding
the
Opportunity
they
had
watch'd
for
,
seiz'd
all
the
Dutch
Sailors
,
who
had
been
put
in
upon
them
,
and
brought
the
Ship
back
to
our
own
Fleet
,
together
with
all
the
Dutch
Men
Prisoners
;
for
which
,
as
they
deserv'd
,
they
were
well
rewarded
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
same
Ship
which
the
Earl
of
Mulgrave
(
afterwards
Duke
of
Buckingham
)
commanded
the
next
Sea
Fight
,
and
has
caus'd
to
be
painted
in
his
House
in
St.
James
's
Park
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
not
omit
one
very
remarkable
Occurrence
which
happened
in
this
Ship
,
There
was
a
Gentleman
aboard
her
,
a
Voluntier
,
of
a
very
fine
Estate
,
generally
known
by
the
Name
of
Hodge
Vaughan
.
<EOS>
This
Person
receiv'd
,
in
the
beginning
of
the
Fight
,
a
considerable
Wound
,
which
the
great
Confusion
,
during
the
Battle
,
would
not
give
them
leave
to
inquire
into
;
so
he
was
carried
out
of
the
Way
,
and
disposed
of
in
the
Hold
.
<EOS>
They
had
some
Hogs
aboard
,
which
the
Sailor
,
under
whose
Care
they
were
,
had
neglected
to
feed
;
these
Hogs
,
hungry
as
they
were
,
found
out
,
and
fell
upon
the
wounded
Person
,
and
between
dead
and
alive
eat
him
up
to
his
very
Scull
,
which
,
after
the
Fight
was
over
,
and
the
Ship
retaken
,
as
before
,
was
all
that
could
be
found
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
Another
Thing
,
less
to
be
accounted
for
,
happen'd
to
a
Gentleman
Voluntier
who
was
aboard
the
same
Ship
with
my
self
.
<EOS>
He
was
of
known
personal
Courage
,
in
the
vulgar
Notion
of
it
,
his
Sword
never
having
fail'd
<EOS>
him
in
many
private
Duels
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
all
his
Land
-
mettle
,
it
was
observ'd
of
him
at
Sea
,
that
when
ever
the
Bullets
whizz'd
over
his
Head
,
or
any
way
incommoded
his
Ears
,
he
immediately
quitted
the
Deck
,
and
ran
down
into
the
Hold
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
was
gently
reproach'd
;
but
after
many
Repetitions
he
was
laugh'd
at
,
and
began
to
be
despis'd
;
sensible
of
which
,
as
a
Testimonial
of
his
Valour
,
he
made
it
his
Request
to
be
ty'd
to
the
Main
Mast
.
<EOS>
But
had
it
been
granted
him
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
see
any
Title
he
could
have
pleaded
from
hence
,
to
true
Magnanimity
;
since
to
be
ty'd
from
running
away
can
import
nothing
less
,
than
that
he
would
have
still
continued
these
Signs
of
Cowardice
,
if
he
had
not
been
prevented
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
Bravery
of
Mind
which
I
fansy
few
of
those
Gentlemen
Duellists
are
possess'd
of
.
<EOS>
True
Courage
can
not
proceed
from
what
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
finely
calls
the
Art
or
Philosophy
of
Quarrel
.
<EOS>
No
!

It

a

those

will
give
themselves
leave
cooly
to

this

Why
he

many

should
be

But
to
proceed
,
the
Dutch
had
one
Man
of
War
sunk
,
though
so
near
the
Shore
,
that
I
saw
some
part
of
her
Main
Mast
remain
above
Water
,
with
their
Admiral
Van
Ghent
,
who
was
slain
in
the
close
Engagement
with
the
Earl
of
Sandwich
.
<EOS>
This
Engagement
lasted
fourteen
Hours
,
and
was
look'd
<EOS>
upon
the
greatest
that
ever
was
fought
between
the
English
and
the
Hollander
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
here
omit
one
Thing
,
which
to
some
may
seem
trifling
;
though
I
am
apt
to
think
our
Naturalists
may
have
a
different
Opinion
of
it
,
and
find
it
afford
their
Fansies
no
undiverting
Employment
in
more
curious
,
and
less
perilous
Reflections
.
<EOS>
We
had
on
board
the
London
<EOS>
where
,
as
I
have
said
,
I
was
a
Voluntier
,
a
great
Number
of
Pidgeons
,
of
which
our
Commander
was
very
fond
.
<EOS>
These
,
on
the
first
firing
of
our
Cannon
,
dispers'd
,
and
flew
away
,
and
were
seen
no
where
near
us
during
the
Fight
.
<EOS>
The
next
Day
it
blew
a
brisk
Gale
,
and
drove
our
Fleet
some
Leagues
to
the
Southward
of
the
Place
where
they
forsook
our
Ship
,
yet
the
Day
after
they
all
returned
safe
aboard
;
not
in
one
Flock
,
but
in
small
Parties
of
four
or
five
at
a
Time
.
<EOS>
Some
Persons
at
that
Time
aboard
the
Ship
admiring
at
the
Manner
of
their
Return
,
and
speaking
of
it
with
some
Surprize
,
Sir
Edward
Sprage
told
them
,
That
he
brought
those
Pidgeons
with
him
from
the
Streights
;
and
that
when
,
pursuant
to
his
Order
,
he
left
the
Revenge
Man
of
War
,
to
go
aboard
the
London
,
all
those
Pidgeons
,
of
their
own
accord
,
and
without
the
Trouble
or
Care
of
carrying
,
left
the
Revenge
likewise
,
and
removed
with
the
Sailors
on
board
the
London
,
where
I
saw
them
;
All
which
many
of
the
Sailors
afterwards
confirm'd
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
Sort
of
Instinct
this
could
proceed
from
,
I
leave
to
the
Curious
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
Sea
Engagement
I
left
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
And
the
Parliament
,
the
Winter
following
,
manifesting
their
Resentments
against
two
of
the
Plenipotentiaries
,
viz
.
<EOS>
Buckingham
and
Arlington
,
who
had
been
sent
over
into
Holland
;
and
expressing
,
withal
,
their
great
Umbrage
taken
at
the
prodigious
Progress
of
the
French
Arms
in
the
United
Provinces
;
and
warmly
remonstrating
the
inevitable
Danger
attending
England
in
their
Ruin
.
<EOS>
King
Charles
from
all
this
,
and
for
want
of
the
expected
Supplies
,
found
himself
under
a
Necessity
of
clapping
up
a
speedy
Peace
with
Holland
.
  
<EOS>
This
Peace
leaving
those
youthful
Spirits
,
that
had
by
the
late
Naval
War
<EOS>
been
rais'd
into
a
generous
Ferment
,
under
a
perfect
Inactivity
at
Home
;
they
found
themselves
,
to
avoid
a
Sort
of
Life
that
was
their
Aversion
,
oblig'd
to
look
out
for
one
more
active
,
and
more
suitable
to
their
vigorous
Tempers
Abroad
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
acknowledge
my
self
one
of
that
Number
;
and
therefore
in
the
Year
1674,1
resolv'd
to
go
into
Flanders
,
in
order
to
serve
as
Voluntier
in
the
Army
commanded
by
his
Highness
the
Prince
of
Orange
.
<EOS>
I
took
my
Passage
accordingly
at
Dover
for
Calais
,
and
so
went
by
way
of
Dunkirk
for
Brussels
.
  
<EOS>
Arriving
at
which
Place
,
I
was
inform'd
that
the
Army
of
the
Confederates
lay
encamp'd
not
far
from
Nivelle
;
and
under
the
daily
Expectation
of
an
Engagement
with
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
This
News
made
me
press
forward
to
the
Service
;
for
which
Purpose
I
carry'd
along
with
me
<EOS>
proper
Letters
of
Recommendation
to
Sir
Walter
Vane
,
who
was
at
that
time
a
Major
-
General
.
<EOS>
Upon
further
Enquiry
I
understood
,
that
a
Party
of
Horse
,
which
was
to
guard
some
Waggons
that
were
going
to
Count
Montery
's
Army
,
were
to
set
out
next
Morning
;
so
I
got
an
Irish
Priest
to
introduce
me
to
the
Commanding
Officer
,
which
he
readily
oblig'd
me
in
;
and
they
,
as
I
wish'd
them
,
arriv'd
<EOS>
in
the
Camp
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
scarce
been
there
an
Hour
,
when
happen'd
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
Accidents
in
Life
.
<EOS>
I
observ'd
in
the
East
<EOS>
a
strange
dusty
colour'd
Cloud
,
of
a
pretty
large
Extent
,
riding
,
not
before
the
Wind
(
for
it
was
a
perfect
Calm
)
with
such
a
precipitate
Motion
,
that
it
was
got
over
our
Heads
almost
as
soon
as
seen
.
<EOS>
When
the
Skirts
of
that
Cloud
began
to
cover
our
Camp
,
there
suddenly
arose
such
a
terrible
Hurricaine
,
or
Whirlwind
,
that
all
the
Tents
were
carry'd
aloft
with
great
Violence
into
the
Air
;
and
Soldiers
'
Hats
flew
so
high
and
thick
,
that
my
Fansy
can
resemble
it
to
nothing
better
than
those
Flights
of
Rooks
,
<EOS>
which
at
Dusk
of
Evening
,
leaving
the
Fields
,
seek
their
roosting
Places
.
<EOS>
Trees
were
torn
up
by
the
very
Roots
;
and
the
Roofs
of
all
the
Barns
,
&
c.
belonging
to
the
Prince
's
Quarters
,
were
blown
quite
away
.
<EOS>
This
lasted
for
about
half
an
Hour
,
until
the
Cloud
was
wholly
past
over
us
,
when
as
suddenly
ensued
the
same
pacifik
Calm
as
before
the
Cloud
's
Approach
.
<EOS>
Its
Course
was
seemingly
directly
West
;
and
yet
we
were
soon
after
inform'd
,
that
the
fine
Dome
of
the
great
Church
at
Utrecht
had
greatly
suffer'd
<EOS>
by
it
the
same
Day
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
I
am
not
must
mistaken
,
Sir
William
Temple
,
in
his
Memoirs
,
mentions
somewhat
of
it
,
which
he
felt
at
Lillo
,
on
his
Return
from
the
Prince
of
Orange
's
Camp
,
where
he
had
been
a
Day
or
two
before
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
after
this
,
as
I
could
get
an
Opportunity
,
I
deliver'd
,
at
his
Quarters
,
my
recommendatory
Letters
to
Sir
Walter
Vane
;
who
receiv'd
me
very
kindly
,
telling
me
at
the
same
time
,
that
there
were
six
or
seven
English
Gentlemen
,
who
had
enter'd
<EOS>
themselves
Voluntiers
in
the
Prince
's
own
Company
of
Guards
:
<EOS>
And
added
,
that
he
would
immediately
recommend
me
to
Count
Solmes
,
their
Colonel
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
worse
than
his
Word
,
and
I
was
enter'd
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Those
six
Gentlemen
were
as
follows
,
 
Clavers
,
who
since
was
better
known
by
the
Title
of
Lord
Dundee
;
<EOS>
Mr.
Collier
,
now
Lord
Portmore
;
Mr.
Rooke
,
since
Major
-
General
;
Mr.
Hales
,
who
lately
died
,
and
was
for
a
long
time
Governor
of
Chelsea
-
Hospital
;
Mr.
Venner
,
Son
of
that
Venner
remarkable
for
his
being
one
of
the
Fifth
-
Monarchy
Men
;
and
Mr.
Boyce
.
<EOS>
The
four
first
rose
to
be
very
eminent
;
but
Fortune
is
not
to
all
alike
favourable
.
  
<EOS>
In
about
a
Week
's
Time
after
,
it
was
resolv'd
in
a
Council
of
War
,
to
march
towards
Binch
,
a
small
wall'd
Town
,
about
four
Leagues
from
Nivelle
;
the
better
to
cut
off
the
Provisions
from
coming
to
the
Prince
of
Conde
's
Camp
that
Way
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
on
the
first
Day
of
August
,
being
Saturday
,
we
began
our
March
;
and
the
English
Voluntiers
had
the
Favour
of
a
Baggage
Waggon
appointed
them
.
<EOS>
Count
Souches
,
the
Imperial
General
,
with
the
Troops
of
that
Nation
,
led
the
Van
;
the
main
Body
was
compos'd
of
Dutch
,
under
the
Prince
of
Orange
.
<EOS>
as
Generalissimo
;
and
the
Spaniards
,
under
Prince
Vaudemont
,
with
some
Detachments
,
made
the
Rear
Guard
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
were
upon
our
March
,
I
being
among
those
Detachments
which
made
up
the
Rear
Guard
,
observ'd
<EOS>
a
great
Party
of
the
Enemy
's
Horse
upon
an
Ascent
,
which
,
I
then
imagin'd
,
as
it
after
prov'd
,
to
be
the
Prince
of
Conde
taking
a
View
of
our
Forces
under
March
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
Defiles
,
which
our
Army
must
necessarily
pass
;
through
which
that
Prince
politickly
enough
permitted
the
Imperial
and
Dutch
Forces
to
pass
unmolested
.
<EOS>
But
when
Prince
Vaudemont
,
with
the
Spaniards
,
and
our
Detachments
,
thought
to
have
done
the
like
,
the
Prince
of
Conde
fell
on
our
Rear
Guard
;
and
,
after
a
long
and
sharp
Dispute
,
entirely
routed
'em
;
the
Marquiss
of
Assentar
,
a
Spanish
Lieutenant
-
General
,
dying
upon
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
Had
the
Prince
of
Conde
contented
himself
with
this
Share
of
good
Fortune
,
his
Victory
had
been
uncontested
:
But
being
pushed
forward
by
a
vehement
Heat
of
Temper
(
which
he
was
noted
for
)
and
flush'd
with
this
extraordinary
Success
,
he
resolv'd
to
force
the
whole
Confederate
Army
to
a
Battle
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
which
,
he
immediately
led
his
Forces
between
our
Second
Line
,
and
our
Line
of
Baggage
;
by
which
means
the
latter
were
entirely
cut
off
;
and
were
subjected
to
the
Will
of
the
Enemy
,
who
fell
directly
to
plunder
;
in
which
they
were
not
a
little
assisted
by
the
routed
Spaniards
themselves
,
who
did
not
disdain
at
that
time
to
share
with
the
Enemy
in
the
plundering
of
their
Friends
and
Allies
.
  
<EOS>
The
English
Voluntiers
had
their
Share
of
this
ill
Fortune
with
the
rest
;
their
Waggon
appointed
them
being
among
those
intercepted
by
the
Enemy
;
and
I
,
for
my
Part
,
lost
every
Thing
but
Life
,
which
yet
was
saved
almost
as
unaccountably
as
my
Fellow
-
Soldiers
had
lost
theirs
.
<EOS>
The
Baggage
,
as
I
have
said
,
being
cut
off
,
and
at
the
Mercy
of
the
Enemy
,
every
one
endeavour'd
to
escape
through
,
or
over
the
Hedges
.
<EOS>
And
as
in
all
Cases
of
like
Confusion
,
one
endeavours
to
save
himself
upon
the
Ruins
of
others
:
So
here
,
he
that
found
himself
stopt
by
another
in
getting
over
the
Cap
of
a
Hedge
,
pull'd
him
back
to
make
way
for
himself
,
and
perhaps
met
with
the
same
Fortune
from
a
Third
,
to
the
Destruction
of
all
.
<EOS>
I
was
then
in
the
Vigour
of
my
Youth
,
and
none
of
the
least
active
,
and
perceiving
how
it
had
far'd
with
some
before
me
,
I
clapt
my
left
Leg
upon
the
Shoulders
of
one
who
was
thus
contending
with
another
,
and
with
a
Spring
threw
my
self
over
both
their
Heads
and
the
Hedge
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
By
this
Means
I
not
only
sav'd
my
Life
(
for
they
were
all
cut
to
Pieces
that
could
not
get
over
)
but
from
an
Eminence
,
which
I
soon
after
attain'd
,
I
had
an
Opportunity
of
seeing
,
and
making
my
Observations
upon
the
remaining
Part
of
that
glorious
Conflict
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
from
that
advantageous
Situation
,
that
I
presently
discover'd
that
the
Imperialists
,
who
led
the
Van
,
had
now
<EOS>
join'd
<EOS>
the
main
Body
.
<EOS>
And
,
I
confess
,
it
was
with
an
almost
inexpressible
Pleasure
,
that
I
beheld
,
about
three
a
-
Clock
,
with
what
intrepid
Fury
they
fell
upon
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
both
Armies
were
universally
engag'd
,
and
with
great
Obstinacy
disputed
the
Victory
till
Eleven
at
Night
.
<EOS>
At
which
Time
the
French
,
being
pretty
well
surfeited
,
made
their
Retreat
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
to
secure
it
by
a
Stratagem
,
they
left
their
lighted
Matches
hanging
in
the
Hedges
,
and
waving
with
the
Air
,
to
conceal
it
from
the
Confederate
Army
.
  
<EOS>
About
two
Hours
after
,
the
Confederate
Forces
follow'd
the
Example
of
their
Enemies
,
and
drew
off
.
<EOS>
And
tho
'
neither
Army
had
much
Reason
to
boast
;
yet
as
the
Prince
of
Orange
remained
last
in
the
Field
;
and
die
French
had
lost
<EOS>
what
they
before
had
gain'd
,
the
Glory
of
the
Day
fell
to
the
Prince
of
Orange
;
who
,
altho
'
but
twenty
-
four
Years
of
Age
,
had
the
Suffrage
of
Friend
and
Foe
,
of
having
play'd
<EOS>
the
Part
of
an
old
and
experienc'd
Officer
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
left
that
Day
on
the
Field
of
Battle
,
by
a
general
Computation
,
not
less
than
eighteen
Thousand
Men
on
both
Sides
,
over
and
above
those
,
who
died
of
their
Wounds
:
<EOS>
The
Loss
being
pretty
equal
,
only
the
French
carried
off
most
Prisoners
.
<EOS>
Prince
Waldeck
was
shot
through
the
Arm
,
which
I
was
near
enough
to
be
an
Eye
-
witness
of
;
And
my
much
lamented
Friend
,
Sir
Walter
Vane
,
was
carried
off
dead
.
<EOS>
A
Wound
in
the
Arm
was
all
the
Mark
of
Honour
,
that
I
as
yet
could
boast
of
,
though
our
Cannon
in
the
Defiles
had
slain
many
near
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
Prince
of
Conde
(
as
we
were
next
Day
inform'd
)
lay
all
that
Night
under
a
Hedge
,
wrapp'd
<EOS>
in
his
Cloke
:
And
either
from
the
Mortification
of
being
disappointed
in
his
Hopes
of
Victory
;
or
from
a
Reflection
of
the
Disservice
,
which
is
own
natural
over
Heat
of
Temper
had
drawn
upon
him
,
was
almost
inconsolable
many
Days
after
.
<EOS>
And
thus
ended
the
famous
Battle
of
Seneff
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
common
Vogue
has
given
it
the
Name
of
a
Battle
,
in
my
weak
Opinion
,
it
might
rather
deserve
that
of
a
confus'd
Skirmish
;
all
Things
having
been
forcibly
carried
on
without
Regularity
,
or
even
Design
enough
to
allow
it
any
higher
Denomination
:
<EOS>
For
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
notwithstanding
I
was
advantagiously
stationed
for
Observation
,
I
found
it
very
often
impossible
to
distinguish
one
Party
from
another
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
more
remarkably
evident
on
the
Part
of
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
whose
Valour
and
Vigour
having
led
him
into
the
Middle
of
the
Enemy
,
and
being
then
sensible
of
his
Error
,
by
a
peculiar
Presence
of
Mind
,
gave
the
Word
of
Command
in
French
,
which
he
spoke
perfectly
well
.
<EOS>
But
the
French
Soldiers
,
who
took
him
for
one
of
their
own
Generals
,
making
Answer
,
that
their
Powder
was
all
spent
,
it
afforded
Matter
of
Instruction
to
him
to
persist
in
his
Attack
;
at
the
same
Time
,
that
it
gave
him
a
Lesson
of
Caution
,
to
withdraw
himself
,
as
soon
as
he
could
,
to
his
own
Troops
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
the
Day
after
the
Prince
of
Orange
thought
proper
to
march
to
Quarignan
,
a
Village
within
a
League
of
Mons
;
where
he
remain'd
<EOS>
some
Days
,
till
he
could
be
supply'd
from
Brussells
with
those
Necessaries
which
his
Army
stood
in
need
of
.
  
<EOS>
From
thence
we
march'd
to
Valenciennes
,
where
we
again
encamp'd
,
till
we
could
receive
Things
proper
for
a
Siege
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
Arrival
whereof
,
the
Prince
gave
Orders
to
decamp
,
and
march'd
his
Army
with
a
Design
to
besiege
Aeth
.
<EOS>
But
having
Intelligence
on
our
March
,
that
the
Mareschal
De
Humiers
had
reinforc'd
<EOS>
that
Garrison
,
we
march'd
directly
to
Oudenard
,
and
immediately
invested
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
Siege
was
carried
on
with
such
Application
and
Success
,
that
the
Besiegers
were
in
a
few
Days
ready
for
a
Storm
;
but
the
Prince
of
Conde
prevented
them
,
by
coming
up
to
its
Relief
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
pursuant
to
the
Resolution
of
a
Council
of
War
the
Night
before
,
drew
off
his
Forces
in
order
to
give
him
Battle
;
and
to
that
purpose
,
after
the
laborious
Work
of
filling
up
our
Lines
of
Contravallation
,
that
the
Horse
might
pass
more
freely
,
we
lay
upon
our
Arms
all
Night
.
<EOS>
Next
Morning
we
expected
the
Imperial
General
,
Count
Souches
,
to
join
us
;
but
instead
of
that
,
he
sent
back
some
very
frivolous
Excuses
,
of
the
Inconveniency
of
the
Ground
for
a
Battle
;
and
after
that
,
instead
of
joining
the
Prince
,
marched
off
quite
another
way
;
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
with
the
Dutch
and
Spanish
Troops
,
marched
directly
for
Ghent
;
exclaiming
publickly
against
the
Chicanery
of
Souches
,
and
openly
declaring
,
That
he
had
been
advertis'd
of
a
Conference
between
a
French
Capuchin
and
that
General
,
the
Night
before
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
that
that
General
lay
under
the
Displeasure
of
his
Master
,
the
Emperor
,
for
that
Piece
of
Management
;
and
the
Count
de
Sporck
was
immediately
appointed
General
in
his
Place
.
  
<EOS>
The
Prince
of
Orange
was
hereupon
leaving
the
Army
in
great
Disgust
,
till
prevail'd
upon
by
the
Count
de
Montery
,
for
the
general
Safety
,
to
recede
from
that
Resolution
.
<EOS>
However
,
seeing
no
likelihood
of
any
Thing
further
to
be
done
,
while
Souches
was
in
Command
,
he
resolv'd
upon
a
Post
of
more
Action
,
though
more
dangerous
;
<EOS>
wherefore
ordering
ten
Thousand
Men
to
march
before
,
he
himself
soon
after
foliow'd
to
the
Siege
of
Grave
.
  
<EOS>
The
Grave
,
a
strong
Place
,
and
of
the
first
Moment
to
the
Hollanders
,
had
been
block'd
up
by
the
Dutch
Forces
all
the
Summer
;
the
Prince
of
Orange
therefore
leaving
the
main
Army
under
Prince
Waldeck
at
Ghent
,
follow'd
<EOS>
the
Detachment
he
had
made
for
the
Siege
of
that
important
Place
,
resolving
to
purchase
it
at
any
Rate
.
<EOS>
On
his
Arrival
before
it
,
Things
began
to
find
new
Motion
;
and
as
they
were
carried
on
with
the
utmost
Application
and
Fury
,
the
Besieged
found
themselves
,
in
a
little
Time
,
oblig'd
to
change
their
haughty
Summer
Note
for
one
more
suitable
to
the
Season
.
  
<EOS>
The
Prince
,
from
his
first
coming
,
having
kept
those
within
hotly
ply'd
with
Ball
,
both
from
Cannon
and
Mortars
,
Monsieur
Chamilly
,
the
Governor
,
after
a
few
Days
,
being
weary
of
such
warm
Work
,
desired
to
capitulate
;
upon
which
Hostages
were
exchanged
,
and
Articles
agreed
on
next
Morning
.
<EOS>
Pursuant
to
which
,
the
Garrison
march'd
out
with
Drums
beating
and
Colours
flying
,
two
Days
after
,
and
were
conducted
to
Charleroy
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
taking
this
Place
,
which
made
the
Prince
of
Orange
the
more
earnest
upon
it
,
the
French
were
wholly
expell'd
their
last
Year
's
astonishing
Conquests
in
Holland
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
was
another
Consideration
,
that
render'd
the
Surrender
of
it
much
more
considerable
.
<EOS>
For
the
French
being
sensible
of
the
great
Strength
of
this
Place
,
had
there
deposited
all
their
Cannon
and
Ammunition
,
taken
from
their
other
Conquests
in
Holland
,
which
they
never
were
able
to
remove
or
carry
off
,
with
tolerable
Prospect
of
Safety
,
after
that
Prince
's
Army
first
took
the
Field
.
  
<EOS>
The
Enemy
being
march'd
out
,
the
Prince
enter'd
the
Town
,
and
immediately
order'd
public
Thanksgivings
for
its
happy
Reduction
.
<EOS>
Then
having
appointed
a
Governor
,
and
left
a
sufficient
Garrison
,
he
put
an
End
to
that
Campaign
,
and
return'd
to
the
Hague
,
where
he
had
not
been
long
before
he
fell
ill
of
the
Small
Pox
.
<EOS>
The
Consternation
this
threw
the
whole
Country
into
,
is
not
to
be
express'd
;
Any
one
that
had
seen
it
would
have
thought
,
that
the
French
had
made
another
Inundation
greater
than
the
former
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
Danger
was
over
,
their
Joy
and
Satisfaction
,
for
his
Recovery
,
was
equally
beyond
Expression
.
  
<EOS>
The
Year
1675
yielded
very
little
remarkable
in
our
Army
.
<EOS>
Limburgh
was
besieged
by
the
French
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Duke
of
Enguien
,
which
the
Prince
of
Orange
having
Intelligence
of
,
immediately
decamp'd
from
his
fine
Camp
at
Bethlem
,
near
Louvain
,
in
order
to
raise
the
Siege
.
<EOS>
But
as
we
were
on
a
full
March
for
that
purpose
,
and
had
already
reach'd
<EOS>
Ruremond
,
Word
was
brought
,
that
the
Place
had
surrender'd
the
Day
before
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
Advice
,
the
Prince
,
after
a
short
Halt
,
made
his
little
Army
(
for
it
consisted
not
of
more
than
thirty
Thousand
Men
)
march
back
to
Brabant
.
<EOS>
Nothing
of
moment
,
after
this
,
occurr'd
all
that
Campaign
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
Year
1676
,
the
Prince
of
Orange
having
,
in
concert
with
the
Spaniards
,
resolv'd
upon
the
important
Siege
of
Maestrich
(
the
only
Town
in
the
Dutch
Provinces
,
then
remaining
in
the
Hands
of
the
French
)
it
was
accordingly
invested
about
the
middle
of
June
,
with
an
Army
of
twenty
Thousand
Men
,
under
the
Command
of
his
Highness
Prince
Waldeck
,
with
the
grand
Army
covering
the
Siege
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
Time
before
the
heavy
Cannon
,
which
we
expected
up
the
Maes
,
from
Holland
,
arrived
;
which
gave
Occasion
to
a
Piece
of
Raillery
of
Monsieur
Calvo
,
the
Governor
,
which
was
as
handsomely
<EOS>
repartec'd
.
<EOS>
That
Governor
,
by
a
Messenger
,
intimating
his
Sorrow
to
find
,
we
had
pawn'd
<EOS>
our
Cannon
for
Ammunition
Bread
.
<EOS>
Answer
was
made
,
That
in
a
few
Days
we
hoped
to
give
him
a
Taste
of
the
Loaves
,
which
he
should
find
would
be
sent
him
into
the
Town
in
extraordinary
plenty
.
<EOS>
I
remember
another
Piece
of
Raillery
,
which
pass'd
<EOS>
some
Days
after
between
the
Rhingrave
and
the
same
Calvo
.
<EOS>
The
former
sending
Word
,
that
he
hoped
within
three
Weeks
to
salute
that
Governor
's
Mistress
within
the
Place
.
<EOS>
Calvo
reply'd
,
He
'd
give
him
leave
to
kiss
her
all
over
,
if
he
kiss'd
her
<EOS>
any
where
in
three
Months
.
  
<EOS>
But
our
long
expected
Artillery
being
at
last
arriv'd
<EOS>
,
all
this
Jest
and
Merriment
was
soon
converted
into
earnest
.
<EOS>
Our
Trenches
were
immediately
open'd
<EOS>
towards
the
Dauphin
Bastion
,
against
which
were
planted
many
Cannon
,
in
order
to
make
a
Breach
;
my
self
as
a
Probationer
being
twice
put
upon
the
forlorn
Hope
to
facilitate
that
difficult
Piece
of
Service
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
long
before
such
a
Breach
was
effected
,
as
was
esteem'd
practicable
,
and
therefore
very
soon
after
it
was
ordered
to
be
attack'd
.
  
<EOS>
The
Disposition
for
the
Attack
was
thus
ordered
;
two
Serjeants
with
twenty
Grenadiers
,
a
Captain
with
fifty
Men
,
my
self
one
of
the
Number
;
then
a
Party
carrying
Wool
Sacks
,
and
after
them
two
Captains
with
one
Hundred
Men
more
;
the
Soldiers
in
the
Trenches
to
be
ready
to
sustain
them
,
as
Occasion
should
require
.
  
<EOS>
The
Signal
being
given
,
we
left
our
Trenches
accordingly
,
having
about
one
Hundred
Yards
to
run
,
before
we
could
reach
the
Breach
,
which
we
mounted
with
some
Difficulty
and
Loss
;
all
our
Batteries
firing
at
the
same
instant
to
keep
our
Action
in
countenance
,
and
favour
our
Design
.
<EOS>
When
we
were
in
Possession
of
the
Bastion
,
the
Enemy
fir'd
most
furiously
upon
us
with
their
small
Cannon
through
a
thin
brick
Wall
,
by
which
,
and
their
hand
Grenadoes
,
we
lost
more
Men
than
we
did
in
the
Attack
it
self
.
  
<EOS>
But
well
had
it
been
had
our
ill
Fortune
<EOS>
stopp'd
there
;
for
as
if
Disaster
must
needs
be
the
Concomitant
of
Success
,
we
soon
lost
what
we
had
thus
gotten
,
by
a
small
,
but
very
odd
Accident
.
<EOS>
Not
being
furnished
with
such
Scoopes
as
our
Enemies
made
use
of
,
in
tossing
their
hand
Grenadoes
some
distance
off
,
one
of
our
own
Soldiers
aiming
to
throw
one
over
the
Wall
into
the
Counterscarp
among
the
Enemy
,
it
so
happen'd
that
he
unfortunately
miss'd
<EOS>
his
Aim
,
and
the
Grenade
fell
down
again
on
our
side
the
Wall
,
very
near
the
Person
who
fir'd
it
.
<EOS>
He
starting
back
to
save
himself
,
and
some
others
who
saw
it
fall
,
doing
the
like
,
those
who
knew
nothing
of
the
Matter
fell
into
a
sudden
Confusion
,
and
imagining
some
greater
danger
than
there
really
was
,
every
body
was
struck
with
a
panick
Fear
,
and
endeavour'd
to
be
the
first
who
should
quit
the
Bastion
,
and
secure
himself
by
a
real
Shame
from
an
imaginary
Evil
.
<EOS>
Thus
was
a
Bastion
,
that
had
been
gloriously
gain'd
,
inadvertently
deserted
;
and
that
too
,
with
the
Loss
of
almost
as
many
Men
in
the
Retreat
,
as
had
been
slain
in
the
Onset
,
and
the
Enemy
most
triumphantly
again
took
Possession
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
Slain
on
our
Side
in
this
Action
,
was
an
Ensign
of
Sir
John
Fenwick
's
Regiment
;
and
as
an
Approbation
of
my
Services
his
Commission
was
bestowed
upon
me
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
Days
after
it
was
resolv'd
again
to
storm
that
Bastion
,
as
before
;
out
of
three
English
,
and
one
Scotch
Regiment
,
then
in
the
Camp
,
a
Detachment
was
selected
for
a
fresh
Attack
.
<EOS>
Those
Regiments
were
under
the
Command
of
Sir
John
Fenwick
(
who
was
afterwards
beheaded
)
Colonel
Ralph
Widdrington
,
and
Colonel
Ashley
,
of
the
English
;
and
Sir
Alexander
Collier
,
Father
of
the
present
Lord
Portmore
,
of
the
Scotch
.
<EOS>
Out
of
every
of
these
four
Regiments
,
as
before
,
were
detach'd
<EOS>
a
Captain
,
a
Lieutenant
,
and
an
Ensign
,
with
fifty
Men
:
<EOS>
Captain
Anthony
Bamwell
,
of
Sir
John
Fenwick
's
Regiment
,
who
was
now
my
Captain
,
commanding
that
Attack
.
  
<EOS>
At
break
of
Day
the
Attack
was
begun
with
great
Resolution
;
and
though
vigorously
maintain'd
,
was
attended
with
the
desir'd
Success
.
<EOS>
The
Bastion
was
again
taken
,
and
in
it
the
commanding
Officer
,
who
in
Service
to
himself
,
more
than
to
us
,
told
us
,
that
the
Center
of
the
Bastion
would
soon
be
blown
up
being
to
his
Knowledge
undermin'd
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
this
Secret
prov'd
of
no
other
use
,
than
to
make
us
,
by
way
of
Precaution
,
to
keep
as
much
as
we
could
upon
the
Rampart
.
<EOS>
In
this
Attack
Captain
Barnwell
lost
his
Life
;
and
it
happened
my
new
Commission
was
wetted
(
not
,
as
too
frequently
is
the
Custom
,
with
a
Debauch
)
<EOS>
but
with
a
Bullet
through
my
Hand
,
and
the
Breach
of
my
Collar
Bone
with
the
Stroke
of
a
Halberd
.
  
<EOS>
After
about
half
an
hour
's
Possession
of
the
Bastion
,
the
Mine
under
it
,
of
which
the
French
Officer
gave
us
warning
,
was
sprung
;
the
Enemy
at
the
same
Time
making
a
furious
Sally
upon
us
.
<EOS>
The
Mine
did
a
little
,
though
the
less
,
Execution
,
for
being
discovered
;
but
the
Sally
no
way
answer'd
<EOS>
their
End
,
for
we
beat
them
back
,
and
immediately
fix'd
our
Lodgment
;
which
we
maintain'd
<EOS>
during
the
Time
of
the
Siege
.
<EOS>
But
to
our
double
Surprize
,
a
few
Days
after
they
fir'd
another
Mine
under
,
or
aside
,
the
former
,
in
which
they
had
plac'd
<EOS>
a
quantity
of
Grenadoes
,
which
did
much
more
Execution
than
the
other
:
Notwithstanding
all
which
,
a
Battery
of
Guns
was
presently
erected
upon
that
Bastion
,
which
very
considerably
annoy'd
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
The
Breach
for
a
general
Storm
was
now
render'd
<EOS>
almost
practicable
;
yet
before
that
could
be
advisably
attempted
,
there
was
a
strong
Horn
-
work
to
be
taken
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
Exploit
the
Dutch
Troops
only
were
to
signalize
themselves
;
and
they
answered
the
Confidence
repos'd
<EOS>
in
them
;
for
though
they
were
twice
repuls'd
,
at
the
third
Onset
they
were
more
successful
,
and
took
Possession
;
which
they
likewise
kept
to
the
Raising
of
the
Siege
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
Stratagem
lay'd
at
this
Time
,
which
in
its
own
Merit
one
would
have
thought
should
not
have
fail'd
of
a
good
Effect
;
but
to
shew
the
Vanity
of
the
highest
human
Wisdom
<EOS>
it
miscarry'd
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
of
the
Maes
,
opposite
to
Maestrich
,
lies
the
strong
Fortress
of
Wyck
,
to
which
it
is
join'd
by
a
stone
Bridge
of
six
fair
Arches
.
<EOS>
The
design
was
,
by
a
false
Attack
on
that
regular
Fortification
to
draw
the
Strength
of
the
Garrison
to
its
Defence
,
which
was
but
very
natural
to
imagine
would
be
the
Consequence
.
<EOS>
Ready
to
attend
that
well
concerted
false
Attack
,
a
large
flat
bottom'd
Boat
,
properly
furnish'd
with
Barrels
of
Gun
-
Powder
,
and
other
Necessaries
,
was
to
fall
down
under
one
of
the
middle
Arches
,
and
when
fix'd
there
,
by
firing
the
Powder
to
have
blown
up
the
Bridge
,
and
by
that
means
to
have
prevented
the
Return
of
the
Garrison
to
oppose
a
real
Attack
at
that
instant
of
Time
to
be
made
upon
the
Town
of
Maestrich
by
the
whole
Army
.
  
<EOS>
The
false
Attack
on
Wyck
was
accordingly
made
,
which
,
as
propos'd
,
drew
the
Main
of
the
Garrison
of
Maestrich
to
its
Defence
,
and
the
Boat
<EOS>
so
furnish'd
fell
down
the
River
as
projected
,
but
unfortunately
,
before
it
could
reach
the
Arch
,
from
the
Darkness
of
the
Night
,
running
upon
a
Shoal
,
it
could
not
be
got
off
;
for
which
Reason
the
Men
in
the
Boat
were
glad
to
make
a
hasty
Escape
for
fear
of
being
discovered
;
as
the
Boat
was
,
next
Morning
;
and
the
whole
Design
laid
open
.
  
<EOS>
This
Stratagem
thus
miscarrying
,
all
Things
were
immediately
got
ready
for
a
general
Storm
,
at
the
main
Breach
in
the
Town
;
and
the
rather
,
because
the
Prince
of
Orange
had
receiv'd
<EOS>
incontestable
Intelligence
,
That
Duke
Schomberg
,
at
the
Head
of
the
French
Army
,
was
in
full
march
to
relieve
the
Place
.
<EOS>
But
before
every
Thing
could
be
rightly
got
ready
for
the
intended
Storm
(
though
some
there
were
who
pretended
to
say
,
that
a
Dispute
rais'd
by
the
Spaniards
with
the
Dutch
,
about
the
Propriety
of
the
Town
,
when
taken
,
was
the
Cause
of
that
Delay
)
<EOS>
we
heard
at
some
distance
several
Guns
fir'd
as
Signals
of
Relief
;
upon
which
we
precipitately
,
and
,
as
most
imagin'd
,
shamefully
drew
off
from
before
the
Place
,
and
join'd
the
grand
Army
under
Prince
Waldeck
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
Matter
of
yet
greater
Surprize
to
most
on
the
Spot
,
that
when
the
Armies
were
so
joyn'd
,
we
did
not
stay
to
offer
the
Enemy
Battle
.
<EOS>
The
well
known
Courage
of
the
Prince
,
then
Generalissimo
,
was
so
far
from
solving
this
Riddle
,
that
it
rather
puzzled
all
who
thought
of
it
;
however
,
the
prevailing
Opinion
was
,
that
it
was
occasion'd
<EOS>
by
some
great
Misunderstanding
between
the
Spaniards
and
the
Dutch
.
<EOS>
And
Experience
will
evince
,
that
this
was
not
the
only
Disappointment
of
that
Nature
,
occasion'd
by
imperfect
Understandings
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
the
Number
of
common
Soldiers
slain
in
this
Attack
,
which
was
not
inconsiderable
,
we
lost
here
<EOS>
the
brave
Rhingrave
,
a
Person
much
lamented
on
account
of
his
many
other
excellent
Qualifications
,
as
well
as
that
of
a
General
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Ralph
Widdrington
,
and
Colonel
Doleman
(
who
had
not
<EOS>
enjoy'd
Widdrington
's
Commission
above
a
Fortnight
)
.
<EOS>
Captain
Douglas
,
Captain
Barnwell
,
and
Captain
Lee
,
were
of
the
Slain
among
the
English
;
who
,
indeed
,
had
born
the
whole
brunt
of
the
Attack
upon
the
Dauphin
's
Bastion
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
during
the
Siege
,
receiv'd
<EOS>
a
Shot
through
his
Arm
;
<EOS>
which
giving
an
immediate
Alarm
to
the
Troops
under
his
Command
,
he
took
his
Hat
off
his
Head
with
the
wounded
Arm
,
and
smiling
,
wav'd
it
,
to
shew
them
<EOS>
there
was
no
danger
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
after
the
most
gallant
Defence
against
the
most
couragious
Onsets
,
ended
the
Siege
of
Maestrich
;
and
with
it
all
that
was
material
that
Campaign
.
  
<EOS>
Early
in
the
Spring
,
in
the
Year
1677
,
the
French
Army
,
under
the
Duke
of
Orleans
,
besieged
at
once
,
both
Cambray
and
Saint
Omers
.
<EOS>
This
last
the
Prince
of
Orange
seem'd
<EOS>
very
intent
and
resolute
to
relieve
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
which
,
well
knowing
by
sad
Experience
,
it
would
be
to
little
purpose
to
wait
the
majestick
Motions
of
the
Spaniards
,
that
Prince
got
together
what
Forces
he
could
,
all
in
Dutch
Pay
,
and
marching
forward
with
all
speed
,
resolv'd
,
even
at
the
Hazard
of
a
Battle
,
to
attempt
the
Raising
the
Siege
.
<EOS>
Upon
his
appearing
the
Duke
of
Orleans
,
to
whose
particular
Conduct
the
Care
of
that
Siege
was
committed
,
drew
off
from
before
the
Place
,
leaving
scarce
enough
of
his
Men
to
defend
the
Trenches
.
<EOS>
The
Prince
was
under
the
Necessity
of
marching
his
Forces
over
a
Morass
;
and
the
Duke
,
<EOS>
well
knowing
it
,
took
care
to
attack
him
near
Mont
Cassel
,
before
half
his
little
Army
were
got
over
.
<EOS>
The
Dispute
was
very
sharp
,
but
the
Prince
being
much
out
number'd
,
and
his
Troops
not
able
,
by
the
Straitness
of
the
Passage
,
to
engage
all
at
once
,
was
oblig'd
<EOS>
at
last
to
retreat
,
which
he
did
in
pretty
good
Order
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
Dutch
Troops
did
not
all
alike
do
their
Duty
;
and
the
Prince
seeing
one
of
the
Officers
on
his
fullest
speed
,
call'd
to
him
over
and
over
to
halt
;
which
the
Officer
in
too
must
haste
to
obey
,
the
Prince
gave
him
a
Slash
over
the
Face
,
saying
,
By
this
Mark
I
shall
know
you
another
Time
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
Retreat
of
the
Prince
,
Saint
Omers
was
surrender'd
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
Retreat
the
Prince
marching
back
,
lay
for
some
time
among
the
Boors
,
who
from
the
good
Discipline
,
which
he
took
care
to
make
his
Troops
observe
,
did
not
give
us
their
customary
boorish
Reception
.
<EOS>
And
yet
as
secure
as
we
might
think
our
selves
,
I
met
with
a
little
Passage
that
confirm'd
<EOS>
in
me
the
Notions
,
which
the
generality
as
well
as
I
,
had
imbib'd
of
the
private
Barbarity
of
those
People
,
whenever
an
Opportunity
falls
in
their
Way
.
<EOS>
I
was
stroling
at
a
Distance
from
my
Quarters
,
all
alone
,
when
I
found
my
self
near
one
of
their
Houses
;
into
which
,
the
Doors
being
open
,
I
ventur'd
to
enter
.
<EOS>
I
saw
no
body
when
I
came
in
,
though
the
House
was
,
for
that
Sort
of
People
,
well
enough
furnish'd
,
and
in
pretty
decent
Order
.
<EOS>
I
call'd
,
but
no
body
answering
,
I
had
the
Curiosity
to
advance
a
little
farther
,
when
,
at
the
Mouth
of
the
Oven
,
which
had
not
yet
wholly
lost
its
Heat
,
I
spy'd
the
Corpse
of
a
Man
so
bloated
,
swoln
and
parch'd
,
as
left
me
little
room
to
doubt
,
that
the
Oven
had
been
the
Scene
of
his
Destiny
.
<EOS>
I
confess
the
Sight
struck
me
with
Horror
;
and
as
much
Courage
and
Security
as
I
enter'd
<EOS>
with
,
I
withdrew
in
haste
,
and
with
quite
different
Sentiments
,
and
could
not
fansy
my
self
out
of
Danger
till
I
had
reach'd
<EOS>
our
Camp
.
<EOS>
A
wise
Man
should
not
frame
an
Accusation
on
Conjectures
;
but
,
on
Inquiry
,
I
was
soon
made
sensible
,
that
such
barbarous
Usage
is
too
common
among
those
People
;
especially
if
they
meet
with
a
Straggler
,
of
what
Nation
soever
.
  
<EOS>
This
made
me
not
very
sorry
when
we
decamp'd
,
and
we
soon
after
receiv'd
Orders
to
march
and
invest
Charleroy
;
before
which
Place
we
stay'd
<EOS>
somewhat
above
a
Week
,
and
then
drew
off
.
<EOS>
I
remember
very
well
,
that
I
was
not
the
only
Person
then
in
the
Camp
that
was
at
a
Loss
to
dive
into
the
Reason
of
this
Investiture
and
Decampment
:
<EOS>
But
since
I
at
that
time
,
among
the
Politicians
of
the
Army
,
never
heard
a
good
one
,
I
shall
not
venture
to
offer
my
Sentiments
at
so
great
a
Distance
.
  
<EOS>
We
,
after
this
march'd
towards
Mons
;
and
,
in
our
March
,
pass'd
over
the
very
Grounds
on
which
the
Battle
of
Seneff
had
been
fought
three
Years
before
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
no
little
Pleasure
,
that
I
re
-
survey'd
a
Place
<EOS>
,
that
had
once
been
of
so
much
Danger
to
me
;
and
where
my
Memory
and
Fansy
now
repeated
back
all
those
Observations
I
had
then
made
under
some
unavoidable
Confusion
.
<EOS>
Young
as
I
was
,
both
in
Years
and
Experience
,
from
my
own
Reflections
,
and
the
Sentiments
of
others
,
after
the
Fight
was
over
,
methought
<EOS>
I
saw
visibly
before
me
<EOS>
the
well
order'd
Disposition
of
the
Prince
of
Conde
;
the
inexpressible
Difficulties
which
the
Prince
of
Orange
had
to
encounter
with
;
while
at
the
same
Moment
I
could
not
omit
to
repay
my
Debt
to
the
Memory
of
my
first
Patron
,
Sir
Walter
Vane
,
who
there
loosing
his
Life
,
left
me
a
solitary
Wanderer
to
the
wide
World
of
Fortune
.
  
<EOS>
But
these
Thoughts
soon
gave
place
to
new
Objects
,
which
every
Hour
presented
themselves
in
our
continu'd
March
to
Enghien
,
a
Place
famous
for
the
finest
Gardens
in
all
Flanders
,
near
which
we
encamp'd
,
on
the
very
same
Ground
which
the
French
chose
some
Years
after
at
the
Battle
of
Steenkirk
:
of
which
I
shall
speak
in
its
proper
Place
.
<EOS>
Here
the
Prince
of
Orange
left
our
Army
,
as
we
afterwards
found
,
to
pass
into
England
;
<EOS>
where
he
marry'd
<EOS>
the
Princess
Mary
,
Daughter
of
the
Duke
of
York
.
<EOS>
And
after
his
Departure
,
that
Campaign
ended
without
any
thing
further
material
.
  
<EOS>
Now
began
the
Year
1678
,
famous
for
the
Peace
,
and
no
less
remarkable
for
an
Action
previous
to
it
,
which
has
not
fail'd
to
employ
the
Talents
of
Men
,
variously
,
as
they
stood
affected
.
<EOS>
Our
Army
,
under
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
lay
encamp'd
<EOS>
at
Soignies
,
where
it
was
whisper'd
that
the
Peace
was
concluded
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
which
,
two
Days
after
,
being
Sunday
the
17th
Day
of
August
,
the
Army
was
drawn
out
,
as
most
others
as
well
as
my
self
apprehended
,
in
order
to
feux
de
Joye
;
but
in
lieu
of
that
,
we
found
our
March
order'd
towards
St.
Dennis
,
where
the
Duke
of
Luxembourg
lay
,
as
he
imagin'd
,
safe
in
inaccessible
Entrenchments
.
  
<EOS>
About
three
of
the
Clock
our
Army
arriv'd
<EOS>
there
,
when
we
receiv'd
Orders
to
make
the
Attack
.
<EOS>
It
began
with
a
most
vigorous
Spirit
,
that
promis'd
no
less
than
the
Success
which
ensu'd
.
<EOS>
The
three
English
and
three
Scotch
Regiments
,
under
the
Command
of
the
ever
renown'd
Earl
of
Ossory
,
together
with
the
Prince
of
Orange
's
Guards
,
made
their
Attack
at
a
Place
call'd
the
Chateau
;
where
the
French
took
their
Refuge
among
a
Parcel
of
Hop
-
Poles
;
but
their
Resource
was
as
weak
as
their
Defence
;
and
they
were
soon
beaten
out
with
a
very
great
Slaughter
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
a
French
Officer
having
his
Pistol
directed
at
the
Breast
of
the
Prince
,
Monsieur
D'Auverquerque
interpos'd
,
and
shot
the
Officer
dead
upon
the
Spot
.
  
<EOS>
The
Fight
lasted
from
three
in
the
Afternoon
till
Nine
at
Night
;
when
growing
dark
,
the
Duke
of
Luxembourg
forsook
his
Entrenchments
,
<EOS>
into
which
we
march'd
<EOS>
next
Morning
.
<EOS>
And
to
see
the
sudden
Change
of
Things
!
<EOS>
that
very
Spot
of
Ground
,
where
nothing
but
Fire
and
Fury
appear'd
<EOS>
the
Day
before
,
the
yest
saw
solac'd
with
the
Proclamation
of
a
Peace
.
  
<EOS>
About
an
Hour
before
the
Attack
began
,
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
arriv'd
<EOS>
in
the
Army
,
being
kindly
receiv'd
by
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
bravely
fighting
by
his
Side
,
all
that
Day
.
<EOS>
The
Woods
and
the
Unevenness
of
the
Ground
,
render'd
the
Cavalry
almost
useless
;
yet
I
saw
a
Standard
,
among
some
others
,
which
was
taken
from
the
Enemy
,
being
richly
embroidered
with
Gold
and
Silver
,
bearing
the
Sun
in
the
Zodiack
,
with
these
haughty
Words
,
Nihil
obstabit
eunte
.
<EOS>
On
the
News
of
this
unexpected
Victory
,
the
States
of
Holland
sent
to
congratulate
the
Prince
;
and
to
testify
how
much
they
valued
his
Preservation
,
they
presented
Monsieur
D'Auverquerque
,
who
had
so
bravely
rescued
him
,
with
a
Sword
,
whose
Handle
was
of
massy
Gold
set
with
Diamonds
.
<EOS>
I
forgot
to
mention
that
this
Gentleman
receiv'd
a
Shot
on

<EOS>
Lieut

<EOS>
Col

Babington
,
who
began
the
Attack
,
by
beating
the
French
out

Prisoner

<EOS>
Col

Hales
,
who
was
a
long
time
Governor
of
Chelsea
College
,
being
then
a
Captain
,
received
a
Shot
on
his
Leg
,
of
which
he
went
lame
to
his
dying
Day
.
  
<EOS>
The
War
thus
ended
by
the
Peace
of
Nimeugen
,
The
Regiment
in
which
I
serv'd
,
was
appointed
to
be
in
Garrison
at
the
Grave
.
<EOS>
We
lay
there
near
four
Years
,
our
Soldiers
being
mostly
employ'd
about
the
Fortifications
.
<EOS>
It
was
here
,
and
by
that
Means
,
that
I
imbib'd
<EOS>
the
Rudiments
of
Fortification
,
and
the
practick
Part
of
an
Enginier
,
which
in
my
more
advanc'd
Years
was
of
no
small
Service
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
in
the
Year
1684
,
our
Regiment
receiv'd
Orders
to
march
to
Haren
,
near
Brussels
,
where
,
with
other
Forces
,
we
encamp'd
,
till
we
heard
that
Luxemburg
,
invaded
by
the
French
,
in
a
Time
of
the
profoundest
Peace
,
had
surrender'd
to
them
.
<EOS>
Then
we
decamp'd
,
and
march'd
to
Mechlin
;
where
we
lay
in
the
Field
till
near
November
.
<EOS>
Not
that
there
was
any
War
proclaim'd
;
but
as
not
knowing
,
whether
those
who
had
committed
such
Acts
of
Hostility
in
time
of
Peace
might
not
take
it
in
their
Heads
to
proceed
yet
further
.
<EOS>
In
November
we
march'd
into
that
Town
,
where
Count
Nivelle
was
Governor
:
The
Marquiss
de
Grana
,
at
the
same
time
,
governing
the
Netherlands
in
the
Jurisdiction
of
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
of
any
Moment
happen'd
<EOS>
after
this
,
till
the
Death
of
King
Charles
II
.
<EOS>
The
Summer
after
which
,
the
three
English
and
three
Scotch
Regiments
receiv'd
Orders
to
pass
over
into
England
,
upon
the
Occasion
of
Monmouth
's
Rebellion
;
where
,
upon
our
Arrival
,
we
receiv'd
Orders
to
encamp
on
Hounslow
-
Heath
.
<EOS>
But
that
Rebellion
being
soon
stifled
,
and
King
James
having
no
farther
Need
of
us
,
those
Regiments
were
order'd
to
return
again
to
Holland
,
into
the
proper
Service
of
those
who
paid
them
.
  
<EOS>
Tho
'
I
am
no
stiff
Adherer
to
the
Doctrine
of
Predestination
,
yet
to
the
full
Assurance
of
a
Providence
I
never
could
fail
to
adhere
.
<EOS>
Thence
came
it
,
that
my
natural
Desire
to
serve
my
own
native
Country
prevail'd
upon
me
to
quit
the
Service
of
another
,
though
its
Neighbour
and
Allie
.
<EOS>
Events
are
not
always
to
direct
the
Judgment
;
and
therefore
whether
I
did
best
in
following
those
fondling
Dictates
of
Nature
,
I
shall
neither
question
nor
determine
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
not
long
after
my
Arrival
in
England
before
I
had
a
Commission
given
me
by
King
James
,
to
be
a
Lieutenant
in
a
new
rais'd
Regiment
under
the
Command
of
Colonel
Tufton
,
Brother
to
the
Earl
of
Thanet
.
<EOS>
Under
this
Commission
I
sojourn'd
out
<EOS>
two
peaceable
Campaigns
on
Hounslow
-
Heath
;
where
I
was
an
Eye
-
Witness
of
one
mock
Siege
of
Buda
:
After
which
our
Regiment
was
order'd
to
Berwick
,
where
I
remained
till
the
Revolution
.
  
<EOS>
King
James
having
abdicated
the
Throne
,
and
the
Prince
of
Orange
accepting
the
Administration
,
all
Commissions
were
order'd
to
be
renew'd
<EOS>
in
his
Name
.
<EOS>
The
Officers
of
our
Regiment
,
as
well
as
others
,
severally
took
out
theirs
accordingly
,
a
very
few
excepted
,
of
which
Number
was
our
Colonel
;
who
refusing
a
Compliance
,
his
Commission
was
given
to
Sir
James
Lesley
.
  
<EOS>
The
Prince
of
Orange
presently
after
was
declar'd
and
proclaim'd
King
,
and
his
Princess
Queen
,
with
a
conjunctive
Power
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
our
Regiment
was
order'd
into
Scotland
,
where
Affairs
appear'd
under
a
Face
of
Disquietude
.
<EOS>
We
had
our
Quarters
at
Leith
,
till
the
Time
the
Castle
of
Edinburgh
,
then
under
the
Command
of
the
Duke
of
Gordon
,
had
surrender'd
.
<EOS>
After
which
,
pursuant
to
fresh
Orders
,
we
march'd
to
Inverness
,
a
Place
of
no
great
Strength
,
and
as
little
Beauty
;
though
yet
I
think
I
may
say
,
without
the
least
Danger
of
an
Hyperbole
,
that
it
is
as
pleasant
as
most
Places
in
that
Country
.
<EOS>
Here
we
lay
two
long
Winters
,
perpetually
harrass'd
upon
Parties
,
and
hunting
of
somewhat
wilder
than
their
wildest
Game
,
namely
,
the
Highlanders
,
who
were
,
if
not
as
nimble
footed
,
yet
fully
as
hard
to
be
found
.
  
<EOS>
But
General
Mackay
having
receiv'd
Orders
to
build
a
Fort
at
Inverlochy
,
our
Regiment
,
among
others
,
was
commanded
to
that
Service
.
<EOS>
The
two
Regiments
appointed
on
the
same
Duty
,
with
some
few
Dragoons
,
were
already
on
their
March
,
which
having
join'd
,
we
march'd
together
through
Louquebar
.
<EOS>
This
sure
is
the
wildest
Country
in
the
Highlands
,
if
not
in
the
World
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
see
one
House
in
all
our
March
;
and
their
Oeconomy
,
if
I
may
call
it
such
,
is
much
the
same
with
that
of
the
Arabs
or
Tartars
.
<EOS>
Hutts
,
or
Cabins
of
Trees
and
Trash
,
are
their
Places
of
Habitation
;
in
which
they
dwell
,
till
their
half
-
horn'd
Cattle
have
devour'd
the
Grass
,
and
then
remove
,
staying
<EOS>
no
where
longer
than
that
Convenience
invites
them
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
March
,
or
rather
,
if
you
please
,
most
dismal
Peregrination
,
we
could
be
very
rarely
go
two
on
a
Breast
;
and
oftner
,
like
Geeze
in
a
String
,
one
after
another
.
<EOS>
So
that
our
very
little
Army
had
sometimes
,
or
rather
most
commonly
,
an
Extent
of
many
Miles
;
our
Enemy
,
the
Highlanders
,
firing
down
upon
us
from
their
Summits
all
the
Way
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
it
possible
for
our
Men
,
or
very
rarely
at
least
,
to
return
their
Favours
with
any
Prospect
of
Success
;
for
as
they
pop'd
upon
us
always
on
a
sudden
,
they
never
stay'd
long
enough
to
allow
any
of
our
Soldiers
a
Mark
;
or
even
time
enough
to
fire
:
<EOS>
And
for
our
Men
to
march
,
or
climb
up
those
Mountains
,
which
to
them
were
natural
Champion
,
would
have
been
as
dangerous
as
it
seem'd
to
us
impracticable
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
under
all
these
disheartning
Disadvantages
,
we
arriv'd
at
Inverlochy
,
and
there
perform'd
the
Task
appointed
,
building
a
Fort
on
the
same
Spot
where
Cromwell
had
<EOS>
rais'd
one
before
.
<EOS>
And
which
was
not
a
little
remarkable
,
we
had
with
us
one
Hill
,
a
Colonel
,
who
had
been
Governor
in
Oliver
's
Time
,
and
who
was
now
again
appointed
Governor
by
General
Mackay
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
Work
on
which
we
were
sent
being
effected
,
we
march'd
back
again
by
the
Way
of
Gillycrancky
,
where
that
memorable
Battle
under
Dundee
had
been
fought
the
Year
before
.
  
<EOS>
Some
time
after
,
Sir
Thomas
Levingston
,
afterwards
Earl
of
Tiviot
,
having
receiv'd
<EOS>
Intelligence
that
the
Highlanders
intended
to
fall
down
into
the
lower
Countries
,
in
a
considerable
Body
,
got
together
a
Party
of
about
five
Hundred
(
the
Dragoons
,
call'd
<EOS>
the
Scotch
Greys
,
inclusive
)
<EOS>
with
which
he
resolv'd
,
if
possible
,
to
give
them
a
Meeting
.
<EOS>
We
left
Inverness
the
last
Day
of
April
,
and
encamp'd
near
a
little
Town
call'd
Forrest
,
the
Place
where
,
as
Tradition
still
confidently
avers
,
the
Witches
met
Mackbeth
,
and
greeted
him
with
their
diabolical
Auspices
.
<EOS>
But
this
Story
is
so
naturally
display'd
in
a
Play
of
the
immortal
Shakespear
,
that
I
need
not
descend
here
to
any
farther
Particulars
.
  
<EOS>
Here
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
receiv'd
Intelligence
,
that
the
Highlanders
design'd
to
encamp
upon
the
Spey
,
near
the
Laird
of
Grant
's
Castle
.
<EOS>
Whereupon
we
began
our
March
about
Noon
;
and
the
next
Day
,
about
the
Break
thereof
,
we
came
to
that
River
,
where
we
soon
discover'd
the
Highlanders
by
their
Fires
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
immediately
,
on
Sight
of
it
,
issued
his
Orders
for
our
fording
the
River
,
and
falling
upon
them
as
soon
after
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Both
were
accordingly
perform'd
,
and
with
so
good
Order
,
Secrecy
and
Success
,
that
Cannon
and
Balfour
,
their
Commanders
,
were
obliged
to
make
their
Escape
naked
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
about
one
Thousand
in
Number
,
of
which
were
kill'd
about
three
Hundred
;
we
pursued
them
,
till
they
got
up
Crowdale
-
Hill
,
where
we
lost
them
in
a
Fog
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
so
high
is
that
Hill
,
that
they
,
who
perfectly
knew
it
,
assured
me
that
it
never
is
without
a
little
dark
Fog
hanging
over
it
.
<EOS>
And
to
me
,
at
that
Instant
of
Time
,
they
seem'd
rather
to
be
People
receiv'd
up
into
Clouds
,
than
flying
from
an
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Near
this
there
was
an
old
Castle
,
call'd
<EOS>
Lethendy
,
into
which
about
Fifty
of
them
made
their
Retreat
,
most
of
them
Gentlemen
,
resolving
there
to
defend
themselves
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
sent
a
Messenger
to
them
,
with
an
Offer
of
Mercy
,
if
they
would
surrender
:
But
they
refus'd
<EOS>
the
profer'd
Quarter
,
and
fir'd
upon
our
Men
,
killing
two
of
our
Grenadiers
,
and
wounding
another
.
<EOS>
During
my
Quarters
at
the
Grave
,
having
learnt
to
throw
a
Grenado
,
I
took
three
or
four
in
a
Bag
,
and
crept
down
by
the
Side
of
a
Ditch
,
or
Dyke
,
to
an
old
thatch'd
House
near
the
Castle
,
imagining
,
on
my
mounting
the
same
,
I
might
be
near
enough
to
throw
them
,
so
as
to
do
execution
.
<EOS>
I
found
all
Things
answer
my
Expectation
;
and
the
Castle
wanting
a
Cover
,
I
threw
in
a
Grenado
,
which
put
the
Enemy
immediately
into
Confusion
.
<EOS>
The
Second
had
not
so
good
Success
,
falling
short
,
and
the
Third
burst
as
soon
as
it
was
well
out
of
my
Hand
,
though
without
Damage
to
my
self
.
<EOS>
But
throwing
the
Fourth
in
at
a
Window
,
it
so
increas'd
the
Confusion
,
which
the
first
had
put
them
into
,
that
they
immediately
call'd
out
to
me
,
upon
their
Parole
of
Safety
,
to
come
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
went
up
to
the
Door
,
which
they
had
barricaded
,
and
made
up
with
great
Stones
;
when
they
told
me
they
were
ready
to
surrender
upon
Condition
of
obtaining
Mercy
.
<EOS>
I
return'd
to
Sir
Thomas
;
and
telling
him
what
I
had
done
,
and
the
Consequence
of
it
,
and
the
Message
they
had
<EOS>
desir'd
<EOS>
me
to
deliver
(
a
great
many
of
the
Highland
Gentlemen
,
not
of
this
Party
,
being
with
him
)
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
,
in
a
high
Voice
,
and
broad
Scotch
,
best
to
be
heard
and
understood
,
order'd
<EOS>
me
back
to
tell
'em
<EOS>
,
He
would
cut
them
all
to
Pieces
,
for
their
Murder
of
two
of
his
Grenadiers
,
after
his
Proffer
of
Quarter
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
returning
full
of
these
melancholy
Tidings
,
when
Sir
Thomas
,
advancing
after
me
a
little
Distance
from
the
rest
of
the
Company
;
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
Sir
,
says
he
,
I
believe
there
may
be
among
'em
some
of
our
old
Acquaintance
(
for
we
had
serv'd
together
in
the
Service
of
the
States
in
Flanders
)
<EOS>
therefore
tell
them
they
shall
have
good
Quarter
.
<EOS>
I
very
willingly
carry'd
<EOS>
back
a
Message
to
much
chang'd
to
my
Mind
;
and
upon
delivering
of
it
,
without
the
least
Hesitation
,
they
threw
down
the
Barricado
,
open'd
<EOS>
the
Door
,
and
out
came
one
Brody
,
who
,
as
he
then
told
me
,
had
had
a
Piece
of
his
Nose
taken
off
by
one
of
my
Grenadoes
.
<EOS>
I
carry'd
him
to
Sir
Thomas
,
who
confirming
my
Message
,
they
all
came
out
,
and
surrendered
themselves
Prisoners
.
<EOS>
This
happen'd
on
May
Day
in
the
Morning
;
for
which
Reason
we
return'd
to
Inverness
with
our
Prisoners
,
and
Boughs
in
our
Hats
;
and
the
Highlanders
never
held
up
their
Heads
so
high
after
this
Defeat
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
Success
Sir
Thomas
wrote
to
Court
,
giving
a
full
Account
of
the
whole
Action
.
<EOS>
In
which
being
pleas'd
to
make
mention
of
my
Behaviour
,
with
some
Particularities
,
I
had
soon
after
a
Commission
order'd
me
for
a
Company
in
the
Regiment
under
the
Command
of
Brigadier
Tiffin
.
  
<EOS>
My
Commission
being
made
out
,
sign'd
,
and
sent
to
me
,
I
repair'd
immediately
to
Portsmouth
,
where
the
Regiment
lay
in
Garrison
.
<EOS>
A
few
Days
after
I
had
been
there
,
Admiral
Russel
arriv'd
with
the
Fleet
,
and
anchor'd
at
St.
Hellen
's
,
where
he
remain'd
about
a
Week
.
<EOS>
On
the
18th
of
May
the
whole
Fleet
set
Sail
;
and
it
being
my
Turn
the
same
Day
to
mount
the
Main
Guard
,
I
was
going
the
Rounds
very
early
,
when
I
heard
great
shooting
at
Sea
.
<EOS>
I
went
directly
to
acquaint
the
Governor
,
and
told
him
my
Sentiments
,
that
the
two
contending
Fleets
were
actually
engag'd
,
which
indeed
prov'd
true
;
for
that
very
Night
a
Pinnace
,
which
came
from
our
Fleet
,
brought
News
that
Admiral
Russel
had
engag'd
<EOS>
the
French
Admiral
Turvile
;
<EOS>
and
,
after
a
long
and
sharp
Dispute
,
was
making
after
them
to
their
own
Coasts
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
Day
,
towards
Evening
,
several
other
Expresses
arriv'd
,
one
after
another
,
all
agreeing
in
the
Defeat
of
the
French
Fleet
,
and
in
the
Particulars
of
the
burning
their
Rising
Sun
,
together
with
many
other
of
their
Men
of
War
,
at
la
Hogue
.
<EOS>
All
which
Expresses
were
immediately
forwarded
to
Court
by
Mr.
Gibson
,
our
Governor
.
  
<EOS>
About
two
Months
after
this
,
our
Regiment
,
among
many
others
,
was
,
according
to
Order
,
<EOS>
shipp'd
off
on
a
Secret
Expedition
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Duke
of
Leinster
,
no
Man
knowing
to
what
Place
we
were
going
,
or
on
what
Design
;
no
,
not
the
Commander
himself
.
<EOS>
However
,
when
we
were
out
at
Sea
,
the
General
,
according
to
Instructions
,
opening
his
Commission
,
we
were
soon
put
out
of
our
Suspence
,
and
inform'd
,
that
our
Orders
were
to
attack
Dunkirk
.
<EOS>
But
what
was
so
grand
a
Secret
to
those
concern'd
in
the
Expedition
,
having
been
intrusted
to
a
Female
Politician
on
Land
<EOS>
,
it
was
soon
discover'd
to
the
Enemy
;
for
which
Reason
our
Orders
were
countermanded
,
before
we
<EOS>
reach'd
<EOS>
the
Place
of
Action
,
and
our
Forces
receiv'd
Directions
to
land
at
Ostend
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
happen'd
that
memorable
Battle
at
Steenkirk
,
which
as
very
few
at
that
Time
could
dive
into
the
Reason
of
,
and
mistaken
Accounts
of
it
have
pass'd
for
authentick
,
I
will
mention
somewhat
more
particularly
:
The
Undertaking
was
bold
;
and
,
as
many
thought
,
bolder
than
was
consistent
with
the
Character
of
the
wise
Undertaker
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
French
having
taken
Namure
;
and
,
as
the
Malecontents
alledg'd
,
in
the
very
Sight
of
a
superior
Army
;
and
nothing
having
been
done
by
Land
of
any
moment
,
Things
were
blown
into
such
a
dangerous
Fermentation
,
by
a
malicious
and
lying
Spirit
,
that
King
William
found
himself
under
a
Necessity
of
attempting
something
that
might
appease
the
Murmurs
of
the
People
.
<EOS>
He
knew
very
well
,
though
spoke
in
the
Senate
,
that
it
was
not
true
,
that
his
Forces
at
the
Siege
of
Namure
exceeded
those
of
the
Enemy
;
no
Man
could
be
more
afflicted
than
he
at
the
overflowing
of
the
Mehaigne
,
from
the
continual
Rains
,
which
obstructed
the
Relief
he
had
designed
for
that
important
Place
;
yet
since
his
Maligners
made
an
ill
Use
of
these
false
Topicks
,
to
insinuate
that
he
had
no
Mind
to
put
an
End
to
the
War
,
he
was
resolv'd
to
evince
the
contrary
,
by
shewing
them
that
he
was
not
afraid
to
venture
his
Life
for
the
better
obtaining
what
was
so
much
desired
.
  
<EOS>
To
that
Purpose
,
receiving
Intelligence
that
the
Duke
of
Luxemburg
lay
strongly
encamp'd
<EOS>
at
Steenkirk
,
near
Enghien
(
tho
'
<EOS>
he
was
sensible
he
must
pass
through
many
Defiles
to
engage
him
;
and
that
the
many
Thickets
between
the
two
Armies
would
frequently
afford
him
new
Difficulties
)
<EOS>
he
resolv'd
there
to
attack
him
.
<EOS>
Our
Troops
at
first
were
forc'd
to
hew
out
their
Passage
for
the
Horse
;
and
there
was
no
one
difficulty
that
his
Imagination
had
drawn
that
was
lessen'd
by
Experience
;
and
yet
so
prosperous
were
his
Arms
at
the
Beginning
,
that
our
Troops
had
made
themselves
Masters
of
several
Pieces
of
the
Enemy
's
Cannon
.
<EOS>
But
the
farther
he
advanc'd
,
the
Ground
growing
straiter
,
so
strait
as
not
to
admit
his
Army
's
being
drawn
up
in
Battalia
,
the
Troops
behind
could
not
give
timely
Succour
to
those
engag'd
,
and
the
Cannon
we
had
taken
was
forcibly
left
behind
in
order
to
make
a
good
Retreat
.
<EOS>
The
French
had
lost
all
their
Courage
in
the
Onset
;
for
though
they
had
too
fair
an
Opportunity
,
they
did
not
think
fit
to
pursue
it
;
or
,
at
least
,
did
it
very
languidly
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
Malecontents
at
Home
,
I
remember
,
grew
very
well
pleas'd
after
this
;
for
so
long
as
they
had
but
a
Battle
for
their
Money
,
like
true
Englishmen
,
lost
or
won
,
they
were
contented
.
  
<EOS>
Several
Causes
,
I
remember
,
were
assign'd
for
this
Miscarriage
,
as
they
<EOS>
call'd
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
;
Some
there
were
who
were
willing
to
lay
it
upon
the
Dutch
;
and
alledge
a
Saying
of
one
of
their
Generals
,
who
receiving
Orders
to
relieve
some
English
and
Scotch
that
were
over
-
power'd
,
was
heard
to
say
,
<EOS>
Dam
'em
,
since
they
love
Fighting
let
'em
have
their
Bellies
full
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
rather
impute
the
Disappointment
to
the
great
Loss
of
so
many
of
our
bravest
Officers
at
the
very
first
Onset
.
<EOS>
General
Mackay
,
Colonel
Lanier
,
the
Earl
of
Angus
,
with
both
his
Field
-
Officers
,
Sir
Robert
Douglas
,
Colonel
Hodges
,
and
many
others
falling
<EOS>
,
it
was
enough
to
put
a
very
considerable
Army
into
Confusion
.
<EOS>
I
remember
one
particular
Action
of
Sir
Robert
Douglas
,
that
I
should
think
my
self
to
blame
<EOS>
should
I
omit
:
<EOS>
Seeing
his
Colours
on
the
other
Side
the
Hedge
,
in
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
,
he
leap'd
over
,
slew
the
Officer
that
had
them
,
and
then
threw
them
over
the
Hedge
to
his
Company
;
redeeming
his
Colours
at
the
Expense
of
his
Life
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
Scotch
Commander
improv'd
upon
the
Roman
General
;
for
the
brave
Posthumius
cast
his
Standard
in
the
Middle
of
the
Enemy
for
his
Soldiers
to
retrieve
,
but
Douglas
retriev'd
his
from
the
Middle
of
the
Enemy
,
without
any
Assistance
,
and
cast
it
back
to
his
Soldiers
to
retain
,
after
he
had
so
bravely
rescued
it
out
of
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
From
hence
our
Regiment
receiv'd
Orders
to
march
to
Dixmuyd
,
where
we
lay
some
time
employ'd
in
fortifying
that
Place
.
<EOS>
While
we
were
there
,
I
had
one
Morning
stedfastly
fix'd
my
Eyes
upon
some
Ducks
,
that
were
swimming
in
a
large
Water
before
me
;
<EOS>
when
all
on
a
sudden
,
in
the
Midst
of
a
perfect
Calm
,
I
observ'd
<EOS>
such
a
strange
and
strong
Agitation
in
the
Waters
,
<EOS>
that
prodigiously
surpriz'd
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
the
same
Moment
seiz'd
with
such
a
Giddiness
in
my
Head
,
that
,
for
a
Minute
or
two
,
I
was
scarce
sensible
,
and
had
much
a
-
do
to
keep
on
my
Legs
.
<EOS>
I
had
never
felt
any
thing
of
an
Earthquake
before
,
which
,
as
I
soon
after
understood
from
others
,
this
was
;
and
it
left
,
indeed
,
very
apparent
Marks
of
its
Force
in
a
great
Rent
in
the
Body
of
the
great
Church
,
which
remains
to
this
Day
.
  
<EOS>
Having
brought
the
intended
Fortifications
into
some
tolerable
Order
,
we
receiv'd
a
Command
out
of
hand
to
reimbarque
for
England
.
<EOS>
And
,
upon
our
Landing
,
Directions
met
us
to
march
for
Ipswich
,
where
we
had
our
Quarters
all
that
Winter
.
<EOS>
From
thence
we
were
order'd
up
to
London
,
to
do
Duty
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
there
long
,
before
an
Accident
happen'd
,
as
little
to
be
accounted
for
,
without
a
divine
Providence
,
as
some
would
make
that
Providence
to
be
,
that
only
can
account
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
at
that
Time
,
as
I
was
assur'd
by
my
Lord
Lucas
,
Constable
of
it
,
upwards
of
twenty
Thousand
Barrels
of
Gun
-
powder
,
in
that
they
call
the
White
-
Tower
,
when
all
at
once
the
middle
Flooring
did
not
only
give
way
,
or
shrink
,
but
fell
flat
down
upon
other
Barrels
of
Powder
,
together
with
many
of
the
same
combustible
Matter
which
had
been
placed
upon
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
Providence
strangely
neglected
at
that
Time
,
and
hardly
thought
of
since
;
But
let
any
considerate
Man
consult
the
Consequences
,
if
it
had
taken
fire
;
perhaps
to
the
Destruction
of
the
whole
City
,
or
,
at
least
,
as
far
as
the
Bridge
and
Parts
adjacent
.
<EOS>
Let
his
Thoughts
proceed
to
examine
,
why
,
or
how
,
in
that
precipitate
Fall
,
not
one
Nail
,
nor
one
Piece
of
Iron
,
in
that
large
Fabrick
,
should
afford
one
little
Spark
to
enflame
that
Mass
of
sulphurous
Matter
it
was
loaded
with
;
and
if
he
is
at
a
loss
to
find
a
Providence
,
I
fear
his
Friends
will
be
more
at
a
loss
to
find
his
Understanding
.
<EOS>
But
the
Battle
of
Landen
happening
while
our
Regiment
was
here
on
Duty
,
we
were
soon
remov'd
to
our
Satisfaction
from
that
pacifick
Station
,
to
one
more
active
in
Flanders
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
that
fatal
Battle
the
Year
preceding
,
namely
,
A.D.
1694
,
the
Confederate
Army
under
King
William
lay
encamp'd
<EOS>
at
Mont.
St.
Andre
,
an
open
Place
,
and
much
expos'd
;
while
the
French
were
entrench'd
up
to
their
very
Teeth
,
at
Vignamont
,
a
little
Distance
from
us
.
<EOS>
This
afforded
Matter
of
great
Reflection
to
the
Politicians
of
those
Times
,
who
could
hardly
allow
,
that
if
the
Confederate
Army
suffer'd
<EOS>
so
much
,
as
it
really
did
in
the
Battle
of
Landen
,
it
could
consist
with
right
Conduct
to
tempt
,
or
rather
dare
a
new
Engagement
.
<EOS>
But
those
sage
Objectors
had
forgot
the
well
-
known
Courage
of
that
brave
Prince
,
and
were
as
little
capable
of
fathoming
his
Designs
.
<EOS>
The
Enemy
,
who
to
their
Sorrow
had
by
Experience
been
made
better
Judges
,
was
resolv'd
to
traverse
both
;
for
which
Purpose
they
kept
close
within
their
Entrenchments
;
so
that
after
all
his
Efforts
,
King
William
finding
he
could
no
way
draw
them
to
a
Battle
,
suddenly
decamp'd
,
and
march'd
directly
to
Pont
Espiers
,
by
long
Marches
,
with
a
Design
to
pass
the
French
Lines
at
that
Place
.
  
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
our
Army
march'd
in
a
direct
Line
,
to
our
great
Surprize
,
we
found
the
Enemy
had
first
taken
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
gave
this
the
Name
of
the
Long
March
,
and
very
deservedly
;
for
though
our
Army
march'd
upon
the
String
,
and
the
Enemy
upon
the
Bow
,
sensible
of
the
Importance
of
the
Post
,
and
the
Necessity
of
securing
it
,
by
double
horseing
with
their
Foot
,
and
by
leaving
their
Weary
and
Weak
in
their
Garrisons
,
and
supplying
their
Places
with
fresh
Men
out
of
them
,
they
gain'd
their
Point
in
disappointing
us
.
<EOS>
Though
certain
it
is
,
that
March
cost
'em
as
many
Men
and
Horses
as
a
Battle
.
<EOS>
However
their
Master
,
the
French
King
,
was
so
pleas'd
with
their
indefatigable
and
auspicious
Diligence
,
that
he
wrote
,
with
his
own
Hand
,
a
Letter
of
Thanks
to
the
Officers
,
for
the
great
Zeal
and
Care
they
had
taken
to
prevent
the
Confederate
Army
from
entring
into
French
Flanders
.
  
<EOS>
King
William
,
thus
disappointed
in
that
noble
Design
,
gave
immediate
Orders
for
his
whole
Army
to
march
through
Oudenard
,
and
then
ecamp'd
<EOS>
at
Rofendale
;
after
some
little
Stay
at
that
Camp
<EOS>
we
were
remov'd
to
the
Camerlins
,
between
Newport
and
Ostend
,
once
more
to
take
our
Winter
Quarters
there
among
the
Boors
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
now
in
the
Year
1695
when
the
strong
Fortress
of
Namur
,
taken
by
the
French
in
1692
and
since
made
by
them
much
stronger
,
was
invested
by
the
Earl
of
Athlone
.
<EOS>
After
very
many
vigorous
Attacks
,
with
the
Loss
of
many
Men
,
the
Town
was
taken
,
the
Garrison
retiring
into
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
Into
which
soon
after
,
notwithstanding
all
the
Circumspection
of
the
Besiegers
,
Mareschal
Bouflers
found
means
,
with
some
Dragoons
,
to
throw
himself
.
  
<EOS>
While
King
William
was
thus
engag'd
<EOS>
in
that
glorious
and
important
Siege
,
Prince
Vaudemont
being
posted
at
Watergaem
,
with
about
fifty
Battallions
,
and
as
many
Squadrons
,
the
Mareschal
Villeroy
laid
a
Design
to
attack
him
with
the
whole
French
Army
.
<EOS>
The
Prince
imagin'd
<EOS>
no
less
,
therefore
he
prepar'd
accordingly
,
giving
us
Orders
to
fortify
our
Camp
,
as
well
as
the
little
time
we
had
for
it
would
permit
.
<EOS>
Those
Orders
were
pursu'd
;
nevertheless
,
I
must
confess
,
it
was
beyond
the
Reach
of
my
little
Reason
to
account
for
our
so
long
Stay
in
the
Sight
of
an
Army
so
much
superior
to
ours
.
<EOS>
The
Prince
in
the
Whole
could
hardly
muster
thirty
Thousand
;
and
Villeroy
was
known
to
value
himself
upon
having
one
Hundred
Thousand
effective
Men
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
Prince
provisionally
sent
away
all
our
Baggage
that
very
Morning
to
Ghent
,
and
still
made
shew
as
if
he
resolv'd
to
defend
himself
to
the
last
Extremity
in
our
little
Entrenchments
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
on
their
Side
began
to
surround
us
;
and
in
their
Motions
for
that
Purpose
,
blew
up
little
Bags
of
Gun
-
powder
,
to
give
the
readier
Notice
how
far
they
had
acomplish'd
<EOS>
it
.
<EOS>
Another
Captain
,
with
my
self
,
being
plac'd
on
the
Right
,
with
one
Hundred
Men
(
where
I
found
Monsieur
Montal
endeavouring
,
if
possible
,
to
get
behind
us
)
<EOS>
I
could
easily
observe
,
they
had
so
far
attain'd
<EOS>
their
Aim
of
encompassing
us
,
as
to
the
very
Fashion
of
a
Horse
's
Shoe
.
<EOS>
This
made
me
fix
my
Eyes
so
intently
upon
the
advancing
Enemy
,
that
I
never
minded
what
my
Friends
were
doing
behind
me
;
though
I
afterwards
found
that
they
had
been
fileing
off
so
very
artfully
and
privately
,
by
that
narrow
Opening
of
the
Horse
-
Shoe
,
that
when
the
Enemy
imagin'd
us
past
a
Possibility
of
Escape
,
our
little
Army
at
once
,
and
of
a
sudden
,
was
ready
to
disappear
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
Wood
on
the
Right
of
our
Army
,
through
which
lay
the
Road
to
Ghent
,
not
broader
than
to
admit
of
more
than
Four
to
march
a
breast
.
<EOS>
Down
this
the
Prince
had
slid
his
Forces
,
except
to
that
very
small
Party
which
the
Captain
and
my
self
commanded
,
and
which
was
designedly
left
to
bring
up
the
Rear
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
we
stir
till
Captain
Collier
,
then
<EOS>
Aid
de
Camp
to
his
Brother
,
now
Earl
of
Portmore
,
came
with
the
Word
of
Command
for
us
to
draw
off
.
  
<EOS>
When
Villeroy
was
told
of
our
Retreat
,
he
was
much
surpriz'd
,
as
thinking
it
a
Thing
utterly
impossible
.
<EOS>
However
,
at
last
,
being
sensible
of
the
Truth
of
it
,
he
gave
Orders
for
our
Rear
to
be
attack'd
<EOS>
;
but
we
kept
fireing
from
Ditch
to
Ditch
,
and
Hedge
to
Hedge
,
till
Night
came
upon
us
;
and
so
our
little
Army
got
clear
of
its
gigantick
Enemy
with
very
inconsiderable
Loss
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
French
fail'd
not
,
in
their
customary
Way
,
to
express
the
Sense
of
their
vexation
,
at
this
Disappointment
,
with
Fire
and
Sword
in
the
Neighbourhood
round
.
<EOS>
Thus
Prince
Vaudemont
acquir'd
<EOS>
more
Glory
by
that
Retreat
than
an
intire
Victory
could
have
given
him
;
and
it
was
not
,
I
confess
,
the
least
Part
of
Satisfaction
in
Life
,
that
my
self
had
a
Share
of
Honour
under
him
to
bring
off
the
Rear
at
that
his
glorious
Retreat
at
Arfeel
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
in
further
Revenge
of
this
political
Chicane
of
the
Prince
of
Vaudemont
,
and
to
oblige
,
if
possible
,
King
William
to
raise
the
Siege
from
before
Namur
,
Villeroy
enter'd
into
the
Resolution
of
Bombarding
Brussells
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
which
he
encamp'd
at
Anderleck
,
and
then
made
his
Approaches
as
near
as
was
convenient
to
the
Town
.
<EOS>
There
he
caus'd
to
be
planted
thirty
Mortars
,
and
rais'd
a
Battery
of
ten
Guns
to
shoot
hot
Bullets
into
the
Place
.
  
<EOS>
But
before
they
fir'd
from
either
,
Villeroy
,
in
complement
to
the
Duke
of
Bavaria
,
sent
a
Messenger
to
know
in
what
Part
of
the
Town
his
Dutchess
chose
to
reside
,
that
they
might
,
as
much
as
possible
,
avoid
incommoding
her
,
by
directing
their
Fire
to
other
Parts
.
<EOS>
Answer
was
return'd
that
she
was
at
her
usual
Place
of
Residence
,
the
Palace
;
and
accordingly
their
fireing
from
Battery
or
Mortars
<EOS>
little
incommoded
them
that
Way
.
  
<EOS>
Five
Days
<EOS>
the
Bombardment
continu'd
;
and
with
such
Fury
,
that
the
Centre
of
that
noble
City
was
quite
lay'd
in
Rubbish
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
Time
of
Bombarding
<EOS>
I
was
upon
the
Counterscarp
,
where
I
could
best
see
and
distinguish
;
and
I
have
often
counted
in
the
Air
,
at
one
time
,
more
than
twenty
Bombs
;
for
they
shot
whole
Vollies
out
of
their
Mortars
all
together
.
<EOS>
This
,
as
it
must
needs
be
terrible
,
threw
the
Inhabitants
into
the
utmost
Confusion
.
<EOS>
Cartloads
of
Nuns
,
that
for
many
Years
before
had
never
been
out
of
the
Cloister
,
were
now
hurry'd
<EOS>
about
from
Place
to
Place
,
to
find
Retreats
of
some
Security
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
Groves
,
and
Parts
remote
,
were
all
crowded
;
and
the
most
spacious
Streets
had
hardly
a
Spectator
left
to
view
their
Ruins
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
to
be
seen
like
that
Dexterity
of
our
People
in
extinguishing
the
Fires
;
for
where
the
red
-
hot
Bullets
fell
,
and
rais'd
new
Conflagrations
,
not
Burghers
only
,
but
the
vulgar
Sort
,
stood
stareing
,
and
with
their
Hands
impocketted
,
beheld
their
Houses
gradually
consume
;
and
without
offering
prudent
or
charitable
Hand
to
stop
the
growing
Flames
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
they
had
almost
thus
destroy'd
that
late
fair
City
,
Villeroy
,
finding
he
could
not
raise
the
Siege
of
Namur
,
by
that
vigorous
Attack
upon
Brussels
,
decamp'd
at
last
from
before
it
,
and
put
his
Army
on
the
March
,
to
try
if
he
could
have
better
Success
by
exposing
to
Show
his
Pageant
of
one
Hundred
Thousand
Men
.
<EOS>
Prince
Vaudemont
had
timely
Intelligence
of
the
Duke
's
Resolution
and
Motion
;
and
resolv'd
,
if
possible
to
get
there
before
him
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
Attempt
fruitless
:
<EOS>
He
fortunately
succeeded
,
though
with
much
Fatigue
,
and
no
little
Difficulty
,
after
he
had
put
a
Trick
upon
the
Spies
of
the
Enemy
,
by
pretending
to
encamp
,
and
so
soon
as
they
were
gone
ordering
a
full
March
.
  
<EOS>
The
Castle
of
Namur
had
been
all
this
Time
under
the
Fire
of
the
Besieger
's
Cannon
;
and
soon
after
our
little
Army
under
the
Prince
was
arriv'd
,
a
Breach
<EOS>
,
that
was
imagin'd
practicable
,
being
made
in
the
Terra
Nova
(
which
,
as
the
Name
imports
,
was
a
new
Work
,
<EOS>
rais'd
by
the
French
,
and
added
to
the
Fortifications
,
since
it
fell
into
their
Hands
in
1692
and
which
very
much
increas'd
the
Strength
of
the
Whole
)
<EOS>
a
Breach
,
as
I
have
said
,
being
made
in
this
Terra
Nova
,
a
Storm
,
in
a
Council
of
War
,
was
resolv'd
upon
.
<EOS>
Four
entire
Regiments
,
in
conjunction
with
some
Draughts
made
out
of
several
others
,
were
order'd
for
that
Work
,
my
self
commanding
that
Part
of
'em
which
had
been
drawn
out
of
Colonel
Tiffins
.
<EOS>
We
were
all
to
rendevouze
at
the
Abbey
of
Salsines
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Lord
Cutts
;
the
Signal
,
when
the
Attack
was
to
be
made
,
being
agreed
to
be
the
blowing
up
of
a
Bag
of
Gun
-
powder
upon
the
Bridge
of
Boats
that
lay
over
the
Sambre
.
  
<EOS>
So
soon
as
the
Signal
was
made
,
we
march'd
up
to
the
Breach
with
a
decent
Intrepidity
,
receiving
all
the
Way
we
advanc'd
<EOS>
the
full
Fire
of
the
Cohorn
Fort
.
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
we
came
near
enough
to
mount
,
we
found
it
vastly
steep
and
rugged
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
which
,
several
did
get
up
,
and
enter'd
<EOS>
the
Breach
;
but
not
being
supported
as
they
ought
to
have
been
,
they
were
all
made
Prisoners
.
<EOS>
Which
,
together
with
a
Wound
my
Lord
Cutts
receiv'd
,
after
he
had
done
all
that
was
possible
for
us
,
necessitated
us
to
retire
with
the
Loss
of
many
of
our
Men
.
  
<EOS>
VILLEROY
all
this
while
lay
in
fight
,
with
his
Army
of
One
Hundred
Thousand
Men
,
without
making
the
least
Offer
to
incommode
the
Besiegers
;
or
even
without
doing
any
thing
more
than
make
his
Appearance
in
favour
of
the
Besieged
,
and
reconnoitring
our
Encampment
:
<EOS>
And
,
at
last
,
seeing
,
or
imagining
that
he
saw
,
the
Attempt
would
be
to
little
purpose
,
with
all
the
good
Manners
in
the
World
,
<EOS>
in
the
Night
,
he
withdrew
that
terrible
Meteor
,
and
reliev'd
our
poor
Horses
from
feeding
on
Leaves
,
the
only
Inconvenience
he
had
put
us
to
.
  
<EOS>
This
Retreat
leaving
the
Garrison
without
all
Hope
of
Relief
,
they
in
the
Castle
immediately
capitulated
.
<EOS>
But
after
one
of
the
Gates
had
been
,
according
to
Articles
,
delivered
up
and
Count
Guiscard
was
marching
out
at
the
Head
of
the
Garrison
,
and
Bouflers
at
the
Head
of
the
Dragoons
;
the
latter
was
,
by
order
of
King
William
,
arrested
,
in
reprize
of
the
Garrison
of
Dixmuyd
(
who
,
contrary
to
the
Cartel
,
had
been
detain'd
Prisoners
)
and
remain'd
under
Arrest
till
they
were
set
free
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
very
Beginning
of
the
Year
1696
was
discover'd
<EOS>
a
Plot
,
fit
only
to
have
had
its
Origin
from
Hell
or
Rome
.
<EOS>
A
Plot
,
which
would
have
put
Hottentots
and
Barbarians
out
of
Countenance
.
<EOS>
This
was
call'd
the
Assassination
Plot
,
from
the
Design
of
it
,
which
was
to
have
assassinated
King
William
a
little
before
the
Time
of
his
usual
leaving
England
to
head
the
Army
of
the
Confederates
in
Flanders
.
<EOS>
And
as
nothing
could
give
a
nobler
Idea
of
the
great
Character
of
that
Prince
than
such
a
nefarious
Combination
against
him
;
so
,
with
all
considerate
Men
,
nothing
could
more
depreciate
the
Cause
of
his
inconsiderate
Enemies
.
<EOS>
If
I
remember
what
I
have
read
,
the
Sons
of
ancient
Rome
,
though
Heathens
,
behav'd
themselves
against
an
Enemy
in
a
quite
different
Manner
.
<EOS>
Their
Historians
afford
us
more
Instances
than
a
few
of
their
generous
Intimations
to
Kings
and
Generals
,
under
actual
Hostilities
,
of
barbarous
Designs
upon
their
Lives
.
<EOS>
I
proceed
to
this
of
our
own
Countrymen
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
the
Discovery
had
been
made
,
by
Persons
<EOS>
actually
engag'd
<EOS>
in
that
inhuman
Design
,
the
Regiment
,
in
which
I
served
,
with
some
others
then
in
Flanders
,
receiv'd
Orders
,
with
all
Expedition
,
to
embarque
for
England
;
though
,
on
our
Arrival
at
Gravesend
,
fresh
Orders
met
us
to
remain
on
board
the
Transports
,
till
we
had
surther
Directions
.
  
<EOS>
On
my
going
to
London
,
a
few
Days
after
,
I
was
told
,
that
two
Regiments
only
were
now
design'd
to
come
a
-
shore
;
and
that
the
rest
would
be
remanded
to
Flanders
,
the
Danger
apprehended
being
pretty
well
over
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
White
Hall
when
I
receiv'd
this
Notice
;
<EOS>
where
meeting
my
Lord
Cutts
(
who
had
ever
since
the
storming
of
the
Terra
Nova
at
Namur
<EOS>
allow'd
<EOS>
me
a
Share
in
his
Favour
)
<EOS>
he
express'd
<EOS>
himself
in
the
most
obliging
Manner
;
and
at
parting
<EOS>
desir'd
<EOS>
he
might
not
fail
of
seeing
me
next
Morning
at
his
House
;
for
he
had
somewhat
of
an
extraordinary
Nature
to
communicate
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
time
appointed
,
I
waited
on
his
Lorship
,
where
I
met
Mr.
Steel
(
now
Sir
Richard
,
and
at
that
time
his
Secretary
)
who
immediately
introduc'd
me
.
<EOS>
I
found
in
company
with
him
three
Gentlemen
;
and
after
common
Salutations
,
his
Lordship
deliver'd
into
my
Hands
,
an
Order
from
the
King
in
Council
to
go
along
with
Captain
Porter
,
Mr.
de
la
Rue
,
and
Mr.
George
Harris
(
<EOS>
who
prov'd
to
be
those
three
with
him
)
to
search
all
the
Transports
at
Gravesend
,
in
order
to
prevent
any
of
the
Conspirators
getting
out
of
England
that
Way
.
<EOS>
After
answering
,
that
I
was
ready
to
pay
Obedience
,
and
receiving
,
in
private
,
the
further
necessary
Instructions
,
we
took
our
Leave
,
and
Oars
soon
after
for
Gravesend
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
in
our
Passage
down
,
that
I
understood
that
they
had
all
been
of
the
Conspiracy
,
but
now
reluctant
,
were
become
Witnesses
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
came
to
Gravesend
,
I
produc'd
<EOS>
my
Authority
to
the
Commanding
Officer
,
who
very
readily
paid
Obedience
,
and
gave
Assistance
;
<EOS>
But
after
our
most
diligent
Search
,
finding
nothing
of
what
we
look'd
<EOS>
for
,
we
return'd
<EOS>
that
very
Night
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
Next
Day
a
Proclamation
was
to
come
out
for
the
apprehending
three
of
four
Troopers
,
who
were
sent
over
by
King
James
,
with
a
thousand
Pounds
Reward
for
each
:
<EOS>
Mr.
George
Harris
,
who
was
the
fourth
,
being
the
only
Evidence
against
the
other
three
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
were
we
return'd
from
Gravesend
,
but
Harris
had
Intelligence
brought
him
,
that
Cassells
,
one
of
the
three
,
was
at
Mr.
Allens
in
the
Savoy
,
under
the
Name
of
Green
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
we
went
directly
to
the
Place
;
and
enquiring
for
Mr.
Green
,
we
were
told
he
lodg'd
there
,
and
was
in
his
Room
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
oblig'd
<EOS>
by
my
Order
to
go
along
with
them
,
and
assist
'em
;
and
very
well
was
it
that
I
was
so
<EOS>
:
For
in
consideration
of
the
Reward
in
the
Proclamation
,
which
,
as
I
have
said
,
was
to
come
out
the
next
Day
,
Harris
and
the
rest
were
for
deferring
his
Seizure
,
till
the
coming
out
of
that
Proclamation
;
but
making
answer
,
that
in
case
of
his
Escape
that
Night
,
I
must
be
responsible
to
my
Superiors
;
who
,
under
the
most
favourable
Aspect
,
would
construe
it
a
Neglect
of
Duty
,
they
were
forc'd
to
comply
;
and
so
he
was
taken
up
,
and
his
Name
that
Night
struck
out
of
the
Proclamation
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
true
,
by
this
faithful
Discharge
of
my
Trust
,
I
did
save
the
Government
one
Thousand
Pounds
;
but
it
is
equally
so
,
that
I
never
had
of
my
Governors
one
Farthing
Consideration
for
what
others
term'd
<EOS>
an
over
-
officious
Piece
of
Service
;
though
in
Justice
it
must
be
own'd
a
Piece
of
exact
and
disinterested
Duty
.
  
<EOS>
Some
few
Days
after
,
attending
by
Direction
at
the
Secretary
's
Office
,
with
Mr.
Harris
,
there
came
in
a
Dutchman
,
spluttering
and
making
a
great
Noise
,
that
he
was
sure
he
could
discover
one
of
the
Conspirators
;
but
the
Mein
and
the
Behaviour
of
the
Man
,
would
not
give
any
Body
Leave
to
give
him
any
Credit
or
Regard
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
Man
persisting
in
his
Assertions
,
I
spoke
to
Mr.
Harris
to
take
him
aside
,
and
ask
him
what
Sort
of
a
Person
he
was
;
<EOS>
Harris
did
so
;
and
the
Dutchman
describing
him
,
says
Harris
,
returning
to
me
,
I
'll
be
<EOS>
hang'd
<EOS>
if
it
be
not
Blackburn
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
we
had
him
question'd
somewhat
more
narrowly
;
when
having
no
room
to
doubt
,
and
understanding
where
he
was
,
Colonel
Rivet
of
the
Guards
was
sent
for
,
and
order'd
to
go
along
with
us
to
seize
him
.
<EOS>
We
went
accordingly
;
and
it
proving
to
be
Blackburn
,
the
Dutchman
had
five
Hundred
Pounds
,
and
the
Colonel
and
others
the
Remainder
.
<EOS>
Cassels
and
Blackburn
,
if
still
alive
,
are
in
Newgate
,
confin'd
by
Act
of
Parliament
,
one
only
Witness
,
which
was
Harris
,
being
producible
against
them
.
  
<EOS>
When
Blackburn
was
seiz'd
,
I
found
in
the
Chamber
with
him
,
one
Davison
,
a
Watch
-
maker
,
living
in
Holbourn
.
<EOS>
I
carry'd
him
along
with
me
to
the
Secretary
of
State
;
but
nothing
on
his
Examination
appearing
against
him
,
he
was
immediately
<EOS>
discharg'd
.
<EOS>
He
offer'd
afterwards
to
present
me
with
a
fine
Watch
of
his
own
making
,
which
I
refus'd
;
and
he
long
after
own'd
the
Obligation
.
  
<EOS>
So
soon
as
the
Depth
of
this
Plot
was
fathom'd
,
and
<EOS>
the
intended
Evil
provided
against
,
as
well
as
prevented
,
King
William
went
over
into
Flanders
,
and
our
Regiment
thereupon
receiv'd
<EOS>
Orders
for
their
immediate
Return
.
<EOS>
Nothing
of
any
Moment
occurr'd
<EOS>
till
our
Arrival
at
our
old
Quarters
,
the
Camerlins
,
where
we
lay
dispers'd
amongst
the
Country
Boors
or
Farmers
,
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
However
,
for
our
better
Security
in
those
Quarters
,
and
to
preserve
us
from
the
Excursions
of
the
neighbouring
Garrison
of
Furnes
,
we
were
oblig'd
to
keep
an
Out
-
guard
at
a
little
Place
call'd
Shoerbeck
.
<EOS>
This
Guard
was
every
forty
-
eight
Hours
chang'd
,
and
remounted
with
a
Captain
,
a
Lieutenant
,
an
Ensign
,
and
threescore
Men
.
  
<EOS>
When
it
came
to
my
Turn
to
relieve
that
Guard
,
and
for
that
Purpose
I
was
arriv'd
at
my
Post
,
it
appear'd
to
me
with
the
Face
of
a
Place
of
Debauch
,
rather
than
Business
;
there
being
too
visible
Tokens
,
that
the
hard
Duty
of
both
Officers
and
Soldiers
had
been
that
of
hard
Drinking
,
the
foulest
Error
that
a
Soldier
can
commit
,
especially
when
on
his
Guard
.
  
<EOS>
To
confirm
my
Apprehensions
,
a
little
after
I
had
taken
Possession
of
my
Guard
,
the
Man
of
the
House
related
to
me
such
Passages
,
and
so
many
of'em
,
that
satisfy'd
me
,
that
if
ten
sober
Men
had
made
the
Attack
,
they
might
have
fairly
knock'd
<EOS>
all
my
Predecessors
of
the
last
Guard
on
the
Head
,
without
much
Difficulty
.
<EOS>
However
,
his
Account
administer'd
Matter
of
Caution
to
me
,
and
put
me
upon
taking
a
narrower
View
of
our
Situation
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
whereof
,
at
Night
I
plac'd
a
Centinel
a
Quarter
of
a
Mile
in
the
Rear
,
and
such
other
Centinels
as
I
thought
necessary
and
convenient
in
other
Places
;
with
Orders
,
that
upon
Sight
of
an
Enemy
the
Centinel
near
should
fire
;
and
that
upon
hearing
that
,
all
the
other
Centinels
,
as
well
as
he
,
should
hasten
in
to
strengthen
our
Main
Guard
.
  
<EOS>
What
my
Jealousy
,
on
my
Landlord
's
Relation
,
had
suggested
,
happen'd
<EOS>
accordingly
:
For
about
one
in
the
Morning
I
was
alarm'd
<EOS>
with
the
Cry
of
one
of
my
Centinels
,
Turn
out
for
God
's
sake
;
which
he
repeated
,
with
Vehemence
,
three
or
four
times
over
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
Alarm
,
got
up
suddenly
;
and
with
no
little
Difficulty
got
my
Men
into
their
Ranks
,
when
the
Person
who
made
the
Outcry
came
running
in
,
almost
spent
,
and
out
of
Breath
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
Centinel
,
that
I
had
luckily
plac'd
about
a
Quarter
of
a
Mile
off
,
who
gave
the
Alarm
,
and
his
Musket
flashing
in
the
Pan
,
without
going
off
,
he
endeavour'd
to
supply
with
his
Voice
the
Defect
of
his
Piece
.
<EOS>
I
had
just
got
my
Men
into
their
Ranks
,
in
order
to
receive
the
Enemy
,
<EOS>
when
by
the
Moonlight
,
I
discover'd
a
Party
advancing
upon
us
.
<EOS>
My
out
Centinel
challeng'd
'em
,
and
as
I
had
precaution'd
,
they
answer'd
,
Hispanioli
;
though
I
knew
'em
to
be
French
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
on
my
Survey
of
our
Situation
by
Day
-
light
,
having
mark'd
<EOS>
in
my
Mind
<EOS>
a
proper
Place
for
drawing
up
my
Men
in
Case
of
an
Attack
,
which
was
too
narrow
to
admit
of
more
than
two
on
a
Breast
;
and
which
would
secure
between
us
and
the
Enemy
a
Ditch
of
Water
<EOS>
:
I
resolv'd
to
put
in
practice
what
had
entertain'd
me
so
well
in
the
Theory
.
<EOS>
To
that
Purpose
<EOS>
I
order'd
<EOS>
my
first
Rank
to
keep
their
Post
,
stand
still
and
face
the
Enemy
,
while
the
other
two
Ranks
stooping
should
follow
me
to
gain
the
intended
Station
;
which
done
,
the
first
Rank
had
Orders
to
file
off
and
fall
behind
.
<EOS>
All
was
perform'd
in
excellent
Order
;
and
I
confess
it
was
with
no
little
Pleasure
,
that
I
beheld
the
Enemy
,
for
the
best
Part
of
an
Hour
,
in
Consultation
whether
they
should
attack
us
or
no
.
<EOS>
The
result
,
nevertheless
,
of
that
Consultation
ended
in
this
;
that
,
seeing
us
so
well
upon
our
Guard
,
it
was
most
adviseable
to
draw
off
.
<EOS>
They
soon
put
their
Resolution
into
practice
,
which
I
was
very
glad
to
see
;
on
Examination
a
little
before
having
found
that
my
Predecessor
,
as
in
other
Things
,
had
fail'd
of
Conduct
in
leaving
me
a
Garrison
without
Ammunition
.
  
<EOS>
Next
Morning
I
was
very
pleasingly
surpriz'd
with
a
handsome
Present
of
Wine
,
and
some
other
necessary
Refreshments
.
<EOS>
At
first
I
made
a
little
Scruple
and
Hesitation
whether
or
no
to
receive
'em
;
till
the
Bearer
<EOS>
assur'd
<EOS>
me
,
that
they
were
sent
me
from
the
Officers
of
the
next
Garrison
,
who
had
made
me
a
Visit
the
Night
before
,
as
a
candid
Acknowledgment
of
my
Conduct
and
good
Behaviour
.
<EOS>
I
return'd
their
Compliment
,
that
I
hop'd
I
should
never
receive
Men
of
Honour
otherwise
than
like
a
Man
of
Honour
;
which
mightily
pleas'd
them
.
<EOS>
Every
of
which
Particulars
the
Ghent
Gazettier
the
Week
after
publish'd
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
little
to
do
except
Marching
and
Counter
-
marching
all
the
Campaign
after
;
till
it
was
resolv'd
in
a
Council
of
War
,
for
the
better
preserving
of
Brussels
from
such
Insults
,
as
it
had
before
sustain'd
from
the
French
,
during
the
Siege
of
Namur
,
to
fortify
Anderlech
;
upon
which
our
Regiment
,
as
well
as
others
,
were
commanded
from
our
more
pacifick
Posts
to
attend
that
Work
.
<EOS>
Our
whole
Army
was
under
Movement
to
cover
that
Resolution
;
and
the
Train
fell
to
my
Care
and
Command
in
the
March
.
<EOS>
There
accompany'd
<EOS>
the
Train
a
Fellow
,
seemingly
ordinary
,
yet
very
officious
and
courteous
,
being
ready
to
do
any
thing
for
any
Person
,
from
the
Officer
to
the
common
Soldier
.
<EOS>
He
travell'd
along
and
mov'd
with
the
Train
,
sometimes
on
Foot
,
and
sometimes
getting
a
Ride
in
some
one
or
other
of
the
Waggons
;
but
ever
full
of
his
Chit
-
chat
and
Stories
of
Humour
.
<EOS>
By
these
insinuating
Ways
he
had
screw'd
<EOS>
himself
into
the
general
good
Opinion
;
but
the
Waggoners
especially
grew
particularly
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
At
the
End
of
our
March
all
our
Powder
-
Waggons
were
plac'd
breast
a
-
breast
,
and
so
close
,
that
one
miscarrying
would
leave
little
doubt
of
the
Fate
of
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
This
in
the
Camp
we
commonly
call
the
Park
;
and
here
it
was
that
our
new
Guest
,
like
another
Phaeton
,
though
under
Pretence
of
Weariness
,
not
Ambition
,
got
Leave
of
the
very
last
Carter
to
the
Train
to
take
a
Nap
in
his
Waggon
.
<EOS>
One
who
had
entertain'd
a
Jealousy
of
him
,
and
had
watch'd
<EOS>
him
,
gave
Information
against
him
;
upon
which
he
was
seiz'd
and
brought
to
me
as
Captain
of
the
Guard
.
<EOS>
I
caus'd
him
to
be
<EOS>
search'd
;
and
upon
search
,
finding
Match
,
Touchwood
,
and
other
dangerous
Materials
upon
him
;
I
sent
him
and
them
away
to
the
Provoe
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
Whole
,
a
Council
of
War
was
call'd
,
at
which
,
upon
a
strict
Examination
,
he
confess'd
himself
a
hir'd
Incendiary
;
and
as
such
receiv'd
<EOS>
his
Sentence
to
be
burnt
in
the
Face
of
the
Army
.
<EOS>
The
Execution
was
a
Day
or
two
after
:
When
on
the
very
Spot
,
he
further
acknowledged
,
that
on
Sight
or
Noise
of
the
Blow
,
it
had
been
concerted
,
that
the
French
Army
should
fall
upon
the
Confederates
under
those
lamentable
Circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
The
Peace
of
Riswick
soon
after
taking
place
,
put
an
End
to
all
Incendiarisms
of
either
Sort
.
<EOS>
So
that
nothing
of
a
Military
Kind
,
which
was
now
become
my
Province
,
happen'd
<EOS>
of
some
Years
after
.
<EOS>
Our
Regiment
was
first
order'd
into
England
;
and
presently
after
into
Ireland
:
<EOS>
But
as
these
Memoirs
are
not
design'd
for
the
Low
Amuzement
of
a
Tea
-
Table
,
but
rather
of
the
Cabinet
,
a
Series
of
inglorious
Inactivity
can
furnish
but
very
little
towards
'em
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
as
little
as
I
admir'd
a
Life
of
Inactivity
,
there
are
some
Sorts
of
Activity
,
to
which
a
wise
Man
might
almost
give
Supineness
the
Preference
:
<EOS>
Such
is
that
of
barely
encountring
Elements
,
and
wageing
War
with
Nature
;
and
such
,
in
my
Opinion
,
would
have
been
the
spending
my
Commission
,
and
very
probably
my
Life
with
it
,
in
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
For
though
the
Climate
(
as
some
would
urge
)
may
afford
a
Chance
for
a
very
speedy
Advance
in
Honour
,
yet
,
upon
revolving
in
my
Mind
,
that
those
Rotations
of
the
Wheel
of
Fortune
are
often
so
very
quick
,
as
well
as
uncertain
,
that
I
my
self
might
as
well
be
the
First
as
the
Last
;
the
Whole
of
the
Debate
ended
in
somewhat
like
that
Couplet
of
the
excellent
Hudibras
:
  
<EOS>
Then
he
,
that
ran
away
and
fled
,
Must
lie
in
Honour
's
Truckle
-
bed
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
my
better
Planets
soon
disannull'd
<EOS>
those
melancholy
Ideas
,
which
a
Rumour
of
our
being
sent
into
the
West
Indies
had
crowded
my
Head
and
Heart
with
:
For
being
call'd
over
into
England
,
upon
the
very
Affairs
of
the
Regiment
,
I
arriv'd
there
just
after
the
Orders
for
their
Transportation
went
over
;
by
which
Means
the
Choice
of
going
was
put
out
of
my
Power
,
and
the
Danger
of
Refusing
,
which
was
the
Case
of
many
,
was
very
luckily
avoided
.
  
<EOS>
It
being
judg'd
,
therefore
,
impossible
for
me
to
return
soon
enough
to
gain
my
Passage
,
one
in
Power
propos'd
to
me
,
that
I
should
resign
to
an
Officer
then
going
over
;
and
with
some
other
contingent
Advantages
,
to
my
great
Satisfaction
,
I
was
put
upon
the
Half
-
pay
List
.
<EOS>
This
was
more
agreeable
,
for
I
knew
,
or
at
least
imagin'd
<EOS>
my
self
wise
enough
to
foretel
,
from
the
over
hot
Debate
of
the
House
of
Commons
upon
the
Partition
Treaty
,
that
it
could
not
be
long
before
the
present
Peace
would
,
at
least
,
require
patching
.
  
<EOS>
Under
this
Sort
of
uncertain
Settlement
I
remain'd
with
the
Patience
of
a
Jew
,
though
not
with
Judaical
Absurdity
,
a
faithful
Adherer
to
my
Expectation
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
Consequence
fail
of
answering
<EOS>
,
a
War
was
apparent
,
and
soon
after
proclaim'd
.
<EOS>
Thus
waiting
for
an
Opportunity
,
which
I
flatter'd
my
self
would
soon
present
,
the
little
Diversions
of
Dublin
,
and
the
moderate
Conversation
of
that
People
,
were
not
of
Temptation
enough
to
make
my
Stay
in
England
look
like
a
Burden
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
the
War
was
proclaim'd
,
and
Preparations
accordingly
made
for
it
,
the
Expectations
from
all
receiv'd
<EOS>
a
sudden
Damp
,
by
the
as
sudden
Death
of
King
William
.
<EOS>
That
Prince
,
who
had
stared
Death
in
the
Face
in
many
Sieges
and
Battles
,
met
with
his
Fate
in
the
Midst
of
his
Diversions
,
who
seiz'd
his
Prize
in
an
Hour
,
to
human
Thought
,
the
least
adapted
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
Hunting
(
his
customary
Diversion
)
<EOS>
when
,
by
an
unhappy
Trip
of
his
Horse
,
he
fell
to
the
Ground
;
and
in
the
Fall
displac'd
his
Collar
-
bone
.
<EOS>
The
News
of
it
immediately
alarm'd
<EOS>
the
Court
,
and
all
around
;
and
the
sad
Effects
of
it
soon
after
gave
all
Europe
the
like
Alarm
.
<EOS>
France
only
,
who
had
not
disdain'd
to
seek
it
sooner
by
ungenerous
Means
,
receiv'd
<EOS>
new
Hope
,
from
what
gave
others
Motives
for
Despair
.
<EOS>
He
flatter'd
himself
,
that
that
long
liv'd
Obstacle
to
his
Ambition
thus
remov'd
,
his
Successor
would
never
fall
into
those
Measures
,
which
he
had
wisely
concerted
for
the
Liberties
of
Europe
;
but
he
,
as
well
as
others
of
his
Adherents
,
was
gloriously
deceiv'd
;
that
God
-
like
Queen
,
with
a
Heart
entirely
English
,
prosecuted
her
royal
Predecessor
's
Counsels
;
and
to
remove
all
the
very
Faces
of
Jealousy
,
immediately
on
her
Accession
dispatch'd
<EOS>
to
every
Court
of
the
great
Confederacy
,
Persons
adequate
to
the
Importance
of
the
Message
,
to
give
Assurances
thereof
.
  
<EOS>
This
gave
new
Spirit
to
a
Cause
,
that
at
first
seem'd
to
languish
in
its
Founder
,
as
it
struck
its
great
Opposers
with
a
no
less
mortifying
Terror
;
And
well
did
the
great
Successes
of
her
Arms
answer
the
Prayers
and
Efforts
of
that
royal
Soul
of
the
Confederacies
;
together
with
the
Wishes
of
all
,
that
,
like
her
,
had
the
Good
,
as
well
as
the
Honour
of
their
Country
at
Heart
,
in
which
the
Liberties
of
Europe
were
included
.
<EOS>
The
first
Campaign
gave
a
noble
Earnest
of
the
Future
.
<EOS>
Bon
,
Keyserwaert
,
Venlo
,
and
Ruremond
,
were
sound
Forerunners
only
of
Donawert
,
Hochstet
,
and
Blenheim
.
<EOS>
Such
a
March
of
English
Forces
to
the
Support
of
the
tottering
Empire
,
as
it
gloriously
manifested
the
ancient
Genius
of
a
warlike
People
;
so
was
it
happily
celebrated
with
a
Success
answerable
to
the
Glory
of
the
Undertaking
,
which
concluded
in
Statues
and
princely
Donatives
to
an
English
Subject
,
from
the
then
only
Emperor
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
A
small
Tribute
,
it
's
true
,
for
ransom'd
<EOS>
Nations
and
captiv'd
Armies
,
which
justly
enough
inverted
the
Exclamations
of
a
Roman
Emperor
to
the
French
Monarch
,
who
deprecated
his
Legions
lost
pretty
near
the
same
Spot
;
but
to
a
much
superior
Number
,
and
on
a
much
less
glorious
Occasion
.
  
<EOS>
But
my
good
Fortune
not
allowing
me
to
participate
in
those
glorious
Appendages
of
the
English
Arms
in
Flanders
,
nor
on
the
Rhine
,
I
was
resolv'd
to
make
a
Push
for
it
the
first
Opportunity
,
and
waste
my
Minutes
no
longer
on
Court
Attendances
.
<EOS>
And
my
Lord
Cutts
returning
with
his
full
Share
of
Laurels
,
for
his
never
to
be
forgotten
Services
at
Venlo
,
Ruremond
,
and
Hochstet
,
found
his
active
Genius
now
to
be
repos'd
,
under
the
less
agreeable
Burden
of
unhazardous
Honour
,
where
Quiet
must
provide
a
Tomb
for
one
already
past
any
Danger
of
Oblivion
;
deep
Wounds
and
glorious
Actions
having
anticipated
all
that
could
be
said
in
Epitaphs
or
litteral
Inscriptions
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
his
Arrival
from
Germany
,
he
was
appointed
General
of
all
her
Majesty
's
Forces
in
Ireland
;
upon
which
going
to
congratulate
him
,
he
was
pleas'd
to
enquire
of
me
several
Things
relating
to
that
Country
;
and
particularly
in
what
Part
of
Dublin
I
would
recommend
his
Residence
;
offering
at
the
same
time
,
if
I
would
go
over
with
him
,
all
the
Services
that
should
fall
in
his
Way
.
  
<EOS>
But
Inactivity
was
a
Thing
I
had
too
long
lamented
;
therefore
,
after
I
had
,
as
decently
as
I
could
,
declin'd
<EOS>
the
latter
Part
,
I
told
his
Lordship
,
that
as
to
a
Place
of
Residence
,
I
was
Master
of
a
House
in
Dublin
,
large
enough
,
and
suitable
to
his
great
Quality
,
which
should
be
at
his
Service
,
on
any
Terms
he
thought
fit
.
<EOS>
Adding
withal
,
that
I
had
a
Mind
to
see
Spain
,
where
my
Lord
Peterborow
was
now
going
;
and
that
if
his
Lordship
would
favour
me
with
a
Recommendation
,
it
would
suit
my
present
Inclinations
much
better
than
any
further
tedious
Recess
.
<EOS>
His
Lordship
was
so
good
to
close
with
both
my
Overtures
;
and
spoke
so
effectually
in
my
Favour
,
that
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
then
General
of
all
the
Forces
order'd
on
that
Expedition
,
bad
me
speedily
prepare
my
self
;
and
so
when
all
Things
were
ready
<EOS>
I
embarqu'd
<EOS>
with
that
noble
Lord
for
Spain
,
to
pursue
his
well
concerted
Undertaking
;
which
,
in
the
Event
,
will
demonstrate
to
the
World
,
that
little
Armies
,
under
the
Conduct
of
auspicious
Generals
,
may
sometimes
produce
prodigious
Effects
.
  
<EOS>
The
Jews
,
in
whatever
Part
of
the
World
,
are
a
People
industrious
in
the
increasing
of
Mammon
;
and
being
accustom'd
<EOS>
to
the
universal
Methods
of
Gain
,
are
always
esteem'd
best
qualify'd
for
any
Undertaking
,
where
that
bears
a
Probability
of
being
a
Perquisite
.
<EOS>
Providing
Bread
,
and
other
Requisites
for
an
Army
,
was
ever
allow'd
<EOS>
to
carry
along
with
it
a
Profit
answerable
;
and
Spain
was
not
the
first
Country
where
that
People
had
engag'd
in
such
an
Undertaking
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
on
any
likely
Appearance
of
great
Advantage
,
it
is
in
the
Nature
as
well
as
Practice
of
that
Race
,
strenuously
to
assist
one
another
;
and
that
with
the
utmost
Confidence
and
prodigious
Alacrity
.
<EOS>
One
of
that
Number
,
both
competent
and
willing
enough
to
carry
on
an
Undertaking
of
that
kind
,
fortunately
came
at
that
Juncture
to
solicit
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
to
be
employ'd
as
Proveditor
to
the
Army
and
Troops
,
which
were
,
or
should
be
sent
into
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
It
will
easily
be
admitted
,
that
the
Earl
,
under
his
present
Exigencies
,
did
not
decline
to
listen
.
<EOS>
And
a
very
considerable
Sum
being
offer'd
,
by
way
of
Advance
,
the
Method
common
in
like
Cases
was
pursu'd
,
and
the
Sum
propos'd
accepted
;
by
which
Means
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
found
himself
put
into
the
happy
Capacity
of
proceeding
upon
his
first
concerted
Project
.
<EOS>
The
Name
of
the
Jew
,
who
sign'd
the
Contract
,
was
Curtisos
;
and
he
and
his
Friends
,
with
great
Punctuality
,
advanc'd
<EOS>
the
expected
Sum
of
One
Hundred
Thousand
Pounds
Sterling
,
or
very
near
it
;
which
was
immediately
order'd
into
the
Hands
of
the
Pay
-
master
of
the
Forces
.
<EOS>
For
though
the
Earl
took
Money
of
the
Jews
,
it
was
not
for
his
own
,
but
public
Use
.
<EOS>
According
to
Agreement
,
Bills
were
drawn
for
the
Value
from
Lisbon
,
upon
the
Lord
Godolphin
(
then
Lord
Treasurer
)
<EOS>
all
which
were
,
on
that
Occasion
,
punctually
comply'd
with
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Peterborow
having
thus
fortunately
found
Means
to
supply
himself
with
Money
,
and
by
that
with
some
Horse
,
after
he
had
obtain'd
Leave
of
the
Lord
Galoway
to
make
an
Exchange
of
two
Regiments
of
Foot
,
receiv'd
the
Arch
-
Duke
,
and
all
those
who
would
follow
him
,
aboard
the
Fleet
;
and
,
at
his
own
Expense
,
transported
him
and
his
whole
Retinue
to
Barcelona
:
For
all
which
prodigious
Charge
,
as
I
have
been
very
lately
inform'd
,
from
very
good
Hands
,
<EOS>
that
noble
Earl
never
to
this
Day
receiv'd
<EOS>
any
Consideration
from
the
Government
,
or
any
Person
whatsoever
.
  
<EOS>
We
sail'd
from
Lisbon
,
in
order
to
join
the
Squadron
under
Sir
Cloudsley
Shovel
:
Meeting
with
which
at
the
appointed
Station
off
Tangier
,
the
Men
of
War
and
Transports
thus
united
,
made
the
best
of
their
Way
for
Gibraltar
.
<EOS>
There
we
stay'd
no
longer
than
to
take
aboard
two
Regiments
out
of
that
Garrison
,
in
lieu
of
two
out
of
our
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Here
we
found
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
who
immediately
took
a
Resolution
to
follow
the
Arch
-
Duke
in
this
Expedition
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
Person
of
great
Gallantry
;
and
having
been
Vice
-
Roy
of
Catalonia
,
was
receiv'd
on
board
the
Fleet
with
the
utmost
Satisfaction
,
as
being
a
Person
capable
of
doing
great
Service
in
a
Country
where
he
was
well
known
,
and
as
well
belov'd
.
  
<EOS>
Speaking
Latin
then
pretty
fluently
,
it
gave
me
frequent
Opportunies
of
conversing
with
the
two
Father
Confessors
of
the
Duke
of
Austria
;
and
upon
that
Account
I
found
my
self
honour'd
with
some
Share
in
the
Favour
of
the
Arch
-
Duke
himself
.
<EOS>
I
mention
this
,
not
to
gratify
any
vain
Humour
,
but
as
a
corroborating
Circumstance
,
that
my
Opportunities
of
Information
,
in
Matters
of
Consequence
,
could
not
thereby
be
suppos'd
to
be
lessen'd
;
but
that
I
might
more
reasonably
be
imagin'd
to
arrive
at
Intelligence
,
that
not
very
often
,
or
at
least
not
so
soon
,
came
to
the
Knowledge
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
From
Gibraltar
we
sail'd
to
the
Bay
of
Altea
,
not
far
distant
from
the
City
of
Valencia
,
in
the
Road
of
which
we
continu'd
for
some
Days
.
<EOS>
While
we
were
there
,
as
I
was
very
credibly
inform'd
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
met
with
some
fresh
Disappointment
;
but
what
it
was
,
neither
I
nor
any
Body
else
,
as
far
as
I
could
perceive
,
could
ever
dive
into
:
Neither
did
it
appear
by
any
outward
Tokens
,
in
that
noble
General
,
that
it
lay
so
much
at
his
Heart
,
as
those
about
him
seem'd
to
assure
me
it
did
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
while
we
lay
in
Altea
Bay
,
two
Bomb
-
Vessels
,
and
a
small
Squadron
,
were
order'd
against
Denia
,
which
had
a
small
Castle
;
but
rather
fine
than
strong
.
<EOS>
And
accordingly
,
upon
our
Offer
to
bring
to
bear
with
our
Cannon
,
and
preparing
to
fix
our
Bomb
-
Vessels
,
in
order
to
bombard
the
Place
,
it
surrender'd
;
and
acknowledg'd
the
Arch
-
Duke
as
lawful
King
of
Spain
,
and
so
proclaim'd
him
.
<EOS>
From
this
time
,
therefore
,
speaking
of
that
Prince
,
it
shall
be
under
that
Title
.
<EOS>
General
Ramos
was
left
Commander
here
;
a
Person
who
afterwards
acted
a
very
extraordinary
Part
in
the
War
carry'd
on
in
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
.
  
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
no
positive
Resolutions
had
been
taken
for
the
Operations
of
the
Campaign
,
before
the
Arch
Duke
's
Departure
from
Lisbon
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
ever
solicitous
of
the
Honour
of
his
Country
,
had
premeditated
another
Enterprize
,
which
,
had
it
been
embrac'd
,
<EOS>
would
in
all
Probability
,
have
brought
that
War
to
a
much
more
speedy
Conclusion
;
and
at
the
same
time
have
obviated
all
those
Difficulties
,
which
were
but
too
apparent
in
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
He
had
justly
and
judiciously
weigh'd
,
that
there
were
no
Forces
in
the
Middle
Parts
of
Spain
,
all
their
Troops
being
in
the
extream
Parts
of
the
Kingdom
,
either
on
the
Frontiers
of
Portugal
,
or
in
the
City
of
Barcelona
;
that
with
King
Philip
,
and
the
royal
Family
at
Madrid
,
there
were
only
some
few
Horse
,
and
those
in
a
bad
Condition
,
and
which
only
serv'd
for
Guards
:
if
therefore
,
as
he
rightly
projected
within
himself
,
by
the
taking
of
Valencia
,
or
any
Sea
-
Port
Town
,
that
might
have
secur'd
<EOS>
his
Landing
,
he
had
march'd
<EOS>
directly
for
Madrid
;
what
could
have
oppos'd
him
?
<EOS>
But
I
shall
have
occasion
to
dilate
more
upon
this
Head
a
few
Pages
hence
;
and
therefore
shall
here
only
say
,
that
though
that
Project
of
his
might
have
brought
about
a
speedy
and
wonderful
Revolution
,
what
he
was
by
his
Orders
afterwards
<EOS>
oblig'd
to
,
against
his
Inclinations
,
to
pursue
,
contributed
much
more
to
his
great
Reputation
,
as
it
put
him
under
a
frequent
Necessity
of
overcoming
Difficulties
,
which
,
to
any
other
General
,
would
have
appear'd
unsurmountable
.
  
<EOS>
VALENCIA
is
a
City
towards
the
Centre
of
Spain
,
to
the
Seaward
,
seated
in
a
rich
and
most
populous
Country
,
just
fifty
Leagues
from
Madrid
.
<EOS>
It
abounds
in
Horses
and
Mules
;
by
reason
of
the
great
Fertility
of
its
Lands
,
which
they
can
,
to
great
Advantage
,
water
when
,
and
as
they
please
.
<EOS>
This
City
and
Kingdom
was
as
much
inclin'd
<EOS>
to
the
Interest
of
King
Charles
as
Catalonia
<EOS>
it
self
;
for
even
on
our
first
Appearance
,
great
Numbers
of
People
came
down
to
the
Bay
of
Altea
,
with
not
only
a
bare
Offer
of
their
Services
,
but
loaded
with
all
Manner
of
Provisions
,
and
loud
Acclamations
of
Viva
Carlos
tercero
,
Viva
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
regular
Troops
in
any
of
the
Places
round
about
it
,
or
in
the
City
it
self
.
<EOS>
The
nearest
were
those
few
Horse
in
Madrid
,
one
hundred
and
fifty
Miles
distant
;
nor
any
Foot
nearer
than
Barcelona
,
or
the
Frontiers
of
Portugal
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
Barcelona
is
one
of
the
largest
and
most
populous
Cities
in
all
Spain
,
<EOS>
fortify'd
with
Bastions
;
one
Side
thereof
is
secur'd
by
the
Sea
;
and
the
other
by
a
strong
Fortification
call'd
Monjouick
.
<EOS>
The
Place
is
of
so
large
a
Circumference
,
that
thirty
thousand
Men
would
scarce
suffice
to
form
the
Lines
of
Circumvallation
.
<EOS>
It
once
resisted
for
many
Months
an
Army
of
that
Force
;
and
is
almost
at
the
greatest
Distance
from
England
of
any
Place
belonging
to
that
Monarchy
.
  
<EOS>
This
short
Description
of
these
two
Places
will
appear
highly
necessary
,
if
it
be
consider'd
,
that
no
Person
without
it
would
be
able
to
judge
of
the
Design
which
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
intended
to
pursue
,
when
he
first
took
the
Arch
-
Duke
aboard
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
the
Earl
now
found
himself
under
a
Necessity
of
quitting
that
noble
Design
,
upon
his
Receipt
of
Orders
from
England
,
while
he
lay
in
the
Bay
of
Altea
,
to
proceed
directly
to
Catalonia
;
to
which
the
Arch
-
Duke
,
as
well
as
many
Sea
and
Land
Officers
,
were
most
inclin'd
;
and
the
Prince
of
Hesse
more
than
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
On
receiving
those
Orders
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
seem'd
to
be
of
Opinion
,
that
from
an
Attempt
,
which
he
thought
under
a
Probability
of
Success
,
he
was
condemn'd
to
undertake
what
was
next
to
an
Impossibility
of
effecting
;
since
nothing
appear'd
<EOS>
to
him
so
injudicious
as
an
Attempt
upon
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
A
Place
at
such
a
Distance
from
receiving
any
Reinforcement
or
Relief
;
the
only
Place
in
which
the
Spaniards
had
a
Garrison
of
regular
Forces
;
and
those
in
Number
rather
exceeding
the
Army
he
was
to
undertake
the
Siege
with
,
was
enough
to
cool
the
Ardour
of
a
Person
of
less
Penetration
and
Zeal
than
what
the
Earl
had
on
all
Occasions
demonstrated
.
<EOS>
Whereas
if
the
General
,
as
he
intended
,
had
made
an
immediate
March
to
Madrid
,
after
he
had
secur'd
<EOS>
Valencia
,
and
the
Towns
adjacent
,
which
were
all
ready
to
submit
and
declare
for
King
Charles
;
or
if
otherwise
inclin'd
,
had
it
not
in
their
Power
to
make
any
considerable
Resistance
;
to
which
,
if
it
be
added
,
that
he
could
have
had
Mules
and
Horses
immediately
provided
for
him
,
in
what
Number
he
pleas'd
,
together
with
Carriages
necessary
for
Artillery
,
Baggage
,
and
Ammunition
;
in
few
Days
he
could
have
forc'd
King
Philip
out
of
Madrid
,
where
he
had
so
little
Force
to
oppose
him
.
<EOS>
And
as
there
was
nothing
in
his
Way
to
prevent
or
obstruct
his
marching
thither
,
it
is
hard
to
conceive
any
other
Part
King
Philip
could
have
acted
in
such
an
Extremity
,
than
to
retire
either
towards
Portugal
or
Catalonia
.
<EOS>
In
either
of
which
Cases
he
must
have
left
all
the
middle
Part
of
Spain
open
to
the
Pleasure
of
the
Enemy
;
who
in
the
mean
time
would
have
had
it
in
their
Power
to
prevent
any
Communication
of
those
Bodies
at
such
opposite
Extreams
of
the
Country
,
as
were
the
Frontiers
of
Portugal
and
Barcelona
,
where
only
,
as
I
said
before
,
were
any
regular
Troops
.
  
<EOS>
And
on
the
other
Side
,
as
the
Forces
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
were
more
than
sufficient
for
an
Attempt
where
there
was
so
little
Danger
of
Opposition
;
so
if
their
Army
on
the
Frontiers
of
Portugal
should
have
march'd
<EOS>
back
upon
him
into
the
Country
;
either
the
Portugueze
Army
could
have
enter'd
into
Spain
without
Opposition
;
or
,
at
worst
,
supposing
the
General
had
been
forc'd
to
retire
,
his
Retreat
would
have
been
easy
and
safe
into
those
Parts
of
Valencia
and
Andahzia
,
which
he
previously
had
secur'd
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
Gibraltar
,
the
strongest
Place
in
Spain
,
if
not
in
the
whole
World
,
was
already
in
our
Possession
,
and
a
great
Fleet
at
Hand
ready
to
give
Assistance
in
all
Places
near
the
Sea
.
<EOS>
From
all
which
it
is
pretty
apparent
,
that
in
a
little
time
the
War
on
our
Side
might
have
been
supported
without
entering
the
Mediterranean
;
by
which
Means
all
Reinforcements
would
have
been
much
nearer
at
Hand
,
and
the
Expences
of
transporting
Troops
and
Ammunition
very
considerably
diminish'd
.
  
<EOS>
But
none
of
these
Arguments
,
though
every
one
of
them
is
founded
on
solid
Reason
,
were
of
Force
enough
against
the
prevailing
Opinion
for
an
Attempt
upon
Catalonia
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crow
,
Agent
for
the
Queen
in
those
Parts
,
had
sent
into
England
most
positive
Assurances
,
that
nothing
would
be
wanting
,
<EOS>
if
once
our
Fleet
made
an
invasion
amongst
the
Catalans
:
The
Prince
of
Hesse
likewise
abounded
in
mighty
Offers
and
prodigious
Assurances
;
all
which
enforc'd
our
Army
to
that
Part
of
Spain
,
and
that
gallant
Prince
to
those
Attempts
in
which
he
lost
his
Life
.
<EOS>
Very
much
against
the
Inclination
of
our
General
,
who
foresaw
all
those
Difficulties
,
which
were
no
less
evident
afterwards
to
every
one
;
and
the
Sense
of
which
occasion'd
<EOS>
those
Delays
,
and
that
Opposition
to
any
Effort
upon
Barcelona
,
which
ran
thro
'
so
many
successive
Councils
of
War
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
pursuant
to
his
Instructions
from
England
,
the
repeated
Desires
of
the
Arch
-
Duke
,
and
the
Importunities
of
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
our
General
gave
Orders
to
sail
from
Altea
towards
the
Bay
of
Barcelona
,
the
chief
City
of
Catalonia
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
when
we
arriv'd
there
,
he
was
very
unwilling
to
land
any
of
the
Forces
,
till
he
saw
some
Probability
of
that
Assistance
and
Succour
so
must
boasted
of
,
and
so
often
promis'd
.
<EOS>
But
as
nothing
appear'd
<EOS>
but
some
small
Numbers
of
Men
,
very
indifferently
arm'd
,
and
without
either
Gentlemen
or
Officers
at
the
Head
of
them
;
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
was
of
Opinion
,
this
could
not
be
deem'd
sufficient
Encouragement
for
him
to
engage
in
an
Enterprize
,
which
carry'd
so
poor
a
Face
of
Probability
of
Success
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
this
it
was
urg'd
,
that
till
a
Descent
was
made
,
and
the
Affairs
thoroughly
engag'd
<EOS>
in
,
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
any
great
Numbers
would
appear
,
or
that
Persons
of
Condition
would
discover
themselves
.
<EOS>
Upon
all
which
it
was
resolv'd
<EOS>
the
Troops
should
be
landed
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
our
Forces
were
disembark'd
,
and
immediately
encamp'd
;
notwithstanding
which
the
Number
of
Succours
increas'd
very
slowly
,
and
that
after
the
first
straggling
Manner
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
those
that
did
appear
any
way
to
be
depended
on
;
coming
when
they
thought
fit
,
and
going
away
when
they
pleas'd
,
and
not
to
be
brought
under
any
regular
Discipline
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
pretended
,
that
until
they
saw
the
Artillery
landed
as
well
as
Forces
,
they
would
not
believe
any
Siege
actually
intended
.
<EOS>
This
brought
the
General
under
a
sort
of
Necessity
of
complying
in
that
also
.
<EOS>
Though
certainly
so
to
do
must
be
allow'd
<EOS>
a
little
unreasonable
,
while
the
Majority
in
all
Councils
of
War
declar'd
<EOS>
the
Design
to
be
impracticable
;
and
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
had
positive
Orders
to
proceed
according
to
such
Majorities
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
Prince
of
Hesse
was
pleas'd
to
demand
Pay
for
those
Stragglers
,
as
Officers
and
Soldiers
,
endeavouring
to
maintain
,
that
it
could
not
be
expected
that
Men
should
venture
their
Lives
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Thus
we
came
to
Catalonia
upon
Assurances
of
universal
Assistance
;
but
found
,
when
we
came
there
,
that
we
were
to
have
none
unless
we
paid
for
it
.
<EOS>
And
as
we
were
sent
thither
without
Money
to
pay
for
any
thing
,
it
had
certainly
been
for
us
more
tolerable
to
have
been
in
a
Country
where
we
might
have
taken
by
Force
what
we
could
not
obtain
any
other
way
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
to
do
the
Miquelets
all
possible
Justice
,
I
must
say
,
that
notwithstanding
the
Number
of
'em
,
which
hover'd
about
the
Place
,
never
much
exceeded
fifteen
Hundred
Men
;
if
sometimes
more
,
oftner
less
;
and
though
they
never
came
under
any
Command
,
but
planted
themselves
where
and
as
they
pleas'd
;
yet
did
they
considerable
Service
in
taking
Possession
of
all
the
Country
Houses
and
Convents
,
that
lay
between
the
Hills
and
the
Plain
of
Barcelona
;
by
means
whereof
they
render'd
it
impossible
for
the
Enemy
to
make
any
Sorties
or
Sallies
at
any
Distance
from
the
Town
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
began
all
those
Difficulties
to
bear
,
which
long
before
by
the
General
had
been
apprehended
.
<EOS>
The
Troops
had
continu'd
under
a
State
of
Inactivity
for
the
Space
of
three
Weeks
,
all
which
was
spent
in
perpetual
Contrivances
and
Disputes
amongst
our
selves
,
not
with
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
In
six
several
Councils
of
War
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
,
under
the
Circumstances
we
then
lay
,
was
rejected
as
a
Madness
and
Impossibility
.
<EOS>
And
though
the
General
and
Brigadier
Stanhope
(
afterward
Earl
Stanhope
)
consented
to
some
Effort
should
be
made
to
satisfy
the
Expectation
of
the
World
,
than
with
any
Hopes
of
Success
.
<EOS>
However
,
no
Consent
at
all
could
be
obtain'd
from
any
Council
of
War
;
and
the
Dutch
General
in
particular
declar'd
,
that
he
would
not
obey
even
the
Commands
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
if
he
should
order
the
Sacrifice
of
the
Troops
under
him
in
so
unjustifiable
a
Manner
,
without
the
Consent
of
a
Council
of
War
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
all
those
Officers
,
who
refus'd
their
Consent
to
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
,
offer'd
to
march
into
the
Country
,
and
attempt
any
other
Place
,
that
was
not
provided
with
so
strong
and
numerous
a
Garrison
;
taking
it
for
granted
,
that
no
Town
in
Catalonia
,
Barcelona
excepted
,
could
make
long
Resistance
;
and
in
case
the
Troops
in
that
Garrison
should
pursue
them
,
they
then
might
have
an
Opportunity
of
fighting
them
at
less
Disadvantage
in
the
open
Field
,
than
behind
the
Walls
of
a
Place
of
such
Strength
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
should
they
have
issu'd
out
on
any
such
Design
,
<EOS>
a
Defeat
of
those
Troops
would
have
put
the
Province
of
Catalonia
,
together
with
the
Kingdoms
of
Aragon
and
Valencia
,
into
the
Hands
of
King
Charles
more
effectually
than
the
taking
of
Barcelona
it
self
.
  
<EOS>
Let
it
be
observ'd
,
en
passant
,
that
by
those
Offers
of
the
Land
Officers
in
a
Council
of
War
,
it
is
easy
to
imagine
what
would
have
been
the
Success
of
our
Troops
,
had
they
march'd
directly
from
Valencia
to
Madrid
.
<EOS>
For
if
after
two
Months
Alarm
,
it
was
thought
reasonable
,
as
well
as
practicable
,
to
march
into
the
open
Country
rather
than
attempt
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
,
where
Forces
equal
,
if
not
superior
in
Number
,
were
ready
to
follow
us
at
the
Heels
;
what
might
not
have
been
expected
from
an
Invasion
by
our
Troops
when
and
where
they
could
meet
with
little
Opposition
?
<EOS>
But
leaving
the
Consideration
of
what
might
have
been
,
I
shall
now
endeavour
at
least
with
great
Exactness
to
set
down
some
of
the
most
remarkable
Events
from
our
taking
to
the
Relief
of
Barcelona
.
  
<EOS>
The
repeated
Refusals
of
the
Councils
of
War
for
undertaking
the
Siege
of
so
strong
a
Place
,
with
a
Garrison
so
numerous
,
and
those
Refusals
grounded
upon
such
solid
Reasons
,
against
a
Design
so
rash
,
reduc'd
<EOS>
the
General
to
the
utmost
Perplexity
.
<EOS>
The
Court
of
King
Charles
was
immerg'd
<EOS>
in
complaint
;
all
belonging
to
him
lamenting
the
hard
Fate
of
that
Prince
,
to
be
brought
into
Catalonia
only
to
return
again
,
without
the
Offer
of
any
one
Effort
in
his
Favour
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
Hand
,
our
own
Officers
and
Soldiers
were
highly
dissatisfy'd
,
that
they
were
reproach'd
,
because
not
dispos'd
to
enter
upon
and
engage
themselves
in
Impossibilities
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
in
the
Manner
that
the
Siege
was
propos'd
and
insisted
upon
by
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
in
every
of
the
several
Councils
of
War
,
after
the
Loss
of
many
Men
,
thrown
away
to
no
other
purpose
,
but
to
avoid
the
Shame
(
as
the
Expression
ran
)
of
coming
like
Fools
and
going
away
like
Cowards
,
it
could
have
ended
in
nothing
but
a
Retreat
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
It
afforded
but
small
Comfort
to
the
Earl
to
have
foreseen
all
these
Difficulties
,
and
to
have
it
in
his
Power
to
say
,
that
he
would
never
have
taken
the
Arch
-
Duke
on
Board
,
nor
have
propos'd
to
him
the
Hopes
of
a
Recovery
of
the
Spanish
Monarchy
from
King
Philip
,
if
he
could
have
imagin'd
<EOS>
it
probable
,
that
he
should
not
have
been
at
liberty
to
pursue
his
own
Design
,
according
to
his
own
Judgment
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
allow'd
very
hard
for
him
,
who
had
undertaken
so
great
a
Work
,
and
that
without
any
Orders
from
the
Government
;
and
by
so
doing
could
have
had
no
Justification
but
by
Success
;
I
say
,
it
must
be
allow'd
to
be
very
hard
(
after
the
Undertaking
had
been
approv'd
in
England
)
that
he
should
find
himself
to
be
directed
in
this
Manner
by
those
at
a
Distance
,
upon
ill
grounded
and
confident
Reports
from
Mr.
Crow
;
and
compell'd
,
as
it
were
,
though
General
,
to
follow
the
Sentiments
of
Strangers
,
who
either
had
private
Views
of
Ambition
,
or
had
no
immediate
Care
or
Concern
for
the
Troops
employ'd
<EOS>
in
this
Expedition
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
the
present
unhappy
Circumstanches
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
in
the
Camp
before
Barcelona
:
Impossibilities
propos'd
;
no
Expedients
to
be
accepted
;
a
Court
reproaching
;
Councils
of
War
rejecting
;
and
the
Dutch
General
refusing
the
Assistance
of
the
Troops
under
his
Command
;
and
what
surmounted
all
,
a
Despair
of
bringing
such
Animosities
and
differing
Opinions
to
any
tolerable
Agreement
.
<EOS>
Yet
all
these
Difficulties
,
instead
of
discouraging
the
Earl
,
set
every
Faculty
of
his
more
afloat
;
and
,
at
last
,
produc'd
a
lucky
Thought
,
which
was
happily
attended
with
Events
extraordinary
,
and
Scenes
of
Success
much
beyond
his
Expectation
;
<EOS>
such
,
as
the
General
himself
was
heard
to
confess
,
it
had
been
next
to
Folly
to
have
look'd
<EOS>
for
;
as
certainly
,
in
prima
facie
,
it
would
hardly
have
born
proposing
,
to
take
by
Surprize
a
Place
much
stronger
than
Barcelona
it
self
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
that
his
only
Hope
of
succeeding
consisted
in
this
:
That
no
Person
could
suppose
such
an
Enterprize
could
enter
into
the
Imagination
of
Man
;
and
without
doubt
the
General
's
chief
Dependence
lay
upon
what
he
found
true
in
the
Sequel
;
that
the
Governor
and
Garrison
of
Monjouick
,
by
reason
of
their
own
Security
,
would
be
very
negligent
,
and
very
little
upon
their
Guard
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
to
make
the
Experiment
,
he
took
an
Opportunity
,
unknown
to
any
Person
but
an
Aid
de
Camp
that
attended
him
,
and
went
out
to
view
the
Fortifications
:
<EOS>
And
there
being
no
Horse
in
that
strong
Fortress
;
and
the
Miquelets
being
possess'd
of
all
the
Houses
and
Gardens
in
the
Plain
,
it
was
not
difficult
to
give
himself
that
Satisfaction
,
taking
his
Way
by
the
Foot
of
the
Hill
.
<EOS>
The
Observation
he
made
of
the
Place
it
self
,
the
Negligence
and
Supineness
of
the
Garrison
,
together
with
his
own
uneasy
Circumstances
,
soon
brought
the
Earl
to
a
Resolution
of
putting
his
first
Conceptions
in
Execution
,
satisfy'd
<EOS>
as
he
was
,
from
the
Situation
of
the
Ground
between
Monjouick
and
the
Town
,
that
if
the
first
was
in
our
Possession
,
the
Siege
of
the
latter
might
be
undertaken
with
some
Prospect
of
Success
.
  
<EOS>
From
what
has
been
said
,
some
may
be
apt
to
conclude
that
the
Siege
afterward
succeeding
,
when
the
Attack
was
made
from
the
Side
of
Monjouick
,
it
had
not
been
impossible
to
have
prevail'd
,
if
the
Effort
had
been
made
on
the
East
Side
of
the
Town
,
where
our
Forces
were
at
first
encamp'd
,
and
where
only
we
could
have
made
our
Approaches
,
if
Monjouick
had
not
been
in
our
Power
.
<EOS>
But
a
few
Words
will
convince
any
of
common
Experience
of
the
utter
Impossibility
of
Success
upon
the
East
Part
of
the
Town
,
although
many
almost
miraculous
Accidents
made
us
succeed
when
we
brought
our
Batteries
to
bear
upon
that
Part
of
Barcelona
towards
the
West
.
<EOS>
The
Ground
to
the
East
was
a
perfect
Level
for
many
Miles
,
which
would
have
necessitated
our
making
our
Approaches
in
a
regular
Way
;
and
consequently
our
Men
must
have
been
expos'd
to
the
full
Fire
of
their
whole
Artillery
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
Town
is
on
that
Side
much
stronger
than
any
other
;
there
is
an
Out
-
work
just
under
the
Walls
of
the
Town
,
flank'd
by
the
Courtin
and
the
Faces
of
two
Bastions
,
which
might
have
cost
us
half
our
Troops
to
possess
,
before
we
could
have
rais'd
a
Battery
against
the
Walls
.
<EOS>
Or
supposing
,
after
all
,
a
competent
Breach
had
been
made
,
what
a
wise
Piece
of
Work
must
it
have
been
to
have
attempted
a
Storm
against
double
the
Number
of
regular
Troops
within
?
  
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
we
were
so
favoured
by
the
Situation
,
when
we
made
the
Attack
from
the
Side
of
Monjouick
,
that
the
Breach
was
made
and
the
Town
taken
without
opening
of
Trenches
,
or
without
our
being
at
all
incommoded
by
any
Sallies
of
the
Enemy
;
as
in
truth
they
made
not
one
during
the
whole
Siege
.
<EOS>
Our
great
Battery
,
which
consisted
of
upwards
of
fifty
heavy
Cannon
,
supply'd
from
the
Ships
,
and
manag'd
by
the
Seamen
,
were
plac'd
upon
a
Spot
of
rising
Ground
,
just
large
enough
to
contain
our
Guns
,
with
two
deep
hollow
Ways
on
each
Side
the
Field
,
at
each
End
whereof
we
had
rais'd
a
little
Redoubt
,
which
serv'd
to
preserve
our
Men
from
the
Shot
of
the
Town
.
<EOS>
Those
little
Redoubts
,
in
which
we
had
some
Field
Pieces
,
flank'd
<EOS>
the
Battery
,
and
render'd
it
intirely
secure
from
any
Surprize
of
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
There
were
several
other
smaller
Batteries
rais'd
upon
the
Hills
adjacent
,
in
Places
not
to
be
approach'd
,
which
,
in
a
manner
,
render'd
all
the
Artillery
of
the
Enemy
useless
,
by
reason
their
Men
could
not
play
'em
,
but
with
the
utmost
Danger
;
whereas
ours
were
secure
,
very
few
being
kill'd
,
and
those
mostly
by
random
Shot
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
the
General
;
forc'd
,
as
he
was
,
to
take
this
extraordinary
Resolution
,
he
concluded
,
the
readiest
Way
to
surprize
his
Enemies
was
to
elude
his
Friends
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
call'd
a
Council
of
War
a
-
shore
,
of
the
Land
Officers
;
and
aboard
,
of
the
Admirals
and
Sea
Officers
:
In
both
which
it
was
resolv'd
,
that
in
case
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
was
judg'd
impracticable
,
and
that
the
Troops
should
be
re
-
imbark'd
by
a
Day
appointed
,
an
Effort
should
be
made
upon
the
Kingdom
of
Naples
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
Day
affix'd
being
come
,
the
heavy
Artillery
landed
for
the
Siege
was
return'd
aboard
the
Ships
,
and
every
thing
in
appearance
prepar'd
for
a
Re
-
imbarkment
.
<EOS>
During
which
,
the
General
was
oblig'd
to
undergo
all
the
Reproaches
of
a
dissatisfy'd
Court
;
and
what
was
more
uneasy
to
him
,
the
Murmurings
of
the
Sea
Officers
,
who
,
not
so
competent
Judges
in
what
related
to
Sieges
,
were
one
and
all
inclin'd
<EOS>
to
a
Design
upon
Barcelona
;
and
the
rather
,
because
as
the
Season
was
so
far
spent
,
it
was
thought
altogether
improper
to
engage
the
Fleet
in
any
new
Undertaking
.
<EOS>
However
,
all
Things
were
so
well
disguis'd
by
our
seeming
Preparations
for
a
Retreat
,
that
the
very
Night
our
Troops
were
in
March
towards
the
Attack
of
Monjouick
,
there
were
publick
Entertainments
and
Rejoicings
in
the
Town
for
the
raising
of
the
Siege
.
  
<EOS>
The
Prince
of
Hesse
had
taken
large
Liberties
in
complaining
against
all
the
Proceedings
in
the
Camp
before
Barcelona
;
even
to
Insinuations
,
that
though
the
Earl
gave
his
Opinion
for
some
Effort
in
public
,
yet
us'd
he
not
sufficient
Authority
over
the
other
General
Officers
to
incline
them
to
comply
;
throwing
out
withal
some
Hints
,
that
the
General
from
the
Beginning
had
declar'd
<EOS>
himself
in
favour
of
other
Operations
,
and
against
coming
to
Catalonia
<EOS>
;
the
latter
Part
whereof
was
nothing
but
Fact
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
Side
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
complain'd
,
that
the
boasted
Assistance
was
no
way
made
good
;
and
that
in
failure
thereof
,
his
Troops
were
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
Humours
of
a
Stranger
;
one
who
had
no
Command
;
and
whose
Conduct
might
bear
a
Question
whether
equal
to
his
Courage
.
<EOS>
These
Reproaches
of
one
another
had
bred
so
much
ill
Blood
between
those
two
great
Men
,
that
for
above
a
Fortnight
they
had
no
Correspondence
,
nor
ever
exchang'd
<EOS>
one
Word
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
however
,
having
made
his
proper
Dispositions
,
and
deliver'd
out
his
Orders
,
began
his
March
in
the
Evening
with
twelve
Hundred
Foot
and
two
Hundred
Horse
,
which
of
necessity
were
to
pass
by
the
Quarters
of
the
Prince
of
Hesse
.
<EOS>
That
Prince
,
on
their
Appearance
,
was
told
that
the
General
was
come
to
speak
with
him
;
and
being
brought
into
his
Apartment
,
the
Earl
acquainted
him
,
that
he
had
at
last
resolv'd
upon
an
Attempt
against
the
Enemy
;
adding
,
that
now
,
if
he
pleas'd
,
he
might
be
a
Judge
of
their
Behaviour
,
and
see
whether
his
Officers
and
Soldiers
had
deserv'd
<EOS>
that
Character
which
he
had
so
liberally
given
'em
.
<EOS>
The
Prince
made
answer
,
that
he
had
always
been
ready
to
take
his
Share
;
but
could
hardly
believe
,
that
Troops
marching
that
way
could
make
any
Attempt
against
the
Enemy
to
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
However
,
without
further
Discourse
he
call'd
for
his
Horse
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
we
may
see
what
Share
Fortune
has
in
the
greatest
Events
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
had
never
engag'd
<EOS>
in
such
a
dangerous
Affair
in
cold
Blood
and
unprovok'd
<EOS>
;
and
if
such
an
Enterprize
had
been
resolv'd
on
in
a
regular
Way
,
it
is
very
likely
he
might
have
given
the
Command
to
some
of
the
General
Officers
;
since
it
is
not
usual
,
nor
hardly
allowable
,
for
one
,
that
commands
in
chief
,
to
go
in
Person
on
such
kind
of
Services
.
<EOS>
But
here
we
see
the
General
and
Prince
,
notwithstanding
their
late
indifferent
Harmony
,
engag'd
<EOS>
together
in
this
most
desperate
Undertaking
.
  
<EOS>
Brigadier
Stanhope
and
Mr.
Methuen
(
now
Sir
Paul
)
were
the
General
's
particular
Friends
,
and
those
he
most
consulted
,
and
most
confided
in
;
yet
he
never
imparted
this
Resolution
of
his
to
either
of
them
;
for
he
was
not
willing
to
engage
them
in
a
Design
so
dangerous
,
and
where
there
was
so
little
Hope
of
Success
;
rather
choosing
to
reserve
them
as
Persons
most
capable
of
giving
Advice
and
Assistance
in
the
Confusion
,
great
enough
already
,
which
yet
must
have
been
greater
,
if
any
Accident
had
happen'd
to
himself
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
very
good
Reason
to
believe
,
that
the
Motive
,
which
mainly
engag'd
<EOS>
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
in
this
Enterprize
,
was
to
satisfy
the
Prince
of
Hesse
and
the
World
,
that
his
Diffidence
proceeded
from
his
Concern
for
the
Troops
committed
to
his
Charge
,
and
not
for
his
own
Person
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
Hand
,
the
great
Characters
of
the
two
Gentlemen
just
mention'd
are
so
well
known
,
that
it
will
easily
gain
Credit
,
that
the
only
Way
the
General
could
take
to
prevent
their
being
of
the
Party
,
was
to
conceal
it
from
them
,
as
he
did
from
all
Mankind
,
even
from
the
Archduke
himself
.
<EOS>
And
certainly
there
never
was
a
more
universal
Surprize
than
when
the
firing
was
heard
next
Morning
from
Monjouick
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
now
proceed
to
give
an
exact
Account
of
this
great
Action
;
of
which
no
Person
,
that
I
have
heard
of
,
ever
yet
took
upon
him
to
deliver
to
Posterity
the
glorious
Particulars
;
and
yet
the
Consequences
and
Events
,
by
what
follows
,
will
appear
so
great
,
and
so
very
extraordinary
,
<EOS>
that
few
,
if
any
,
had
they
had
it
in
their
Power
,
would
have
deny'd
<EOS>
themselves
the
Pleasure
or
the
World
<EOS>
the
Satisfaction
of
knowing
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
Troops
,
which
march'd
all
Night
along
the
Foot
of
the
Mountains
,
arriv'd
two
Hours
before
Day
under
the
Hill
of
Monjouick
,
not
a
Quarter
of
a
Mile
from
the
outward
Works
:
For
this
Reason
it
was
taken
for
granted
,
whatever
the
Design
was
which
the
General
had
propos'd
to
himself
,
that
it
would
be
put
in
Execution
before
Day
-
light
;
but
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
was
now
pleas'd
to
inform
the
Officers
of
the
Reasons
why
he
chose
to
stay
till
the
Light
appear'd
.
<EOS>
He
was
of
opinion
that
any
Success
would
be
impossible
,
unless
the
Enemy
came
into
the
outward
Ditch
under
the
Bastions
of
the
second
Enclosure
;
but
that
if
they
had
time
allow'd
<EOS>
them
to
come
thither
,
there
being
no
Palisadoes
,
our
Men
,
by
leaping
in
upon
them
,
after
receipt
of
their
first
Fire
,
might
drive
'em
into
the
upper
Works
;
and
following
them
close
,
with
some
Probability
,
might
force
them
,
under
that
Confusion
,
into
the
inward
Fortifications
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
the
General
's
Reasons
then
and
there
given
;
after
which
,
having
promis'd
ample
Rewards
to
such
as
<EOS>
discharg'd
<EOS>
their
Duty
<EOS>
well
,
a
Lieutenant
,
with
thirty
Men
,
was
order'd
to
advance
towards
the
Bastion
nearest
the
Town
;
and
a
Captain
,
with
fifty
Men
,
to
support
him
.
<EOS>
After
the
Enemy
's
Fire
they
were
to
leap
into
the
Ditch
,
and
their
Orders
were
to
follow
'em
close
,
if
they
retir'd
into
the
upper
Works
:
Nevertheless
,
not
to
pursue
'em
farther
,
if
they
made
into
the
inner
Fort
;
but
to
endeavour
to
cover
themselves
within
the
Gorge
of
the
Bastion
.
  
<EOS>
A
Lieutenant
and
a
Captain
,
with
the
Like
Number
of
Men
and
the
same
Orders
,
were
commanded
to
a
Demi
-
Bastion
at
the
Extremity
of
the
Fort
towards
the
West
,
which
was
above
Musket
-
Shot
from
the
inward
Fortification
.
<EOS>
Towards
this
Place
the
Wall
,
which
was
cut
into
the
Rock
,
was
not
fac'd
for
about
twenty
Yards
;
and
here
our
own
Men
got
up
;
<EOS>
where
they
found
three
Pieces
of
Cannon
upon
a
Platform
,
without
many
Men
to
defend
them
.
  
<EOS>
Those
appointed
to
the
Bastion
towards
the
Town
were
sustain'd
by
two
hundred
Men
;
with
which
the
General
and
Prince
went
in
Person
.
<EOS>
The
like
Number
,
under
the
Directions
of
Colonel
Southwell
,
were
to
sustain
the
Attack
towards
the
West
;
and
about
five
hundred
Men
were
left
under
the
Command
of
a
Dutch
Colonel
,
whose
Orders
were
to
assist
,
<EOS>
where
,
in
his
own
Judgment
,
he
should
think
most
proper
;
and
these
were
drawn
up
between
the
two
Parties
appointed
to
begin
the
Assault
.
<EOS>
My
Lot
was
on
the
Side
where
the
Prince
and
Earl
were
in
Person
;
and
where
we
sustain'd
the
only
Loss
from
the
first
Fire
of
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Our
men
,
though
quite
expos'd
,
and
though
the
Glacis
was
all
escarp'd
upon
the
live
Rock
,
went
on
with
an
undaunted
Courage
;
and
immediately
after
the
first
Fire
of
the
Enemy
,
all
,
that
were
not
<EOS>
kill'd
or
wounded
,
leap'd
in
,
pel
-
mel
,
amongst
the
Enemy
;
who
,
being
thus
boldly
attack'd
,
and
seeing
others
pouring
in
upon
'em
,
retir'd
in
great
Confusion
;
and
some
one
Way
,
some
another
,
ran
into
the
inward
Works
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
Port
in
the
Flank
of
the
principal
Bastion
,
towards
the
North
-
East
,
and
a
cover'd
Way
,
through
which
the
General
and
the
Prince
of
Hesse
<EOS>
follow'd
<EOS>
the
flying
Forces
;
and
by
that
Means
became
possess'd
of
it
.
<EOS>
Luckily
enough
here
lay
a
Number
of
great
Stones
in
the
Gorge
of
the
Bastion
,
for
the
Use
of
the
Fortification
;
with
which
we
made
a
Sort
of
Breast
-
Work
,
before
the
Enemy
recover'd
of
their
Amaze
,
or
made
any
considerable
Fire
upon
us
from
their
inward
Fort
,
which
commanded
the
upper
Part
of
that
Bastion
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
afterwards
inform'd
,
that
the
Commander
of
the
Citadel
,
expecting
but
one
Attack
,
had
call'd
off
the
Men
from
the
most
distant
and
western
Part
of
the
Fort
,
to
that
Side
which
was
next
the
Town
;
upon
which
our
Men
got
into
a
Demi
-
Bastion
in
the
most
extream
Part
of
the
Fortification
.
<EOS>
Here
they
got
Possession
of
three
Pieces
of
Cannon
,
with
hardly
any
Opposition
;
and
had
Leisure
to
cast
up
a
little
Retrenchment
,
and
to
make
use
of
the
Guns
they
had
taken
to
defend
it
.
<EOS>
Under
this
Situation
,
the
Enemy
,
when
drove
into
the
inward
Fort
,
were
expos'd
to
our
Fire
from
those
Places
we
were
possess'd
of
,
in
case
they
offer'd
to
make
any
Sally
,
or
other
Attempt
against
us
.
<EOS>
Thus
we
every
Moment
became
better
and
better
prepar'd
against
any
Effort
of
the
Garrison
.
<EOS>
And
as
they
could
not
pretend
to
assail
us
without
evident
Hazard
;
so
nothing
remain'd
for
us
to
do
,
till
we
could
bring
up
our
Artillery
and
Mortars
.
<EOS>
Now
it
was
that
the
General
sent
for
the
thousand
Men
under
Brigadier
Stanhope
's
Command
,
which
he
had
posted
at
a
Convent
,
halfway
between
the
Town
and
Monjouick
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
almost
a
total
Cessation
of
Fire
,
the
Men
on
both
Sides
being
under
Cover
.
<EOS>
The
General
was
in
the
upper
Part
of
the
Bastion
;
the
Prince
of
Hesse
below
,
behind
a
little
Work
at
the
Point
of
the
Bastion
,
whence
<EOS>
he
could
only
see
the
Heads
of
the
Enemy
over
the
Parapet
of
the
inward
Fort
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
an
Accident
happen'd
which
cost
that
gallant
Prince
his
Life
.
  
<EOS>
The
Enemy
had
Lines
of
Communication
between
Barcelona
and
Monjouick
.
<EOS>
The
Governor
of
the
former
,
upon
hearing
the
firing
from
the
latter
,
immediately
sent
four
hundred
Dragoons
on
Horseback
,
under
Orders
,
that
two
Hundred
dismounting
should
reinforce
the
Garrison
,
and
the
other
two
Hundred
should
return
with
their
Horses
back
to
the
Town
.
  
<EOS>
When
those
two
Hundred
Dragoons
were
accordingly
got
into
the
inward
Fort
,
unseen
by
any
of
our
Men
,
the
Spaniards
,
waving
their
Hats
over
their
Heads
,
repeated
over
and
over
,
Viva
el
Rey
,
Viva
.
<EOS>
This
the
Prince
of
Hesse
unfortunately
took
for
a
Signal
of
their
Desire
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
with
too
much
Warmth
and
Precipitancy
,
calling
to
the
Soldiers
following
,
They
surrender
,
they
surrender
,
he
advanc'd
with
near
three
Hundred
Men
(
who
<EOS>
follow'd
him
without
any
Orders
from
their
General
)
along
the
Curtain
which
led
to
the
Ditch
of
the
inward
Fort
.
<EOS>
The
Enemy
suffered
them
to
come
into
the
Ditch
,
and
there
surrounding
'em
,
took
two
Hundred
of
them
Prisoners
,
at
the
same
time
making
a
Discharge
upon
the
rest
,
who
were
running
back
the
Way
they
came
.
<EOS>
This
firing
brought
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
down
from
the
upper
Part
of
the
Bastion
,
to
see
what
was
doing
below
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
just
turn'd
<EOS>
the
Point
of
the
Bastion
,
he
saw
the
Prince
of
Hesse
retiring
,
with
the
Men
that
had
so
rashly
<EOS>
advanc'd
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
had
exchang'd
<EOS>
a
very
few
Words
with
him
,
when
,
from
a
second
Fire
,
that
Prince
receiv'd
a
Shot
in
the
great
Artery
of
the
Thigh
,
of
which
he
died
immediately
,
falling
down
at
the
General
's
Feet
,
who
instantly
gave
Orders
to
carry
off
the
Body
to
the
next
Convent
.
  
<EOS>
Almost
the
same
Moment
an
Officer
came
to
acquaint
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
that
a
great
Body
of
Horse
and
Foot
,
at
least
three
Thousand
,
were
on
their
March
from
Barcelona
towards
the
Fort
.
<EOS>
The
Distance
is
near
a
Mile
,
all
uneven
Ground
;
so
that
the
Enemy
was
either
discoverable
,
or
not
to
be
seen
,
just
as
they
were
marching
on
the
Hills
or
in
the
Vallies
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
General
directly
got
on
Horseback
,
to
take
a
View
of
those
Forces
from
the
rising
Ground
without
the
Fort
,
having
left
all
the
Posts
,
which
were
already
taken
,
well
secur'd
with
the
allotted
Numbers
of
Officers
and
Soldiers
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
Event
will
demonstrate
of
what
Consequence
the
Absence
or
Presence
of
one
Man
may
prove
on
great
Occasions
;
No
sooner
was
the
Earl
out
of
the
Fort
,
the
Care
of
which
he
had
left
under
the
Command
of
the
Lord
Charlemont
(
a
Person
of
known
Merit
and
undoubted
Courage
,
but
somewhat
too
flexible
in
his
Temper
)
<EOS>
when
a
panick
Fear
(
tho
'
the
Earl
,
as
I
have
said
,
was
only
gone
to
take
a
View
of
the
Enemy
)
<EOS>
seiz'd
upon
the
Soldiery
,
which
was
a
little
too
easily
comply'd
with
by
the
Lord
Charlemont
,
then
commanding
Officer
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
;
for
I
heard
an
Officer
,
ready
enough
to
take
such
Advantages
,
urge
to
him
,
that
none
of
all
those
Posts
we
were
become
Masters
of
,
were
tenable
;
that
to
offer
at
it
would
be
no
better
than
wilfully
sacrificing
human
Lives
to
Caprice
and
Humour
;
and
just
like
a
Man
's
knocking
his
Head
against
Stone
Walls
,
to
try
which
was
hardest
.
<EOS>
Having
over
-
heard
this
Piece
of
Lip
-
Oratory
,
and
finding
by
the
Answer
that
it
was
too
likely
to
prevail
,
and
that
all
I
was
like
to
say
would
avail
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
slipt
away
as
fast
as
I
could
,
to
acquaint
the
General
with
the
Danger
impending
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
pass'd
along
,
I
took
notice
that
the
Panick
was
upon
the
Increase
,
the
general
Rumor
affirming
,
that
we
should
be
all
cut
off
by
the
Troops
that
were
come
out
of
Barcelona
,
if
we
did
not
immediately
gain
the
Hills
,
or
the
Houses
possess'd
by
the
Miquelets
.
<EOS>
Officers
and
Soldiers
,
under
this
prevailing
Terror
,
quitted
their
Posts
;
and
in
one
united
Body
(
the
Lord
Charlemont
at
the
Head
of
them
)
march'd
,
or
rather
hurry'd
out
of
the
Fort
;
and
were
come
halfway
down
the
Hill
before
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
came
up
to
them
.
<EOS>
Though
on
my
acquainting
him
with
the
shameful
and
surprizing
Accident
he
made
no
Stay
,
but
answering
,
with
a
good
deal
of
Vehemence
,
Good
God
,
is
it
possible
?
<EOS>
hastened
back
as
fast
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
I
never
thought
my
self
happier
than
in
this
Piece
of
Service
to
my
Country
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
could
not
but
value
it
,
as
having
been
therein
more
than
a
little
instrumental
in
the
glorious
Successes
which
succeeded
;
since
immediately
upon
this
Notice
from
me
,
the
Earl
gallop'd
up
the
Hill
,
and
lighting
when
he
came
to
Lord
Charlemont
,
he
took
his
Half
-
pike
out
of
his
Hand
;
and
turning
to
the
Officers
and
Soldiers
,
told
them
,
if
they
would
not
face
about
and
follow
him
,
they
should
have
the
Scandal
and
eternal
Infamy
upon
them
of
having
deserted
their
Posts
,
and
abandon'd
their
General
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
surprizing
to
see
with
what
Alacrity
and
new
Courage
they
fac'd
about
and
follow'd
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
.
<EOS>
In
a
Moment
they
had
forgot
their
Apprehensions
;
and
,
without
doubt
,
had
they
met
with
any
Opposition
,
they
would
have
behav'd
themselves
with
the
greatest
Bravery
.
<EOS>
But
as
these
Motions
were
unperceiv'd
by
the
Enemy
,
all
the
Posts
were
regain'd
,
and
anew
possess'd
in
less
than
half
an
Hour
,
without
any
Loss
:
Though
,
had
our
Forces
march'd
half
Musket
-
shot
farther
,
their
Retreat
would
have
been
perceiv'd
,
and
<EOS>
all
the
Success
attendant
on
this
glorious
Attempt
must
have
been
intirely
blasted
.
  
<EOS>
Another
Incident
which
attended
this
happy
Enterprize
was
this
:
The
two
hundred
Men
which
fell
into
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
,
by
the
unhappy
Mistake
of
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
were
carry'd
directly
into
the
Town
.
<EOS>
The
Marquis
of
Risburg
,
a
Lieutenant
-
General
,
who
commanded
the
three
thousand
Men
which
were
marching
from
the
Town
to
the
Relief
of
the
Fort
,
examin'd
<EOS>
the
Prisoners
,
as
they
pass'd
by
;
and
they
all
agreeing
that
the
General
and
the
Prince
of
Hesse
were
in
Person
with
the
Troops
that
made
the
Attack
on
Monjouick
,
the
Marquis
gave
immediate
Orders
to
retire
to
the
Town
;
taking
it
for
granted
,
that
the
main
Body
of
the
Troops
attended
the
Prince
and
General
;
and
that
some
Design
therefore
was
on
foot
to
intercept
his
Return
,
in
case
he
should
venture
too
far
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
unfortunate
Loss
of
our
two
hundred
Men
turn'd
to
our
Advantage
,
in
preventing
the
Advance
of
the
Enemy
,
which
must
have
put
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
to
inconceivable
Difficulties
.
  
<EOS>
The
Body
of
one
Thousand
,
under
Brigadier
Stanhope
,
being
come
up
to
Monjouick
,
and
no
Interruption
given
us
by
the
Enemy
,
our
Affairs
were
put
into
very
good
Order
on
this
Side
;
while
the
Camp
on
the
other
Side
was
so
fortify'd
,
that
the
Enemy
,
during
the
Siege
,
never
made
one
Effort
against
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
the
Communication
between
the
two
Camps
was
secure
enough
;
although
our
Troops
were
obliged
to
a
tedious
March
along
the
Foot
of
the
Hills
,
whenever
the
General
thought
fit
to
relieve
those
on
Duty
on
the
Side
of
the
Attack
,
from
those
Regiments
encamp'd
on
the
West
Side
of
Barcelona
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
Day
,
after
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
had
taken
Care
to
secure
the
first
Camp
to
the
Eastward
of
the
Town
,
he
gave
Orders
to
the
Officers
of
the
Fleet
to
land
the
Artillery
and
Ammunition
behind
the
Fortress
to
the
Westward
.
<EOS>
Immediately
upon
the
Landing
whereof
,
two
Mortars
were
fix'd
;
from
both
which
we
ply'd
the
Fort
of
Monjouick
furiously
with
our
Bombs
.
<EOS>
But
the
third
or
fourth
Day
,
one
of
our
Shells
fortunately
lighting
on
their
Magazine
of
Powder
,
blew
it
up
;
and
with
it
the
Governor
,
and
many
principal
Officers
who
were
at
Dinner
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
Blast
,
at
the
same
Instant
,
threw
down
a
Face
of
one
of
the
smaller
Bastions
;
which
the
vigilant
Miquelets
,
ready
enough
to
take
all
Advantages
,
no
sooner
saw
(
for
they
were
under
the
Hill
,
very
near
the
Place
)
but
they
readily
enter'd
,
while
the
Enemy
were
under
the
utmost
Confusion
.
<EOS>
If
the
Earl
,
no
less
watchful
than
they
,
had
not
at
the
same
Moment
thrown
himself
in
with
some
regular
Troops
,
and
appeas'd
the
general
Disorder
,
in
all
probability
the
Garrison
had
been
put
to
the
Sword
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
General
's
Presence
not
only
allay'd
<EOS>
the
Fury
of
the
Miquelets
;
but
kept
his
own
Troops
under
strictest
Discipline
:
<EOS>
So
that
in
a
happy
Hour
for
the
frighted
Garrison
,
the
General
gave
Officers
and
Soldiers
Quarters
,
making
them
Prisoners
of
War
.
  
<EOS>
How
critical
was
that
Minute
wherein
the
General
met
his
retreating
Commander
?
<EOS>
a
very
few
Steps
farther
had
excluded
us
our
own
Conquests
,
to
the
utter
Loss
of
all
those
greater
Glories
which
ensu'd
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
that
have
been
the
worst
;
for
besides
the
Shame
attending
such
an
ill
concerted
Retreat
from
our
Acquests
on
Monjouick
,
we
must
have
felt
the
accumulative
Disgrace
of
infamously
retiring
aboard
the
Ships
that
brought
us
;
but
Heaven
reserv'd
for
our
General
amazing
Scenes
both
of
Glory
and
Mortification
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
here
omit
one
Singularity
of
Life
,
which
will
demonstrate
Men
's
different
Way
of
Thinking
,
if
not
somewhat
worse
;
when
many
Years
after
,
to
one
in
Office
,
who
seem'd
a
little
too
dead
to
my
Complaints
,
and
by
that
Means
irritating
my
human
Passions
,
injustice
to
my
self
,
as
well
as
Cause
<EOS>
,
I
urged
this
Piece
of
Service
,
by
which
I
not
only
preserv'd
the
Place
,
but
the
Honour
of
my
Country
,
that
Minister
petite
,
to
mortify
my
Expectations
and
baffle
my
Plea
,
with
a
Grimace
as
odd
as
his
Logick
,
return'd
,
that
,
in
his
Opinion
,
the
Service
pretended
was
a
Disservice
to
the
Nation
;
since
Perseverance
had
cost
the
Government
more
Money
than
all
our
Conquests
were
worth
,
could
we
have
kept
'em
.
<EOS>
So
irregular
are
the
Conceptions
of
Man
,
when
even
great
Actions
thwart
the
Bent
of
an
interested
Will
!
  
<EOS>
The
Fort
of
Monjouick
being
thus
surprizingly
reduc'd
,
furnish'd
a
strange
Vivacity
to
Mens
Expectations
,
and
as
extravagantly
flatter'd
<EOS>
their
Hopes
;
for
as
Success
never
fails
to
excite
weaker
Minds
to
pursue
their
good
Fortune
,
though
many
times
to
their
own
Loss
;
so
is
it
often
too
apt
to
push
on
more
elevated
Spirits
to
renew
the
Encounter
for
atchieving
new
Conquests
,
by
hazarding
too
rashly
all
their
former
Glory
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
every
Body
now
began
to
make
his
utmost
Efforts
;
and
look'd
upon
himself
as
a
Drone
,
if
he
was
not
employ'd
in
doing
something
or
other
towards
pushing
forward
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
it
self
,
and
raising
proper
Batteries
for
that
Purpose
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
it
must
in
Justice
be
acknowledg'd
,
that
notwithstanding
this
prodigious
Success
that
attended
this
bold
Enterprize
,
the
Land
Forces
of
themselves
,
without
the
Assistance
of
the
Sailors
,
could
never
have
reduc'd
the
Town
.
<EOS>
The
Commanders
and
Officers
of
the
Fleet
had
always
evinc'd
<EOS>
themselves
Favourers
of
this
Project
upon
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
A
new
Undertaking
so
late
in
the
Year
,
as
I
have
said
before
,
was
their
utter
Aversion
,
and
what
they
hated
to
hear
of
.
<EOS>
Elated
therefore
with
a
Beginning
so
auspicious
,
they
gave
a
more
willing
Assistance
than
could
have
been
ask'd
,
or
judiciously
expected
.
<EOS>
The
Admirals
forgot
their
Element
,
and
acted
as
General
Officers
at
Land
:
They
came
every
Day
from
their
Ships
,
with
a
Body
of
Men
form'd
into
Companies
,
and
regularly
marshall'd
and
commanded
by
Captains
and
Lieutenants
of
their
own
.
<EOS>
Captain
Littleton
in
particular
,
one
of
the
most
advanced
Captains
in
the
whole
Fleet
,
offer'd
of
himself
to
take
care
of
the
Landing
and
Conveyance
of
the
Artillery
to
the
Camp
.
<EOS>
And
answerable
to
that
his
first
Zeal
was
his
Vigour
all
along
,
for
finding
it
next
to
an
Impossibility
to
draw
the
Cannon
and
Mortars
up
such
vast
Precipices
by
Horses
,
if
the
Country
had
afforded
them
,
he
caus'd
Harnesses
to
be
made
for
two
hundred
Men
;
and
by
that
Means
,
after
a
prodigious
Fatigue
and
Labour
,
brought
the
Cannon
and
Mortars
necessary
for
the
Siege
up
to
the
very
Batteries
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
Manner
was
the
Siege
begun
;
nor
was
it
carry'd
<EOS>
on
with
any
less
Application
;
the
Approaches
being
made
by
an
Army
of
Besiegers
,
that
very
little
,
if
at
all
,
exceeded
the
Number
of
the
Besieg'd
;
not
altogether
in
a
regular
Manner
,
our
few
Forces
would
not
admit
it
;
but
yet
with
Regularity
enough
to
secure
our
two
little
Camps
,
and
preserve
a
Communication
between
both
,
not
to
be
interrupted
or
incommoded
by
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
We
had
soon
erected
three
several
Batteries
against
the
Place
,
all
on
the
West
Side
of
the
Town
,
viz
.
<EOS>
one
of
nine
Guns
,
another
of
Twelve
,
and
the
last
of
upwards
of
Thirty
.
<EOS>
From
all
which
we
ply'd
the
Town
incessantly
,
and
with
all
imaginable
Fury
;
and
very
often
in
whole
Vollies
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
it
was
thought
not
only
adviseable
,
but
necessary
,
to
erect
another
Battery
,
upon
a
lower
Piece
of
Ground
under
a
small
Hill
;
which
lying
more
within
Reach
,
and
opposite
to
those
Places
where
the
Walls
were
imagin'd
weakest
,
would
annoy
the
Town
the
more
;
and
being
design'd
for
six
Guns
only
,
might
soon
be
perfected
.
<EOS>
A
French
Engeneer
had
the
Direction
;
and
indeed
very
quickly
perfected
it
.
<EOS>
But
when
it
came
to
be
consider'd
which
way
to
get
the
Cannon
to
it
,
most
were
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
absolutely
impracticable
,
by
reason
of
the
vast
Descent
;
tho
'
<EOS>
I
believe
they
might
have
added
a
stronger
Reason
,
and
perhaps
more
intrinsick
,
that
it
was
extremely
expos'd
to
the
Fire
of
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Having
gain'd
<EOS>
some
little
Reputation
in
the
Attack
of
Monjouick
,
this
Difficulty
was
at
last
to
be
put
upon
me
;
and
<EOS>
as
some
,
not
my
Enemies
,
suppos'd
,
more
out
of
Envy
than
good
Will
.
<EOS>
However
,
when
I
came
to
the
Place
,
and
had
carefully
taken
a
View
of
it
,
though
I
was
sensible
enough
of
the
Difficulty
,
I
made
my
main
Objection
as
to
the
Time
for
accomplishing
it
;
for
it
was
then
between
Nine
and
Ten
,
and
the
Guns
were
to
be
mounted
by
Day
-
light
.
<EOS>
Neither
could
I
at
present
see
any
other
Way
to
answer
their
Expectations
,
than
by
casting
the
Cannon
down
the
Precipice
,
at
all
Hazards
,
to
the
Place
below
,
where
that
fourth
Battery
was
erected
.
  
<EOS>
This
wanted
not
Objections
to
;
and
therefore
to
answer
my
Purpose
,
as
to
point
of
Time
,
sixty
Men
more
were
order'd
<EOS>
me
,
as
much
as
possible
to
facilitate
the
Work
by
Numbers
;
and
accordingly
I
set
about
it
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
was
setting
all
Hands
to
work
,
and
had
given
Orders
to
my
Men
to
begin
some
Paces
back
,
to
make
the
Descent
more
gradual
,
and
thereby
render
the
Task
a
little
more
feasible
,
Major
Collier
,
who
commanded
the
Train
,
came
to
me
;
and
perceiving
the
Difficulties
of
the
Undertaking
,
in
a
Fret
<EOS>
told
me
,
I
was
impos'd
upon
;
and
vow'd
he
would
go
and
find
out
Brigadier
Petit
,
and
let
him
know
the
Impossibility
,
as
well
as
the
Unreasonableness
of
the
Task
I
was
put
upon
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarce
utter'd
those
Words
,
and
turn'd
<EOS>
himself
round
to
perform
his
Promise
,
when
an
unlucky
Shot
with
a
Musket
-
Ball
wounded
him
through
the
Shoulder
;
upon
which
he
was
carry'd
off
,
and
I
saw
him
not
till
some
considerable
time
after
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
painful
Diligence
,
and
the
additional
Compliment
of
Men
,
however
,
I
so
well
succeeded
(
such
was
my
great
good
Fortune
)
that
the
Way
was
made
,
and
the
Guns
,
by
the
Help
of
Fascines
,
and
other
lesser
Preparations
below
,
safely
let
down
and
mounted
;
so
that
that
fourth
Battery
began
to
play
upon
the
Town
before
Break
of
Day
;
and
with
all
the
Success
that
was
propos'd
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
Breach
in
a
very
few
Days
after
was
found
wholly
practicable
;
and
all
Things
were
got
ready
for
a
general
Storm
.
<EOS>
Which
Don
Valasco
the
Governor
being
sensible
of
,
immediately
beat
a
Parley
;
upon
which
it
was
,
among
other
Articles
,
concluded
,
that
the
Town
should
be
surrender'd
in
three
Days
;
and
the
better
to
ensure
it
,
the
Bastion
,
which
commanded
the
Port
St.
Angelo
,
was
directly
put
into
our
Possession
.
  
<EOS>
But
before
the
Expiration
of
the
limited
three
Days
,
a
very
unexpected
Accident
fell
out
,
which
hasten'd
the
Surrender
.
<EOS>
Don
Valasco
,
during
his
Government
,
had
behav'd
himself
very
arbitrarily
,
and
thereby
procur'd
,
as
the
Consequence
of
it
,
a
large
Proportion
of
ill
will
,
not
only
among
the
Townsmen
,
but
among
the
Miquelets
,
who
had
,
in
their
Zeal
to
King
Charles
,
flock'd
from
all
Parts
of
Catalonia
to
the
Siege
of
their
Capital
;
and
who
,
on
the
Signing
of
the
Articles
of
Surrender
,
had
found
various
Ways
,
being
well
acquainted
with
the
most
private
Avenues
,
to
get
by
Night
into
the
Town
:
So
that
early
in
the
Morning
they
began
to
plunder
all
that
they
knew
Enemies
to
King
Charles
,
or
thought
Friends
to
the
Prince
his
Competitor
.
  
<EOS>
Their
main
Design
was
upon
Valasco
the
Governor
,
whom
,
if
they
could
have
got
into
their
Hands
,
it
was
not
to
be
question'd
,
but
as
far
as
his
Life
and
Limbs
would
have
serv'd
,
they
would
have
sufficiently
satiated
their
Vengeance
upon
.
<EOS>
He
expected
no
less
;
and
therefore
concealed
himself
,
till
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
could
give
Orders
for
his
more
safe
and
private
Conveyance
by
Sea
to
Alicant
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
in
the
Town
all
was
in
the
utmost
Confusion
;
which
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
at
the
very
first
hearing
,
hastened
to
appease
;
with
his
usual
Alacrity
he
rid
all
alone
to
Port
St.
Angelo
,
where
at
that
time
my
self
happen'd
to
be
;
and
demanding
to
be
admitted
,
the
Officer
of
the
Guard
,
under
Fear
and
Surprise
,
open'd
<EOS>
the
Wicket
,
through
which
the
Earl
enter'd
,
and
I
after
him
.
  
<EOS>
Scarce
had
we
gone
a
hundred
Paces
,
when
we
saw
a
Lady
of
apparent
Quality
,
and
indisputable
Beauty
,
in
a
strange
,
but
most
affecting
Agony
,
flying
from
the
apprehended
Fury
of
the
Miquelets
;
her
lovely
Hair
was
all
flowing
about
her
Shoulders
,
which
,
and
the
Consternation
she
was
in
,
rather
added
to
,
than
any
thing
diminish'd
<EOS>
from
the
Charms
of
an
Excess
of
Beauty
.
<EOS>
She
,
as
is
very
natural
to
People
in
Distress
,
made
up
directly
to
the
Earl
,
her
Eyes
satisfying
her
he
was
a
Person
likely
to
give
her
all
the
Protection
she
wanted
.
<EOS>
And
as
soon
as
ever
she
came
near
enough
,
in
a
Manner
that
declar'd
<EOS>
her
Quality
before
she
spoke
<EOS>
,
she
crav'd
<EOS>
that
Protection
,
telling
him
,
the
better
to
secure
it
,
who
it
was
that
ask'd
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
generous
Earl
presently
convinc'd
her
,
he
wanted
no
Intreaties
,
having
,
before
he
knew
her
to
be
the
Dutchess
of
Popoli
,
taken
her
by
the
Hand
,
in
order
to
convey
her
through
the
Wicket
<EOS>
which
he
enter'd
<EOS>
at
,
to
a
Place
of
Safety
without
the
Town
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay'd
behind
,
while
the
Earl
convey'd
the
distress'd
Dutchess
to
her
requested
Asylum
;
and
I
believe
it
was
much
the
longest
Part
of
an
Hour
before
he
return'd
.
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
ever
he
came
back
,
he
,
and
my
self
,
at
his
Command
,
repair'd
to
the
Place
of
most
Confusion
,
which
the
extraordinary
Noise
full
readily
directed
us
to
;
and
which
happened
to
be
on
the
Parade
before
the
Palace
.
<EOS>
There
it
was
that
the
Miquelets
were
making
their
utmost
Efforts
to
get
into
their
Hands
the
almost
sole
Occasion
of
the
Tumult
,
and
the
Object
of
their
raging
Fury
,
the
Person
of
Don
Valasco
,
the
late
Governor
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
the
Earl
preserv'd
<EOS>
that
Governor
from
the
violent
,
but
perhaps
too
just
Resentments
of
the
Miquelets
;
and
,
as
I
said
before
,
convey'd
him
by
Sea
to
Alicant
.
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
I
could
little
doubt
the
Effect
,
or
be
any
thing
surpriz'd
<EOS>
at
the
Easiness
of
the
Task
,
when
I
saw
,
that
wherever
he
appear'd
<EOS>
the
popular
Fury
was
in
a
Moment
allay'd
,
and
that
every
Dictate
of
that
General
was
assented
to
with
the
utmost
Chearfulness
and
Deference
.
<EOS>
Valasco
,
before
his
Embarkment
,
had
given
Orders
,
in
Gratitude
to
his
Preserver
,
for
all
the
Gates
to
be
deliver'd
up
,
tho
'
short
of
the
stipulated
Term
;
and
they
were
accordingly
so
delivered
,
and
our
Troops
took
Possession
so
soon
as
ever
that
Governor
was
aboard
the
Ship
that
was
to
convey
him
to
Alicant
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
,
Brigadier
Stanhope
order'd
a
Tent
to
be
pitch'd
<EOS>
as
near
the
Trenches
as
possibly
could
be
with
Safety
;
where
he
not
only
entertain'd
the
chief
Officers
who
were
upon
Duty
,
but
likewise
the
Catalonian
Gentlemen
who
brought
Miquelets
to
our
Assistance
.
<EOS>
I
remember
I
saw
an
old
Cavalier
,
having
his
only
Son
with
him
,
who
appear'd
a
fine
young
Gentleman
,
about
twenty
Years
of
Age
,
go
into
the
Tent
,
in
order
to
dine
with
the
Brigadier
.
<EOS>
But
whilst
they
were
at
Dinner
,
an
unfortunate
Shot
came
from
the
Bastion
of
St.
Antonio
,
and
intirely
struck
off
the
Head
of
the
Son
.
<EOS>
The
father
immediately
rose
up
,
first
looking
down
upon
his
headless
Child
,
and
then
lifting
up
his
Eyes
to
Heaven
,
whilst
the
Tears
ran
down
his
Cheeks
,
he
cross'd
himself
,
and
only
said
,
Fiat
voluntas
tua
,
and
bore
it
with
a
wonderful
Patience
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
a
sad
Spectacle
,
and
truly
it
affects
me
now
whilst
I
am
writing
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
tho
'
<EOS>
for
some
time
after
the
Revolution
he
had
been
employ'd
in
civil
Affairs
,
return'd
to
the
military
Life
with
great
Satisfaction
,
which
was
ever
his
Inclination
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Stanhope
,
who
was
justly
afterwards
created
an
Earl
,
did
well
deserve
this
Motto
,
Tam
Marte
quam
Mercurio
;
for
truly
he
behav'd
,
all
the
time
he
continu'd
in
Spain
,
as
if
he
had
been
inspir'd
with
Conduct
;
for
the
Victory
at
Almanar
was
intirely
owing
to
him
;
and
likewise
at
the
Battle
of
Saragosa
he
distinguish'd
himself
with
great
Bravery
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
not
Success
at
Bruhega
was
not
his
Fault
;
for
no
Man
can
resist
Fate
;
for
'
twas
decreed
by
Heaven
that
Philip
should
remain
King
of
Spain
,
and
Charles
to
be
Emperor
of
Germany
.
<EOS>
Yet
each
of
these
Monarchs
have
been
ungrateful
to
the
Instruments
which
the
Almighty
made
use
of
to
preserve
them
upon
their
Thrones
;
for
one
had
not
been
King
of
Spain
but
for
France
;
and
the
other
had
not
been
Emperor
but
for
England
.
  
<EOS>
Barcelona
,
the
chief
Place
in
Catalonia
,
being
thus
in
our
Hands
,
as
soon
as
the
Garrison
,
little
inferior
to
our
Army
,
had
march'd
out
with
Drums
beating
,
Colours
flying
,
&
c.
<EOS>
according
to
the
Articles
,
Charles
the
Third
made
his
publick
Entry
,
and
was
proclaim'd
<EOS>
King
,
and
receiv'd
with
the
general
Acclamations
,
and
all
other
Demonstrations
of
Joy
suitable
to
that
great
Occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Some
Days
after
which
,
the
Citizens
,
far
from
being
satiated
with
their
former
Demonstrations
of
their
Duty
,
sent
a
Petition
to
the
King
,
by
proper
Deputies
for
that
Purpose
appointed
,
desiring
Leave
to
give
more
ample
Instances
of
their
Affections
in
a
public
Cavalcade
.
<EOS>
The
King
granted
their
Request
,
and
the
Citizens
,
pursuant
thereto
,
made
their
Preparations
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Day
appointed
,
the
King
,
plac'd
in
a
Balcony
belonging
to
the
House
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
appear'd
ready
to
honour
the
Show
.
<EOS>
The
Ceremonial
,
to
speak
nothing
figuratively
,
was
very
fine
and
grand
:
Those
of
the
first
Rank
made
their
Appearance
in
decent
Order
,
and
upon
fine
Horses
;
and
others
under
Arms
,
and
in
Companies
,
march'd
with
native
Gravity
and
Grandeur
,
all
saluting
his
Majesty
as
they
pass'd
by
,
after
the
Spanish
Manner
,
which
that
Prince
return'd
with
the
Movement
of
his
Hand
to
his
Mouth
;
for
the
Kings
of
Spain
are
not
allow'd
to
salute
,
or
return
a
Salute
,
by
any
Motion
to
,
or
of
,
the
Hat
.
  
<EOS>
After
these
follow'd
several
Pageants
;
the
first
of
which
was
drawn
by
Mules
,
set
off
to
the
Height
with
stateliest
Feathers
,
and
adorn'd
with
little
Bells
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
Top
of
this
Pageant
appear'd
a
Man
dress'd
all
in
Green
;
but
in
the
Likeness
of
a
Dragon
.
<EOS>
The
Pageant
making
a
Stop
just
over
-
against
the
Balcony
where
the
King
sate
,
the
Dragonical
Representative
diverted
him
with
great
Variety
of
Dancings
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
all
the
time
throwing
out
Dollars
by
Handfuls
among
the
Populace
,
which
they
as
constantly
receiv'd
with
the
loud
Acclamation
and
repeated
Cries
of
Viva
,
Viva
,
Carlos
Terceros
,
Viva
la
Casa
d'Austria
.
  
<EOS>
When
that
had
play'd
<EOS>
its
Part
,
another
Pageant
,
drawn
as
before
,
made
a
like
full
Stop
before
the
same
Balcony
.
<EOS>
On
this
was
plac'd
<EOS>
a
very
large
Cage
,
or
Aviary
,
the
Cover
of
which
,
by
Springs
contriv'd
<EOS>
for
that
Purpose
,
immediately
flew
open
,
and
out
of
it
a
surprizing
Flight
of
Birds
of
various
Colours
.
<EOS>
These
,
all
amaz'd
at
their
sudden
Liberty
,
which
I
took
to
be
the
Emblem
intended
,
hover'd
a
considerable
space
of
time
over
and
about
their
Place
of
Freedom
,
chirping
,
singing
,
and
otherwise
testifying
their
mighty
Joy
for
their
so
unexpected
Enlargement
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
many
other
Pageants
;
but
having
little
in
them
very
remarkable
,
I
have
forgot
the
Particulars
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
every
one
of
them
was
dismiss'd
with
the
like
Acclamations
of
Viva
,
Viva
;
the
Whole
concluding
with
Bonfires
and
Illuminations
common
on
all
such
Occasions
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
here
omit
one
very
remarkable
Instance
of
the
Catholick
Zeal
of
that
Prince
,
which
I
was
soon
after
an
Eye
-
witness
of
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
that
time
in
the
Fruit
-
Market
,
when
the
King
passing
by
in
his
Coach
,
the
Host
(
whether
by
Accident
or
Contrivance
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
)
was
brought
,
at
that
very
Juncture
,
out
of
the
great
Church
,
in
order
,
as
I
after
understood
,
to
a
poor
sick
Woman
's
receiving
the
Sacrament
.
<EOS>
On
Sight
of
the
Host
the
King
came
out
of
his
Coach
,
kneel'd
down
in
the
Street
,
which
at
that
time
prov'd
to
be
very
dirty
,
till
the
Host
pass'd
by
;
then
rose
up
,
and
taking
the
lighted
Flambeau
from
him
who
bore
it
,
he
<EOS>
follow'd
the
Priest
up
a
streight
nasty
Alley
,
and
there
up
a
dark
ordinary
Pair
of
Stairs
,
where
the
poor
sick
Woman
lay
.
<EOS>
There
he
stay'd
<EOS>
till
the
whole
Ceremony
was
over
,
when
,
returning
to
the
Door
of
the
Church
,
he
very
faithfully
restor'd
the
lighted
Flambeau
to
the
Fellow
he
had
taken
it
from
,
the
People
all
the
while
crying
out
Viva
,
Viva
;
an
Acclamation
,
we
may
imagine
,
intended
to
his
Zeal
,
as
well
as
his
Person
.
  
<EOS>
Another
remarkable
Accident
,
of
a
much
more
moral
Nature
,
I
must
,
injustice
to
the
Temperance
of
that
,
in
this
truly
inimitable
People
,
recite
.
<EOS>
I
was
one
Day
walking
in
one
of
the
most
populous
Streets
of
that
City
,
where
I
found
an
uncommon
Concourse
of
People
,
of
all
Sorts
,
got
together
;
and
imagining
so
great
<EOS>
a
Croud
could
not
be
assembled
on
a
small
Occasion
,
I
prest
in
among
the
rest
;
and
after
a
good
deal
of
Struggling
and
Difficulty
,
reach'd
into
the
Ring
and
Centre
of
that
mix'd
Multitude
.
<EOS>
But
how
did
I
blush
?
<EOS>
with
what
Confusion
did
I
appear
?
<EOS>
when
I
found
one
of
my
own
Countrymen
,
a
drunken
Granadier
,
the
attractive
Loadstone
of
all
that
high
and
low
Mob
,
and
the
Butt
of
all
their
Merriment
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
easily
imagin'd
to
be
a
Thing
not
a
little
surprizing
to
one
of
our
Country
,
to
find
that
a
drunken
Man
should
be
such
a
wonderful
Sight
;
However
,
the
witty
Sarcasms
that
were
then
by
high
and
low
thrown
upon
that
senseless
Creature
,
<EOS>
and
as
I
interpreted
Matters
,
me
in
him
,
were
so
pungent
,
that
if
I
did
not
curse
my
Curiosity
,
I
thought
it
best
to
withdraw
my

BARCELONA
being
now
under
King
Charles
,
the
Towns
of
Gironne
,
Tarragona
,
Tortosa
,
and
Lerida
,
immediately
declar'd
for
him
.
<EOS>
To
every
one
of
which
Engeneers
being
order'd
,
it
was
my
Lot
to
be
sent
to
Tortosa
.
<EOS>
This
Town
is
situated
on
the
Side
of
the
River
Ebro
,
over
which
there
is
a
fair
and
famous
Bridge
of
Boats
.
<EOS>
The
Waters
of
this
River
are
always
of
a
dirty
red
Colour
,
somewhat
fouler
than
our
Moorish
Waters
;
yet
is
it
the
only
Water
the
Inhabitants
drink
,
or
covet
to
drink
;
and
every
House
providing
for
its
own
Convenience
Cisterns
to
preserve
it
in
,
by
a
few
Hours
standing
it
becomes
as
clear
as
the
clearest
Rock
-
water
,
but
as
soft
as
Milk
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
for
Softness
,
Brightness
,
and
Pleasantness
of
Taste
,
the
Natives
prefer
it
to
all
the
Waters
in
the
World
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
declare
in
favour
of
their
Opinion
,
that
none
ever
<EOS>
pleas'd
me
like
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
Town
was
of
the
greater
Moment
to
our
Army
,
as
opening
a
Passage
into
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
on
one
Side
,
and
the
Kingdom
of
Arragon
on
the
other
:
<EOS>
And
being
of
it
self
tolerably
defensible
<EOS>
,
in
human
Appearance
might
probably
repay
a
little
Care
and
Charge
in
its
Repair
and
Improvement
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
Employ
was
I
appointed
,
and
thus
was
I
busy'd
,
till
the
Arrival
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
with
his
little
Army
,
in
order
to
march
to
Valencia
,
the
Capital
of
that
Province
.
<EOS>
Here
he
left
in
Garrison
Colonel
Hans
Hamilton
's
Regiment
;
the
Place
,
nevertheless
,
was
under
the
Command
of
a
Spanish
Governor
,
appointed
by
King
Charles
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
Earl
stay'd
a
few
Days
at
this
Place
,
under
Expectation
of
the
promis'd
Succours
from
Barcelona
,
he
receiv'd
a
Proprio
(
or
Express
)
from
the
King
of
Spain
,
full
of
Excuses
,
instead
of
Forces
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
very
same
Letter
,
in
a
paradoxical
Manner
,
commanded
him
,
at
all
Events
,
to
attempt
the
Relief
of
Santo
Mattheo
,
where
Colonel
Jones
commanded
,
and
which
was
then
under
Siege
by
the
Conde
de
los
Torres
(
as
was
the
Report
)
with
upwards
of
three
thousand
Men
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Peterborow
could
not
muster
above
one
thousand
Foot
,
and
about
two
hundred
Horse
;
a
small
Force
to
make
an
Attempt
of
that
Nature
upon
such
a
superior
Power
:
Yet
the
Earl
's
Vivacity
(
as
will
be
occasionally
further
observ'd
in
the
Course
of
these
Memoirs
)
never
much
regarded
Numbers
,
so
there
was
but
room
,
by
any
Stratagem
,
to
hope
for
Success
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
for
his
greater
Encouragement
and
Consolation
,
the
same
Letter
intimated
,
that
a
great
Concourse
of
the
Country
People
being
up
in
Arms
,
to
the
Number
of
many
Thousands
,
in
Favour
of
King
Charles
,
and
wanting
only
Officers
,
the
Enterprize
would
be
easy
and
unattended
with
much
Danger
.
<EOS>
But
upon
mature
Enquiry
,
the
Earl
found
that
great
Body
of
Men
all
in
nubibus
;
and
that
the
Conde
,
in
the
plain
Truth
of
the
Matter
,
was
much
stronger
than
the
Letter
at
first
represented
.
  
<EOS>
Santo
Mattheo
was
a
Place
of
known
Importance
;
and
that
from
its
Situation
,
which
cut
off
all
Communication
between
Catalonia
and
Valencia
;
and
,
consequently
,
should
it
fall
into
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
,
the
Earl
's
Design
upon
the
latter
must
inevitably
have
been
postpon'd
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
granted
,
the
Commands
for
attempting
the
Relief
of
it
were
pressing
and
peremptory
;
nevertheless
,
the
Earl
was
very
conscious
to
himself
,
that
as
the
promis'd
Reinforcements
were
suspended
,
his
Officers
would
not
approve
of
the
Attempt
upon
the
Foot
of
such
vast
Inequalities
;
and
their
own
declar'd
<EOS>
Sentiments
soon
confirm'd
<EOS>
the
Dictates
of
the
Earl
's
Reason
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
addresses
himself
to
those
Officers
in
a
different
Manner
:
He
told
'em
he
only
<EOS>
desir'd
they
would
be
passive
,
and
leave
it
to
him
to
work
his
own
Way
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
Earl
found
out
and
hired
two
Spanish
Spies
,
for
whose
Fidelity
(
as
his
great
Precaution
always
led
him
to
do
)
<EOS>
he
took
sufficient
Security
;
and
dispatch'd
'em
with
a
Letter
to
Colonel
Jones
,
Governor
of
the
Place
,
intimating
his
Readiness
,
as
well
as
Ability
,
to
relieve
him
;
and
,
above
all
,
exhorting
him
to
have
the
Miquelets
in
the
Town
ready
,
on
Sight
of
his
Troops
,
to
issue
out
,
pursue
,
and
plunder
;
since
that
would
be
all
they
would
have
to
do
,
and
all
he
would
expect
at
their
Hands
.
<EOS>
The
Spies
were
dispatch'd
accordingly
;
and
,
pursuant
to
Instructions
,
one
betray'd
and
discover'd
the
other
who
had
the
Letter
in
charge
to
deliver
to
Colonel
Jones
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
to
carry
on
the
Feint
,
having
in
the
mean
time
,
by
dividing
his
Troops
,
and
marching
secretly
over
the
Mountains
,
drawn
his
Men
together
,
so
as
to
make
their
Appearance
on
the
Height
of
a
neighbouring
Mountain
,
little
more
than
Cannot
-
shot
from
the
Enemy
's
Camp
.
<EOS>
The
Tale
of
the
Spies
was
fully
confirm'd
,
and
the
Conde
(
though
an
able
General
)
march'd
off
with
some
Precipitation
with
his
Army
;
and
by
that
Means
the
Earl
's
smaller
Number
of
twelve
Hundred
had
Liberty
to
march
into
the
Town
without
Interruption
.
<EOS>
I
must
not
let
slip
an
Action
of
Colonel
Jones
's
just
before
the
Earl
's
Delivery
of
them
:
<EOS>
The
Conde
,
for
want
of
Artillery
,
had
set
his
Miners
to
work
;
and
the
Colonel
,
finding
they
had
made
some
dangerous
Advances
,
turned
the
Course
of
a
Rivulet
,
that
ran
through
the
Middle
of
the
Town
,
in
upon
them
,
and
made
them
quit
a
Work
they
thought
was
brought
to
Perfection
.
  
<EOS>
SANTO
Mattheo
being
reliev'd
,
as
I
have
said
,
the
Earl
,
though
he
had
so
far
gain'd
<EOS>
his
Ends
,
left
not
the
flying
Enemy
without
a
Feint
of
Pursuit
;
with
such
Caution
,
nevertheless
,
that
in
case
they
should
happen
to
be
better
inform'd
of
his
Weakness
,
he
might
have
a
Resource
either
back
again
to
Santo
Mattheo
,
or
to
Vinaros
on
the
Sea
-
side
;
or
some
other
Place
,
as
occasion
might
require
.
<EOS>
But
having
just
before
receiv'd
fresh
Advice
,
that
the
Reinforcements
he
expected
were
anew
countermanded
;
and
that
the
Duke
of
Anjou
had
increas'd
<EOS>
his
Troops
to
twelve
thousand
Men
;
the
Officers
,
not
enough
elated
with
the
last
Success
to
adventure
upon
new
Experiments
,
resolv'd
,
in
a
Council
of
War
,
to
advise
the
Earl
,
who
had
just
before
receiv'd
<EOS>
a
discretionary
Commission
in
lieu
of
Troops
,
so
to
post
the
Forces
under
him
,
as
not
to
be
cut
off
from
being
able
to
assist
the
King
in
Person
;
or
to
march
to
the
Defence
of
Catalonia
,
in
case
of
Necessity
.
  
<EOS>
Pursuant
to
this
Resolution
of
the
Council
of
War
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
tho
'
still
intent
upon
his
Expedition
into
Valencia
(
which
had
been
afresh
commanded
,
even
while
his
Supplies
were
countermanded
)
orders
his
Foot
,
in
a
truly
bad
Condition
,
by
tedious
Marches
Day
and
Night
over
the
Mountains
,
to
Vinaros
;
and
with
his
two
hundred
Horse
,
set
out
to
prosecute
his
pretended
Design
of
pursuing
the
flying
Enemy
;
resolv'd
,
if
possible
,
notwithstanding
all
seemingly
desperate
Circumstances
,
to
perfect
the
Security
of
that
Capital
.
  
<EOS>
To
that
Purpose
,
the
Earl
,
with
his
small
Body
of
Patrolers
,
went
on
frightning
the
Enemy
,
till
they
came
under
the
Walls
of
Nules
,
<EOS>
a
Town
fortify'd
<EOS>
with
the
best
Walls
,
regular
Towers
,
and
in
the
best
Repair
of
any
in
that
Kingdom
.
<EOS>
But
even
here
,
upon
the
Appearance
of
the
Earl
's
Forlorn
(
if
they
might
not
properly
at
that
time
all
have
pass'd
under
that
Character
)
under
the
same
Panick
they
left
that
sensible
Town
,
with
only
one
Thousand
of
the
Town
's
People
,
well
arm'd
,
for
the
Defence
of
it
.
<EOS>
Yet
was
it
scarce
to
be
imagin'd
,
that
the
Earl
,
with
his
small
Body
of
two
hundred
Horse
,
should
be
able
to
gain
Admission
;
or
,
indeed
,
under
such
Circumstances
,
to
attempt
it
.
<EOS>
But
bold
as
the
Undertaking
was
,
his
good
Genius
went
along
with
him
;
and
so
good
a
Genius
was
it
,
that
it
rarely
left
him
without
a
good
Effect
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
told
the
Day
before
,
that
the
Enemy
,
on
leaving
Nules
,
had
got
Possession
of
Villa
Real
,
where
they
put
all
to
the
Sword
.
<EOS>
What
would
have
furnish'd
another
with
Terror
,
inspir'd
<EOS>
his
Lordship
with
a
Thought
as
fortunate
as
it
was
successful
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
rides
up
to
the
very
Gates
of
the
Town
,
at
the
Head
of
his
Party
,
and
peremptorily
demands
the
chief
Magistrate
,
or
a
Priest
,
immediately
to
be
sent
out
to
him
;
and
that
under
Penalty
of
being
all
put
to
the
Sword
,
and
us'd
as
the
Enemy
had
us'd
those
at
<EOS>
Villa
-
Real
<EOS>
the
Day
or
two
before
.
<EOS>
The
Troops
,
that
had
so
lately
left
the
Place
,
had
left
behind
'em
more
Terror
than
Men
;
which
,
together
with
the
peremptory
Demand
of
the
Earl
,
soon
produc'd
some
Priests
to
wait
upon
the
General
.
<EOS>
By
their
Readiness
to
obey
,
the
Earl
very
justly
imagin'd
<EOS>
Fear
to
be
the
Motive
;
wherefore
,
to
improve
their
Terror
,
he
only
allow'd
<EOS>
them
six
Minutes
time
to
resolve
upon
a
Surrender
,
telling
them
,
that
otherwise
,
so
soon
as
his
Artillery
was
come
up
,
he
would
lay
them
under
the
utmost
Extremities
.
<EOS>
The
Priests
return'd
with
this
melancholy
Message
into
the
Place
;
and
in
a
very
short
time
after
the
Gates
were
thrown
open
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
Earl
's
Entrance
he
found
two
hundred
Horse
,
which
were
the
Original
of
his
Lordship
's
forming
that
Body
of
Horse
,
which
afterwards
prov'd
the
saving
of
Valencia
.
  
<EOS>
The
News
of
the
taking
of
Nules
soon
overtook
the
flying
Enemy
;
and
so
increas'd
<EOS>
the
Apprehensions
of
their
Danger
,
that
they
renew'd
<EOS>
their
March
,
the
same
Day
;
though
what
they
had
taken
before
would
have
satisfy'd
them
much
better
without
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
Earl
was
so
well
pleas'd
with
his
Success
,
that
leaving
the
Enemy
to
fly
before
their
Fears
,
he
made
a
short
Turn
towards
Castillon
de
la
Plana
,
a
considerable
,
but
open
Town
,
where
his
Lordship
furnish'd
himself
with
four
hundred
Horses
more
;
and
all
this
under
the
Assurance
that
his
Troops
were
driving
the
Enemy
before
them
out
of
the
Kingdom
.
<EOS>
Hence
he
sent
Orders
to
Colonel
Pierce
's
Regiment
at
Vinaros
to
meet
him
at
Oropesa
,
a
Place
at
no
great
Distance
;
where
,
when
they
came
,
they
were
very
pleasingly
surpriz'd
<EOS>
at
their
being
well
mounted
,
and
furnish'd
with
all
Accoutrements
necessary
.
<EOS>
After
which
,
leaving
'em
canton'd
in
wall'd
Towns
,
where
they
could
not
be
disturb'd
without
Artillery
,
that
indefatigable
General
,
leaving
them
full
Orders
,
went
on
his
way
towards
Tortosa
.
  
<EOS>
At
Vinaros
the
Earl
met
with
Advice
,
that
the
Spanish
Militia
of
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
were
assembled
,
and
had
already
advanc'd
a
Day
's
March
at
least
into
that
Country
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
collecting
,
as
fast
as
he
could
,
the
whole
Corps
together
,
the
Earl
resolv'd
to
penetrate
into
Valencia
directly
;
notwithstanding
this
whole
collected
Body
would
amount
to
no
more
than
six
hundred
Horse
and
two
thousand
Foot
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
strong
Pass
over
a
River
,
just
under
the
Walls
of
Molviedro
,
which
must
be
first
disputed
and
taken
.
<EOS>
This
Brigadier
Mahoni
,
by
the
Orders
of
the
Duke
of
Arcos
,
who
commanded
the
Troops
of
the
Duke
of
Anjou
in
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
,
had
taken
care
to
secure
.
<EOS>
Molviedro
,
though
not
very
strong
,
is
a
wall'd
Town
,
very
populous
of
it
self
;
and
had
in
it
,
besides
a
Garrison
of
eight
hundred
Men
,
most
of
Mahoni
's
Dragoons
.
<EOS>
It
lies
at
the
very
Bottom
of
a
high
Hill
;
on
the
upper
Part
whereof
they
shew
the
Ruins
of
the
once
famous
SAGUNTUM
;
famous
sure
to
Eternity
,
if
Letters
shall
last
so
long
,
for
an
inviolable
Fidelity
to
a
negligent
Confederate
,
against
an
implacable
Enemy
.
<EOS>
Here
yet
appear
the
visible
Vestigia
of
awful
Antiquity
,
in
half
standing
Arches
,
and
the
yet
unlevell'd
<EOS>
Walls
and
Towers
of
that
once
celebrated
City
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
look
upon
all
these
with
the
Eyes
of
Despight
,
in
regard
to
their
Enemy
Hannibal
;
with
those
of
Disdain
,
in
respect
to
the
uncommon
and
unaccountable
Supineness
of
its
Confederates
,
the
Romans
;
but
with
those
of
Veneration
,
as
to
the
Memory
of
a
glorious
People
,
who
rather
than
stand
reproach'd
with
a
Breach
of
Faith
,
or
the
Brand
of
Cowardice
,
chose
to
sacrifice
themselves
,
their
Wives
,
Children
,
and
all
that
was
dear
to
them
,
in
the
Flames
of
their
expiring
City
.
  
<EOS>
In
Molviedro
,
as
I
said
before
,
Mahoni
commanded
,
with
eight
hundred
Men
,
besides
Inhabitants
;
which
,
together
with
our
having
but
little
Artillery
,
induc'd
the
Officers
under
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
reasonably
enough
to
imagine
and
declare
,
that
there
could
be
no
visible
Appearance
of
surmounting
such
Difficulties
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
nevertheless
,
instead
of
indulging
such
Despondencies
,
gave
them
Hope
,
<EOS>
that
what
Strength
serv'd
not
to
accomplish
,
Art
might
possibly
obtain
.
<EOS>
To
that
Purpose
he
proposed
an
Interview
between
himself
and
Mahoni
;
and
accordingly
sent
an
Officer
with
a
Trumpet
to
intimate
his
Desire
.
<EOS>
The
Motion
was
agreed
to
;
and
the
Earl
having
previously
station'd
<EOS>
his
Troops
to
advantage
,
and
his
little
Artillery
at
a
convenient
Distance
,
with
Orders
<EOS>
they
should
appear
on
a
slow
March
on
the
Side
of
a
rising
Hill
,
during
the
time
of
Conference
,
went
to
the
Place
appointed
;
only
,
as
had
been
stipulated
,
attended
with
a
small
Party
of
Horse
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
met
,
the
Earl
first
offer'd
<EOS>
all
he
could
to
engage
Mahoni
to
the
Interest
of
King
Charles
;
proposing
some
Things
extravagant
enough
(
as
Mahoni
himself
some
time
after
told
me
)
to
stagger
the
Faith
of
a
Catholick
;
but
all
to
little
Purpose
:
<EOS>
Mahoni
was
inflexible
,
which
oblig'd
<EOS>
the
Earl
to
new
Measures
.
  
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
Earl
frankly
told
him
,
that
he
could
not
however
but
esteem
the
Confidence
he
had
put
in
him
;
and
therefore
,
to
make
some
Retaliation
,
he
was
ready
to
put
it
in
his
Power
to
avoid
the
Barbarities
lately
executed
at
Villa
-
Real
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
Relation
to
you
,
"
continued
the
General
,
"
inclines
me
to
spare
a
Town
under
your
Command
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
near
my
Forces
are
;
and
can
hardly
doubt
our
soon
being
Masters
of
the
Place
:
What
I
would
therefore
offer
you
,
said
the
Earl
,
is
a
Capitulation
,
that
my
Inclination
may
be
held
in
Countenance
by
my
Honour
.
<EOS>
Barbarities
,
however
justified
by
Example
,
are
my
utter
Aversion
,
and
against
my
Nature
;
and
to
testify
so
much
,
together
with
my
good
Will
to
your
Person
,
was
the
main
Intent
of
this
Interview
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
Frankness
so
far
prevail'd
on
Mahoni
,
that
he
agreed
to
return
an
Answer
in
half
an
Hour
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
an
Answer
was
returned
by
a
Spanish
Officer
,
and
a
Capitulation
agreed
upon
;
the
Earl
at
the
same
time
endeavouring
to
bring
over
that
Officer
to
King
Charles
,
on
much
the
same
Topicks
he
us'd
with
Mahoni
.
<EOS>
But
finding
this
equally
fruitless
,
whether
it
was
that
he
tacitly
reproach'd
<EOS>
the
Officer
with
a
Want
of
Consideration
in
neglecting
to
follow
the
Example
of
his
Commander
,
or
what
else
,
he
created
in
that
Officer
<EOS>
such
a
Jealousy
of
Mahoni
,
that
was
afterward
very
serviceable
to
him
in
his
further
Design
.
  
<EOS>
To
forward
which
to
a
good
Issue
,
the
Earl
immediately
made
choice
of
two
Dragoons
,
who
,
upon
promise
of
Promotion
,
undertook
to
go
as
Spies
to
the
Duke
of
Arcos
,
whose
Forces
lay
not
far
off
,
on
the
other
Side
<EOS>
a
large
Plain
,
which
the
Earl
must
unavoidably
pass
,
and
which
would
inevitably
be
attended
with
almost
insuperable
Dangers
,
if
there
attack'd
<EOS>
by
a
Force
so
much
superior
.
<EOS>
Those
Spies
,
according
to
Instructions
,
were
to
discover
to
the
Duke
,
that
they
over
-
heard
the
Conference
between
the
Earl
and
Mahoni
;
and
at
the
same
time
saw
a
considerable
Number
of
Pistoles
deliver'd
into
Mahoni
's
Hands
,
large
Promises
passing
at
that
Instant
reciprocally
:
But
above
all
,
that
the
Earl
had
recommended
to
him
the
procuring
the
March
of
the
Duke
over
the
Plain
between
them
.
<EOS>
The
Spies
went
and
deliver'd
all
according
to
Concert
;
concluding
,
before
the
Duke
,
that
they
would
ask
no
Reward
,
but
undergo
any
Punishment
,
if
Mahoni
did
not
very
soon
send
to
the
Duke
a
Request
to
march
over
the
Plain
,
in
order
to
put
the
concerted
Plot
in
execution
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
after
this
pretended
Discovery
before
Mahoni
did
send
indeed
an
Officer
to
the
Duke
,
desiring
the
March
of
his
Forces
over
the
Plain
;
but
,
in
reality
,
to
obstruct
the
Earl
's
Passage
,
which
he
knew
very
well
must
be
that
and
no
other
way
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
Duke
being
prepossess'd
by
the
Spies
,
and
what
those
Spanish
Officers
that
at
first
escap'd
had
before
infus'd
,
took
Things
in
their
Sense
;
and
as
soon
as
Mahoni
,
who
was
forc'd
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
over
the
Plain
before
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
arriv'd
<EOS>
at
his
Camp
,
he
was
put
under
Arrest
and
sent
to
Madrid
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
having
thus
imbib'd
the
Venom
,
and
taken
the
Alarm
,
immediately
decamp'd
in
Confusion
,
and
took
a
different
Rout
than
at
first
he
intended
;
leaving
that
once
formidable
Plain
open
to
the
Earl
,
without
an
Enemy
to
obstruct
him
.
<EOS>
In
some
little
time
after
he
arriv'd
at
Madrid
,
Mahoni
made
his
Innocence
appear
,
and
was
created
a
General
;
while
the
Duke
of
Arcos
was
recall'd
from
his
Post
of
Honour
.
  
<EOS>
The
Day
after
we
arriv'd
at
Valencia
,
the
Gates
of
which
fine
City
were
set
open
to
us
with
the
highest
Demonstrations
of
Joy
.
<EOS>
I
call'd
it
<EOS>
a
fine
City
;
<EOS>
but
sure
it
richly
deserves
a
brighter
Epithet
,
since
it
is
a
common
Saying
among
the
Spaniards
,
that
the
Pleasures
of
Valencia
would
make
a
Jew
forget
Jerusalem
.
<EOS>
It
is
most
sweetly
situated
in
a
very
beautiful
Plain
,
and
within
half
a
League
of
the
Mediterranean
Sea
.
<EOS>
It
never
wants
any
of
the
Fragrancies
of
Nature
,
and
always
has
something
to
delight
the
most
curious
Eye
.
<EOS>
It
is
famous
to
a
Proverb
for
fine
Women
;
but
as
infamous
,
and
only
in
that
so
,
for
the
Race
of
Bravoes
,
the
common
Companions
of
the
Ladies
of
Pleasure
in
this
Country
.
<EOS>
These
Wretches
are
so
Case
-
hardened
,
they
will
commit
a
Murder
for
a
Dollar
,
tho
'
they
run
their
Country
for
it
when
they
have
done
.
<EOS>
Not
that
other
Parts
of
this
Nation
are
uninfested
with
this
sort
of
Animals
;
but
here
their
Numbers
are
so
great
,
that
if
a
Catalogue
was
to
be
taken
of
those
in
other
Parts
of
that
Country
,
perhaps
nine
in
ten
would
be
found
by
Birth
to
be
of
this
Province
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
proceed
,
tho
'
the
Citizens
,
and
all
Sorts
of
People
,
were
redundant
in
their
various
Expressions
of
Joy
,
for
an
Entry
so
surprizing
,
and
utterly
lost
to
their
Expedition
,
whatever
it
was
to
their
Wishes
,
the
Earl
had
a
secret
Concern
for
the
Publick
,
which
lay
gnawing
at
his
Heart
,
and
which
yet
he
was
forced
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
he
had
not
four
thousand
Soldiers
in
the
Place
,
and
not
Powder
or
Ammunition
for
those
;
nor
any
Provisions
lay'd
in
for
any
thing
like
a
Siege
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
Hand
,
the
Enemy
without
were
upwards
of
seven
Thousand
,
with
a
Body
of
four
Thousand
more
,
not
fifteen
Leagues
off
,
on
their
March
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
Add
to
this
,
the
Marechal
de
Thesse
was
no
farther
off
than
Madrid
,
a
very
few
Days
'
March
from
Valencia
;
a
short
Way
indeed
for
the
Earl
(
who
,
as
was
said
before
,
was
wholly
unprovided
for
a
Siege
,
which
was
reported
to
be
the
sole
End
of
the
Mareschal
's
moving
that
Way
.
)
<EOS>
But
the
Earl
's
never
-
failing
Genius
resolv'd
again
to
attempt
that
by
Art
,
which
the
Strength
of
his
Forces
utterly
disallow'd
him
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
first
Place
,
his
Intelligence
telling
him
that
sixteen
twenty
-
four
Pounders
,
with
Stores
and
Ammunition
answerable
for
a
Siege
,
were
ship'd
<EOS>
off
for
the
Enemy
's
Service
at
Alicant
,
the
Earl
forthwith
lays
a
Design
,
and
with
his
usual
Success
intercepts
'em
all
,
supplying
that
way
his
own
Necessities
at
the
Expence
of
the
Enemy
.
  
<EOS>
The
four
thousand
Men
ready
to
reinforce
the
Troops
nearer
Valencia
,
were
the
next
Point
to
be
undertaken
;
but
hic
labor
,
hoc
opus
;
since
the
greater
Body
under
the
Conde
de
las
Torres
(
who
,
with
Mahoni
,
was
now
reinstated
in
his
Post
)
lay
between
the
Earl
and
those
Troops
intended
to
be
dispers'd
.
<EOS>
And
what
inhaunc'd
the
Difficulty
,
the
River
Xucar
must
be
passed
in
almost
the
Face
of
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
Great
Disadvantages
as
these
were
,
they
did
not
discourage
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
He
detach'd
<EOS>
by
Night
four
hundred
Horse
and
eight
hundred
Foot
,
who
<EOS>
march'd
with
such
hasty
Silence
,
that
they
surpriz'd
<EOS>
that
great
Body
,
routed
'em
,
and
brought
into
Valencia
six
hundred
Prisoners
very
safely
,
notwithstanding
they
were
oblig'd
,
under
the
same
Night
-
Covert
,
to
pass
very
near
a
Body
of
three
Thousand
of
the
Enemy
's
Horse
.
<EOS>
Such
a
prodigious
Victory
would
hardly
have
gain'd
Credit
in
that
City
,
if
the
Prisoners
brought
in
had
not
been
living
Witnesses
of
the
Action
as
well
as
the
Triumph
.
<EOS>
The
Conde
de
las
Torres
,
upon
these
two
military
Rebuffs
,
drew
off
to
a
more
convenient
Distance
,
and
left
the
Earl
a
little
more
at
ease
in
his
new
Quarters
.
  
<EOS>
Here
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
made
his
Residence
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
He
was
extreamly
well
belov'd
,
his
affable
Behaviour
exacted
as
much
from
all
;
and
he
preserv'd
such
a
good
Correspondence
with
the
Priests
and
the
Ladies
,
that
he
never
fail'd
of
the
most
early
and
best
Intelligence
,
a
thing
by
no
means
to
be
slighted
in
the
common
Course
of
Life
;
but
much
more
commendable
and
necessary
in
a
General
,
with
so
small
an
Army
,
at
open
War
,
and
in
the
Heart
of
his
Enemy
's
Country
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
by
this
Means
,
some
small
time
after
,
receiving
early
Intelligence
that
King
Philip
was
actually
on
his
March
to
Barcelona
,
with
an
Army
of
upwards
of
twenty
five
thousand
Men
,
under
the
Command
of
a
Mareschal
of
France
,
began
his
March
towards
Catalonia
,
with
all
the
Troops
that
he
could
gather
together
,
leaving
in
Valencia
a
small
Body
of
Foot
,
such
as
in
that
Exigence
could
best
be
spar'd
.
<EOS>
The
whole
Body
thus
collected
made
very
little
more
than
two
thousand
Foot
and
six
hundred
Horse
;
yet
resolutely
with
these
he
sets
out
for
Barcelona
:
<EOS>
In
the
Neighbourhood
of
which
,
as
soon
as
he
arriv'd
,
he
took
care
to
post
himself
and
his
diminutive
Army
in
the
Mountains
which
inviron
that
City
;
where
he
not
only
secur'd
'em
against
the
Enemy
;
but
found
himself
in
a
Capacity
of
putting
him
under
perpetual
Alarms
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
Mareschal
,
with
his
great
Army
,
capable
of
returning
the
Earl
's
Compliment
of
Disturbance
;
since
he
himself
,
every
six
or
eight
Hours
,
put
his
Troops
into
such
a
varying
Situation
,
that
always
when
most
arduously
fought
,
he
was
farthest
off
from
being
found
.
<EOS>
In
this
Manner
the
General
bitterly
harrass'd
the
Troops
of
the
Enemy
;
and
by
these
Means
struck
a
perpetual
Terror
into
the
Besiegers
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
only
this
way
annoy
the
Enemy
;
the
Precautions
he
had
us'd
,
and
the
Measures
he
had
taken
in
other
Places
,
with
a
View
to
prevent
their
Return
to
Madrid
,
though
the
Invidious
endeavour'd
to
bury
them
in
Oblivion
,
<EOS>
having
equally
contributed
to
the
driving
of
the
Mareschal
of
France
,
and
his
Catholick
King
,
out
of
the
Spanish
Dominions
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
go
on
with
the
Siege
:
The
Breaches
in
the
Walls
of
that
City
,
during
its
Siege
by
the
Earl
,
had
been
put
into
tolerable
Repair
;
but
those
of
Monjouick
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
been
as
much
neglected
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
Garrison
made
shift
to
hold
out
a
Battery
of
twenty
-
three
Days
,
with
no
less
than
fifty
Pieces
of
Cannon
;
when
,
after
a
Loss
of
the
Enemy
of
upwards
of
three
thousand
Men
(
a
Moiety
of
the
Army
employ'd
<EOS>
against
it
when
the
Earl
took
it
)
they
were
forc'd
to
surrender
at
Discretion
.
<EOS>
And
this
can
not
but
merit
our
Observation
,
that
a
Place
,
which
the
English
General
took
in
little
more
than
an
Hour
,
and
with
inconsiderable
Loss
,
afforded
the
Mareschal
of
France
a
Resistance
of
twenty
-
three
Days
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
taking
of
Fort
Monjouick
,
the
Mareschal
de
Thess
gave
immediate
Orders
for
Batteries
to
be
rais'd
against
the
Town
.
<EOS>
Those
Orders
were
put
in
Execution
with
all
Expedition
;
and
at
the
same
time
his
Army
fortify'd
themselves
with
such
Entrenchments
,
as
would
have
ruin'd
the
Earl
's
former
little
Army
to
have
rais'd
,
or
his
present
much
lesser
Army
to
have
attempted
the
forcing
them
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
sufficiently
demonstrated
their
Apprehensions
of
that
watchful
General
,
who
lay
hovering
over
their
Heads
upon
the
Mountains
.
<EOS>
Their
main
Effort
was
to
make
a
Breach
between
Port
St.
Antonio
and
that
Breach
which
our
Forces
had
made
the
Year
before
;
to
effect
which
they
took
care
to
ply
them
very
diligently
both
from
Cannon
and
Mortars
;
and
in
some
few
Days
their
Application
was
answer'd
with
a
practicable
Breach
for
a
Storm
.
<EOS>
Which
however
was
prudently
deferr'd
<EOS>
for
some
time
,
and
that
thro
'
fear
of
the
Earl
's
falling
on
the
Back
of
them
whenever
they
should
attempt
it
;
which
,
consequently
,
they
were
sensible
might
put
them
into
some
dangerous
Disorder
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
it
was
that
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
resolv'd
to
put
in
practice
the
Resolution
<EOS>
he
had
some
time
before
concerted
within
himself
.
<EOS>
About
nine
or
ten
Days
before
the
Raising
of
the
Siege
,
he
had
receiv'd
<EOS>
an
Express
from
Brigadier
Stanhope
(
who
was
aboard
<EOS>
Sir
John
Leake
's
Fleet
appointed
for
the
Relief
of
the
Place
,
with
the
Reinforcements
from
England
)
acquainting
the
Earl
,
that
he
had
us'd
all
possible
Endeavours
to
prevail
on
the
Admiral
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
to
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
But
that
the
Admiral
,
however
,
persisted
in
a
positive
Resolution
not
to
attempt
the
French
Fleet
before
that
Place
under
the
Count
de
Thoulouse
,
till
the
Ships
were
join'd
him
which
were
expected
from
Ireland
,
under
the
Command
of
Sir
George
Bing
.
<EOS>
True
it
was
,
the
Fleet
under
Admiral
Leake
was
of
equal
Strength
with
that
under
the
French
Admiral
;
but
jealous
of
the
Informations
he
had
receiv'd
,
and
too
ready
to
conclude
that
People
in
Distress
were
apt
to
make
Representations
too
much
in
their
own
Favour
;
he
held
himself
,
in
point
of
Discretion
,
oblig'd
not
to
hazard
the
Queen
's
Ships
,
when
a
Reinforcement
of
both
cleaner
and
larger
were
under
daily
Expectation
.
  
<EOS>
This
unhappy
Circumstance
(
notwithstanding
all
former
glorious
Deliverances
)
had
almost
brought
the
Earl
to
the
Brink
of
Despair
;
and
to
increase
it
,
the
Earl
every
Day
<EOS>
receiv'd
<EOS>
such
Commands
from
the
King
within
the
Place
,
as
must
have
sacrificed
his
few
Forces
,
without
the
least
Probability
of
succeeding
.
<EOS>
Those
all
tended
to
his
forcing
his
Way
into
the
Town
;
when
,
in
all
human
Appearance
,
not
one
Man
of
all
that
should
make
the
Attempt
could
have
done
it
,
with
any
Hope
or
Prospect
of
surviving
.
<EOS>
The
French
were
strongly
encamp'd
<EOS>
at
the
Foot
of
the
Mountains
,
distant
two
Miles
from
Barcelona
;
towards
the
Bottom
of
those
Hills
,
the
Avenues
into
the
Plain
were
possess'd
and
fortify'd
by
great
Detachments
from
the
Enemy
's
Army
.
<EOS>
From
all
which
it
will
be
evident
,
that
no
Attempt
could
be
made
without
giving
the
Enemy
time
to
draw
together
what
Body
of
Foot
they
pleas'd
.
<EOS>
Or
supposing
it
feasible
,
under
all
these
difficult
Circumstances
,
for
some
of
them
to
have
forc'd
their
Passage
,
the
Remainder
,
that
should
have
been
so
lucky
to
have
escap'd
<EOS>
their
Foot
,
would
have
found
themselves
expos'd
in
open
Field
to
a
Pursuit
of
four
thousand
Horse
and
Dragoons
;
and
that
for
two
Miles
together
;
when
in
case
of
their
inclosing
them
,
the
bravest
Troops
in
the
World
,
under
such
a
Situation
,
would
have
found
it
their
best
way
to
have
surrender'd
themselves
Prisoners
of
War
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
when
Brigadier
Stanhope
sent
that
Express
to
the
Earl
,
which
I
just
now
mention'd
,
he
assur'd
him
in
the
same
,
that
he
would
use
his
utmost
Diligence
,
both
by
Sea
and
Land
,
to
let
him
have
timely
Notice
of
the
Conjunction
of
the
Fleets
,
which
was
now
all
they
had
to
depend
upon
.
<EOS>
Adding
withal
,
that
if
the
Earl
should
at
any
time
receive
a
Letter
,
or
Paper
,
though
directed
to
no
Body
,
and
with
nothing
in
it
,
but
a
half
Sheet
of
Paper
cut
in
the
Middle
,
he
,
the
Earl
,
might
certainly
depend
upon
it
,
that
the
two
Fleets
were
join'd
,
and
making
the
best
of
their
Way
for
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
It
will
easily
be
imagin'd
<EOS>
the
Express
was
to
be
well
paid
;
and
being
made
sensible
that
he
ran
little
or
no
Hazard
in
carrying
a
Piece
of
blank
Paper
,
he
undertook
it
,
and
as
fortunately
arriv'd
<EOS>
with
it
to
the
Earl
,
at
a
Moment
when
Chagrin
and
Despair
might
have
hurry'd
him
to
some
Resolution
that
might
have
prov'd
fatal
.
<EOS>
The
Messenger
himself
,
however
,
knew
nothing
of
the
Joining
of
the
Fleets
,
or
the
Meaning
of
his
Message
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
receiv'd
<EOS>
this
welcome
Message
from
Brigadier
Stanhope
,
he
<EOS>
march'd
<EOS>
the
very
same
Night
,
with
his
whole
little
Body
of
Forces
,
to
a
Town
on
the
Sea
-
Shore
,
call'd
Sigeth
.
<EOS>
No
Person
guess'd
<EOS>
the
Reason
of
his
March
,
or
knew
any
thing
of
what
the
Intent
of
it
was
.
<EOS>
The
Officers
,
as
formerly
,
obey'd
without
Enquiry
;
for
they
were
led
to
it
by
so
many
unaccountable
Varieties
of
Success
,
that
Affiance
became
a
second
Nature
,
both
in
Officer
and
Soldier
.
  
<EOS>
The
Town
of
Sigeth
was
about
seven
Leagues
to
the
Westward
of
Barcelona
;
where
,
as
soon
as
the
Earl
with
his
Forces
arriv'd
,
he
took
care
to
secure
all
the
small
Fishing
-
Boats
,
Feluccas
,
and
Sattees
;
nay
,
in
a
Word
,
every
Machine
in
which
he
could
transport
any
of
his
Men
:
<EOS>
So
that
in
two
Days
'
time
he
had
got
together
a
Number
sufficient
for
the
Conveyance
of
all
his
Foot
.
  
<EOS>
But
a
Day
or
two
before
the
Arrival
of
the
English
Fleet
off
Sigeth
,
The
Officers
of
his
Troops
were
under
a
strange
Consternation
at
a
Resolution
their
General
had
taken
.
<EOS>
Impatient
of
Delay
,
and
fearful
of
the
Fleets
passing
by
without
his
Knowledge
,
the
Earl
<EOS>
summon'd
<EOS>
them
together
a
little
before
Night
,
at
which
time
he
discover'd
<EOS>
to
the
whole
Assembly
,
that
he
himself
was
oblig'd
to
endeavour
to
get
aboard
the
English
Fleet
;
and
that
,
if
possible
,
before
the
French
Scouts
should
be
able
to
make
any
Discovery
of
their
Strength
:
<EOS>
That
finding
himself
of
no
further
Use
on
Shore
,
having
already
taken
the
necessary
Precautions
for
their
Transportation
and
Security
,
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
pursue
his
Orders
,
and
make
the
best
of
their
Way
to
Barcelona
,
in
the
Vessels
which
he
had
provided
for
them
:
That
they
might
do
this
in
perfect
Security
when
they
saw
the
English
Fleet
pass
by
;
or
if
they
should
pass
by
in
the
Night
,
an
Engagement
with
the
French
,
which
would
give
them
sufficient
Notice
what
they
had
to
do
further
.
  
<EOS>
This
Declaration
,
instead
of
satisfying
,
made
the
Officers
ten
times
more
curious
:
<EOS>
But
when
they
saw
their
General
going
with
a
Resolution
to
lie
out
all
Night
at
Sea
,
in
an
open
Boat
,
attended
with
only
one
Officer
;
and
understood
that
he
intended
to
row
out
in
his
Felucca
five
or
six
Leagues
distance
from
the
Shore
,
it
is
hardly
to
be
express'd
what
Amazement
and
Concern
surpriz'd
them
all
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crow
,
the
Queen
's
Minister
,
and
others
,
express'd
a
particular
Dislike
and
Uneasiness
;
but
all
to
no
purpose
,
the
Earl
had
resolv'd
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
at
Night
he
put
out
to
Sea
in
his
open
Felucca
,
all
which
he
spent
five
Leagues
from
Shore
,
with
no
other
Company
than
one
Captain
and
his
Rowers
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
Morning
,
to
the
great
Satisfaction
of
all
,
Officers
and
others
,
the
Earl
came
again
to
Land
;
and
immediately
began
to
put
his
Men
into
the
several
Vessels
which
lay
ready
in
Port
for
that
Purpose
.
<EOS>
But
at
Night
their
Amaze
was
renew'd
,
when
they
found
their
General
ready
to
put
in
execution
his
old
Resolution
,
in
the
same
Equipage
,
and
with
the
same
Attendance
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
again
felucca'd
himself
;
and
they
saw
him
no
more
till
they
were
landed
on
the
Mole
in
Barcelona
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
first
engag'd
himself
in
the
Expedition
to
Spain
,
he
propos'd
to
the
Queen
and
her
Ministry
,
that
Admiral
Shovel
might
be
join'd
in
Commission
with
him
in
the
Command
of
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
But
this
Year
,
when
the
Fleet
came
through
the
Straites
,
under
Vice
-
Admiral
Leake
,
the
Queen
had
sent
a
Commission
to
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
for
the
full
Command
,
whenever
he
thought
fit
to
come
aboard
in
Person
.
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
it
was
that
made
the
General
endeavour
,
at
all
Hazards
,
to
get
aboard
the
Fleet
by
Night
;
for
he
was
apprehensive
,
and
the
Sequel
prov'd
<EOS>
his
Apprehensions
too
well
grounded
,
that
Admiral
Leake
would
make
his
Appearance
with
the
whole
Body
of
the
Fleet
,
which
made
near
twice
the
Number
of
the
Ships
of
the
Enemy
;
in
which
Case
it
was
natural
to
suppose
,
that
the
Count
de
Tholouse
,
as
soon
as
ever
the
French
Scouts
should
give
Notice
of
our
Strength
,
<EOS>
would
cut
his
Cables
and
put
out
to
Sea
,
to
avoid
an
Engagement
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
Earl
was
very
sensible
,
that
if
a
Part
of
his
Ships
had
kept
a
-
stern
,
that
the
Superiority
might
have
appear'd
<EOS>
on
the
French
Side
,
or
rather
if
they
had
bore
away
in
the
Night
towards
the
Coast
of
Africa
,
and
fallen
to
the
Eastward
of
Barcelona
the
next
Day
,
a
Battle
had
been
inevitable
,
and
a
Victory
equally
certain
;
since
the
Enemy
by
this
Means
had
been
tempted
into
an
Engagement
,
and
their
Retreat
being
cut
off
,
and
their
whole
Fleet
surrounded
with
almost
double
their
Number
,
there
had
hardly
been
left
for
any
of
them
a
Probability
of
Escaping
.
  
<EOS>
Therefore
,
when
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
put
to
Sea
again
the
second
Evening
,
fearful
of
loosing
such
a
glorious
Opportunity
,
and
impatient
to
be
aboard
to
give
the
necessary
Orders
,
he
order'd
his
Rowers
to
obtain
the
same
Station
,
in
order
to
discover
the
English
Fleet
.
<EOS>
And
according
to
his
Wishes
he
did
fall
in
with
it
;
but
unfortunately
the
Night
was
so
far
advanc'd
,
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
then
to
put
his
Project
into
practice
.
<EOS>
Captain
Price
,
a
Gentleman
of
Wales
,
who
commanded
a
Third
Rate
,
was
the
Person
he
first
came
aboard
of
;
but
how
amaz'd
was
he
to
find
,
in
an
open
Boat
at
open
Sea
,
the
Person
who
had
Commission
to
command
the
Fleet
?
<EOS>
So
soon
as
he
was
enter'd
<EOS>
the
Ship
,
the
Earl
sent
the
Ship
's
Pinnace
with
Letters
to
Admiral
Leake
,
to
acquaint
him
with
his
Orders
and
Intentions
;
and
to
Brigadier
Stanhope
with
a
Notification
of
his
safe
Arrival
;
but
the
Darkness
of
the
Night
prov'd
so
great
an
Obstacle
,
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
Pinnace
could
reach
the
Admiral
.
<EOS>
When
Day
appear'd
,
it
was
astonishing
to
the
whole
Fleet
to
see
the
Union
Flag
waving
at
the
Main
-
top
-
mast
Head
.
<EOS>
No
body
could
trust
his
own
Eyes
,
or
guess
at
the
Meaning
,
till
better
certify'd
<EOS>
by
the
Account
of
an
Event
<EOS>
so
singular
and
extraordinary
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
were
about
six
Leagues
Distance
from
Barcelona
,
the
Port
we
aim'd
at
,
one
of
the
French
Scouts
gave
the
Alarm
,
who
making
the
Signal
to
another
,
he
communicated
it
to
a
Third
,
and
so
on
,
as
we
afterward
sorrowfully
found
,
and
as
the
Earl
had
before
apprehended
:
The
French
Admiral
being
thus
made
acquainted
with
the
Force
of
our
Fleet
,
hoisted
sail
,
and
made
the
best
of
his
Way
from
us
,
either
pursuant
to
Orders
,
or
under
the
plausible
Excuse
of
a
Retreat
.
  
<EOS>
This
favourable
Opportunity
thus
lost
,
there
remain'd
nothing
to
do
but
to
land
the
Troops
with
all
Expedition
;
which
was
executed
accordingly
:
<EOS>
The
Regiments
,
which
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
embark'd
<EOS>
the
Night
before
,
being
the
first
that
got
into
the
Town
.
<EOS>
Let
the
Reader
imagine
how
pleasing
such
a
Sight
must
be
to
those
in
Barcelona
,
reduc'd
as
they
were
to
the
last
Extremity
.
<EOS>
In
this
Condition
,
to
see
an
Enemy
's
Fleet
give
way
to
another
with
Reinforcements
from
England
,
the
Sea
at
the
same
Instant
<EOS>
cover'd
with
little
Vessels
crouded
with
greater
Succours
;
what
was
there
wanting
to
compleat
the
glorious
Scene
,
but
what
the
General
had
projected
,
a
Fight
at
Sea
,
under
the
very
Walls
of
the
invested
City
,
and
the
Ships
of
the
Enemy
sinking
,
or
tow'd
in
by
the
victorious
English
?
<EOS>
But
Night
,
and
a
few
Hours
,
defeated
the
latter
Part
of
that
well
intended
Landskip
.
  
<EOS>
King
Philip
,
and
the
Mareschal
of
France
,
had
not
fail'd
to
push
on
the
Siege
with
all
imaginable
Vigour
;
but
this
Retreat
of
the
Count
de
Tholouse
,
and
the
News
of
those
Reinforcements
,
soon
chang'd
<EOS>
the
Scene
.
<EOS>
Their
Courage
without
was
abated
proportionably
,
as
theirs
within
was
elated
.
<EOS>
In
these
Circumstances
,
a
Council
of
War
being
call'd
,
it
was
unanimously
resolv'd
to
raise
the
Siege
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
next
Morning
,
the
first
of
May
,
1706
,
while
the
Sun
was
under
a
total
Eclypse
,
in
a
suitable
Hurry
and
Confusion
,
they
broke
up
,
leaving
behind
them
most
of
their
Cannon
and
Mortars
,
together
with
vast
Quantities
of
all
sorts
of
Ammunition
and
Provisions
,
scarce
stopping
to
look
back
till
they
had
left
all
but
the
very
Verge
of
the
disputed
Dominion
behind
them
.
  
<EOS>
King
Charles
<EOS>
look'd
<EOS>
with
new
Pleasure
upon
this
lucky
Effort
of
his
old
Deliverers
.
<EOS>
Captivity
is
a
State
no
way
desirable
to
Persons
however
brave
,
of
the
most
private
Station
in
Life
;
but
for
a
King
,
within
two
Days
of
falling
into
the
Hands
of
his
Rival
,
to
receive
so
seasonable
and
unexpected
a
Deliverance
,
must
be
supposed
,
as
it
really
did
,
to
open
a
Scene
to
universal
Rejoicing
among
us
,
too
high
for
any
Words
to
express
,
or
any
Thoughts
to
imagine
,
to
those
that
were
not
present
and
Partakers
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
forthwith
gave
Orders
for
a
Medal
to
be
struck
suitable
to
the
Occasion
;
one
of
which
,
set
round
with
Diamonds
,
he
presented
to
Sir
John
Leake
,
the
English
Admiral
.
<EOS>
The
next
Orders
were
for
re
-
casting
all
the
damag'd
brass
Cannon
which
the
Enemy
had
left
;
upon
every
one
of
which
was
,
by
order
,
a
Sun
eclyps'd
,
with
this
Motto
under
it
:
Magna
parvis
obscurantur
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
wonder'd
that
I
never
heard
any
Body
curious
enough
to
enquire
what
could
be
the
Motives
to
the
King
of
Spain
's
quitting
his
Dominions
upon
the
raising
of
this
Siege
;
very
certain
it
is
that
he
had
a
fine
Army
,
under
the
Command
of
a
Mareschal
of
France
,
not
very
considerably
decreas'd
,
either
by
Action
or
Desertion
:
<EOS>
But
all
this
would
rather
increase
the
Curiosity
than
abate
it
.
<EOS>
In
my
Opinion
then
,
though
Men
might
have
Curiosity
enough
,
the
Question
was
purposely
evaded
,
under
an
Apprehension
that
an
honest
Answer
must
inevitably
give
a
higher
Idea
of
the
General
than
their
Inclinations
led
them
to
.
<EOS>
At
first
View
this
may
carry
the
Face
of
a
Paradox
;
yet
if
the
Reader
will
consider
,
that
in
every
Age
Virtue
has
had
its
Shaders
or
Maligners
,
he
will
himself
easily
solve
it
,
at
the
same
time
that
he
finds
himself
compell'd
to
allow
,
that
those
,
who
found
themselves
unable
to
prevent
his
great
Services
,
were
willing
,
in
a
more
subtil
Manner
,
to
endeavour
at
the
annulling
of
them
by
Silence
and
Concealment
.
  
<EOS>
This
will
appear
more
than
bare
Supposition
,
if
we
compare
the
present
Situation
,
as
to
Strength
,
of
the
two
contending
Powers
:
<EOS>
The
French
,
at
the
Birth
of
the
Siege
,
consisted
of
five
thousand
Horse
and
Dragoons
,
and
twenty
-
five
thousand
Foot
,
effective
Men
.
<EOS>
Now
grant
,
that
their
kill'd
and
wounded
,
together
with
their
Sick
in
the
Hospitals
,
might
amount
to
five
Thousand
;
yet
as
their
Body
of
Horse
was
entire
,
and
in
the
best
Condition
,
the
Remaining
will
appear
to
be
an
Army
of
twenty
-
five
Thousand
at
least
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
Side
,
all
the
Forces
in
Barcelona
,
even
with
their
Reinforcements
,
amounted
to
no
more
than
seven
thousand
Foot
and
four
hundred
Horse
.
<EOS>
Why
then
,
when
they
rais'd
their
Siege
,
did
not
they
march
back
into
the
Heart
of
Spain
,
with
their
so
much
superior
Army
?
<EOS>
or
,
at
least
,
towards
their
Capital
?
<EOS>
The
Answer
can
be
this
,
and
this
only
;
Because
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
had
taken
such
provident
Care
to
render
all
secure
,
that
it
was
thereby
render'd
<EOS>
next
to
an
Impossibility
for
them
so
to
do
.
<EOS>
That
General
was
satisfy'd
,
that
the
Capital
of
Catalonia
must
,
in
course
,
fall
into
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
,
unless
a
superior
Fleet
remov'd
the
Count
de
Tholouse
,
and
threw
in
timely
Succours
into
the
Town
:
<EOS>
And
as
that
could
not
depend
upon
him
,
but
others
<EOS>
,
he
made
it
his
chief
Care
and
assiduous
Employment
to
provide
against
those
Strokes
of
Fortune
to
which
he
found
himself
again
likely
to
be
expos'd
,
as
he
often
had
been
;
and
therefore
had
he
Resource
to
that
Vigilance
and
Precaution
which
had
often
<EOS>
retriev'd
<EOS>
him
,
when
to
others
his
Circumstances
seem'd
to
be
most
desperate
.
  
<EOS>
The
Generality
of
Mankind
,
and
the
French
in
particular
,
were
of
opinion
that
the
taking
Barcelona
would
prove
a
decisive
Stroke
,
and
put
a
Period
to
the
War
in
Spain
;
and
yet
at
that
very
Instant
<EOS>
I
was
inclin'd
to
believe
,
that
the
General
flatter'd
himself
<EOS>
it
would
be
in
his
Power
to
give
the
Enemy
sufficient
Mortification
,
even
though
the
Town
should
be
oblig'd
to
submit
to
King
Philip
.
<EOS>
The
wise
Measures
taken
induc'd
<EOS>
me
so
to
believe
,
and
the
Sequel
approv'd
<EOS>
it
;
for
the
Earl
had
so
well
expended
his
Caution
,
that
the
Enemy
,
on
the
Disappointment
,
found
himself
under
a
Necessity
of
quitting
Spain
;
and
the
same
would
have
put
him
under
equal
Difficulties
<EOS>
had
he
carry'd
<EOS>
the
Place
.
<EOS>
The
French
could
never
have
undertaken
that
Siege
without
depending
on
their
Fleet
,
for
their
Artillery
,
Ammunition
,
and
Provisions
;
since
they
must
be
inevitably
forc'd
to
leave
behind
them
the
strong
Towns
of
Tortosa
,
Lerida
,
and
Taragona
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
therefore
,
whose
perpetual
Difficulties
seem'd
rather
to
render
him
more
sprightly
and
vigorous
,
took
care
himself
to
examine
the
whole
Country
between
the
Ebro
and
Barcelona
;
and
,
upon
his
doing
so
,
was
pleasingly
,
as
well
as
sensibly
satisfy'd
,
that
it
was
practicable
to
render
their
Return
into
the
Heart
of
Spain
impossible
,
whether
they
did
or
did
not
succeed
in
the
Siege
they
were
so
intent
to
undertake
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
but
three
Ways
they
could
attempt
it
:
The
first
of
which
was
by
the
Sea
-
side
,
from
Taragona
towards
Tortosa
;
the
most
barren
,
and
consequently
the
most
improper
Country
in
the
Universe
to
sustain
an
Army
;
and
yet
to
the
natural
,
the
Earl
had
added
such
artificial
Difficulties
,
as
render'd
it
absolutely
impossible
for
an
Army
to
subsist
or
march
that
Way
.
  
<EOS>
The
middle
Way
lay
through
a
better
Country
indeed
,
yet
only
practicable
by
the
Care
which
had
been
taken
to
make
the
Road
so
.
<EOS>
And
even
here
there
was
a
Necessity
of
marching
along
the
Side
of
a
Mountain
,
where
by
vast
Labour
and
Industry
,
a
high
Way
had
been
cut
for
two
Miles
at
least
out
of
the
main
Rock
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
therefore
,
by
somewhat
of
the
same
Labour
,
soon
made
it
impassable
.
<EOS>
He
employ'd
to
that
End
many
Thousands
of
the
Country
People
<EOS>
,
under
a
few
of
his
own
Officers
and
Troops
,
who
cutting
up
twenty
several
Places
,
made
so
many
Precipices
,
perpendicular
almost
as
a
Wall
,
which
render'd
it
neither
safe
,
or
even
to
be
attempted
by
any
single
Man
in
his
Wits
,
much
less
by
an
Army
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
a
very
few
Men
,
from
the
higher
Cliffs
of
the
Mountain
,
might
have
destroy'd
an
Army
with
the
Arms
of
Nature
only
,
by
rolling
down
large
Stones
and
Pieces
of
the
Rock
upon
the
Enemy
passing
below
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
and
uppermost
Way
,
lay
thro
'
the
hilly
Part
of
Catalonia
,
and
led
to
Lerida
,
towards
the
Head
of
the
Ebro
,
the
strongest
Place
we
had
in
all
Spain
,
and
which
was
as
well
furnish'd
with
a
very
good
Garrison
.
<EOS>
Along
this
Road
there
lay
many
old
Castles
and
little
Towns
in
the
Mountains
,
naturally
strong
;
all
which
would
not
only
have
afforded
Opposition
,
but
at
the
same
time
had
entertain'd
an
Enemy
with
variety
of
Difficulties
;
and
especially
as
the
Earl
had
given
Orders
and
taken
Care
that
all
Cattle
,
and
every
Thing
necessary
to
sustain
an
Army
,
should
be
convey'd
into
Places
of
Security
,
either
in
the
Mountains
or
thereabouts
.
<EOS>
These
three
Ways
thus
precautiously
secur'd
,
what
had
the
Earl
to
apprehend
but
the
Safety
of
the
Arch
-
Duke
;
which
yet
was
through
no
Default
of
his
,
if
in
any
Danger
from
the
Siege
?
  
<EOS>
For
I
<EOS>
well
remember
,
on
Receipt
of
an
Express
from
the
Duke
of
Savoy
(
as
he
frequenly
sent
such
to
enquire
after
the
Proceedings
in
Spain
)
<EOS>
I
was
shew'd
<EOS>
a
Letter
,
wrote
about
this
time
by
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
to
that
Prince
,
which
rais'd
<EOS>
my
Spirits
,
though
then
at
a
very
low
Ebb
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
remarkable
to
be
forgot
;
and
the
Substance
of
it
was
,
That
his
Highness
might
depend
upon
it
,
that
he
(
the
Earl
)
was
in
much
better
Circumstances
than
he
was
thought
to
be
:
That
the
French
Officers
,
knowing
nothing
of
the
Situation
of
the
Country
,
would
find
themselves
extreamly
disappointed
,
since
in
case
the
Siege
was
rais'd
,
their
Army
should
be
oblig'd
to
abandon
Spain
:
Or
in
case
the
Town
was
taken
,
they
should
find
themselves
shut
up
in
that
Corner
of
Catalonia
,
and
under
an
Impossibility
of
forcing
their
Way
back
,
either
through
Aragon
or
Valencia
:
<EOS>
That
by
this
Means
all
Spain
,
to
the
Ebro
,
would
be
open
to
the
Lord
Galoway
,
who
might
march
to
Madrid
,
or
any
where
else
,
without
Opposition
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
no
other
Uneasiness
or
Concern
upon
him
,
but
for
the
Person
of
the
Arch
-
Duke
,
whom
he
had
nevertheless
earnestly
solicited
not
to
remain
in
the
Town
on
the
very
first
Appearance
of
the
intended
Siege
.
  
<EOS>
BARCELONA
being
thus
reliev'd
,
and
King
Philip
forc'd
out
of
Spain
,
by
these
cautious
Steps
taken
by
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
before
we
bring
him
to
Valencia
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
intimate
,
that
as
it
always
was
the
Custom
of
that
General
to
settle
,
by
a
Council
of
War
,
all
the
Measures
to
be
taken
,
whenever
he
was
oblig'd
for
the
Service
to
leave
the
Arch
-
Duke
;
a
Council
of
War
was
now
accordingly
held
,
where
all
the
General
Officers
,
and
those
in
greatest
Employments
at
Court
assisted
.
<EOS>
Here
every
thing
was
in
the
most
solemn
Manner
concerted
and
resolv'd
upon
;
here
Garrisons
were
settled
for
all
the
strong
Places
,
and
Governors
appointed
:
But
the
main
Article
then
agreed
upon
was
,
that
King
Charles
should
immediately
begin
his
Journey
to
Madrid
,
and
that
by
the
Way
of
Valencia
.
<EOS>
The
Reason
assign'd
<EOS>
for
it
was
,
because
that
Kingdom
being
in
his
Possession
,
no
Difficulties
could
arise
which
might
occasion
Delay
,
if
his
Majesty
took
that
Rout
.
<EOS>
It
was
likewise
agreed
in
the
same
Council
,
that
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
should
embark
all
the
Foot
,
not
in
Garrisons
,
for
their
more
speedy
,
as
well
as
more
easy
Conveyance
to
Valencia
.
<EOS>
The
same
Council
of
War
agreed
,
that
all
the
Horse
in
that
Kingdom
should
be
drawn
together
,
the
better
to
insure
the
Measures
to
be
taken
for
the
opening
and
facilitating
his
Majesty
's
Progress
to
Madrid
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
after
these
Resolutions
were
taken
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
embarks
his
Forces
and
sails
for
Valencia
,
where
he
was
doubly
welcom'd
by
all
Sorts
of
People
upon
Account
of
his
safe
Arrival
,
and
the
News
he
brought
along
with
it
.
<EOS>
By
the
Joy
they
express'd
,
one
would
have
imagin'd
that
the
General
had
escap'd
<EOS>
the
same
Danger
with
the
King
;
and
,
in
truth
,
had
their
King
arriv'd
<EOS>
with
him
in
Person
,
the
most
loyal
and
zealous
would
have
found
themselves
at
a
loss
how
to
have
express'd
<EOS>
their
Satisfaction
in
a
more
sensible
Manner
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
his
Landing
,
with
his
customary
Vivacity
,
he
apply'd
<EOS>
himself
to
put
in
execution
the
Resolutions
taken
in
the
Councils
of
War
at
Barcelona
;
and
a
little
to
improve
upon
them
,
he
rais'd
<EOS>
an
intire
Regiment
of
Dragoons
,
bought
them
Horses
,
provided
them
Cloaths
,
Arms
,
and
Acoutrements
;
and
in
six
Weeks
time
had
them
ready
to
take
the
Field
;
a
thing
though
hardly
to
be
parallell'd
,
is
yet
scarce
worthy
to
be
mentioned
among
so
many
nobler
Actions
of
his
;
yet
in
regard
to
another
General
it
may
merit
Notice
,
since
while
he
had
Madrid
in
Possession
near
four
Months
,
he
neither
augmented
his
Troops
,
nor
lay'd
up
any
Magazines
;
neither
sent
he
all
that
time
any
one
Express
to
concert
any
Measures
with
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
but
lay
under
a
perfect
Inactivity
,
or
which
was
worse
,
negotiating
that
unfortunate
Project
of
carrying
King
Charles
to
Madrid
by
the
roundabout
and
ill
-
concerted
Way
of
Aragon
;
a
Project
not
only
contrary
to
the
solemn
Resolutions
of
the
Council
of
War
;
but
which
in
reality
was
the
Root
of
all
our
succeeding
Misfortunes
;
and
that
only
for
the
wretched
Vanity
of
appearing
to
have
had
some
Share
in
bringing
the
King
to
his
Capital
;
but
how
minute
a
Share
<EOS>
it
was
will
be
manifest
,
if
it
be
consider'd
that
another
General
had
first
made
the
Way
easy
,
by
driving
the
Enemy
out
of
Spain
;
and
that
the
French
General
only
stay'd
at
Madrid
till
the
Return
of
those
Troops
which
were
in
a
manner
driven
out
of
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
that
Transaction
,
doughty
as
it
was
,
took
up
four
most
precious
Months
,
which
most
certainly
might
have
been
much
better
employ'd
in
rendering
it
impossible
for
the
Enemy
to
re
-
enter
Spain
;
nor
had
there
been
any
Great
Difficulty
in
so
doing
,
but
the
contrary
,
if
the
General
at
Madrid
had
thought
convenient
to
have
join'd
<EOS>
the
Troops
under
the
Earl
of
Peterhorow
,
and
then
to
have
march'd
<EOS>
directly
towards
Pampelona
,
or
the
Frontiers
of
France
.
<EOS>
To
this
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
solicited
the
King
,
and
those
about
him
;
he
advis'd
,
desir'd
,
and
intreated
him
to
lose
no
time
,
but
to
put
in
Execution
those
Measures
resolv'd
on
at
Barcelona
.
<EOS>
A
Council
of
War
in
Valencia
renew'd
<EOS>
the
same
Application
;
but
all
to
no
Purpose
,
his
Rout
was
order'd
<EOS>
him
,
and
that
to
meet
his
Majesty
on
the
Frontiers
of
Arragon
.
<EOS>
There
,
indeed
,
the
Earl
did
meet
the
King
;
and
the
French
General
an
Army
,
which
,
by
Virtue
of
a
decrepid
Intelligence
,
he
never
saw
or
heard
of
till
he
fled
from
it
to
his
Camp
at
Guadalira
.
<EOS>
Inexpressible
with
the
Confusion
in
this
fatal
Camp
:
<EOS>
The
King
from
Arragon
,
The
Earl
of
Peterborow
from
Valencia
arriving
in
it
the
same
Day
,
almost
the
same
Hour
that
the
Earl
of
Galoway
enter'd
under
a
hasty
Retreat
before
the
French
Army
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
Order
,
which
a
Zeal
of
Justice
has
made
me
somewhat
anticipate
;
the
Earl
had
not
been
long
at
Valencia
before
he
gave
Orders
to
Major
-
General
Windham
to
march
with
all
the
Forces
he
had
,
which
were
not
above
two
thousand
Men
,
and
lay
Siege
to
Requina
,
a
Town
ten
Leagues
distant
from
Valencia
,
and
in
the
Way
to
Madrid
.
<EOS>
The
Town
was
not
very
strong
,
nor
very
large
;
but
<EOS>
sure
the
odliest
<EOS>
fortify'd
that
ever
was
.
<EOS>
The
Houses
in
a
Circle
conneftively
compos'd
the
Wall
;
and
the
People
,
who
defended
the
Town
,
instead
of
firing
from
Hornworks
,
Counterscarps
,
and
Bastions
,
fir'd
out
of
the
Windows
of
their
Houses
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
which
,
General
Windham
found
much
greater
Opposition
than
he
at
first
imagin'd
;
and
therefore
finding
he
should
want
Ammunition
,
he
sent
to
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
for
a
Supply
;
at
the
same
time
assigning
,
as
a
Reason
for
it
,
the
unexpected
Obstinacy
of
the
Town
.
<EOS>
So
soon
as
the
Earl
receiv'd
<EOS>
the
Letter
he
sent
for
me
;
and
told
me
I
must
repair
to
Requifia
,
where
they
would
want
an
Engineer
;
and
that
I
must
be
ready
next
Morning
,
when
he
should
order
a
Lieutenant
,
with
thirty
Soldiers
and
two
Matrosses
,
to
guard
some
Powder
for
that
Service
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
next
Morning
we
set
out
,
the
Lieutenant
,
who
was
a
Dutchman
,
and
Commander
of
the
Convoy
,
being
of
my
Acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
reach'd
<EOS>
Saint
Jago
,
a
small
Village
about
midway
between
Valencia
and
Requina
,
when
the
Officer
,
just
as
he
was
got
without
the
Town
,
resolving
to
take
up
his
Quarters
on
the
Spot
,
order'd
<EOS>
the
Mules
to
be
unloaded
.
<EOS>
The
Powder
,
which
consisted
of
forty
-
five
Barrels
,
was
pil'd
up
in
a
Circle
,
and
cover'd
with
Oil
-
cloth
,
to
preserve
it
from
the
Weather
;
and
though
we
had
agreed
to
sup
together
at
my
Quarters
within
the
Village
,
yet
being
weary
and
fatigu'd
,
he
order'd
his
Field
-
Bed
to
be
put
up
near
the
Powder
,
and
so
lay
down
to
take
a
short
Nap
.
<EOS>
I
had
scarce
been
at
my
Quarters
<EOS>
an
Hour
,
when
a
sudden
Shock
attack'd
<EOS>
the
House
so
violently
,
that
it
threw
down
Tiles
,
Windows
,
Chimneys
and
all
.
<EOS>
It
presently
came
into
my
Head
what
was
the
Occasion
;
and
as
my
Fears
suggested
so
it
prov'd
:
<EOS>
For
running
to
the
Door
I
saw
a
Cloud
ascending
from
the
Spot
<EOS>
I
left
the
Powder
pitch'd
upon
.
<EOS>
In
haste
making
up
to
which
,
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
bare
Circle
upon
which
it
had
stood
.
<EOS>
The
Bed
was
blown
quite
away
,
and
the
poor
Lieutenant
all
to
pieces
,
several
of
his
Limbs
being
found
separate
,
and
at
a
vast
Distance
each
from
the
other
;
and
particularly
an
Arm
,
with
a
Ring
on
one
of
the
Fingers
.
<EOS>
The
Matrosses
were
,
if
possible
,
in
a
yet
worse
Condition
,
that
is
,
as
to
Manglement
and
Laceration
.
<EOS>
All
the
Soldiers
who
were
standing
,
and
any
thing
near
,
were
struck
dead
.
<EOS>
Only
such
as
lay
sleeping
on
the
Ground
escap'd
,
and
of
those
one
<EOS>
assur'd
<EOS>
me
,
that
the
Blast
remov'd
him
several
Foot
from
his
Place
of
Repose
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
enquiring
into
this
deplorable
Disaster
,
I
had
this
Account
:
<EOS>
That
a
Pig
running
out
of
the
Town
,
the
Soldiers
endeavour'd
to
intercept
its
Return
;
but
driving
it
upon
the
Matrosses
,
one
of
them
,
who
was
jealous
of
its
getting
back
into
the
Hands
of
the
Soldiers
,
drew
his
Pistol
to
shoot
it
,
which
was
the
Source
of
this
miserable
Catastrophe
.
<EOS>
The
Lieutenant
carry'd
along
with
him
a
Bag
of
Dollars
to
pay
the
Soldiers
'
Quarters
,
of
which
the
People
,
and
the
Soldiers
that
were
say'd
,
found
many
;
but
blown
to
an
inconceivable
Distance
.
  
<EOS>
With
those
few
Soldiers
that
remain'd
<EOS>
alive
,
I
proceeded
,
according
to
my
Order
,
to
Requina
;
where
,
when
I
arriv'd
,
I
gave
General
Windham
an
Account
of
the
Disaster
at
St.
Jago
.
<EOS>
As
such
it
troubled
him
,
and
not
a
little
on
account
of
the
Disappointment
.
<EOS>
However
,
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
Market
,
he
gave
Orders
for
the
forming
of
a
Mine
under
an
old
Castle
,
which
was
part
of
the
Wall
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
order'd
,
so
it
was
begun
,
more
in
Terrorem
,
than
with
any
Expectation
of
Success
from
it
as
a
Mine
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
had
scarce
began
to
frame
the
Oven
of
the
Mine
,
when
those
within
the
Town
desir'd
to
capitulate
.
<EOS>
This
being
all
we
could
aim
at
,
under
the
Miscarriage
of
our
Powder
at
St.
Jago
(
none
being
yet
arriv'd
to
supply
that
Defect
)
<EOS>
Articles
were
readily
granted
them
;
pursuant
to
which
,
that
Part
of
the
Garrison
,
which
was
compos'd
of
Castilian
Gentry
,
had
Liberty
to
go
wherever
they
thought
best
,
and
the
rest
were
made
Prisoners
of
War
.
<EOS>
Requina
being
thus
reduc'd
<EOS>
to
the
Obedience
of
Charles
III
<EOS>
a
new
rais'd
Regiment
of
Spaniards
was
left
in
Garrison
,
the
Colonel
of
which
was
appointed
Governor
;
and
our
Supply
of
Powder
having
at
last
got
safe
to
us
,
General
Windham
march'd
his
little
Army
to
Cuenca
.
  
<EOS>
CUENCA
is
a
considerable
City
and
a
Bishoprick
;
therefore
to
pretend
to
sit
down
before
it
with
such
a
Company
of
Forragers
,
rather
than
an
Army
,
must
be
plac'd
among
the
hardy
Influences
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
's
auspicious
Administration
.
<EOS>
On
the
out
Part
of
Cuenca
there
stood
an
old
Castle
,
from
which
,
upon
our
Approach
,
they
play'd
upon
us
furiously
:
<EOS>
But
as
soon
as
we
could
bring
two
Pieces
of
our
Cannon
to
bear
,
we
answered
their
Fire
with
so
good
Success
,
that
we
soon
oblig'd
them
to
retire
into
the
Town
.
<EOS>
We
had
rais'd
<EOS>
a
Battery
of
twelve
Guns
against
the
City
,
on
their
Rejection
of
the
Summons
sent
them
to
come
under
the
Obedience
of
King
Charles
;
going
to
which
from
the
old
Castle
last
reduc'd
,
<EOS>
I
receiv'd
<EOS>
a
Shot
on
the
Toe
of
one
of
my
Shoes
,
which
carry'd
<EOS>
that
Part
of
the
Shoe
intirely
away
,
without
any
further
Damage
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
that
Battery
we
ply'd
them
warmly
(
as
well
as
from
three
Mortars
)
for
the
Space
of
three
Days
,
their
Nights
included
;
but
observing
,
that
in
one
particular
House
,
they
were
remarkably
busy
;
<EOS>
People
thronging
in
and
out
below
;
and
those
above
firing
perpetually
out
of
the
Windows
,
I
was
resolv'd
to
have
one
Shot
at
that
Window
,
and
made
those
Officers
about
me
take
Notice
of
it
.
<EOS>
True
it
was
,
the
Distance
would
hardly
allow
me
to
hope
for
Success
;
yet
as
the
Experiment
could
only
be
attended
with
the
Expence
of
a
single
Ball
,
I
made
it
.
<EOS>
So
soon
as
the
Smoak
of
my
own
Cannon
would
permit
it
,
we
could
see
Clouds
of
Dust
issuing
from
out
of
the
Window
,
which
,
together
with
the
People
's
crouding
out
of
Doors
,
<EOS>
convinc'd
<EOS>
the
Officers
,
whom
I
had
desir'd
to
take
Notice
of
it
,
that
I
had
been
no
bad
Marksman
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
two
Priests
were
sent
out
of
the
Place
with
Proposals
;
but
they
were
so
triflingly
extravagant
,
that
as
soon
as
ever
the
General
heard
them
,
he
order'd
<EOS>
their
Answer
in
a
fresh
Renewal
of
the
Fire
of
both
Cannon
and
Mortars
.
<EOS>
And
it
happen'd
to
be
with
so
much
Havock
and
Execution
,
that
they
were
soon
taught
Reason
;
and
sent
back
their
Divines
,
with
much
more
moderate
Demands
.
<EOS>
After
the
General
had
a
little
modell'd
<EOS>
these
last
,
they
were
accepted
;
and
according
to
the
Articles
of
Capitulation
,
the
City
was
that
very
Day
surrender'd
into
our
Possession
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Duncannon
's
Regiment
took
Guard
of
all
the
Gates
;
and
King
Charles
was
proclaim'd
in
due
Form
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
during
this
Expedition
,
had
left
Valencia
,
and
was
arriv'd
at
my
Lord
Galway
's
Camp
at
Guadalaxara
;
who
for
the
Confederates
,
and
King
Charles
in
particular
,
unfortunately
was
order'd
from
Portugal
,
to
take
the
Command
from
a
General
,
who
had
all
along
been
almost
miraculously
successful
,
and
by
his
own
great
Actions
pay'd
the
Way
for
a
safe
Passage
to
that
his
Supplanter
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
even
in
this
fatal
Place
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
made
some
Proposals
,
which
,
had
they
been
embrac'd
,
might
,
in
all
Probability
,
have
secur'd
<EOS>
Madrid
from
falling
into
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
;
But
,
in
opposition
thereto
,
the
Lord
Galway
,
and
all
his
Portugueze
Officers
,
were
for
forcing
the
next
Day
the
Enemy
to
Battle
.
<EOS>
The
almost
only
Person
against
it
was
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
;
who
then
<EOS>
and
there
took
the
Liberty
to
evince
the
Impossibility
of
coming
to
an
Engagement
.
<EOS>
This
the
next
Morning
too
evidently
made
apparent
,
when
upon
the
first
Motion
of
our
Troops
towards
the
River
,
which
they
pretended
to
pass
,
and
must
pass
,
before
they
could
engage
,
they
were
so
warmly
saluted
from
the
Batteries
of
the
Enemy
,
and
their
small
Shot
,
that
our
Regiments
were
forc'd
to
retire
in
Confusion
to
their
Camp
.
<EOS>
By
which
Rebuff
all
heroical
Imaginations
were
at
present
laid
aside
,
to
consider
how
they
might
make
their
Retreat
to
Valencia
.
  
<EOS>
The
Retreat
being
at
last
resolv'd
on
,
and
a
Multiplicity
of
Generals
rendering
our
bad
Circumstances
much
worse
,
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
met
with
a
fortunate
Reprieve
,
by
Solicitations
from
the
Queen
,
and
Desires
tantamount
to
Orders
,
that
he
would
go
with
the
Troops
left
in
Catalonia
to
the
Relief
of
the
Duke
of
Savoy
.
<EOS>
It
is
hardly
to
be
doubted
that
that
General
was
glad
to
withdraw
from
those
Scenes
of
Confusion
,
which
were
but
too
visible
to
Eyes
even
less
discerning
than
his
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
forebore
to
prepare
himself
to
put
her
Majesty
's
Desires
in
execution
,
as
they
were
not
peremptory
,
till
it
had
been
resolv'd
by
the
unanimous
Consent
of
a
Council
of
War
,
where
the
King
,
all
the
Generals
and
Ministers
were
present
.
<EOS>
That
it
was
expedient
for
the
Service
that
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
during
the
Winter
Season
,
should
comply
with
her
Majesty
's
Desires
,
and
go
for
Italy
;
since
he
might
return
before
the
opening
of
the
Campaign
,
if
it
should
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
And
return
indeed
he
did
,
before
the
Campaign
open'd
,
and
brought
along
with
him
one
hundred
thousand
Pounds
from
Genoa
,
to
the
great
Comfort
and
Support
of
our
Troops
,
which
had
neither
Money
nor
Credit
.
<EOS>
But
on
his
Return
,
that
noble
Earl
found
the
Lord
Galway
had
been
near
as
successful
against
him
,
as
he
had
been
unsuccessful
against
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
Thence
was
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
recall'd
to
make
room
for
an
unfortunate
General
,
who
the
next
Year
suffer'd
<EOS>
himself
to
be
decoy'd
into
that
fatal
Battle
of
Almanza
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
on
his
leaving
Valencia
,
had
order'd
<EOS>
his
Baggage
to
follow
him
to
the
Camp
at
Guadalaxara
;
and
it
arriv'd
<EOS>
in
our
little
Camp
,
so
far
safe
in
its
way
to
the
greater
at
Guadalaxara
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
consisted
of
seven
loaded
Waggons
;
and
General
Windham
gave
Orders
for
a
small
Guard
to
escorte
it
;
under
which
they
proceeded
on
their
Journey
:
But
about
eight
Leagues
from
Cuenca
,
at
a
pretty
Town
call'd
Huette
,
a
Party
from
the
Duke
of
Berwick
's
Army
,
with
Boughs
in
their
Hats
,
the
better
to
appear
what
they
were
not
(
for
the
Bough
in
the
Hat
is
the
Badge
of
the
English
,
as
white
Paper
is
the
Badge
of
the
French
)
came
into
the
Town
,
crying
all
the
way
,
Viva
Carlos
Tercero
,
Viva
.
<EOS>
With
these
Acclamations
in
their
Mouths
,
they
advanc'd
up
to
the
very
Waggons
;
when
attacking
the
Guards
,
who
had
too
much
deluded
themselves
with
Appearances
,
they
routed
'em
,
and
immediately
plunder'd
the
Waggons
of
all
that
was
valuable
,
and
then
march'd
off
.
  
<EOS>
The
Noise
of
this
soon
reach'd
<EOS>
the
Ears
of
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
at
Guadalaxara
.
<EOS>
When
leaving
my
Lord
Galways
Camp
,
pursuant
to
the
Resolutions
of
the
Council
of
War
,
with
a
Party
only
of
fourscore
of
Killigrew
's
Dragoons
,
he
met
General
Windham
's
little
Army
within
a
League
of
Huette
,
the
Place
where
his
Baggage
had
been
plunder'd
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
had
strong
Motives
of
Suspicion
,
that
the
Inhabitants
had
given
Intelligence
to
the
Enemy
;
and
,
as
is
very
natural
,
giving
way
to
the
first
Dictates
of
Resentment
,
he
resolv'd
to
have
lay'd
the
Town
in
Ashes
:
<EOS>
But
when
he
came
near
it
,
the
Clergy
and
Magistrates
upon
their
Knees
,
disavowing
the
Charge
,
and
asserting
their
Innocence
,
prevail'd
on
the
good
Nature
of
that
generous
Earl
,
without
any
great
Difficulty
,
to
spare
the
Town
,
at
least
not
to
burn
it
.
  
<EOS>
We
march'd
however
into
the
Town
,
and
that
Night
took
up
our
Quarters
there
;
and
the
Magistrates
,
under
the
Dread
of
our
avenging
our
selves
,
on
their
part
took
Care
that
we
were
well
supplied
.
<EOS>
But
when
they
were
made
sensible
of
the
Value
of
the
Loss
,
which
the
Earl
had
sustain'd
;
and
that
on
a
moderate
Computation
it
amounted
to
at
least
eight
thousand
Pistoles
;
they
voluntarily
presented
themselves
next
Morning
,
and
of
their
own
accord
offer'd
to
make
his
Lordship
full
Satisfaction
,
and
that
,
in
their
own
Phrase
,
de
Contado
,
in
Ready
Money
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
was
not
displeas'd
at
their
Offer
;
but
generously
made
Answer
,
That
he
was
just
come
from
my
Lord
Galway
's
Camp
at
Chincon
,
where
he
found
they
were
in
a
likelihood
of
wanting
Bread
;
and
as
he
imagin'd
it
might
be
easier
to
them
to
raise
the
Value
in
Corn
,
than
in
ready
Money
;
if
they
would
send
to
that
Value
in
Corn
to
the
Lord
Galway
's
Camp
,
he
would
be
<EOS>
satisfy'd
.
<EOS>
This
they
with
Joy
embrac'd
,
and
immediately
complied
with
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
apt
to
think
the
last
Century
<EOS>
(
and
I
very
much
fear
the
Current
will
be
as
deficient
)
can
hardly
produce
a
parallel
Instance
of
Generosity
and
true
public
Spiritedness
;
And
the
World
will
be
of
my
Opinion
,
when
I
have
corroborated
this
with
another
Passage
some
Years
after
.
<EOS>
The
Commissioners
for
Stating
the
Debts
due
to
the
Army
,
meeting
daily
for
that
Purpose
at
their
House
in
Darby
Court
in
Channel
Row
<EOS>
,
I
there
mentioned
to
Mr.
Read
,
Gentleman
to
his
Lordship
,
this
very
just
and
honourable
Claim
upon
the
Government
,
as
Monies
advanced
for
the
Use
of
the
Army
.
<EOS>
Who
told
me
in
a
little
Time
after
,
that
he
had
mention'd
it
to
his
Lordship
,
but
with
no
other
Effect
than
to
have
it
rejected
with
a
generous
Disdain
.
  
<EOS>
While
we
stayed
at
Huette
there
was
a
little
Incident
in
Life
,
which
gave
me
great
Diversion
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
who
had
always
maintain'd
a
good
Correspondence
with
the
fair
Sex
,
<EOS>
hearing
from
one
of
the
Priests
of
the
Place
,
That
on
the
Alarm
of
burning
the
Town
,
one
of
the
finest
Ladies
in
all
Spain
had
taken
Refuge
in
the
Nunnery
,
was
desirous
to
speak
with
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
Nunnery
stood
upon
a
small
rising
Hill
within
the
Town
;
and
to
obtain
the
View
,
the
Earl
had
presently
in
his
Head
this
Stratagem
;
he
sends
for
me
,
as
Engineer
,
to
have
my
Advice
,
how
to
raise
a
proper
Fortification
upon
that
Hill
out
of
the
Nunnery
.
<EOS>
I
waited
upon
his
Lordship
to
the
Place
,
where
declaring
the
Intent
of
our
coming
,
and
giving
plausible
Reasons
for
it
,
the
Train
took
,
and
immediately
the
Lady
Abbess
,
and
the
fair
Lady
,
came
out
to
make
Intercession
,
That
his
Lordship
would
be
pleas'd
to
lay
aside
that
Design
.
<EOS>
The
divine
Oratory
of
one
,
and
the
beautiful
Charms
of
the
other
,
prevail'd
;
so
his
Lordship
left
the
Fortification
to
be
the
Work
of
some
future
Generation
.
  
<EOS>
From
Huette
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
<EOS>
march'd
forwards
for
Valencia
,
with
only
those
fourscore
Dragoons
,
which
came
with
him
from
Chincon
,
leaving
General
Windham
pursuing
his
own
Orders
to
join
his
Forces
to
the
Army
then
under
the
Command
of
the
Lord
Galway
.
<EOS>
But
stopping
at
Campilio
,
a
little
Town
in
our
Way
,
his
Lordship
had
Information
of
a
most
barbarous
Fact
committed
that
very
Morning
by
the
Spaniards
,
at
a
small
Villa
,
about
a
League
distant
,
upon
some
English
Soldiers
.
  
<EOS>
A
Captain
of
the
English
Guards
(
whose
Name
has
slip'd
<EOS>
my
Memory
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
well
knew
the
Man
)
marching
in
order
to
join
the
Battalion
of
the
Guards
,
then
under
the
Command
of
General
Windham
,
with
some
of
his
Soldiers
,
that
had
been
in
the
Hospital
,
took
up
his
Quarters
in
that
little
Villa
.
<EOS>
But
on
his
marching
out
of
it
,
next
Morning
,
a
Shot
in
the
Back
laid
that
Officer
dead
upon
the
Spot
:
<EOS>
And
as
it
had
been
before
concerted
,
the
Spaniards
of
the
Place
at
the
same
Time
fell
upon
the
poor
,
weak
Soldiers
,
killing
several
;
not
even
sparing
their
Wives
.
<EOS>
This
was
but
a
Prelude
to
their
Barbarity
;
their
savage
Cruelty
was
only
whetted
,
not
glutted
.
<EOS>
They
took
the
surviving
few
;
hurried
and
dragg'd
them
up
a
Hill
,
a
little
without
the
Villa
.
<EOS>
On
the
Top
of
this
Hill
there
was
a
Hole
,
or
Opening
,
somewhat
like
the
Mouth
of
one
of
our
Coal
-
Pits
,
<EOS>
down
this
they
cast
several
,
who
,
with
hideous
Shrieks
and
Cries
,
made
more
hideous
by
the
Ecchoes
of
the
Chasm
,
there
lost
their
Lives
.
  
<EOS>
This
Relation
was
thus
made
to
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
at
his
Quarters
at
Campilio
;
who
immediately
gave
Orders
for
to
sound
to
Horse
.
<EOS>
At
first
we
were
all
surpriz'd
;
but
were
soon
satisfy'd
,
that
it
was
to
revenge
,
or
rather
,
do
Justice
,
on
this
barbarous
Action
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
enter'd
the
Villa
we
found
that
most
of
the
Inhabitants
,
but
especially
the
most
Guilty
,
had
withdrawn
themselves
on
our
Approach
.
<EOS>
We
found
,
however
,
many
of
the
dead
Soldiers
Cloaths
,
which
had
been
convey'd
into
the
Church
,
and
there
hid
.
<EOS>
And
a
strong
Accusation
being
laid
against
a
Person
belonging
to
the
Church
,
and
full
Proof
made
,
that
he
had
been
singularly
Industrious
in
the
Execution
of
that
horrid
Piece
of
Barbarity
on
the
Hill
,
his
Lordship
commanded
him
to
be
hang'd
up
at
the
Knocker
of
the
Door
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
piece
of
military
Justice
,
we
were
led
up
to
the
fatal
Pit
or
Hole
,
down
which
many
had
been
cast
headlong
.
<EOS>
There
we
found
one
poor
Soldier
alive
,
who
,
upon
his
throwing
in
,
had
catch'd
fast
hold
of
some
impending
Bushes
,
and
sav'd
himself
on
a
little
Jutty
within
the
Concavity
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
us
talk
English
he
cry'd
out
;
and
Ropes
being
let
down
,
in
a
little
Time
he
was
drawn
up
;
when
he
gave
us
an
ample
Detail
of
the
whole
Villany
.
<EOS>
Among
other
Particulars
,
I
remember
he
told
me
of
a
very
narrow
Escape
he
had
in
that
obscure
Recess
.
<EOS>
A
poor
Woman
,
one
of
the
Wives
of
the
Soldiers
,
who
were
thrown
down
after
him
,
struggled
,
and
roared
so
much
,
that
they
could
not
,
without
all
their
Force
,
throw
her
cleaverly
in
the
Middle
;
by
which
means
falling
near
the
Side
,
in
her
Fall
she
almost
beat
him
from
his
Place
of
Security
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
Conclusion
of
this
tragical
Relation
of
the
Soldier
thus
saved
,
his
Lordship
gave
immediate
Orders
for
the
Firing
of
the
Villa
,
which
was
executed
with
due
Severity
:
<EOS>
After
which
his
Lordship
march'd
back
to
his
Quarters
at
Campilio
;
from
whence
,
two
Days
after
,
we
arriv'd
at
Valencia
,
Where
,
the
first
Thing
presented
to
that
noble
Lord
,
was
all
the
Papers
taken
in
the
Plunder
of
his
Baggage
,
which
the
Duke
of
Berwick
had
generously
order'd
to
be
return'd
him
,
without
waste
or
opening
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
too
manifest
,
after
the
Earl
's
arrival
at
this
City
,
that
the
Alteration
in
the
Command
of
the
English
Forces
,
which
before
was
only
receiv'd
as
a
Rumour
,
had
deeper
Grounds
for
Belief
,
than
many
of
his
Friends
in
that
City
could
have
wish'd
.
<EOS>
His
Lordship
had
gain'd
<EOS>
the
Love
of
all
by
a
Thousand
engaging
Condescensions
;
even
his
Gallantries
being
no
way
prejudicial
,
were
not
offensive
;
and
though
his
Lordships
did
his
utmost
to
conceal
his
Chagrin
,
the
Sympathy
of
those
around
him
made
such
Discoveries
upon
him
,
as
would
have
disappointed
a
double
Portion
of
his
Caution
.
<EOS>
They
had
seen
him
un
-
elated
under
Successes
,
that
were
so
near
being
unaccountable
,
that
in
a
Country
of
less
Superstition
than
Spain
,
they
might
almost
have
pass'd
for
miraculous
;
they
knew
full
well
,
that
nothing
,
but
that
Series
of
Successes
had
pav'd
a
Passage
for
the
General
that
was
to
supersede
him
;
those
only
having
removed
all
the
Difficulties
of
his
March
from
Portugal
to
Madrid
;
they
knew
him
the
older
General
;
and
therefore
not
knowing
,
that
in
the
Court
he
came
from
,
Intrigue
was
too
often
the
Soul
of
Merit
,
they
could
not
but
be
amazed
at
a
Change
,
which
his
Lordship
was
unwilling
any
body
should
perceive
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
upon
this
Account
,
that
,
as
formerly
,
he
treated
the
Ladies
with
Balls
,
and
to
pursue
the
Dons
in
their
own
Humour
,
order'd
<EOS>
a
Tawridore
or
Bull
-
Feast
.
<EOS>
In
Spain
no
sort
of
public
Diversions
are
esteemed
equal
with
this
.
<EOS>
But
the
Bulls
provided
at
Valencia
,
not
being
of
the
right
Breed
,
nor
ever
initiated
in
the
Mysteries
,
did
not
acquit
themselves
at
all
masterly
;
and
consequently
,
did
not
give
the
Diversion
,
or
Satisfaction
expected
.
<EOS>
For
which
Reason
I
shall
omit
giving
a
Description
of
this
Bull
-
Feast
;
and
desire
my
Reader
to
suspend
his
Curiosity
till
I
come
to
some
,
which
,
in
the
Spanish
Sense
,
were
much
more
entertaining
;
that
is
,
attended
with
much
greater
Hazards
and
Danger
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
I
have
said
,
the
Gallantries
of
the
General
were
mostly
political
at
least
very
inoffensive
;
yet
there
happen'd
<EOS>
about
this
Time
,
and
in
this
Place
,
a
piece
of
Gallantry
,
that
gave
the
Earl
a
vast
deal
of
Offence
and
Vexation
;
as
a
Matter
,
that
in
its
Consequences
might
have
been
fatal
to
the
Interest
of
King
Charles
,
if
not
to
the
English
Nation
in
general
;
and
which
I
the
rather
relate
,
in
that
it
may
be
of
use
to
young
Officers
,
and
others
;
pointing
out
to
them
the
Danger
,
not
to
say
Folly
,
of
inadvertent
and
precipitate
Engagements
,
under
unruly
Passions
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
before
,
that
Valencia
is
famous
for
fine
Women
.
<EOS>
It
indeed
abounds
in
them
;
and
among
those
,
are
great
Numbers
of
Courtezans
not
inferior
in
Beauty
to
any
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
two
of
our
English
Officers
,
not
caring
for
the
common
Road
,
however
safe
,
resolv'd
to
launch
into
the
deeper
Seas
,
though
attended
with
much
greater
Danger
.
<EOS>
Amours
,
the
common
Failing
of
that
fair
City
,
was
the
Occasion
of
this
Accident
,
and
two
Nuns
the
Objects
.
<EOS>
It
is
customary
in
that
Country
for
young
People
in
an
Evening
to
resort
to
the
Grates
of
the
Nunneries
,
there
to
divert
themselves
,
and
the
Nuns
,
with
a
little
pleasant
and
inoffensive
Chit
-
chat
.
<EOS>
For
though
I
have
heard
some
relate
a
World
of
nauseous
Passages
at
such
Conversations
,
I
must
declare
,
that
I
never
saw
,
or
heard
any
Thing
unseemly
;
and
therefore
whenever
I
have
heard
any
such
from
such
Fabulists
,
I
never
so
much
wrong'd
<EOS>
my
Judgment
as
to
afford
them
Credit
.
  
<EOS>
Our
two
Officers
were
very
assiduous
at
the
Grates
of
a
Nunnery
in
this
Place
;
and
having
there
pitch'd
<EOS>
upon
two
Nuns
,
prosecuted
their
Amours
with
such
Vigour
,
that
,
in
a
little
time
,
they
had
made
a
very
great
Progress
in
their
Affections
,
without
in
the
least
considering
the
Dangers
that
must
attend
themselves
and
the
Fair
;
they
had
exchang'd
Vows
,
and
prevail'd
upon
the
weaker
Vessels
to
endeavour
to
get
out
to
their
Lovers
.
<EOS>
To
effect
which
,
soon
after
,
a
Plot
was
lay'd
;
the
Means
,
the
Hour
,
and
every
thing
agreed
upon
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
Custom
of
that
Nunnery
,
as
of
many
others
,
for
the
Nuns
to
take
their
weekly
Courses
in
keeping
the
Keys
of
all
the
Doors
.
<EOS>
The
two
Love
-
sick
Ladies
giving
Notice
to
their
Lovers
at
the
Grate
,
that
one
of
their
Turns
was
come
,
the
Night
and
Hour
was
appointed
,
which
the
Officers
punctually
observing
,
carry'd
<EOS>
off
their
Prey
without
either
Difficulty
or
Interruption
.
  
<EOS>
But
next
Morning
,
when
the
Nuns
were
missing
,
what
an
Uproar
was
there
over
all
the
City
?
<EOS>
The
Ladies
were
both
of
Quality
;
and
therefore
the
Tidings
were
first
carry'd
to
their
Relations
.
<EOS>
They
receiv'd
the
News
with
Vows
of
utmost
Vengeance
;
and
,
as
is
usual
in
that
Country
,
put
themselves
in
Arms
for
that
Purpose
.
<EOS>
There
needed
no
great
canvassing
for
discovering
who
were
the
Aggressors
:
The
Officers
had
been
too
frequent
,
and
too
publick
,
in
their
Addresses
,
to
leave
any
room
for
question
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
were
complain'd
of
and
sought
for
,
but
sensible
at
last
of
their
past
Temerity
,
they
endeavour'd
,
and
with
a
great
deal
of
Difficulty
perfected
their
Escape
.
  
<EOS>
Less
fortunate
were
the
two
fair
Nuns
;
their
Lovers
,
in
their
utmost
Exigence
,
had
forsaken
them
;
and
they
,
poor
Creatures
,
knew
not
where
to
fly
.
<EOS>
Under
this
sad
Dilemma
they
were
taken
;
and
,
as
in
like
Offences
,
condemn'd
<EOS>
directly
to
the
Punishment
of
immuring
.
<EOS>
And
what
greater
Punishment
is
there
on
Earth
than
to
be
confin'd
between
four
narrow
Walls
,
only
open
at
the
Top
;
and
thence
to
be
half
supported
with
Bread
and
Water
,
till
the
Offenders
gradually
starve
to
Death
?
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
though
highly
exasperated
at
the
Proceedings
of
his
Officers
,
in
compassion
to
the
unhappy
Fair
,
resolv'd
to
interpose
by
all
the
moderate
Means
possible
.
<EOS>
He
knew
very
well
,
that
no
one
Thing
could
so
much
prejudice
<EOS>
the
Spaniard
against
him
,
as
the
countenancing
such
an
Action
;
wherefore
he
inveigh'd
against
the
Officers
,
at
the
same
time
that
he
endeavour'd
to
mitigate
in
favour
of
the
Ladies
:
<EOS>
But
all
was
in
vain
;
it
was
urg'd
against
those
charitable
Intercessions
,
that
they
had
broke
their
Vows
;
and
in
that
had
broke
in
upon
the
Laws
of
the
Nunnery
and
Religion
;
the
Consequence
of
all
which
could
be
nothing
less
than
the
Punishment
appointed
to
be
inflicted
.
<EOS>
And
which
was
the
hardest
of
all
,
the
nearest
of
their
Relations
most
<EOS>
oppos'd
<EOS>
all
his
generous
Mediations
;
and
those
,
who
according
to
the
common
Course
of
Nature
should
have
thank'd
<EOS>
him
for
his
Endeavours
to
be
instrumental
in
rescuing
them
from
the
impending
Danger
,
grew
more
and
more
enrag'd
,
because
he
oppos'd
them
in
their
Design
of
a
cruel
Revenge
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
which
the
Earl
persever'd
;
and
after
a
deal
of
Labour
,
first
got
the
Penalty
suspended
;
and
,
soon
after
,
by
the
Dint
of
a
very
considerable
Sum
of
Money
(
a
most
powerful
Argument
,
which
prevails
in
every
Country
)
sav'd
the
poor
Nuns
from
immuring
;
and
at
last
,
though
with
great
Reluctance
,
he
got
them
receiv'd
<EOS>
again
into
the
Nunnery
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
Warlike
Lovers
,
one
of
them
was
the
Year
after
slain
at
the
Battle
of
Almanza
;
the
other
is
yet
living
,
being
a
Brigadier
in
the
Army
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
was
here
with
his
little
Army
of
great
Hereticks
,
neither
Priests
nor
People
were
so
open
in
their
superstitious
Fopperies
,
as
I
at
other
times
found
them
.
<EOS>
For
which
Reason
I
will
make
bold
,
and
by
an
Antichronism
in
this
Place
,
a
little
anticipate
some
Observations
that
I
made
some
time
after
the
Earl
left
it
.
<EOS>
And
as
I
have
not
often
committed
such
a
Transgression
,
I
hope
it
may
be
the
more
excusable
now
,
and
no
way
blemish
my
Memoirs
,
that
I
break
in
upon
the
Series
of
my
Journal
.
  
<EOS>
VALENCIA
is
a
handsome
City
,
and
a
Bishoprick
;
and
is
considerable
not
only
for
the
Pleasantness
of
its
Situation
and
beautiful
Ladies
;
but
(
which
at
some
certain
Times
,
and
on
some
Occasions
,
to
them
is
more
valuable
than
both
those
put
together
)
for
being
the
Birth
-
place
of
Saint
Vincent
,
the
Patron
of
the
Place
;
and
next
for
its
being
the
Place
where
Santo
Domingo
,
the
first
Institutor
of
the
Dominican
Order
had
his
Education
.
<EOS>
Here
,
in
honour
of
the
last
,
is
a
spacious
and
very
splendid
Convent
of
the
Dominicans
.
<EOS>
Walking
by
which
,
I
one
Day
observ'd
over
the
Gate
,
a
Figure
of
a
man
in
stone
;
and
near
it
a
Dog
with
a
lighted
Torch
in
his
Mouth
.
<EOS>
The
Image
I
rightly
enough
took
to
intend
that
of
the
Saint
;
but
inquiring
of
one
of
the
Order
,
at
the
Gate
,
the
Meaning
of
the
Figures
near
it
,
he
very
courteously
ask'd
me
to
walk
in
,
and
then
entertain'd
me
with
the
following
Relation
:
  
<EOS>
When
the
Mother
of
Santo
Domingo
,
said
that
Religious
,
was
with
Child
of
that
future
Saint
,
she
had
a
Dream
which
very
much
afflicted
her
.
<EOS>
She
dreamt
that
she
heard
a
Dog
bark
in
her
Belly
;
and
inquiring
(
at
what
Oracle
is
not
said
)
<EOS>
the
Meaning
of
her
Dream
,
she
was
told
,
That
that
Child
should
bark
out
the
Gospel
(
excuse
the
Bareness
of
the
Expression
,
it
may
run
better
in
Spanish
;
tho
'
,
if
I
remember
right
,
Erasmus
gives
it
in
Latin
much
the
same
Turn
)
which
should
thence
shine
out
like
that
lighted
Torch
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
the
Reason
,
that
wherever
you
see
the
Image
of
that
Saint
,
a
Dog
and
a
lighted
Torch
is
in
the
Group
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
me
at
the
same
time
,
that
there
had
been
more
Popes
and
Cardinals
of
that
Order
than
of
any
,
if
not
all
the
other
.
<EOS>
To
confirm
which
,
he
led
me
into
a
large
Gallery
,
on
each
Side
whereof
he
shew'd
me
<EOS>
the
Pictures
of
all
the
Popes
and
Cardinals
that
had
been
of
that
Order
;
among
which
,
I
particularly
took
Notice
of
that
of
Cardinal
Howard
,
great
Uncle
to
the
present
Duke
of
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
But
after
many
Encomiums
of
their
Society
,
with
which
he
interspers'd
his
Discourse
,
he
added
one
that
I
least
valu'd
<EOS>
it
for
<EOS>
;
That
the
sole
Care
and
Conduct
of
the
Inquisition
was
intrusted
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Finding
me
attentive
,
or
not
so
contradictory
as
the
English
Humour
generally
is
,
he
next
brought
me
into
a
fair
and
large
Cloister
,
round
which
I
took
several
Turns
with
him
;
and
,
indeed
,
The
Place
was
too
delicious
to
tire
,
under
a
Conversation
less
pertinent
or
courteous
than
that
<EOS>
he
entertain'd
me
with
.
<EOS>
In
the
Middle
of
the
Cloister
was
a
small
but
pretty
and
sweet
Grove
of
Orange
and
Lemon
-
trees
;
these
bore
Fruit
ripe
and
green
,
and
Flowers
,
all
together
on
one
Tree
;
and
their
Fruit
was
so
very
large
and
beautiful
,
and
their
Flowers
so
transcendently
odoriferous
,
that
all
I
had
ever
seen
of
the
like
Kind
in
England
could
comparatively
pass
only
for
Beauty
in
Epitome
,
or
Nature
imitated
in
Wax
-
work
.
<EOS>
Many
Flocks
also
of
pretty
little
Birds
,
with
their
chearful
Notes
,
added
not
a
little
to
my
Delight
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
in
Life
I
never
knew
or
found
three
of
my
Senses
at
once
so
exquisitely
gratify'd
.
  
<EOS>
Not
far
from
this
,
Saint
Vincent
,
the
Patron
,
as
I
said
before
,
of
this
City
,
has
a
Chapel
dedicated
to
him
.
<EOS>
Once
a
Year
they
do
him
Honour
in
a
sumptuous
Procession
.
<EOS>
Then
are
their
Streets
all
strow'd
with
Flowers
,
and
their
Houses
set
off
with
their
richest
Tapestries
,
every
one
strives
to
excel
his
Neighbour
in
distinguishing
himself
by
the
Honour
he
pays
to
that
Saint
;
and
he
is
the
best
Catholick
,
as
well
as
the
best
Citizen
,
in
the
Eye
of
the
religious
,
who
most
exerts
himself
on
this
Occasion
.
  
<EOS>
The
Procession
begins
with
a
Cavalcade
of
all
the
Friars
of
all
the
Convents
in
and
about
the
City
.
<EOS>
These
walk
two
and
two
with
folded
Arms
,
and
Eyes
cast
down
to
the
very
Ground
,
and
with
the
greatest
outward
Appearance
of
Humility
imaginable
;
nor
,
though
the
Temptation
from
the
fine
Women
that
fill'd
their
Windows
,
or
the
rich
Tapestries
that
adorn'd
the
Balconies
might
be
allow'd
sufficient
to
attract
<EOS>
,
could
I
observe
that
any
one
of
them
all
ever
mov'd
them
upwards
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
Friars
is
borne
,
upon
the
Shoulders
of
twenty
Men
at
least
,
an
Imagine
of
that
Saint
of
solid
Silver
,
large
as
the
Life
;
It
is
plac'd
in
a
great
Chair
of
Silver
likewise
;
the
Staves
that
bear
him
up
,
and
upon
which
they
bear
him
,
being
of
the
same
Metal
.
<EOS>
The
whole
is
a
most
costly
and
curious
Piece
of
Workmanship
,
such
as
my
Eyes
never
before
or
since
beheld
.
  
<EOS>
The
Magistrates
follow
the
Image
and
its
Supporters
,
dress'd
<EOS>
in
their
richest
Apparel
,
which
is
always
on
this
Day
,
and
on
this
Occasion
,
particularly
sumptuous
and
distinguishing
.
<EOS>
Thus
is
the
Image
,
in
the
greatest
Splendor
,
borne
and
accompany'd
round
that
fine
City
;
and
at
last
convey'd
to
the
Place
from
whence
it
came
:
And
so
concludes
that
annual
Ceremony
.
  
<EOS>
The
Valencians
,
as
to
the
Exteriors
of
Religion
,
are
the
most
devout
of
any
in
Spain
,
though
in
common
Life
you
find
them
amorous
,
gallant
,
and
gay
,
like
other
People
;
yet
on
solemn
Occasions
there
shines
out
-
<EOS>
right
such
a
Spirit
as
proves
them
the
very
Bigots
of
Bigotry
:
<EOS>
As
a
Proof
of
which
<EOS>
Assertion
,
I
will
now
give
some
Account
of
such
Observations
,
as
I
had
time
to
make
upon
them
,
during
two
Lent
Seasons
,
while
I
resided
there
.
  
<EOS>
The
Week
before
the
Lent
commences
,
commonly
known
by
the
Name
of
Carnaval
Time
,
the
whole
City
appears
a
perfect
Bartholomew
Fair
;
the
Streets
are
crouded
,
and
the
Houses
empty
;
nor
is
it
possible
to
pass
along
without
some
Gambol
or
Jack
-
pudding
Trick
offer'd
<EOS>
to
you
;
Ink
,
Water
,
and
sometimes
Ordure
,
are
sure
to
be
hurl'd
at
your
Face
or
Cloaths
;
and
if
you
appear
concern'd
or
angry
,
they
rejoyce
at
it
,
pleas'd
<EOS>
the
more
,
the
more
they
displease
;
for
all
other
Resentment
is
at
that
time
out
of
Season
,
though
at
other
times
few
in
the
World
are
fuller
of
Resentment
or
more
captious
.
  
<EOS>
The
younger
Gentry
,
or
Dons
,
to
express
their
Gallantry
,
carry
about
them
Egg
-
shells
,
fill'd
with
Orange
or
other
sweet
Water
,
which
they
cast
at
Ladies
in
their
Coaches
,
or
such
other
of
the
fair
Sex
as
they
happen
to
meet
in
the
Streets
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
all
,
if
you
would
think
them
extravagant
to
Day
,
as
much
transgressing
the
Rules
of
common
Civility
,
and
neither
regarding
Decency
to
one
another
,
nor
the
Duty
they
owe
to
Almighty
God
;
yet
when
Ash
-
Wednesday
comes
you
will
imagine
them
more
unaccountable
in
their
Conduct
,
being
then
as
much
too
excessive
in
all
outwards
Indications
of
Humility
and
Repentance
.
<EOS>
Here
you
shall
meet
one
,
bare
-
footed
,
with
a
Cross
on
his
Shoulder
,
a
Burden
rather
fit
for
somewhat
with
four
Feet
,
and
which
<EOS>
his
poor
Two
are
ready
to
sink
under
,
yet
the
vain
Wretch
bears
and
sweats
,
and
sweats
and
bears
,
in
hope
of
finding
Merit
in
an
Ass
's
Labour
.
  
<EOS>
Others
you
shall
see
naked
to
their
Wastes
,
whipping
themselves
with
Scourges
made
for
the
Purpose
,
till
the
Blood
follows
every
Stroke
;
and
no
Man
need
be
at
a
Loss
to
follow
them
by
the
very
Tracks
of
Gore
they
shed
in
this
frentick
Perambulation
.
<EOS>
Some
,
who
from
the
Thickness
of
their
Hides
,
or
other
Impediments
,
have
not
Power
by
their
Scourgings
to
fetch
Blood
of
themselves
,
are
follow'd
by
Surgeons
with
their
Lancets
,
who
at
every
Turn
,
make
use
of
them
,
to
evince
the
Extent
of
their
Patience
and
Zeal
by
the
Smart
of
their
Folly
.
<EOS>
While
others
,
mingling
Amour
with
Devotion
,
take
particular
Care
to
present
themselves
all
macerated
before
the
Windows
of
their
Mistresses
;
and
even
in
that
Condition
,
not
satisfy'd
with
what
they
have
barbarously
done
to
themselves
,
they
have
their
Operators
at
hand
,
to
evince
their
Love
by
the
Number
of
their
Gashes
and
Wounds
;
imagining
the
more
Blood
they
lose
,
the
more
Love
they
shew
,
and
the
more
they
shall
gain
.
<EOS>
These
are
generally
Devoto
's
of
Quality
;
though
the
Tenet
is
universal
,
that
he
that
is
most
bloody
is
most
devout
.
  
<EOS>
After
these
Street
-
Exercises
,
these
ostentatious
Castigations
are
over
,
these
Self
-
sacrificers
repair
to
the
great
Church
,
the
bloodier
the
better
;
there
they
throw
themselves
,
in
a
Condition
too
vile
for
the
Eye
of
a
Female
,
before
the
Image
of
the
Virgin
Mary
;
though
I
defy
all
their
Race
of
Fathers
,
and
their
infallible
holy
Father
into
the
Bargain
,
to
produce
any
Authority
to
fit
it
for
Belief
,
that
she
ever
delighted
in
such
sanguinary
Holocausts
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
whole
Time
of
Lent
,
you
will
see
in
every
Street
some
Priest
or
Frier
,
upon
some
Stall
or
Stool
,
preaching
up
Repentance
to
the
People
;
and
with
violent
Blows
on
his
Breast
crying
aloud
,
Mia
Culpa
,
mia
maxima
Culpa
,
till
he
extract
reciprocal
Returns
from
the
Hands
of
his
Auditors
on
their
own
Breasts
.
  
<EOS>
When
Good
Friday
is
come
they
entertain
it
with
the
most
profound
Show
of
Reverence
and
Religion
,
both
in
their
Streets
and
in
their
Churches
.
<EOS>
In
the
last
,
particularly
,
they
have
contriv'd
<EOS>
about
twelve
a
-
Clock
suddenly
to
darken
them
,
so
as
to
render
them
quite
gloomy
.
<EOS>
This
they
do
to
intimate
the
Eclipse
of
the
Sun
,
<EOS>
which
at
that
time
happen'd
.
<EOS>
And
to
signify
the
Rending
of
the
Vail
of
the
Temple
,
you
are
struck
with
a
strange
artificial
Noise
at
the
very
same
Instant
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
Easter
Day
appears
,
you
find
it
in
all
Respects
with
them
a
Day
of
Rejoicing
;
for
though
Abstinence
from
Flesh
with
them
,
who
at
no
time
eat
much
,
is
not
so
great
a
Mortification
as
with
those
of
the
same
Persuasion
in
other
Countries
,
who
eat
much
more
,
yet
there
is
a
visible
Satisfaction
darts
out
at
their
Eyes
,
which
demonstrates
their
inward
Pleasure
in
being
set
free
from
the
Confinement
of
Mind
to
the
Dissatisfaction
of
the
Body
.
<EOS>
Every
Person
you
now
meet
greets
you
with
a
Resurrexit
Jesus
;
a
good
Imitation
of
the
primitive
Christians
,
were
it
the
real
Effect
of
Devotion
.
<EOS>
And
all
Sorts
of
the
best
Musick
(
which
here
indeed
is
the
best
in
all
Spain
)
proclaim
an
auspicious
Valediction
to
the
departed
Season
of
superficial
Sorrow
and
stupid
Superstition
.
<EOS>
But
enough
of
this
:
I
proceed
to
weightier
Matters
.
  
<EOS>
While
we
lay
at
Valencia
,
under
the
Vigilance
and
Care
of
the
indefatigable
Earl
,
News
was
brought
that
Alicant
was
besieg'd
by
General
Gorge
by
Land
,
while
a
Squadron
of
Men
of
War
batter'd
it
from
the
Sea
;
from
both
which
<EOS>
the
Besiegers
play'd
<EOS>
their
Parts
so
well
,
and
so
warmly
ply'd
them
with
their
Cannon
,
that
an
indifferent
practicable
Breach
was
made
in
a
little
time
.
  
<EOS>
Mahoni
commanded
in
the
Place
,
being
again
receiv'd
<EOS>
into
Favour
;
and
clear'd
as
he
was
of
those
political
Insinuations
before
intimated
,
he
now
seem'd
resolv'd
to
confirm
his
Innocence
by
a
resolute
Defence
.
<EOS>
However
,
perceiving
that
all
Preparations
tended
towards
a
Storm
,
and
knowing
full
well
the
Weakness
of
the
Town
,
he
withdrew
his
Garrison
into
the
Castle
,
leaving
the
Town
to
the
Defence
of
its
own
Inhabitants
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
that
was
doing
,
the
Sailors
,
not
much
skill'd
in
Sieges
,
nor
at
all
times
capable
of
the
coolest
Consideration
,
with
a
Resolution
natural
to
them
,
storm'd
<EOS>
the
Walls
to
the
Side
of
the
Sea
;
where
not
meeting
with
much
Opposition
(
for
the
People
of
the
Town
apprehended
the
least
Danger
there
)
<EOS>
they
soon
got
into
the
Place
;
and
,
as
soon
as
got
in
,
began
to
Plunder
.
<EOS>
This
oblig'd
<EOS>
the
People
,
for
the
better
Security
of
themselves
,
to
open
their
Gates
,
and
seek
a
Refuge
under
one
Enemy
,
in
opposition
to
the
Rage
of
another
.
  
<EOS>
General
Gorge
,
as
soon
as
he
enter'd
<EOS>
the
Town
,
with
a
good
deal
of
seeming
Lenity
,
put
a
stop
to
the
Ravages
of
the
Sailors
;
and
ordered
Proclamation
to
be
made
throughout
the
Place
,
that
all
the
Inhabitants
should
immediately
bring
in
their
best
Effects
into
the
great
Church
for
their
better
Security
.
<EOS>
This
was
by
the
mistaken
Populace
,
as
readily
comply'd
with
;
and
neither
Friend
nor
Foe
at
all
disputing
the
Command
,
or
questioning
the
Integrity
of
the
Intention
;
the
Church
was
presently
crouded
with
Riches
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
.
<EOS>
Yet
after
some
time
remaining
there
,
they
were
all
taken
out
,
and
disposed
of
by
those
,
that
had
as
little
Property
in
'em
,
as
the
Sailors
,
they
were
pretended
to
be
preserv'd
from
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Peterborow
upon
the
very
first
News
of
the
Siege
had
left
Valencia
,
and
taken
Shipping
for
Alicant
;
where
he
arrived
soon
after
the
Surrender
of
the
Town
,
and
that
Outcry
of
the
Goods
of
the
Townsmen
.
<EOS>
Upon
his
Arrival
,
Mahoni
,
who
was
block'd
up
in
the
Castle
,
and
had
experienced
his
indefatigable
Diligence
,
being
in
want
of
Provisions
,
and
without
much
hope
of
Relief
,
desired
to
capitulate
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
granted
him
honourable
Conditions
,
upon
which
he
delivered
up
the
Castle
,
and
Gorge
was
made
Governor
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
his
Lordship
's
taking
Ship
at
Valencia
,
I
had
an
Opportunity
of
marching
with
those
Dragoons
,
which
escorted
him
from
Castile
,
who
had
received
Orders
to
march
into
Murcia
.
<EOS>
We
quarter'd
<EOS>
the
first
Night
at
Alcira
,
a
Town
that
the
River
Segra
almost
surrounds
,
which
renders
it
capable
of
being
made
a
Place
of
vast
Strength
,
though
now
of
small
Importance
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
Night
we
lay
at
Xativa
,
a
Place
famous
for
its
steadiness
to
King
Charles
.
<EOS>
General
Basset
,
a
Spaniard
,
being
Governor
<EOS>
;
it
was
besieg'd
by
the
Forces
of
King
Philip
;
but
after
a
noble
Resistance
,
the
Enemy
were
beat
off
,
and
the
Siege
raised
;
for
which
Effort
,
it
is
supposed
,
that
on
the
Retirement
of
King
Charles
out
of
this
Country
,
it
was
depriv'd
of
its
old
Name
Xativa
,
and
is
now
called
San
Felippo
;
though
to
this
day
the
People
thereabouts
much
dissallow
by
their
Practice
,
that
novel
Denomination
.
  
<EOS>
We
march'd
<EOS>
next
Morning
by
Monteza
;
which
gives
Name
to
the
famous
Title
of
Knights
of
Monteza
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
the
Time
that
Colonel
O
Guaza
,
an
Irish
-
man
,
was
Governor
,
besieg'd
by
the
People
of
the
Country
,
in
favour
of
King
Charles
;
but
very
ineffectually
,
so
it
never
chang'd
its
Sovereign
.
<EOS>
That
Night
we
quarter'd
<EOS>
at
Fonte
dalas
Figuras
,
within
one
League
of
Almanza
;
where
that
fatal
and
unfortunate
Battle
,
which
I
shall
give
an
Account
of
in
its
Place
,
was
fought
the
Year
after
,
under
the
Lord
Galway
.
  
<EOS>
On
our
fourth
days
March
we
were
oblig'd
to
pass
Villena
,
where
the
Enemy
had
a
Garrison
.
<EOS>
A
Party
of
Mahoni
's
Dragoons
made
a
part
of
that
Garrison
,
and
they
were
commanded
by
Major
O.
Rairk
an
Irish
Officer
,
who
always
carried
the
Reputation
of
a
good
Soldier
,
and
a
brave
Gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
all
along
made
it
my
Observation
,
that
Captain
Matthews
,
who
commanded
those
Dragoons
,
that
I
<EOS>
march'd
with
,
was
a
Person
of
much
more
Courage
than
Conduct
;
and
he
us'd
as
little
Precaution
here
,
though
just
marching
under
the
Eye
of
the
Enemy
,
as
he
had
done
at
other
Times
.
<EOS>
As
I
was
become
intimately
acquainted
with
him
,
I
rode
up
to
him
,
and
told
him
the
Danger
,
which
,
in
my
Opinion
,
attended
our
present
March
.
<EOS>
I
pointed
out
to
him
just
before
Villena
a
jutting
Hill
,
under
which
we
must
unavoidably
pass
;
at
the
turning
whereof
,
I
was
apprehensive
<EOS>
the
Enemy
might
he
,
and
either
by
Ambuscade
or
otherwise
,
surprize
us
;
I
therefore
intreated
we
might
either
wait
the
coming
of
our
Rear
Guard
;
or
at
least
march
with
a
little
more
leisure
and
caution
.
<EOS>
But
he
taking
little
notice
of
all
I
said
,
kept
on
his
round
March
;
seeing
which
<EOS>
,
I
press'd
forward
my
Mule
,
which
was
a
very
good
one
,
and
rid
as
fast
as
her
Legs
could
carry
her
,
till
I
had
got
on
the
top
of
the
Hill
.
<EOS>
When
I
came
there
,
I
found
both
my
Expectation
,
and
my
Apprehensions
answered
:
For
I
could
very
plainly
discern
three
Squadrons
of
the
Enemy
<EOS>
ready
drawn
up
,
and
waiting
for
Us
at
the
very
winding
of
the
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
Hereupon
I
hastened
back
to
the
Captain
with
the
like
Speed
,
and
told
him
the
Discovery
I
had
made
;
who
nevertheless
kept
on
his
March
,
and
it
was
with
a
good
deal
of
Difficulty
,
that
I
at
last
prevail'd
on
him
to
halt
,
till
our
Rear
Guard
of
twenty
Men
had
got
up
to
us
.
<EOS>
But
those
joining
us
,
and
a
new
Troop
of
Spanish
Dragoons
,
who
had
march'd
towards
us
that
Morning
,
appearing
in
Sight
;
our
Captain
,
as
if
he
was
afraid
of
their
rivalling
him
in
his
Glory
,
at
the
very
turn
of
the
Hill
,
rode
in
a
full
Gallop
,
with
Sword
in
Hand
,
up
to
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
They
stood
their
Ground
,
till
we
were
advanc'd
<EOS>
within
two
hundred
Yards
of
them
,
and
then
in
Confusion
endeavoured
to
retire
into
the
Town
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
obliged
to
pass
over
a
small
Bridge
,
too
small
to
admit
of
such
a
Company
in
so
much
haste
;
their
crouding
upon
which
obstructed
their
Retreat
,
and
left
all
that
could
not
get
over
,
to
the
Mercy
of
our
Swords
,
which
spar'd
none
.
<EOS>
However
narrow
as
the
Bridge
was
,
Captain
Matthews
was
resolved
to
venture
over
after
the
Enemy
;
on
doing
which
,
the
Enemy
made
a
halt
,
till
the
People
of
the
Town
,
and
the
very
Priests
came
out
to
their
Relief
with
fire
Arms
.
<EOS>
On
so
large
an
Appearance
,
Captain
Matthews
thought
it
not
adviseable
to
make
any
further
Advances
;
so
driving
a
very
great
flock
of
Sheep
from
under
the
Walls
,
he
continued
his
March
towards
Elda
.
<EOS>
In
this
Action
we
lost
Captain
Topham
,
and
three
Dragoons
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
we
were
not
marched
very
far
from
the
Place
,
where
this
Rencounter
happen'd
;
when
an
Irish
Dragoon
overtook
the
Captain
,
with
a
civil
Message
from
Major
O
Rairk
,
desiring
that
he
would
not
entertain
a
mean
Opinion
of
him
for
the
Defence
that
was
made
;
since
could
he
have
got
the
Spaniards
to
have
stood
their
Ground
,
he
should
have
given
him
good
Reason
for
a
better
.
<EOS>
The
Captain
return'd
a
complimental
Answer
,
and
so
march'd
on
.
<EOS>
This
Major
O
Rairk
,
or
O
Roork
,
was
the
next
Year
killed
at
Alkay
,
being
much
lamented
,
for
he
was
esteemed
both
for
his
Courage
and
Conduct
,
one
of
the
best
of
the
Irish
Officers
in
the
Spanish
Service
.
<EOS>
I
was
likewise
informed
that
he
was
descended
from
one
of
the
ancient
Kings
of
Ireland
;
the
Mother
of
the
honourable
Colonel
Paget
,
one
of
the
Grooms
of
the
Bedchamber
to
his
present
Majesty
,
was
nearly
related
to
this
Gallant
Gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
One
remarkable
Thing
I
saw
in
that
Action
,
which
affected
and
surprised
me
;
A
Scotch
Dragoon
,
of
but
a
moderate
Size
,
with
his
large
basket
-
hilted
Sword
,
struck
off
a
Spaniard
's
Head
at
one
stroke
,
with
the
same
ease
,
in
appearance
,
as
a
Man
would
do
that
of
a
Poppy
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
came
to
Elda
(
a
Town
much
in
the
Interest
of
King
Charles
,
and
famous
for
its
fine
Situation
,
and
the
largest
Grapes
in
Spain
)
<EOS>
the
Inhabitants
received
us
in
a
manner
as
handsome
as
it
was
peculiar
;
all
standing
at
their
Doors
with
lighted
Torches
;
which
considering
the
Time
we
enter'd
was
far
from
an
unwelcome
or
disagreeable
Sight
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
Day
several
requested
to
be
the
Messengers
of
the
Action
at
Villena
to
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
at
Alicant
;
but
the
Captain
return'd
<EOS>
this
Answer
to
all
,
that
in
consideration
of
the
Share
that
I
might
justly
claim
in
that
Day
's
Transactions
,
he
could
not
think
of
letting
any
other
Person
be
the
Bearer
.
<EOS>
So
giving
me
his
Letters
to
the
Earl
,
I
the
next
Day
deliver'd
<EOS>
them
to
him
at
Alicant
.
<EOS>
At
the
Delivery
,
Colonel
Killigrew
(
whose
Dragoons
they
were
)
being
present
,
he
expressed
a
deal
of
Satisfaction
at
the
Account
,
and
his
Lordship
was
pleased
at
the
same
time
to
appoint
me
sole
Engineer
of
the
Castle
of
Alicant
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
which
,
that
successful
General
embark'd
<EOS>
for
Genoa
,
according
to
the
Resolutions
of
the
Council
of
War
at
Guadalaxara
,
on
a
particular
Commission
from
the
Queen
of
England
,
another
from
Charles
King
of
Spain
,
and
charged
at
the
same
time
with
a
Request
of
the
Marquiss
das
Minas
,
General
of
the
Portugueze
Forces
,
to
negotiate
Bills
for
one
hundred
thousand
Pounds
for
the
use
of
his
Troops
.
<EOS>
In
all
which
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
was
(
as
ever
)
successful
;
yet
may
it
be
said
without
a
figure
,
that
his
Departure
,
in
a
good
measure
,
determin'd
<EOS>
the
Success
of
the
confederate
Forces
in
that
Kingdom
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
the
General
return'd
<EOS>
again
with
the
fortunate
,
Fruits
of
those
Negotiations
;
but
never
to
act
in
his
old
auspicious
Sphere
:
And
therefore
,
as
I
am
now
to
take
leave
of
this
fortunate
General
,
let
me
do
it
with
Justice
,
in
an
Appeal
to
the
World
,
of
the
not
to
be
parallel'd
Usage
(
in
these
latter
Ages
,
at
least
)
that
he
met
with
for
all
his
Services
;
such
a
vast
variety
of
Enterprizes
,
all
successful
,
and
which
had
set
all
Europe
in
amaze
;
Services
that
had
given
occasion
to
such
solemn
and
public
Thanksgivings
in
our
Churches
,
and
which
had
received
such
very
remarkable
Approbations
,
both
of
Sovereign
and
Parliament
;
and
which
had
been
represented
in
so
lively
a
Manner
,
in
a
Letter
wrote
by
the
King
of
Spain
,
under
his
own
Hand
,
to
the
Queen
of
England
,
and
communicated
to
both
Houses
in
the
Terms
following
:
  
Madam
,
my
Sister
,
  
I
should
not
have
been
so
long
<EOS>
e'er
<EOS>
I
did
my
self
<EOS>
the
Honour
to
repeat
the
Assurances
of
my
sincere
Respects
to
you
,
had
I
not
waited
for
the
good
Occasion
which
I
now
acquaint
you
with
,
that
the
City
of
Barcelona
is
surrendered
to
me
by
Capitulation
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
you
will
receive
this
great
News
with
intire
Satisfaction
,
as
well
,
because
this
happy
Success
is
the
Effect
of
your
Arms
,
always
glorious
,
as
from
the
pure
Motives
of
that
Bounty
and
maternal
Affection
<EOS>
you
have
for
me
,
and
for
every
Thing
which
may
contribute
to
the
Advancement
of
my
Interest
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
do
this
Justice
to
all
the
Officers
and
common
Soldiers
,
and
particularly
to
my
Lord
Peterborow
,
that
he
has
shown
in
this
whole
Expedition
,
a
Constancy
,
Bravery
,
and
Conduct
,
worthy
of
the
Choice
that
your
Majesty
has
made
of
him
,
and
that
he
could
no
ways
give
me
better
Satisfaction
than
he
has
,
by
the
great
Zeal
and
Application
,
which
he
has
equally
testified
for
my
Interest
,
and
for
the
Service
of
my
Person
.
<EOS>
I
owe
the
same
Justice
to
Brigadier
Stanhope
,
for
his
great
Zeal
,
Vigilance
,
and
very
wise
Conduct
,
which
he
has
given
Proofs
of
upon
all
Occasions
:
<EOS>
As
also
to
all
your
Officers
of
the
Fleet
,
particularly
to
your
worthy
Admiral
Shovel
,
assuring
your
Majesty
,
that
he
has
assisted
me
in
this
Expedition
,
with
an
inconceivable
Readiness
and
Application
,
and
that
no
Admiral
will
be
ever
better
able
to
render
me
greater
Satisfaction
,
than
he
has
done
.
<EOS>
During
the
Siege
of
Barcelona
,
some
of
your
Majesty
's
Ships
,
with
the
Assistance
of
the
Troops
of
the
Country
,
have
reduc'd
<EOS>
the
Town
of
Tarragona
,
and
the
officers
are
made
Prisoners
of
War
.
<EOS>
The
Town
of
Girone
has
been
taken
at
the
same
time
by
Surprize
,
by
the
Troops
of
the
Country
.
<EOS>
The
Town
of
Lerida
has
submitted
,
as
also
that
of
Tortosa
upon
the
Ebro
;
so
that
we
have
taken
all
the
Places
of
Catalonia
,
except
Roses
.
<EOS>
Some
Places
in
Aragon
near
Sarrogosa
have
declared
for
me
,
and
the
Garrison
of
the
Castle
of
Denia
in
Valencia
have
maintained
their
Post
,
and
repulsed
the
Enemy
;
400
of
the
Enemies
Cavalry
have
enter'd
into
our
Service
,
and
a
great
number
of
their
Infantry
have
deserted
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
Madam
,
is
the
State
that
your
Arms
,
and
the
Inclination
of
the
People
have
put
my
Affairs
in
.
<EOS>
It
is
unnecessary
to
tell
you
what
stops
the
Course
of
these
Conquests
,
it
is
not
the
Season
of
the
Year
,
nor
the
Enemy
;
these
are
no
Obstacles
to
your
Troops
,
who
desire
nothing
more
than
to
act
under
the
Conduct
that
your
Majesty
has
appointed
them
.
<EOS>
The
taking
of
Barcelona
,
with
so
small
a
Number
of
Troops
,
is
very
remarkable
;
and
what
has
been
done
in
this
Siege
is
almost
without
Example
;
that
with
seven
or
eight
thousand
Men
of
your
Troops
,
and
two
hundred
Miquelets
,
we
should
surround
and
invest
a
Place
,
that
thirty
thousand
French
could
not
block
up
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
March
of
thirteen
Hours
,
the
Troops
climb'd
up
the
Rocks
and
Precipices
,
to
attack
a
Fortification
stronger
than
the
Place
,
which
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
has
sent
you
a
Plan
of
;
two
Generals
,
with
the
Grenadiers
,
attack'd
<EOS>
it
Sword
in
Hand
.
<EOS>
In
which
Action
the
Prince
of
Hesse
died
gloriously
,
after
so
many
brave
Actions
:
I
hope
his
Brother
and
his
Family
will
always
have
your
Majesty
's
Protection
.
<EOS>
With
eight
hundred
Men
they
forc'd
the
cover'd
Way
,
and
all
the
Intrenchments
and
Works
,
one
after
another
,
till
they
came
to
the
last
Work
which
surrounded
it
,
against
five
hundred
Men
of
regular
Troops
which
defended
the
Place
,
and
a
Reinforcement
they
had
receiv'd
;
and
three
Days
afterwards
we
became
Masters
of
the
Place
.
<EOS>
We
afterwards
attack'd
<EOS>
the
Town
on
the
Side
of
the
Castle
.
<EOS>
We
landed
again
our
Cannon
,
and
the
other
Artillery
,
with
inconceivable
Trouble
,
and
form'd
two
Camps
,
distant
from
each
other
three
Leagues
,
against
a
Garrison
almost
as
numerous
as
our
Army
,
whose
Cavalry
was
double
the
Strength
of
ours
.
<EOS>
The
first
Camp
was
so
well
intrench'd
,
<EOS>
that
'
twas
defended
by
two
thousand
Men
and
the
Dragoons
;
whilst
we
attack'd
the
Town
with
the
rest
of
our
Troops
.
<EOS>
The
Breach
being
made
,
we
prepar'd
to
make
a
general
Assault
with
all
the
Army
.
<EOS>
These
are
Circumstances
,
Madam
,
which
distinguish
this
Action
,
perhaps
,
from
all
others
.
  
<EOS>
Here
has
happen'd
an
unforeseen
Accident
.
<EOS>
The
Cruelty
of
the
pretended
Viceroy
,
and
the
Report
spread
abroad
,
that
he
would
take
away
the
Prisoners
,
contrary
to
the
Capitulation
,
provok'd
<EOS>
the
Burghers
,
and
some
of
the
Country
People
,
to
take
up
Arms
against
the
Garrison
,
whilst
they
were
busy
in
packing
up
their
Baggage
,
which
was
to
be
sent
away
the
next
Day
;
so
that
every
thing
tended
to
Slaughter
:
But
your
Majesty
's
Troops
,
entering
into
Town
with
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
instead
of
seeking
Pillage
,
a
Practice
common
upon
such
Occasions
,
appeas'd
the
Tumult
,
and
have
say'd
the
Town
,
and
even
the
Lives
of
their
Enemies
,
with
a
Discipline
and
Generosity
without
Example
.
  
<EOS>
What
remains
is
,
that
I
return
you
my
most
hearty
Thanks
for
sending
so
great
<EOS>
a
Fleet
,
and
such
good
and
valiant
Troops
to
my
Assistance
.
<EOS>
After
so
happy
a
Beginning
,
I
have
thought
it
proper
,
according
to
the
Sentiments
of
your
Generals
and
Admirals
,
to
support
,
by
my
Presence
,
the
Conquests
that
we
have
made
;
and
to
shew
my
Subjects
,
so
affectionate
to
my
Person
,
that
I
can
not
abandon
them
.
<EOS>
I
receive
such
succours
from
your
Majesty
,
and
from
your
generous
Nation
,
that
I
am
loaded
with
your
Bounties
;
and
am
not
a
little
concern'd
to
think
that
the
Support
of
my
Interest
should
cause
so
great
an
Expence
.
<EOS>
But
,
Madam
,
I
sacrifice
my
Person
,
and
my
Subjects
in
Catalonia
expose
also
their
Lives
and
Fortunes
,
upon
the
Assurances
they
have
of
your
Majesty
's
generous
Protection
.
<EOS>
Your
Majesty
and
your
Council
knows
better
than
we
do
,
what
is
necessary
for
our
Conservation
.
<EOS>
We
shall
then
expect
your
Majesty
's
Succours
,
with
an
entire
Confidence
in
your
Bounty
and
Wisdom
.
<EOS>
A
further
Force
is
necessary
:
We
give
no
small
Diversion
to
France
,
and
without
doubt
they
will
make
their
utmost
Efforts
against
me
as
soon
as
possible
;
but
I
am
satisfy'd
,
that
the
same
Efforts
will
be
made
by
my
Allies
to
defend
me
.
<EOS>
Your
Goodness
,
Madam
,
inclines
you
,
and
your
Power
enables
you
,
to
support
those
that
the
Tyranny
of
France
would
oppress
.
<EOS>
All
that
I
can
insinuate
to
your
Wisdom
,
and
that
of
your
Allies
,
is
,
that
the
Forces
employ'd
<EOS>
in
this
Country
will
not
be
unprofitable
to
the
public
Good
,
but
will
be
under
an
Obligation
and
Necessity
to
act
with
the
utmost
Vigour
against
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
  
With
an
inviolable
Affection
,
Respect
,
and
most
Sincere
Acknowledgment
,
Madam
,
my
Sister
,
Your
most
affectionate
Brother
,
CHARLES
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
after
all
,
was
this
noble
General
<EOS>
not
only
recall'd
,
the
Command
of
the
Fleet
taken
from
him
,
and
that
of
the
Army
given
to
my
Lord
Galway
,
without
Assignment
of
Cause
;
but
all
Manner
of
Falsities
were
industriously
spread
abroad
,
not
only
to
dimish
,
if
they
could
,
his
Reputation
,
but
to
bring
him
under
Accusations
of
a
malevolent
Nature
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
imagine
it
necessary
here
to
take
Notice
,
that
afterward
he
disprov'd
all
those
idle
Calumnies
and
ill
-
invented
Rumours
;
or
to
mention
what
Compliments
he
receiv'd
,
in
the
most
solemn
Manner
,
from
his
Country
,
upon
a
full
Examination
and
thorough
canvassing
of
his
Actions
in
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
too
notorious
to
be
omitted
,
That
all
Officers
coming
from
Spain
were
purposely
intercepted
in
their
Way
to
London
,
and
craftily
examin'd
upon
all
the
idle
Stories
which
had
pass'd
tending
to
lessen
his
Character
:
<EOS>
And
when
any
Officers
had
asserted
the
Falsity
of
those
Inventions
(
as
they
all
did
,
except
a
military
Sweetner
or
two
)
and
that
there
was
no
Possibility
of
laying
any
thing
amiss
to
the
Charge
of
that
General
 
<EOS>
they
were
told
,
that
they
ought
to
be
careful
however
,
not
to
speak
advantagiously
of
that
Lord
's
Conduct
,
unless
they
were
willing
to
fall
Martyrs
in
his
Cause
 
<EOS>
A
Thing
scarce
to
be
credited
even
in
a
popish
Country
.
<EOS>
But
Scipio
was
accus'd
 
tho
'
(
as
my
Author
finely
observes
)
by
Wretches
only
known
to
Posterity
by
that
stupid
Accusation
.
  
<EOS>
As
a
mournful
Valediction
,
before
I
enter
upon
any
new
Scene
,
the
Reader
will
pardon
this
melancholy
Expostulation
.
<EOS>
How
mortifying
must
it
be
to
an
Englishman
,
after
he
has
found
himself
solac'd
<EOS>
with
a
Relation
of
so
many
surprising
Successes
of
her
Majesty
's
Arms
,
under
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
;
Successes
that
have
lay'd
before
our
Eyes
Provinces
and
Kingdoms
reduc'd
,
and
Towns
and
Fortresses
taken
and
reliev'd
;
where
we
have
seen
a
continu'd
Series
of
happy
Events
,
the
Fruits
of
Conduct
and
Vigilance
;
and
Caution
and
Foresight
preventing
Dangers
that
were
held
,
at
first
View
,
certain
and
unsurmountable
:
to
change
this
glorious
Landskip
,
I
say
,
for
Scenes
every
way
different
,
even
while
our
Troops
were
as
numerous
as
the
Enemy
,
and
better
provided
,
yet
always
baffled
and
beaten
,
and
flying
before
the
Enemy
till
fatally
ruin'd
in
the
Battle
of
Almanza
<EOS>
:
How
mortifying
must
this
be
to
any
Lover
of
his
Country
!
<EOS>
But
I
proceed
to
my
Memoirs
.
  
<EOS>
ALICANT
is
a
Town
of
the
greatest
Trade
of
any
in
the
Kingdom
of
Valencia
,
having
a
strong
Castle
,
being
situated
on
a
high
Hill
,
which
commands
both
Town
and
Harbour
.
<EOS>
In
this
Place
I
resided
a
whole
Year
;
but
it
was
soon
after
my
first
Arrival
,
that
Major
Collier
(
who
was
shot
in
the
Back
at
Barcelona
,
as
I
have
related
in
the
Siege
of
that
Place
)
hearing
of
me
,
sought
me
out
at
my
Quarters
;
and
,
after
a
particular
Enquiry
into
the
Success
of
that
difficult
Task
that
he
left
me
upon
,
and
my
answering
all
his
Questions
to
satisfaction
(
all
which
he
receiv'd
with
evident
Pleasure
)
<EOS>
he
threw
down
a
Purse
of
Pistoles
upon
the
Table
;
which
I
refusing
,
he
told
me
,
in
a
most
handsome
Manner
,
his
Friendship
was
not
to
be
preserved
but
by
my
accepting
it
.
  
<EOS>
After
I
had
made
some
very
necessary
Repairs
,
I
pursu'd
<EOS>
the
Orders
I
had
receiv'd
from
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
,
to
go
upon
the
erecting
a
new
Battery
between
the
Castle
and
the
Town
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
Task
attended
with
Difficulties
,
neither
few
in
Number
,
nor
small
in
Consequence
;
for
it
was
to
be
rais'd
upon
a
great
Declivity
,
which
must
render
the
Work
both
laborious
and
precarious
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
had
the
good
Fortune
to
effect
it
much
sooner
than
was
expected
;
and
it
was
call'd
<EOS>
Gorge
's
Battery
,
from
the
Name
of
the
Governor
then
commanding
;
who
,
out
of
an
uncommon
Profusion
of
Generosity
,
wetted
that
Piece
of
Gossiping
with
a
distinguishing
Bowl
of
Punch
.
<EOS>
Brigadier
Bougard
,
when
he
saw
this
Work
some
time
after
,
was
pleas'd
to
honour
it
with
a
singular
Admiration
and
Approbation
,
for
its
Compleatness
,
notwithstanding
its
Difficulties
.
  
<EOS>
This
Work
,
and
the
Siege
of
Cartagena
,
then
in
our
Possession
,
by
the
Duke
of
Berwick
,
brought
the
Lord
Galway
down
to
this
place
.
<EOS>
Cartagena
is
of
so
little
Distance
from
Alicant
,
that
we
could
easily
hear
the
Cannon
playing
against
,
and
from
it
,
in
our
Castle
,
where
I
then
was
.
<EOS>
And
I
remember
my
Lord
Galway
,
on
the
fourth
Day
of
the
Siege
,
sending
to
know
if
I
could
make
any
useful
Observations
,
as
to
the
Success
of
it
;
I
return'd
,
that
I
was
of
Opinion
the
Town
was
surrender'd
,
from
the
sudden
Cessation
of
the
Cannon
,
which
,
by
our
News
next
Day
from
the
Place
,
prov'd
to
be
fact
.
<EOS>
Cartagena
is
a
small
Sea
-
Port
Town
in
Murcia
;
but
has
so
good
an
Harbour
,
that
when
the
famous
Admiral
Doria
was
ask'd
,
which
were
the
three
best
Havens
in
the
Mediterranean
,
he
readily
return'd
,
June
,
July
,
and
Cartagena
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
the
Surrender
of
this
Place
,
a
Detachment
of
Foot
was
sent
by
the
Governor
,
with
some
Dragoons
,
to
Elsha
;
but
it
being
a
Place
of
very
little
Strength
they
were
soon
made
Prisoners
of
War
.
  
<EOS>
The
Siege
of
Cartagena
being
over
,
the
Lord
Galway
return'd
to
his
Camp
;
and
the
Lord
Duncannon
dying
in
Alicant
,
the
first
Guns
that
were
fir'd
from
Gorge
's
Battery
,
were
the
Minute
-
Guns
for
his
Funeral
.
<EOS>
His
Regiment
had
been
given
to
the
Lord
Montandre
,
who
lost
it
before
he
had
Possession
,
by
an
Action
as
odd
as
it
was
scandalous
.
  
<EOS>
That
Regiment
had
received
Orders
to
march
to
the
Lord
Galway
's
Camp
,
under
the
Command
of
their
Lieutenant
-
Colonel
Bateman
,
a
Person
before
reputedly
a
good
Officer
,
tho
'
<EOS>
his
Conduct
here
gave
People
,
not
invidious
,
too
much
Reason
to
call
it
in
Question
.
<EOS>
On
his
March
,
he
was
so
very
careless
and
negligent
(
though
he
knew
himself
in
a
Country
surrounded
with
Enemies
,
and
that
he
was
to
march
through
a
Wood
,
where
they
every
Day
made
their
Appearance
in
great
Numbers
)
that
his
Soldiers
march'd
with
their
Muskets
slung
at
their
Backs
,
and
went
one
after
another
(
as
necessity
had
forc'd
us
to
do
in
Scotland
)
<EOS>
himself
at
the
Head
of
'em
,
in
his
Chaise
,
riding
a
considerable
way
before
.
  
<EOS>
It
happened
there
was
a
Captain
,
with
threescore
Dragoons
,
<EOS>
detach'd
<EOS>
from
the
Duke
of
Berwick
's
Army
,
with
a
Design
to
intercept
some
Cash
,
that
was
order'd
to
be
sent
to
Lord
Galway
's
Army
from
Alicant
.
<EOS>
This
Detachment
,
missing
of
that
intended
Prize
,
was
returning
very
disconsolately
,
Re
infecta
;
when
their
Captain
,
observing
that
careless
and
disorderly
March
of
the
English
,
resolv'd
,
boldly
enough
,
to
attack
them
in
the
Wood
.
<EOS>
To
that
Purpose
he
secreted
his
little
Party
behind
a
great
Barn
;
and
so
soon
as
they
were
half
passed
by
,
he
falls
upon
'em
in
the
Center
with
his
Dragoons
,
cutting
and
slashing
at
such
a
violent
Rate
,
that
he
soon
dispersed
the
whole
Regiment
,
leaving
many
dead
and
wounded
upon
the
Spot
.
<EOS>
The
three
Colours
were
taken
;
and
the
gallant
Lieutenant
-
Colonel
taken
out
of
his
Chaise
,
and
carried
away
Prisoner
with
many
others
;
only
one
Officer
who
was
an
Ensign
,
and
so
bold
as
to
do
his
Duty
,
was
kill'd
.
  
<EOS>
The
Lieutenant
who
commanded
the
Granadiers
,
received
the
Alarm
time
enough
to
draw
his
Men
into
a
House
in
their
way
;
where
he
bravely
defended
himself
for
a
long
Time
;
but
being
killed
,
the
rest
immediately
surrender'd
.
<EOS>
The
Account
of
this
Action
I
had
from
the
Commander
of
the
Enemy
's
Party
himself
,
some
Time
after
,
while
I
was
a
Prisoner
.
<EOS>
And
Captain
Mahoni
,
who
was
present
when
the
News
was
brought
,
that
a
few
Spanish
Dragoons
had
defeated
an
English
Regiment
,
which
was
this
under
Bateman
,
protested
to
me
,
that
the
Duke
of
Berwick
turn'd
pale
at
the
Relation
;
and
when
they
offer'd
to
bring
the
Colours
before
him
,
he
would
not
so
much
as
see
them
.
<EOS>
A
little
before
the
Duke
went
to
Supper
,
Bateman
himself
was
brought
to
him
,
but
the
Duke
turn'd
<EOS>
away
from
him
without
any
further
Notice
than
coldly
saying
,
that
he
thought
he
was
very
strangely
taken
.
<EOS>
The
Wags
of
the
Army
made
a
thorough
jest
of
him
,
and
said
his
military
Conduct
was
of
a
piece
with
his
Oeconomy
,
having
two
Days
before
this
March
,
sent
his
young
handsome
Wife
into
England
,
under
the
Guardship
of
the
young
Chaplain
of
the
Regiment
.
  
<EOS>
April
15
.
<EOS>
In
the
Year
1707
,
being
Easter
Monday
,
we
had
in
the
Morning
a
flying
Report
in
Alicant
,
that
there
had
been
the
Day
before
a
Battle
at
Almanza
,
between
the
Army
under
the
Command
of
the
Duke
of
Berwick
,
and
that
of
the
English
,
under
Lord
Galway
,
in
which
the
latter
had
suffer'd
<EOS>
an
entire
Defeat
.
<EOS>
We
at
first
gave
no
great
Credit
to
it
:
<EOS>
But
,
alas
,
we
were
too
soon
woefully
convinced
of
the
Truth
of
it
,
by
Numbers
that
came
flying
to
us
from
the
conquering
Enemy
.
<EOS>
Then
indeed
we
were
satisfied
of
Truths
,
too
difficult
before
to
be
credited
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
was
not
present
in
that
calamitous
Battle
,
I
shall
relate
it
,
as
I
received
it
from
an
Officer
then
in
the
Duke
's
Army
.
  
<EOS>
To
bring
the
Lord
Galway
to
a
Battle
,
in
a
Place
most
commodious
for
his
purpose
,
the
Duke
made
use
of
this
Stratagem
:
He
ordered
two
Irishmen
,
both
Officers
,
to
make
their
way
over
to
the
Enemy
as
Deserters
;
putting
this
Story
in
their
Mouths
,
that
the
Duke
of
Orleans
was
in
a
full
March
to
join
the
Duke
of
Berwick
with
twelve
thousand
Men
;
that
this
would
be
done
in
two
Days
,
and
that
then
they
would
find
out
the
Lord
Galway
,
and
force
him
to
Fight
,
where
-
ever
they
found
him
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Galway
,
who
at
this
Time
lay
before
Villena
,
receiving
this
Intelligence
from
those
well
instructed
Deserters
,
immediately
rais'd
<EOS>
the
Siege
;
with
a
Resolution
,
by
a
hasty
March
,
to
force
the
Enemy
to
Battle
,
before
the
Duke
of
Orleans
should
be
able
to
join
the
Duke
of
Berwick
.
<EOS>
To
effect
this
,
after
a
hard
March
of
three
long
Spanish
Leagues
in
the
heat
of
the
Day
;
he
appears
a
little
after
Noon
in
the
face
of
the
Enemy
with
his
fatigu'd
Forces
.
<EOS>
Glad
and
rejoyc'd
<EOS>
at
the
Sight
,
for
he
found
his
Plot
had
taken
;
Berwick
,
the
better
to
receive
him
,
draws
up
his
Army
in
a
half
Moon
,
placing
at
a
pretty
good
Advance
three
Regiments
to
make
up
the
Centre
,
with
express
Order
,
nevertheless
,
to
retreat
at
the
very
first
Charge
.
<EOS>
All
which
was
punctually
observ'd
,
and
had
its
desired
Effect
;
For
the
three
Regiments
,
at
the
first
Attack
gave
way
,
and
seemingly
fled
towards
their
Camp
;
the
English
,
after
their
customary
Manner
,
pursuing
them
with
Shouts
and
Hollowings
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
Duke
of
Berwick
perceiv'd
<EOS>
his
Trap
had
taken
,
he
order'd
<EOS>
his
right
and
left
Wings
to
close
;
by
which
Means
<EOS>
,
he
at
once
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
their
Army
all
those
who
had
so
eagerly
pursu'd
<EOS>
the
imaginary
Runaways
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
Rout
was
total
,
and
the
most
fatal
Blow
that
ever
the
English
receiv'd
<EOS>
during
the
whole
War
with
Spain
.
<EOS>
Nor
,
as
it
is
thought
,
with
a
great
probability
of
Reason
,
had
those
Troops
that
made
their
Retreat
to
the
Top
of
the
Hills
,
under
Major
General
Shrimpton
,
met
with
any
better
Fate
than
those
on
the
Plain
,
had
the
Spaniards
had
any
other
General
in
the
Command
than
the
Duke
of
Berwick
;
whose
native
Sympathy
gave
a
check
to
the
Ardour
of
a
victorious
Enemy
.
<EOS>
And
this
was
the
sense
of
the
Spaniards
themselves
after
the
Battle
.
<EOS>
Verifying
herein
that
noble
Maxim
,
That
Victory
to
generous
Minds
is
only
an
Inducement
to
Moderation
.
  
<EOS>
The
Day
after
this
fatal
Battle
(
which
gave
occasion
to
a
Spanish
piece
of
Wit
,
that
the
English
General
had
routed
the
French
)
the
Duke
of
Orleans
did
arrive
indeed
in
the
Camp
,
but
with
an
Army
of
only
fourteen
Attendants
.
  
<EOS>
The
fatal
Effects
of
this
Battle
were
soon
made
visible
,
and
to
none
more
than
those
in
Alicant
.
<EOS>
The
Enemy
grew
every
Day
more
and
more
troublesome
;
visiting
us
in
Parties
more
boldly
than
before
:
and
often
hovering
about
us
so
very
near
,
that
with
our
Cannon
we
could
hardly
teach
'em
to
keep
a
proper
Distance
.
<EOS>
Gorge
the
Governor
of
Alicant
being
recall'd
into
England
,
Major
General
Richards
was
by
King
Charles
appointed
Governor
in
his
Place
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
Roman
Catholick
,
and
very
much
belov'd
<EOS>
by
the
Natives
on
that
Account
;
tho
"
to
give
him
his
due
,
he
behaved
himself
extremely
well
in
all
other
Respects
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
his
Time
,
that
a
Design
was
laid
of
surprising
Guardamere
,
a
small
Sea
-
port
Town
,
in
Murcia
:
<EOS>
But
the
military
Bishop
(
for
he
was
in
a
literal
Sense
excellent
tam
Marte
,
quam
Mercurio
,
among
his
many
others
Exploits
)
,
by
a
timely
Expedition
,
prevented
that
.
  
<EOS>
Governor
Richards
,
my
Post
being
always
in
the
Castle
,
had
sent
to
desire
me
to
give
notice
whenever
I
saw
any
Parties
of
the
Enemy
moving
.
<EOS>
Pursuant
to
this
Order
,
discovering
one
Morning
a
considerable
body
of
Horse
towards
Elsha
,
I
went
down
into
the
Town
,
and
told
the
Governor
what
I
had
seen
;
and
without
any
delay
he
gave
his
Orders
,
that
a
Captain
with
threescore
Men
should
attend
me
to
an
old
House
about
a
Mile
distance
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
had
got
into
it
,
I
set
about
barricading
all
the
open
Places
,
and
Avenues
,
and
put
my
Men
in
a
Posture
ready
to
receive
an
Enemy
,
as
soon
as
he
should
appear
;
upon
which
the
Captain
,
as
a
feint
,
ordered
a
few
of
his
men
to
shew
themselves
on
a
rising
Ground
just
before
the
House
.
<EOS>
But
we
had
like
to
have
caught
a
Tartar
:
For
tho
'
the
Enemy
took
the
Train
I
had
laid
,
and
on
sight
of
our
small
Body
on
the
Hill
,
sent
a
Party
from
their
greater
Body
to
intercept
them
,
before
they
could
reach
the
Town
;
yet
the
Sequel
prov'd
,
we
had
mistaken
their
Number
and
it
soon
appeared
to
be
much
greater
than
we
at
first
<EOS>
imagin'd
.
<EOS>
However
our
Out
-
scouts
,
as
I
may
call
'em
,
got
safe
into
the
House
;
and
on
the
Appearance
of
the
Party
,
we
let
fly
a
full
Volly
,
which
laid
dead
on
the
Spot
three
Men
and
one
Horse
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
the
whole
Body
made
up
to
the
House
,
but
stood
a
-
loof
upon
the
Hill
without
reach
of
our
Shot
.
<EOS>
We
soon
saw
our
Danger
from
the
number
of
the
Enemy
:
<EOS>
And
well
for
us
it
was
,
that
the
watchful
Governor
had
taken
notice
of
it
,
as
well
as
we
in
the
House
.
<EOS>
For
observing
us
surrounded
with
the
Enemy
,
and
by
a
Power
so
much
superior
,
he
marched
himself
with
a
good
part
of
the
Garrison
to
our
Relief
.
<EOS>
The
Enemy
stood
a
little
time
as
if
they
would
receive
'em
;
but
upon
second
thoughts
they
retir'd
;
and
to
our
no
little
Joy
left
us
at
Liberty
to
come
out
of
the
House
and
join
the
Garrison
.
  
<EOS>
Scarce
a
Day
<EOS>
pass'd
<EOS>
but
we
had
some
visits
of
the
like
kind
attended
sometimes
with
Rencounters
of
this
Nature
;
in
so
much
that
there
was
hardly
any
stirring
out
in
Safety
for
small
Parties
,
tho
'
never
so
little
away
.
<EOS>
There
was
within
a
little
Mile
of
the
Town
,
an
old
Vineyard
,
environed
with
a
loose
stone
Wall
:
<EOS>
An
Officer
and
I
made
an
Agreement
to
ride
thither
for
an
Airing
.
<EOS>
We
did
so
,
and
after
a
little
riding
,
it
came
into
my
Head
to
put
a
Fright
upon
the
Officer
.
<EOS>
And
very
lucky
for
us
both
was
that
unlucky
Thought
of
mine
;
pretending
to
see
a
Party
of
the
Enemy
make
up
to
us
<EOS>
,
I
gave
him
the
Alarm
,
set
Spurs
to
my
Horse
,
and
rid
as
fast
as
Legs
could
carry
me
.
<EOS>
The
Officer
no
way
bated
of
his
Speed
;
and
we
had
scarce
got
out
of
the
Vineyard
but
my
Jest
prov'd
Earnest
,
twelve
of
the
Enemy
's
Horse
pursuing
us
to
the
very
Gates
of
the
Town
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
I
ever
after
prevail
upon
my
Fellow
-
Traveller
to
believe
that
he
ow'd
his
Escape
to
Merriment
more
than
Speed
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
my
Charge
,
as
to
the
Fortifications
,
was
pretty
well
over
,
I
<EOS>
obtain'd
Leave
of
the
Governor
to
be
absent
for
a
Fortnight
,
upon
some
Affairs
of
my
own
at
Valencia
.
<EOS>
On
my
Return
from
whence
,
at
a
Town
call'd
Venissa
,
I
met
two
Officers
of
an
English
Regiment
,
going
to
the
Place
from
whence
<EOS>
I
last
came
.
<EOS>
They
told
me
,
after
common
Congratulations
,
that
they
had
left
Major
Boyd
,
at
a
little
Place
<EOS>
call'd
Capel
,
hiring
another
Mule
,
that
he
rode
on
thither
having
tir'd
and
fail'd
him
;
desiring
withal
,
that
if
I
met
him
,
I
would
let
him
know
that
they
would
stay
for
him
at
that
Place
.
<EOS>
I
had
another
Gentleman
in
my
Company
,
and
we
had
travell'd
on
not
above
a
League
further
,
whence
,
at
a
little
Distance
,
we
were
both
surpriz'd
with
a
Sight
that
seem'd
to
have
set
all
Art
at
defiance
,
and
was
too
odd
for
any
thing
in
Nature
.
<EOS>
It
appear'd
all
in
red
,
and
to
move
;
but
so
very
slowly
,
that
if
we
had
not
made
more
way
to
that
than
it
did
to
us
,
we
should
have
made
it
a
Day
's
Journey
before
we
met
it
.
<EOS>
My
Companion
could
as
little
tell
what
to
make
of
it
as
I
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
nearer
it
came
<EOS>
the
more
monstrous
it
<EOS>
seem'd
,
having
nothing
of
the
Tokens
of
Man
,
either
Walking
,
Riding
,
or
in
any
Posture
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
coming
up
with
this
strange
Figure
of
a
Creature
(
for
now
we
found
it
was
certainly
such
)
<EOS>
what
,
or
rather
who
,
should
it
prove
to
be
,
but
Major
Boyd
?
<EOS>
He
was
a
Person
of
himself
far
from
one
of
the
least
Proportion
,
and
mounted
on
a
poor
little
Ass
,
with
all
his
warlike
Accoutrements
upon
it
,
you
will
allow
must
make
a
Figure
almost
as
odd
as
one
of
the
old
Centaurs
.
<EOS>
The
Morocco
Saddle
that
cover'd
<EOS>
the
Ass
was
of
Burden
enough
for
the
Beast
without
its
Master
;
and
the
additional
Holsters
and
Pistols
made
it
much
more
weighty
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
a
Curb
Bridle
of
the
largest
Size
cover'd
<EOS>
his
little
Head
,
and
a
long
red
Cloak
,
hanging
down
to
the
Ground
,
<EOS>
cover'd
Jackboots
,
Ass
,
Master
and
all
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
my
Companion
and
I
,
after
we
could
specifically
declare
it
to
be
a
Man
,
agreed
we
never
saw
a
Figure
so
comical
in
all
our
Lives
.
<EOS>
When
we
had
merrily
greeted
our
Major
(
for
a
Cynick
could
not
have
forborn
Laughter
)
<EOS>
He
excus'd
all
as
well
as
he
could
,
by
saying
he
could
get
no
other
Beast
.
<EOS>
After
which
,
delivering
our
Message
,
and
condoling
with
him
for
his
present
Mounting
,
and
wishing
him
better
at
his
next
Quarters
,
he
settled
into
his
old
Pace
,
and
we
into
ours
,
and
parted
.
  
<EOS>
We
lay
that
Night
at
Altea
,
famous
for
its
Bay
for
Ships
to
water
at
.
<EOS>
It
stands
on
a
high
Hill
;
and
is
adorn'd
,
not
defended
,
with
an
old
Fort
.
  
<EOS>
Thence
we
came
to
Alicant
,
where
having
now
been
a
whole
Year
,
and
having
effected
what
was
held
necessary
,
I
once
more
prevail'd
upon
the
Governor
to
permit
me
to
take
another
Journey
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
Galway
lay
at
Tarraga
,
while
Lerida
lay
under
the
Siege
of
the
Duke
of
Orleans
;
and
having
some
Grounds
of
Expectation
given
me
,
while
he
was
at
Alicant
,
I
resolv'd
at
least
to
demonstrate
I
was
still
living
.
<EOS>
The
Governor
favour'd
me
with
Letters
,
not
at
all
to
my
Disadvantage
;
so
taking
Ship
for
Barcelona
,
just
at
our
putting
into
the
Harbour
,
we
met
with
the
English
Fleet
,
on
its
Return
from
the
Expedition
to
Toulon
under
Sir
Cloudsly
Shovel
.
  
<EOS>
I
stay'd
<EOS>
but
very
few
Days
at
Barcelona
,
and
then
proceeded
on
my
intended
Journey
to
Tarraga
;
arriving
at
which
<EOS>
Place
<EOS>
I
deliver'd
<EOS>
my
Packet
to
the
Lord
Galway
,
who
receiv'd
me
with
very
great
Civility
;
and
to
double
it
,
acquainted
me
at
the
same
time
,
that
the
Governor
of
Alicant
had
wrote
very
much
in
my
Favour
:
<EOS>
But
though
it
was
a
known
Part
of
that
noble
Lord
's
Character
,
that
the
first
Impression
was
generally
strongest
,
I
had
Reason
soon
after
to
close
with
another
Saying
,
equally
true
,
That
general
Rules
always
admit
of
some
Exception
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
here
we
had
News
of
the
taking
of
the
Town
of
Lerida
;
the
Prince
of
Hesse
(
Brother
to
that
brave
Prince
who
lost
his
Life
before
Monjouick
)
retiring
into
the
Castle
with
the
Garrison
,
which
he
bravely
defended
a
long
time
after
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
was
thus
attending
my
Lord
Galway
at
Tarraga
,
he
receiv'd
Intelligence
that
the
Enemy
had
a
Design
to
lay
Siege
to
Denia
;
whereupon
he
gave
me
Orders
to
repair
there
as
Engineer
.
<EOS>
After
I
had
receiv'd
<EOS>
my
Orders
,
and
taken
Leave
of
his
Lordship
<EOS>
,
I
set
out
,
resolving
,
since
it
was
left
to
my
Choice
,
to
go
by
way
of
Barcelona
,
and
there
take
Shipping
for
the
Place
of
my
Station
;
by
which
I
propos'd
to
save
more
time
than
would
allow
me
a
full
Opportunity
of
visiting
Montserat
,
a
Place
I
had
heard
much
Talk
of
,
which
had
fill'd
me
with
a
longing
Desire
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
To
say
Truth
,
I
had
been
told
such
extravagant
Things
of
the
Place
,
that
I
could
hardly
impute
more
than
one
half
of
it
to
any
thing
but
Spanish
Rhodomontado
's
,
the
Vice
of
extravagant
Exaggeration
being
too
natural
to
that
Nation
.
  
<EOS>
MONTSERAT
is
a
rising
lofty
Hill
,
in
the
very
Middle
of
a
spacious
Plain
,
in
the
Principality
of
Catalonia
,
about
seven
Leagues
distant
from
Barcelona
to
the
Westward
,
somewhat
inclining
to
the
North
.
<EOS>
At
the
very
first
Sight
,
its
Oddness
of
Figure
promises
something
extraordinary
;
and
given
at
that
Distance
the
Prospect
makes
somewhat
of
a
grand
Appearance
:
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
aspiring
Pyramids
presenting
themselves
all
at
once
to
the
Eye
,
look
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
so
to
speak
,
like
a
little
petrify'd
Forrest
;
or
,
rather
,
like
the
awful
Ruins
of
some
capacious
Structure
,
the
Labour
of
venerable
Antiquity
.
<EOS>
The
nearer
you
approach
the
more
it
affects
;
but
till
you
are
very
near
you
can
hardly
form
in
your
Mind
any
thing
like
what
you
find
it
when
you
come
close
to
it
.
<EOS>
Till
just
upon
it
you
would
imagine
it
a
perfect
Hill
of
Steeples
;
but
so
intermingled
with
Trees
of
Magnitude
,
as
well
as
Beauty
,
that
your
Admiration
can
never
be
tir'd
,
or
your
Curiosity
surfeited
.
<EOS>
Such
I
found
it
on
my
Approach
;
yet
much
less
than
what
I
found
it
,
was
so
soon
as
I
enter'd
<EOS>
upon
the
very
Premisses
.
  
<EOS>
Now
that
stupendious
Cluster
of
Pyramids
affected
me
in
a
Manner
different
to
all
before
;
and
I
found
it
so
finely
<EOS>
group'd
with
verdant
Groves
,
and
here
and
there
interspers'd
with
aspiring
,
but
solitary
Trees
,
that
it
no
way
lessened
my
Admiration
,
while
it
increased
my
Delight
.
<EOS>
Those
Trees
,
which
I
call
solitary
,
as
standing
single
,
in
opposition
to
the
numerous
Groves
,
which
are
close
and
thick
(
as
I
observ'd
when
I
ascended
to
take
a
View
of
the
several
Cells
)
rise
generally
out
of
the
very
Clefts
of
the
main
Rock
,
with
nothing
,
to
Appearance
,
but
a
Soil
or
bed
of
Stone
for
their
Nurture
.
<EOS>
But
though
some
few
Naturalists
may
assert
,
that
the
Nitre
in
the
Stone
may
afford
a
due
Proportion
of
Nourishment
to
Trees
and
Vegetables
;
these
,
in
my
Opinion
,
were
all
too
beautiful
,
their
Bark
,
Leaf
,
and
Flowers
,
carry'd
<EOS>
too
fair
a
Face
of
Health
,
to
allow
them
even
to
be
the
Foster
-
children
of
Rock
and
Stone
only
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
Hill
,
or
if
you
please
,
Grove
of
Rocks
,
are
thirteen
Hermits
Cells
,
the
last
of
which
lies
near
the
very
Summit
.
<EOS>
You
gradually
advance
to
every
one
,
from
Bottom
to
Top
,
by
a
winding
Ascent
;
which
to
do
would
otherwise
be
Impossible
,
by
reason
of
the
Steepness
;
but
though
there
is
a
winding
Ascent
to
every
Cell
,
as
I
have
said
,
I
would
yet
set
at
defiance
the
most
observant
,
if
a
Stranger
,
to
find
it
feasible
to
visit
them
in
order
,
if
not
precaution'd
to
follow
the
poor
Borigo
,
or
old
Ass
,
that
with
Paniers
hanging
on
each
Side
of
him
,
mounts
regularly
,
and
daily
,
up
to
every
particular
Cell
.
<EOS>
The
Manner
is
as
follows
:
  
<EOS>
In
the
Paniers
there
are
thirteen
Partitions
;
one
for
every
Cell
.
<EOS>
At
the
Hour
appointed
,
the
Servant
having
<EOS>
plac'd
<EOS>
the
Paniers
on
his
Back
,
the
Ass
,
of
himself
,
goes
to
the
Door
of
the
Convent
at
the
very
Foot
of
the
Hill
,
where
every
Partition
is
supply'd
with
their
several
Allowances
of
Victuals
and
Wine
.
<EOS>
Which
,
as
soon
as
he
has
receiv'd
,
without
any
further
Attendance
,
or
any
Guide
,
he
mounts
and
takes
the
Cells
gradually
,
in
their
due
Course
,
till
he
reaches
the
very
uppermost
.
<EOS>
Where
having
discharg'd
<EOS>
his
Duty
,
he
descends
the
same
Way
,
lighter
by
the
Load
he
carry'd
up
.
<EOS>
This
the
poor
stupid
Drudge
fails
not
to
do
,
Day
and
Night
,
at
the
stated
Hours
.
  
<EOS>
Two
Gentlemen
,
who
had
join'd
me
on
the
Road
,
alike
led
by
Curiosity
,
seem'd
alike
delighted
,
that
the
End
of
it
was
so
well
<EOS>
answer'd
.
<EOS>
I
could
easily
discover
in
their
Countenances
a
Satisfaction
,
which
,
if
it
did
not
give
a
Sanction
to
my
own
,
much
confirm'd
<EOS>
it
,
while
they
seem'd
to
allow
with
me
that
these
reverend
Solitaries
were
truly
happy
Men
;
I
then
thought
them
such
;
and
a
thousand
times
since
,
reflecting
within
my
self
,
have
wish'd
,
bating
their
Errors
,
and
lesser
Superstitions
,
my
self
as
happily
station'd
:
<EOS>
For
what
can
there
be
wanting
to
a
happy
Life
,
where
all
things
necessary
are
provided
without
Care
?
<EOS>
Where
the
Days
,
without
Anxiety
or
Troubles
,
may
be
gratefully
passed
away
,
with
an
innocent
Variety
of
diverting
and
pleasing
Objects
,
and
where
their
Sleep
sand
Slumbers
are
never
interrupted
with
any
thing
more
offensive
,
than
murmuring
Springs
,
natural
Cascades
,
or
the
various
Songs
of
the
pretty
feather'd
Quiristers
.
  
<EOS>
But
their
Courtesy
to
Strangers
is
no
less
engaging
than
their
Solitude
.
<EOS>
A
recluse
Life
,
for
the
Fruits
of
it
,
generally
speaking
,
produces
Moroseness
;
Pharisaical
Pride
too
often
sours
the
Temper
;
and
a
mistaken
Opinion
of
their
own
Merit
too
naturally
leads
such
Men
into
a
Contempt
of
others
;
But
on
the
contrary
,
these
good
Men
(
for
I
must
call
them
as
I
thought
them
)
<EOS>
seem'd
<EOS>
to
me
<EOS>
the
very
Emblems
of
Innocence
;
so
ready
to
oblige
others
,
that
at
the
same
Instant
they
seem'd
laying
Obligations
upon
themselves
.
<EOS>
This
is
self
-
evident
,
in
that
Affability
and
Complaisance
they
use
in
shewing
the
Rarities
of
their
several
Cells
;
where
,
for
fear
you
should
slip
any
thing
worthy
Observation
,
they
endeavour
to
instil
in
you
as
quick
a
Propensity
of
asking
,
as
you
find
in
them
a
prompt
Alacrity
in
answering
such
Questions
of
Curiosity
as
their
own
have
inspir'd
.
  
<EOS>
In
particular
,
I
remember
one
of
those
reverend
old
Men
,
when
we
were
taking
Leave
at
the
Door
of
his
Cell
,
to
which
out
of
his
great
Civility
he
<EOS>
accompany'd
us
,
finding
by
the
Air
of
our
Faces
,
as
well
as
our
Expressions
<EOS>
,
that
we
thought
ourselves
pleasingly
entertain'd
;
to
divert
us
afresh
,
advanc'd
a
few
Paces
from
the
Door
,
when
giving
a
Whistle
with
his
Mouth
,
a
surprising
Flock
of
pretty
little
Birds
,
variegated
,
and
of
different
Colours
,
immediately
<EOS>
flock'd
around
him
.
<EOS>
Here
you
should
see
some
alighting
upon
his
Shoulders
,
some
on
his
awful
Beard
;
others
took
Refuge
on
his
snow
-
like
Head
,
and
many
feeding
,
and
more
endeavouring
to
feed
out
of
his
Mouth
;
each
appearing
emulous
and
under
an
innocent
Contention
,
how
best
to
express
their
Love
and
Respect
to
their
no
less
pleased
Master
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
other
Cells
labour
under
any
Deficiency
of
Variety
<EOS>
:
Every
one
boasting
in
some
particular
,
that
might
distinguish
it
in
something
equally
agreeable
and
entertaining
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
crystal
Springs
spouting
from
the
solid
Rocks
were
,
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
,
common
to
them
all
;
and
,
in
most
of
them
,
they
had
little
brass
Cocks
,
out
of
which
,
when
turn'd
<EOS>
,
issu'd
the
most
cool
and
crystalline
Flows
of
excellent
pure
Water
.
<EOS>
And
yet
what
more
affected
me
,
and
which
I
found
near
more
Cells
than
one
,
was
the
natural
Cascades
of
the
same
transparent
Element
;
these
falling
from
one
Rock
to
another
,
in
that
warm
,
or
rather
hot
Climate
,
gave
not
more
delightful
Astonishment
to
the
Eye
,
than
they
afforded
grateful
Refreshment
to
the
whole
Man
.
<EOS>
The
Streams
falling
from
these
,
soften
,
from
a
rougher
tumultuous
Noise
,
into
such
affecting
Murmurs
,
by
Distance
,
the
Intervention
of
Groves
,
or
neighbouring
Rocks
,
that
it
were
impossible
to
see
or
hear
them
and
not
be
chann'd
.
  
<EOS>
Neither
are
those
Groves
grateful
only
in
a
beautiful
Verdure
;
Nature
renders
them
otherwise
delightful
,
in
loading
them
with
Clusters
of
Berries
of
a
perfect
scarlet
Colour
,
which
,
by
a
beautiful
Intermixture
,
strike
the
Eye
with
additional
Delight
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
it
might
nonplus
a
Person
of
the
nicest
Taste
,
to
distinguish
or
determine
,
whether
the
Neatness
of
their
Cells
within
,
or
the
beauteous
Varieties
without
,
most
exhaust
his
Admiration
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
the
Whole
,
in
my
Opinion
,
a
little
advantag'd
<EOS>
by
the
frequent
View
of
some
of
those
pyramidical
Pillars
,
which
seem
,
as
weary
of
their
own
Weight
,
to
recline
and
seek
Support
from
others
in
the
Neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
mention'd
the
outside
Beauties
of
their
Cells
,
I
must
be
thought
to
have
forgot
to
particularize
the
glorious
Prospects
presented
to
your
Eye
from
every
one
of
them
;
but
especially
from
that
nearest
the
Summit
.
<EOS>
A
Prospect
,
by
reason
of
the
Purity
of
the
Air
,
so
extensive
,
and
so
very
entertaining
that
to
dilate
upon
it
properly
to
one
that
never
saw
it
,
would
baffle
Credit
;
and
naturally
to
depaint
it
,
would
confound
Invention
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
shall
only
say
,
that
on
the
Mediterranean
Side
,
after
an
agreeable
Interval
of
some
fair
Leagues
,
it
will
set
at
defiance
the
strongest
Opticks
;
and
although
Barcelona
bounds
it
on
the
Land
,
the
Eyes
are
feasted
with
the
Delights
of
such
an
intervening
Champion
(
where
beauteous
Nature
does
not
only
smile
,
but
riot
)
that
the
Sense
must
be
very
temperate
,
or
very
weak
,
that
can
be
soon
or
easily
satisfy'd
.
  
<EOS>
Having
thus
taken
a
View
of
all
their
refreshing
Springs
,
their
grateful
Groves
,
and
solitary
Shades
under
single
Trees
,
whose
Clusters
prov'd
<EOS>
that
even
Rocks
were
grown
fruitful
;
and
having
ran
over
all
the
Variety
of
Pleasures
in
their
several
pretty
Cells
,
decently
set
off
with
Gardens
round
the
,
equally
fragrant
and
beautiful
,
we
were
brought
down
again
to
the
Convent
,
which
,
though
on
a
small
Ascent
,
lies
very
near
the
Foot
of
this
terrestrial
Paradise
,
there
to
take
a
Survey
of
their
sumptuous
Hall
,
much
more
sumptuous
Chapel
,
and
its
adjoining
Repository
;
and
feast
our
Eyes
with
Wonders
of
a
different
Nature
;
and
yet
as
entertaining
as
any
,
or
all
<EOS>
,
we
had
seen
before
.
  
<EOS>
Immediately
on
our
Descent
,
a
Priest
presented
himself
at
the
Door
of
the
Convent
,
ready
to
shew
us
the
hidden
Rarities
.
<EOS>
And
though
,
as
I
understood
,
hardly
a
Day
passes
without
the
Resort
of
some
Strangers
to
gratify
their
Curiosity
with
the
Wonders
of
the
Place
;
yet
is
there
,
on
every
such
Occasion
,
a
superior
Concourse
of
Natives
ready
to
see
over
again
,
out
of
meer
Bigotry
and
Superstition
,
what
they
have
seen
,
perhaps
,
a
hundred
times
before
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
avoid
taking
notice
,
however
,
that
the
Priest
treated
those
constant
Visitants
with
much
less
Ceremony
,
or
more
Freedom
,
if
you
please
,
than
any
of
the
Strangers
of
what
Nation
soever
;
or
,
indeed
,
he
seem'd
to
take
as
much
Pains
to
disoblige
those
,
as
he
did
Pleasure
in
obliging
us
.
  
<EOS>
The
Hall
was
neat
,
large
and
stately
;
but
being
plain
and
unadorn'd
with
more
than
decent
Decorations
,
suitable
to
such
a
Society
,
I
hasten
to
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
enter'd
the
Chapel
,
our
Eyes
were
immediately
attracted
by
the
Image
of
our
Lady
of
Montserat
(
as
they
call
it
)
which
stands
over
the
Altar
-
Piece
.
<EOS>
It
is
about
the
natural
Stature
;
but
as
black
and
shining
as
Ebony
it
self
.
<EOS>
Most
would
imagine
it
made
of
that
Material
;
though
her
Retinue
and
Adorers
will
allow
nothing
of
the
Matter
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
Tradition
,
which
with
them
is
,
on
some
Occasions
,
more
than
tantamount
to
Religion
,
has
assur'd
them
,
and
they
relate
it
as
undoubted
Matter
of
Fact
,
that
her
present
Colour
,
if
I
may
so
call
it
,
proceeded
from
her
Concealment
,
in
the
Time
of
the
Moors
,
between
those
two
Rocks
on
which
the
Chapel
is
founded
;
and
that
her
long
lying
in
that
dismal
Place
<EOS>
chang'd
<EOS>
her
once
lovely
White
into
its
present
opposite
.
<EOS>
Would
not
a
Heretick
here
be
apt
to
say
,
That
it
was
greaty
pity
that
an
Image
which
still
boasts
the
Power
of
acting
so
many
Miracles
,
could
no
better
conserve
her
own
Complexion
?
<EOS>
At
least
it
must
be
allow'd
,
even
by
a
good
Catholick
,
to
carry
along
with
it
Matter
of
Reproach
to
the
fair
Ladies
,
Natives
of
the
Country
,
for
their
unnatural
and
excessive
Affection
of
adulterating
,
if
not
defacing
,
their
beautiful
Faces
,
with
the
ruinating
Dauberies
of
Carmine
?
  
<EOS>
As
the
Custom
of
the
Place
is
(
which
is
likewise
allow'd
<EOS>
to
be
a
distinguishing
Piece
of
Civility
to
Strangers
)
when
we
approach
the
black
Lady
(
who
,
I
should
have
told
you
,
bears
a
Child
in
her
Arms
;
but
whether
maternally
Black
,
or
of
the
Mulatto
Kind
<EOS>
,
I
protest
<EOS>
I
did
not
mind
)
<EOS>
the
Priest
,
in
great
Civility
,
offers
you
her
Arm
to
salute
;
at
which
Juncture
,
I
,
like
a
true
blue
Protestant
,
mistaking
my
Word
of
Command
,
fell
foul
on
the
fair
Lady
's
Face
.
<EOS>
The
Displeasure
in
his
Countenance
(
for
he
took
more
Notice
of
the
Rudeness
than
the
good
Lady
her
self
)
<EOS>
soon
convinc'd
me
of
my
Error
;
However
,
as
a
greater
Token
of
his
Civility
,
having
admitted
no
Spaniards
along
with
my
Companions
and
me
,
is
pass'd
off
the
better
;
and
his
after
Civilities
manifested
,
that
he
was
willing
to
reform
my
Ignorance
by
his
Complaisance
.
  
<EOS>
To
demonstrate
which
,
upon
my
telling
him
that
I
had
a
Set
of
Beads
,
which
I
must
entreat
him
to
consecrate
for
me
,
he
readily
,
nay
eagerly
comply'd
;
and
having
hung
them
on
her
Arm
for
the
Space
of
about
half
,
or
somewhat
short
of
a
whole
Minute
,
he
return'd
me
<EOS>
the
holy
Baubles
with
a
great
deal
of
Address
and
most
evident
Satisfaction
.
<EOS>
The
Reader
will
be
apt
to
admire
at
this
curious
Piece
of
Superstition
of
mine
,
till
I
have
told
him
,
that
even
rigid
Protestants
have
,
in
this
Country
,
thought
it
but
prudent
to
do
the
like
;
and
likewise
having
so
done
,
to
carry
them
about
their
Persons
,
or
in
their
Pockets
:
For
Experience
has
convinc'd
us
of
the
Necessity
of
this
most
Catholick
Precaution
;
since
those
who
have
here
,
travelling
or
otherwise
,
come
to
their
Ends
,
whether
by
Accident
,
Sickness
,
or
the
Course
of
Nature
,
not
having
these
sanctifying
Seals
found
upon
them
,
have
ever
been
refus'd
Christian
Burial
,
under
a
superstitious
Imagination
,
that
the
Corps
of
a
Heretick
will
infect
every
thing
near
it
.
  
<EOS>
Two
instances
of
this
kind
fell
within
my
Knowledge
;
one
before
I
came
to
Montserat
,
the
other
after
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
of
one
Slunt
,
who
had
been
Bombardier
at
Monjouick
;
but
being
kill'd
while
we
lay
at
Campilio
,
a
Priest
,
whom
I
advis'd
<EOS>
with
upon
the
Matter
,
told
me
,
that
if
he
should
be
buried
where
any
Corn
grew
,
his
Body
would
not
only
be
taken
up
again
,
but
ill
treated
,
in
revenge
of
the
Destruction
of
so
much
Corn
,
which
the
People
would
on
no
account
be
persuaded
to
touch
;
for
which
Reason
we
took
care
to
have
him
lay'd
in
a
very
deep
Grave
,
on
a
very
barren
Spot
of
Ground
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
of
one
Captain
Bush
,
who
was
a
Prisoner
with
me
on
the
Surrender
of
Denia
;
who
being
sent
,
as
I
was
afterwards
,
to
Saint
Clemente
la
Mancha
,
there
dy'd
;
and
,
as
I
was
inform'd
,
tho
'
he
was
privately
,
and
by
Night
,
bury'd
in
a
Corn
-
Field
,
he
was
taken
out
of
his
Grave
by
those
superstitious
People
,
as
soon
as
ever
they
could
discover
the
Place
where
his
Body
was
deposited
.
<EOS>
But
I
return
to
the
Convent
at
Montserat
.
  
<EOS>
Out
of
the
Chapel
,
behind
the
High
-
Altar
<EOS>
,
we
descended
into
a
spacious
Room
,
the
Repository
of
the
great
Offerings
made
to
the
Lady
.
<EOS>
Here
,
though
I
thought
in
the
Chapel
<EOS>
it
self
<EOS>
I
had
seen
the
Riches
of
the
Universe
,
I
found
a
prodigious
Quantity
of
more
costly
Presents
,
the
superstitious
Tribute
of
most
of
the
Roman
-
Catholick
Princes
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
Among
a
Multitude
of
others
,
they
show'd
me
a
Sword
set
with
Diamonds
,
the
Offering
of
Charles
the
Third
,
then
King
of
Spain
,
but
now
Emperor
of
Germany
.
<EOS>
Though
I
must
confess
,
being
a
Heretick
,
I
could
much
easier
find
a
Reason
for
a
fair
Lady
's
presenting
such
a
Sword
to
a
King
of
Spain
,
than
for
a
King
of
Spain
's
presenting
such
a
Sword
to
a
fair
Lady
:
<EOS>
And
by
the
Motto
upon
it
,
Pulchra
tamen
nigra
,
it
was
plain
such
was
his
Opinion
.
<EOS>
That
Prince
was
so
delighted
with
the
Pleasure
's
of
this
sweet
Place
,
that
he
,
as
well
as
I
,
stay'd
as
long
as
ever
he
could
;
though
neither
of
us
so
long
as
either
could
have
wish'd
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
another
Offering
from
a
King
of
Portugal
,
equally
glorious
and
costly
;
but
much
better
adapted
;
and
therefore
in
its
Propriety
easier
to
be
accounted
for
.
<EOS>
That
was
a
Glory
for
the
Head
of
her
Ladiship
,
every
Ray
of
which
was
set
with
Diamonds
,
large
at
the
Bottom
,
and
gradually
lessening
to
the
very
Extremity
of
every
Ray
.
<EOS>
Each
Ray
might
be
about
half
a
Yard
Long
;
and
I
imagin'd
in
the
Whole
there
might
be
about
one
Hundred
of
them
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
if
ever
her
Ladiship
did
the
Offerer
the
Honour
to
put
it
on
,
I
will
though
a
Heretick
,
venture
to
aver
,
she
did
not
at
that
present
time
look
like
a
humane
Creature
.
  
<EOS>
To
enumerate
the
rest
,
if
my
Memory
would
suffice
,
would
exceed
Belief
.
<EOS>
As
the
upper
Part
was
a
plain
Miracle
of
Nature
,
the
lower
was
a
compleat
Treasury
of
miraculous
Art
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
ascend
from
the
lowest
Cell
to
the
very
Summit
,
the
last
of
all
the
thirteen
,
you
will
perceive
a
continual
Contention
between
Pleasure
and
Devotion
;
and
at
last
,
perhaps
,
find
your
self
at
a
Loss
to
decide
which
deserves
the
Preheminence
:
For
you
are
not
here
to
take
Cells
in
the
vulgar
Acceptation
,
as
the
little
Dormitories
of
solitary
Monks
:
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Neatness
,
Use
,
and
Contrivance
appear
in
every
one
of
them
;
and
though
in
an
almost
perfect
Equality
,
yet
in
such
Perfection
,
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
discover
in
any
one
of
them
any
thing
wanting
to
the
Pleasure
of
Life
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
descend
to
the
Convent
near
the
Foot
of
that
venerable
Hill
;
you
may
see
more
,
much
more
of
the
Riches
of
the
World
;
but
less
,
far
less
Appearance
of
a
celestial
Treasure
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
it
might
be
only
the
Sentiment
of
a
Heretick
;
but
that
Awe
and
Devotion
,
which
I
found
in
my
Attendant
from
Cell
to
Cell
grew
languid
,
and
lost
in
meer
empty
Bigotry
and
foggy
Superstition
,
when
I
came
below
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
there
was
not
a
great
Difference
in
their
Heights
,
than
in
the
Sentiments
<EOS>
they
inspir'd
<EOS>
me
with
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
leave
this
Emblem
of
the
beatific
Vision
,
I
must
correct
some
thing
like
a
Mistake
,
as
to
the
poor
Borigo
.
<EOS>
I
said
at
the
Beginning
that
his
Labour
was
daily
;
but
the
Sunday
is
to
him
a
Day
of
rest
,
as
it
is
to
the
Hermits
,
his
Masters
,
a
Day
of
Refection
.
<EOS>
For
to
save
the
poor
faithful
Brute
the
hard
Drudgery
of
that
Day
,
the
thirteen
Hermits
,
if
Health
permit
,
descend
to
their
Canobium
,
as
they
call
it
;
that
is
,
to
the
Hall
of
the
Convent
;
where
they
dine
in
common
with
the
Monks
of
the
Order
,
who
are
Benedictines
.
  
<EOS>
After
seven
Days
Variety
of
such
innocent
Delight
(
the
Space
allow'd
for
the
Entertainment
of
Strangers
)
,
I
took
my
Leave
of
this
pacifick
Hermitage
,
to
pursue
the
more
boisterous
Duties
of
my
Calling
.
<EOS>
The
Life
of
a
Soldier
is
in
every
Respect
the
full
Antithesis
to
that
of
a
Hermit
;
and
I
know
not
,
whether
it
might
not
be
a
Sense
of
that
,
<EOS>
which
inspir'd
me
with
very
great
Reluctancy
at
parting
.
<EOS>
I
confess
,
while
on
the
Spot
,
I
over
and
over
bandy'd
<EOS>
in
my
Mind
the
Reasons
which
might
prevail
upon
Charles
the
Fifth
to
relinquish
his
Crown
;
and
the
Arguments
on
his
Side
never
fail'd
of
Energy
,
I
could
persuade
my
self
that
this
,
or
some
like
happy
Retreat
,
was
the
Reward
of
abdicated
Empire
.
  
<EOS>
Full
of
these
Contemplations
(
for
they
lasted
there
)
<EOS>
I
arriv'd
<EOS>
at
Barcelona
;
where
I
found
a
Vessel
ready
to
sail
,
on
which
I
embarked
for
Denia
,
in
pursuance
of
my
Orders
.
<EOS>
Sailing
to
the
Mouth
of
the
Mediterranean
,
no
Place
along
the
Christian
Shore
affords
a
Prospect
equally
delightful
with
the
Castle
of
Denia
.
<EOS>
It
was
never
designed
for
a
Place
of
great
Strength
,
being
built
,
and
first
design'd
,
as
a
Seat
of
Pleasure
to
the
Great
Duke
of
Lerma
.
<EOS>
In
that
Family
it
many
Years
remain'd
;
tho
'
,
within
less
than
a
Century
,
that
with
two
other
Dukedoms
,
have
devolv'd
upon
the
Family
of
the
Duke
de
Medina
Celi
,
the
richest
Subject
at
this
time
in
all
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
DENIA
was
the
first
Town
,
that
in
our
Way
to
Barcelona
,
declar'd
for
King
Charles
;
and
was
then
by
his
Order
made
a
Garrison
.
<EOS>
The
Town
is
but
small
,
and
surrounded
with
a
thin
Wall
;
so
thin
,
that
I
have
known
a
Cannon
-
Ball
pierce
through
it
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
arriv'd
at
Denia
,
I
found
a
Spaniard
Governor
of
the
Town
,
whose
Name
has
slipt
my
Memory
;
tho
'
his
Behaviour
merited
everlasting
Annals
.
<EOS>
Major
Percival
,
an
Englishman
,
commanded
in
the
Castle
,
and
on
my
coming
there
,
I
understood
,
it
had
been
agreed
between
'em
,
that
in
case
of
a
Siege
,
which
they
apprehended
,
the
Town
should
be
defended
wholly
by
Spaniards
,
and
the
Castle
by
the
English
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
scarce
been
there
three
Weeks
before
those
Expectations
were
answered
.
<EOS>
The
Place
was
invested
by
Count
D'Alfelt
,
and
Major
General
Mahoni
;
two
Days
after
which
,
they
open'd
<EOS>
Trenches
on
the
East
Side
of
the
Town
.
<EOS>
I
was
necessitated
upon
their
so
doing
,
to
order
the
Demolishment
of
some
Houses
on
that
Side
,
that
I
might
erect
a
Battery
to
point
upon
their
Trenches
,
the
better
to
annoy
them
.
<EOS>
I
did
so
;
and
it
did
the
intended
Service
;
for
with
that
,
and
two
others
,
which
I
rais'd
upon
the
Castle
(
from
all
which
we
fir'd
incessantly
,
and
with
great
Success
)
<EOS>
the
Besiegers
were
sufficiently
incommoded
.
  
<EOS>
The
Governor
of
the
Town
(
a
Spaniard
as
I
said
before
,
and
with
a
Spanish
Garrison
)
<EOS>
behav'd
very
gallantly
;
insomuch
,
that
what
was
said
of
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
when
he
so
bravely
defended
Gibraltar
against
the
joint
Forces
of
France
and
Spain
,
might
be
said
of
him
,
that
he
was
Governor
,
Engineer
,
Gunner
,
and
Bombardier
all
in
one
;
For
no
Man
could
exceed
him
,
either
in
Conduct
or
Courage
;
nor
were
the
Spaniards
under
him
less
valiant
or
vigilant
;
for
in
case
the
Place
was
taken
,
expecting
but
<EOS>
indifferent
Quarter
,
they
fought
with
Bravery
,
and
defended
the
Place
to
Admiration
.
  
<EOS>
The
Enemy
had
answer'd
our
Fire
with
all
the
Ardour
imaginable
;
and
having
made
a
Breach
,
that
,
as
we
thought
was
practicable
,
a
Storm
was
expected
every
Hour
.
<EOS>
Preparing
against
which
to
the
great
Joy
of
all
the
Inhabitants
,
and
the
Surprize
of
the
whole
Garrison
,
and
without
our
being
able
to
assign
the
least
Cause
,
the
Enemy
suddenly
raised
the
Siege
,
and
withdrew
from
a
Place
,
which
those
within
imagined
in
great
Danger
.
  
<EOS>
The
Siege
thus
abdicated
(
if
I
may
use
a
modern
Phrase
)
<EOS>
I
was
resolved
to
improve
my
Time
,
and
make
the
best
Provision
I
could
against
any
future
Attack
.
<EOS>
To
that
purpose
I
made
several
new
Fortifications
,
together
with
proper
Casemets
for
our
Powder
,
all
which
render'd
<EOS>
the
Place
much
stronger
<EOS>
,
tho
'
Time
too
soon
show'd
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
that
Strength
it
self
must
yield
to
Fortune
.
  
<EOS>
Surveying
those
works
,
and
my
Workmen
<EOS>
,
I
was
one
Day
standing
on
the
great
Battery
,
<EOS>
when
casting
my
Eye
toward
the
Barbary
Coast
,
I
observ'd
an
odd
sort
of
greenish
Cloud
making
to
the
Spanish
Shoar
.
<EOS>
Not
like
other
Clouds
with
Rapidity
or
Swiftness
,
but
with
a
Motion
so
slow
,
that
Sight
itself
was
a
long
time
before
it
would
allow
it
such
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
it
came
just
over
my
Head
,
and
interposing
between
the
Sun
and
me
,
so
thickened
the
Air
,
that
I
had
lost
the
very
Sight
of
Day
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
it
had
reach'd
<EOS>
the
Land
;
and
tho
'
very
near
me
in
my
Imagination
<EOS>
,
it
began
to
dissolve
,
and
lose
of
its
first
Tenebrity
,
when
all
on
a
sudden
there
fell
such
a
vast
multitude
of
Locusts
,
as
exceeded
the
thickest
storm
of
Hail
or
Snow
that
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
All
around
me
was
immediately
cover'd
with
those
crauling
Creatures
;
and
they
yet
continu'd
to
fall
so
thick
,
that
with
the
swing
of
my
Cane
<EOS>
I
knock'd
down
thousands
.
<EOS>
It
is
scarce
imaginable
<EOS>
the
Havock
I
made
in
a
very
little
space
of
time
<EOS>
;
much
less
conceivable
is
the
horrid
Desolation
which
attended
the
Visitation
of
those
Animalcula
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
in
a
Day
or
two
's
time
,
the
least
Leaf
to
be
seen
upon
a
Tree
,
nor
any
green
Thing
in
a
Garden
.
<EOS>
Nature
seem'd
buried
in
her
own
Ruins
;
and
the
vegetable
World
to
be
Supporters
only
to
her
Monument
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
the
hardest
Winter
,
in
those
Parts
,
attended
with
any
equal
Desolation
.
<EOS>
When
,
glutton
like
,
they
had
devoured
all
that
should
have
sustained
them
,
and
the
more
valuable
Part
of
God
's
Creation
(
whether
weary
with
gorging
,
or
over
thirsty
with
devouring
,
I
leave
to
Philosophers
)
<EOS>
they
made
to
Ponds
,
Brooks
,
and
standing
Pools
,
there
revenging
their
own
Rape
upon
Nature
,
upon
their
own
vile
Carkasses
.
<EOS>
In
every
of
these
you
might
see
them
lie
in
Heaps
like
little
Hills
;
drown'd
indeed
,
but
attended
with
Stenches
so
noisome
,
that
it
gave
the
distracted
Neighbourhood
too
great
Reason
to
apprehend
yet
more
fatal
Consequences
.
<EOS>
A
Pestilential
Infection
is
the
Dread
of
every
Place
,
but
especially
of
all
Parts
upon
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
The
Priests
therefore
repair'd
to
a
little
Chapel
,
built
in
the
open
Fields
,
to
be
made
use
of
on
such
like
Occasions
,
there
to
deprecate
the
miserable
Cause
of
this
dreadful
Visitation
.
<EOS>
In
a
Week
's
time
,
or
there
abouts
,
the
Stench
was
over
,
and
every
Thing
but
verdant
Nature
in
its
pristin
Order
.
  
<EOS>
Some
few
Months
after
this
,
and
about
eight
Months
from
the
former
Siege
,
Count
D'Alfelt
<EOS>
caus'd
Denia
to
be
again
invested
;
and
being
then
sensible
of
all
the
Mistakes
he
had
before
committed
,
he
now
went
about
his
Business
with
more
Regularity
and
Discretion
.
<EOS>
The
first
Thing
he
set
upon
,
and
it
was
the
wisest
Thing
he
could
do
,
was
to
cut
off
our
Communication
with
the
Sea
.
<EOS>
This
he
did
,
and
thereby
obtained
what
he
much
desired
.
<EOS>
Next
,
he
caus'd
<EOS>
his
Batteries
to
be
erected
on
the
West
side
of
the
Town
,
from
which
he
ply'd
it
so
furiously
,
that
in
five
Days
'
time
a
practicable
Breach
was
made
;
upon
which
they
stormed
and
took
it
.
<EOS>
The
Governor
,
who
had
so
bravely
defended
it
in
the
former
Seige
,
fortunately
for
him
had
been
remov'd
;
and
Francis
Valero
,
now
in
his
Place
,
was
made
Prisoner
of
War
with
all
his
Garrison
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
taking
the
Town
,
they
erected
Batteries
against
the
Castle
,
which
they
kept
ply'd
with
incessant
Fire
,
both
from
Cannon
and
Mortars
.
<EOS>
But
what
most
of
all
plagu'd
us
,
and
did
us
most
Mischief
,
was
the
vast
showers
of
Stones
sent
among
the
Garrison
from
their
Mortars
.
<EOS>
These
,
terrible
in
Bulk
and
Size
,
did
more
Execution
than
all
the
rest
put
together
.
<EOS>
The
Garrison
could
not
avoid
being
somewhat
disheartened
at
this
uncommon
way
of
Rencounter
;
yet
,
to
a
Man
,
dedar'd
against
hearkening
to
any
Proposals
of
Surrender
,
the
Governor
excepted
;
who
having
selected
more
Treasure
than
he
could
properly
,
or
justly
call
his
own
,
was
the
only
Person
that
seem'd
forward
for
such
a
Motion
.
<EOS>
He
had
more
than
once
thrown
out
Expressions
of
such
a
Nature
,
but
without
any
effect
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
having
at
last
secretly
obtained
a
peculiar
Capitulation
for
himself
,
Bag
,
and
Baggage
;
the
Garrison
was
sacrific'd
to
his
private
Interest
,
and
basely
given
up
Prisoners
of
War
.
<EOS>
By
these
Means
indeed
he
saved
his
Money
,
but
lost
his
Reputation
;
and
soon
after
,
Life
it
self
.
<EOS>
And
sure
every
Body
will
allow
the
latter
loss
to
be
least
,
who
will
take
Pains
to
consider
,
that
it
screened
him
from
the
consequential
Scrutinies
of
a
Council
of
War
,
which
must
have
issued
as
the
just
Reward
of
his
Demerits
.
  
<EOS>
The
Garrison
being
thus
unaccountably
delivered
up
and
made
Prisoners
,
were
dispersed
different
ways
:
Some
into
Castile
,
others
as
far
as
Oviedo
,
in
the
Kingdom
of
Leon
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
having
received
a
Contusion
in
my
Breast
;
I
was
under
a
necessity
of
being
left
behind
with
the
Enemy
,
till
I
should
be
in
a
Condition
to
be
remov'd
,
and
<EOS>
when
that
time
came
,
I
found
my
self
agreeably
ordered
to
Valencia
.
  
<EOS>
As
Prisoner
of
War
I
must
now
bid
adieu
to
the
active
Part
of
the
military
Life
;
and
hereafter
concern
my
self
with
Descriptions
of
Countries
,
Towns
,
Palaces
,
and
Men
,
instead
of
Battles
.
<EOS>
However
,
if
I
take
in
my
way
Actions
of
War
,
founded
on
the
best
Authorities
,
I
hope
my
Interspersing
such
will
be
no
disadvantage
to
my
now
more
pacifick
MEMOIRS
.
  
<EOS>
So
soon
as
I
arriv'd
at
Valencia
,
I
wrote
to
our
Pay
-
master
Mr.
Mead
,
at
Barcelona
,
letting
him
know
,
that
I
was
become
a
Prisoner
,
wounded
,
and
in
want
of
Money
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
even
all
those
Circumstances
prevail
on
me
to
think
it
long
before
he
returned
a
favourable
Answer
,
in
an
Order
to
Monsieur
Zoulicafre
,
a
Banker
,
to
pay
me
on
Sight
fifty
Pistoles
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
same
Letter
he
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
those
fifty
Pistoles
were
a
Present
to
me
from
General
(
afterward
Earl
)
Stanhope
;
and
so
indeed
I
found
it
,
when
I
return'd
into
England
,
my
Account
not
being
charged
with
any
part
of
it
:
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
the
only
Test
I
received
of
that
generous
Earl
's
Generosity
.
<EOS>
And
where
's
the
Wonder
,
as
the
World
is
compell'd
to
own
,
that
Heroick
Actions
and
Largeness
of
Soul
ever
did
discover
and
amply
distinguish
the
genuine
Branches
of
that
illustrious
Family
.
  
<EOS>
This
Recruit
to
me
however
was
the
more
generous
for
being
seasonable
.
<EOS>
Benefits
are
always
doubled
in
their
being
easily
conferr'd
<EOS>
and
well
tim'd
;
and
with
such
an
Allowance
as
I
constantly
had
by
the
order
of
King
Philip
,
as
Prisoner
of
War
,
viz
.
<EOS>
eighteen
Ounces
of
Mutton
per
diem
for
my
self
,
and
nine
for
my
Man
,
with
Bread
and
Wine
in
proportion
,
and
especially
in
such
a
Situation
;
all
this
I
say
was
sufficient
to
invite
a
Man
to
be
easy
,
and
almost
forget
his
want
of
Liberty
,
and
much
more
so
to
me
if
it
be
consider'd
,
that
,
that
want
of
Liberty
consisted
only
in
being
debarr'd
from
leaving
the
pleasantest
City
in
all
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
Here
I
met
with
the
French
Engineer
,
who
made
the
Mine
under
the
Rock
of
the
Castle
at
Alicant
.
<EOS>
That
fatal
Mine
,
which
blew
up
General
Richards
,
Colonel
Syburg
,
Colonel
Thornicroft
,
and
at
least
twenty
more
Officers
.
<EOS>
And
yet
by
the
Account
,
that
Engineer
gave
me
,
their
Fate
was
their
own
choosing
:
<EOS>
The
General
,
who
commanded
at
that
Siege
being
more
industrious
to
save
them
,
than
they
were
to
be
say'd
:
<EOS>
He
endeavour'd
it
<EOS>
many
ways
<EOS>
:
He
sent
them
word
of
the
Mine
,
and
their
readiness
to
spring
it
;
he
over
and
over
sent
them
Offers
of
Leave
to
come
,
and
take
a
view
of
it
,
and
inspect
it
:
Notwithstanding
all
which
,
tho
'
Colonel
Thornicroft
,
and
Captain
Page
,
a
French
Engineer
,
in
the
Service
of
King
Charles
,
pursued
the
Invitation
,
and
were
permitted
to
view
it
,
yet
would
they
not
believe
;
but
reported
on
their
Return
,
that
it
was
a
sham
Mine
,
a
feint
only
to
intimidate
'em
to
a
Surrender
,
all
the
Bags
being
fill'd
with
Sand
instead
of
Gun
-
powder
.
  
<EOS>
The
very
Day
on
which
the
Besiegers
design'd
to
spring
the
Mine
,
they
gave
Notice
of
it
;
and
the
People
of
the
Neighbourhood
ran
up
in
Crowds
to
an
opposite
Hill
in
order
to
see
it
:
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
altho
'
those
in
the
Castle
saw
all
this
,
they
still
remain'd
<EOS>
so
infatuated
,
as
to
imagine
it
all
done
only
to
affright
'em
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
fatal
Mine
was
sprung
,
and
all
who
were
upon
that
Battery
lost
their
Lives
;
and
among
them
those
I
first
mentioned
.
<EOS>
The
very
Recital
hereof
made
me
think
within
my
self
,
who
can
resist
his
Fate
?
  
<EOS>
That
Engineer
added
further
,
that
it
was
with
an
incredible
Difficulty
,
that
he
prepar'd
<EOS>
that
Mine
;
that
there
were
in
the
Concavity
thirteen
hundred
Barrels
of
Powder
;
notwithstanding
which
,
it
made
no
great
Noise
without
,
whatever
it
might
do
inwardly
;
that
only
taking
away
what
might
be
not
improperly
term'd
<EOS>
an
Excrescence
in
the
Rock
,
the
Heave
on
the
Blast
had
render'd
<EOS>
the
Castle
rather
stronger
on
that
Side
than
it
was
before
,
a
Crevice
or
Crack
which
had
often
occasioned
Apprehensions
being
thereby
wholly
clos'd
and
firm
.
  
<EOS>
Some
further
Particulars
I
soon
after
had
from
Colonel
Syburg
's
Gentleman
;
who
seeing
me
at
the
Play
-
house
,
challenged
me
,
tho
'
at
that
Time
unkown
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
that
the
Night
preceeding
the
unfortunate
Catastrophe
of
his
Master
,
he
was
waiting
on
him
in
the
Casemet
,
where
he
observed
,
sometime
before
the
rest
of
the
Company
took
notice
of
it
,
that
General
Richards
appeared
very
pensive
and
thoughtful
,
that
the
whole
Night
long
he
was
pester'd
with
,
and
could
not
get
rid
of
a
great
Flie
,
which
was
perpetually
buzzing
about
his
Ears
and
Head
,
to
the
vexation
and
disturbance
of
the
rest
of
the
Company
,
as
well
as
the
General
himself
;
that
in
the
Morning
,
when
they
went
upon
the
Battery
,
under
which
the
Mine
was
,
the
General
made
many
offers
of
going
off
;
but
Colonel
Syburg
,
who
was
got
a
little
merry
,
and
the
rest
out
of
a
Bravado
,
would
stay
,
and
would
not
let
the
General
stir
;
that
at
last
it
was
propos'd
by
Colonel
Syburg
to
have
the
other
two
Bottles
to
the
Queen
's
Health
,
after
which
he
promised
they
would
all
go
off
together
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
my
Relator
,
Syburg
's
Gentleman
,
said
,
he
was
sent
to
fetch
the
stipulated
two
Bottles
;
returning
with
which
,
Captain
Daniel
Weaver
,
within
thirty
or
forty
Yards
of
the
Battery
,
ran
by
him
,
vowing
,
he
was
resolv'd
to
drink
the
Queen
's
Health
with
them
;
but
his
Feet
were
scarce
on
the
Battery
,
when
the
Mine
was
sprung
,
which
took
him
away
with
the
rest
of
the
Company
;
while
Major
Harding
now
a
Justice
in
Westminster
coming
that
very
Moment
off
Duty
,
exchang'd
Fates
.
  
<EOS>
If
Predestination
,
in
the
Eyes
of
many
,
is
an
unaccountable
Doctrine
,
what
better
Account
can
the
wisest
give
of
this
Fatality
?
<EOS>
Or
to
what
else
shall
we
impute
the
Issue
of
this
whole
Transaction
?
<EOS>
That
Men
shall
be
solicited
to
their
Safety
;
suffered
to
survey
the
Danger
they
were
threatened
with
;
among
many
other
Tokens
of
its
approaching
Certainty
,
see
such
a
Concourse
of
People
crowding
to
be
Spectators
of
their
impending
Catastrophe
;
and
after
all
this
,
so
infatuated
to
stay
on
the
fatal
Spot
<EOS>
the
fetching
up
of
the
other
two
Bottles
;
whatever
it
may
to
such
as
never
think
,
to
such
as
plead
an
use
of
Reason
,
it
must
administer
Matter
worthy
of
the
sedatest
Consideration
.
  
<EOS>
Being
now
pretty
well
recover'd
of
my
Wounds
,
I
was
by
Order
of
the
Governor
of
Valencia
,
removed
to
Sainte
Clemente
de
la
Mancha
,
a
Town
somewhat
more
Inland
,
and
consequently
esteem'd
more
secure
than
a
Semi
-
Seaport
.
<EOS>
Here
I
remain'd
under
a
sort
of
Pilgrimage
upwards
of
three
Years
.
<EOS>
To
me
as
a
Stranger
divested
of
Acquaintance
or
Friend
(
for
at
that
instant
<EOS>
I
was
sole
Prisoner
there
)
at
first
it
<EOS>
appear'd
<EOS>
such
,
tho
'
in
a
very
small
compass
of
Time
,
I
luckily
found
it
made
quite
otherwise
by
an
agreeable
Conversation
.
  
<EOS>
SAINTE
Clemente
de
la
Mancha
,
is
rendered
famous
by
the
renown'd
Don
Michael
Cerviantes
,
who
in
his
facetious
but
satyrical
Romance
,
has
fix'd
it
<EOS>
the
Seat
and
Birth
Place
of
his
Hero
Don
Quixot
.
  
<EOS>
The
Gentlemen
of
this
Place
are
the
least
Priest
-
ridden
or
Sons
of
Bigotry
,
of
any
that
I
met
with
in
all
Spain
;
of
which
in
my
Conversation
with
them
<EOS>
I
had
daily
Instances
.
<EOS>
Among
many
others
,
an
Expression
that
fell
from
Don
Felix
Pacheco
,
a
Gentleman
of
the
best
Figure
thereabout
,
and
of
a
very
plentiful
Fortune
,
shall
now
suffice
.
<EOS>
I
was
become
very
intimate
with
him
;
and
we
us'd
often
to
converse
together
with
a
Freedom
too
dangerous
to
be
common
in
a
Country
so
enslav'd
by
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
Asking
me
one
Day
in
a
sort
of
a
jocose
manner
,
who
,
in
my
Opinion
,
had
done
the
greatest
Miracles
that
ever
were
heard
of
?
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
answer'd
,
Jesus
Christ
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
true
,
"
says
he
,
"
Jesus
Christ
did
great
Miracles
,
and
a
great
one
it
was
to
feed
five
Thousand
People
with
two
or
three
small
Fishes
,
and
a
like
number
of
Loaves
:
<EOS>
But
Saint
Francis
,
the
Founder
of
the
Franciscan
Order
,
has
found
out
a
way
to
feed
daily
one
hundred
Thousand
Lubbards
with
nothing
at
all
"
;
meaning
the
Franciscans
,
the
Followers
of
Saint
Francis
,
who
have
no
visible
Revenues
;
yet
in
their
way
of
Living
come
up
to
,
if
they
do
not
exceed
any
other
Order
.
  
<EOS>
Another
Day
talking
of
the
Place
,
it
naturally
led
us
into
a
Discourse
of
the
Knight
of
la
Mancha
,
Don
Quixot
.
<EOS>
At
which
time
he
told
me
,
that
in
his
Opinion
,
that
Work
was
a
perfect
Paradox
,
being
the
best
and
the
worst
Romance
,
that
ever
was
wrote
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
,
"
says
he
,
"
tho
'
<EOS>
it
must
infallibly
please
every
Man
,
that
has
any
taste
of
Wit
;
yet
has
it
had
such
a
fatal
Effect
upon
the
Spirits
of
my
Countrymen
,
that
every
Man
of
Wit
must
ever
resent
;
for
,
"
continu'd
<EOS>
he
,
"
before
the
Appearance
in
the
World
of
that
Labour
of
Cerviantes
,
it
was
next
to
an
Impossibility
for
a
Man
to
walk
the
Streets
with
any
Delight
,
or
without
Danger
.
<EOS>
There
were
seen
so
many
Cavaliero
's
prancing
and
curvetting
before
the
Windows
of
their
Mistresses
,
that
a
Stranger
would
have
imagin'd
<EOS>
the
whole
Nation
to
have
been
nothing
less
than
a
Race
of
Knight
Errants
.
<EOS>
But
after
the
World
became
a
little
acquainted
with
that
notable
History
;
the
Man
that
was
seen
in
that
once
celebrated
Drapery
,
was
pointed
at
as
a
Don
Quixot
,
and
found
himself
the
Jest
of
High
and
Low
.
<EOS>
And
I
verily
believe
,
"
added
he
,
"
that
to
this
,
and
this
only
we
owe
that
dampness
and
poverty
of
Spirit
,
which
has
run
thro
'
all
our
Councils
for
a
Century
past
,
so
little
agreeable
to
those
nobler
Actions
of
our
famous
Ancestors
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
many
of
these
lesser
sorts
of
Confidences
,
Don
Felix
recommended
me
to
a
Lodging
next
Door
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
a
Widow
's
,
who
had
one
only
Daughter
,
her
House
just
opposite
to
a
Francisan
Nunnery
.
<EOS>
Here
I
remain'd
somewhat
upwards
of
two
Years
;
all
which
time
,
lying
in
my
Bed
,
I
could
hear
the
Nuns
early
in
the
Morning
at
their
Matins
,
and
late
in
the
Evening
at
their
Vespers
,
with
Delight
enough
to
my
self
,
and
without
the
least
Indecency
in
the
World
in
my
Thoughts
of
them
.
<EOS>
Their
own
Divine
Employ
too
much
<EOS>
employ'd
<EOS>
every
Faculty
of
mine
to
entertain
any
Thing
inconsentaneous
or
offensive
.
  
<EOS>
This
my
Neighbourhood
to
the
Nunnery
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
seeing
two
Nuns
invested
;
and
in
this
I
must
do
a
Justice
to
the
whole
Country
,
to
acknowledge
,
that
a
Stranger
who
is
curious
(
I
would
impute
it
rather
to
their
hopes
of
Conversion
,
than
to
their
Vanity
)
<EOS>
shall
be
admitted
to
much
greater
Freedoms
in
their
religious
Pageantries
,
than
any
Native
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
these
Nuns
was
of
the
first
Quality
,
which
render'd
the
Ceremony
more
remarkably
fine
.
<EOS>
The
manner
of
investing
them
was
thus
:
In
the
Morning
her
Relations
and
Friends
all
met
at
her
Father
's
House
;
<EOS>
whence
,
she
being
attir'd
<EOS>
in
her
most
sumptuous
Apparel
,
and
a
Coronet
plac'd
on
her
Head
,
they
attended
her
,
in
Cavalcade
,
to
the
Nunnery
,
the
Streets
and
Windows
being
crowded
,
and
fill'd
with
Spectators
of
all
sorts
.
  
<EOS>
So
soon
as
she
enter'd
<EOS>
the
Chapel
belonging
to
the
Nunnery
,
she
kneel'd
down
,
and
with
an
appearance
of
much
Devotion
,
saluted
the
Ground
;
then
rising
up
,
she
advanced
a
Step
or
two
farther
,
when
on
her
Knees
she
repeated
the
Salutes
:
<EOS>
This
done
she
approached
to
the
Altar
,
where
she
remained
till
Mass
was
over
:
After
which
,
a
Sermon
was
preach'd
by
one
of
the
Priests
in
Praise
,
or
rather
in
an
exalted
Preference
of
a
single
Life
.
<EOS>
The
Sermon
being
over
,
the
Nun
elect
fell
down
on
her
Knees
before
the
Altar
;
and
after
some
short
mental
Oraisons
,
rising
again
,
she
withdrew
into
an
inner
Room
,
where
stripping
off
all
her
rich
Attire
,
she
put
on
her
Nun
's
Weeds
:
In
which
making
her
Appearance
,
she
,
again
kneeling
,
offer'd
up
some
private
Devotions
;
which
being
over
,
she
was
led
to
the
Door
of
the
Nunnery
,
where
the
Lady
and
the
rest
of
the
Nuns
stood
ready
to
receive
her
with
open
Arms
.
<EOS>
Thus
enter'd
,
the
Nuns
conducted
her
into
the
Quire
,
where
after
they
had
entertained
her
with
Singing
,
and
playing
upon
the
Organ
,
the
Ceremony
concluded
,
and
every
one
departed
to
their
proper
Habitations
.
  
<EOS>
The
very
same
Day
of
the
Year
ensuing
the
Relations
and
Friends
of
the
fair
Novitiate
meet
again
in
the
Chapel
of
the
Nunnery
,
where
the
Lady
Abbess
brings
her
out
,
and
delivers
her
to
them
.
<EOS>
Then
again
is
there
a
Sermon
preach'd
on
the
same
Subject
as
at
first
;
which
being
over
,
she
is
brought
up
to
the
Altar
,
in
a
decent
,
but
plain
Dress
,
the
fine
Apparel
,
which
she
put
off
on
her
Initiation
,
being
deposited
on
one
side
of
the
Altar
,
and
her
Nun
's
Weeds
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Here
the
Priest
in
Latin
cries
,
Utrum
horum
mavis
,
accipe
:
to
which
she
answers
,
as
her
Inclination
,
or
as
her
Instruction
directs
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
,
after
this
her
Year
of
Probation
,
show
any
Dislike
,
she
is
at
Liberty
to
come
again
into
the
World
:
<EOS>
But
if
aw'd
by
Fear
(
as
too
often
is
the
Case
)
or
won
by
Expectation
,
or
present
real
Inclination
,
she
makes
choice
of
the
Nun
's
Weeds
,
she
is
immediately
invested
,
and
must
never
expect
to
appear
again
in
the
World
out
of
the
Walls
of
the
Nunnery
.
<EOS>
The
young
Lady
I
thus
saw
invested
was
very
beautiful
,
and
sang
the
best
of
any
in
the
Nunnery
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
in
the
Town
three
Nunneries
,
and
a
Convent
to
every
one
of
them
;
viz
.
<EOS>
one
of
Jesuits
,
one
of
Carmelites
,
and
the
other
of
Franciscans
.
<EOS>
Let
me
not
be
so
far
mistaken
to
have
this
taken
by
way
of
Reflection
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
Whatever
some
of
our
Rakes
of
the
Town
may
assert
,
I
freely
declare
,
that
I
never
saw
in
any
of
the
Nunneries
(
of
which
I
have
seen
many
both
in
Spain
and
other
Parts
of
the
World
)
<EOS>
any
thing
like
indecent
Behaviour
,
that
might
give
occasion
for
Satyr
or
Disesteem
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
there
may
be
Accidents
,
that
may
lead
to
a
Misinterpretation
,
of
which
I
remember
a
very
untoward
Instance
in
Alicant
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
English
Forces
first
laid
Siege
to
that
Town
,
the
Priests
,
who
were
apprehensive
of
it
,
having
been
long
since
made
sensible
of
the
profound
Regard
to
Chastity
and
Modesty
of
us
Hereticks
,
by
the
ignominious
Behaviour
of
certain
Officers
at
Rota
and
Porta
St.
Maria
,
the
Priests
,
I
say
,
had
taken
care
to
send
away
privately
all
the
Nuns
to
Majorca
.
<EOS>
But
that
the
Heretick
Invaders
might
have
no
Jealousy
of
it
,
the
fair
Curtezans
of
the
Town
were
admitted
to
supply
their
Room
.
<EOS>
The
Officers
,
both
of
Land
and
Sea
,
as
was
by
the
Friars
pre
-
imagin'd
,
on
taking
the
Town
and
Castle
,
immediately
repair'd
to
the
Grates
of
the
Nunnery
,
toss'd
over
their
Handkercheifs
,
Nosegays
,
and
other
pretty
Things
;
all
which
were
,
doubtless
,
very
graciously
received
by
those
imaginary
Recluses
.
<EOS>
Thence
came
it
to
pass
,
that
in
the
space
of
a
Month
or
less
,
you
could
hardly
fall
into
Comany
of
any
one
of
our
younger
Officers
,
of
either
sort
,
but
the
Discourse
,
if
it
might
deserve
the
Name
,
was
concerning
these
beautiful
Nuns
;
and
you
wou'd
have
imagin'd
<EOS>
the
Price
of
these
Ladies
as
well
known
as
that
of
Flesh
in
their
common
Markets
.
<EOS>
Others
,
as
well
as
my
self
,
have
often
endeavour'd
to
disabuse
those
Glorioso
's
,
but
all
to
little
purpose
,
till
more
sensible
Tokens
convinced
them
,
that
the
Nuns
,
of
whose
Favours
they
so
much
boasted
,
could
hardly
be
perfect
Virgins
,
tho
'
in
a
Cloyster
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
apt
to
think
,
those
who
would
palm
upon
the
World
like
vicious
Relations
of
Nuns
and
Nunneries
,
do
it
on
much
like
Grounds
.
<EOS>
Not
that
there
are
wanting
Instances
of
Nunneries
disfranchis'd
,
and
even
demolish'd
,
upon
very
flagrant
Accounts
;
but
I
confine
myself
to
Spain
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
Town
of
la
Mancha
the
Corrigidore
always
has
his
Presidence
,
having
sixteen
others
under
his
Jurisdiction
,
of
which
Almanza
is
one
.
<EOS>
They
are
changed
every
three
Years
,
and
their
Offices
are
the
Purchase
of
an
excessive
Price
;
which
occasions
the
poor
People
's
being
extravagantly
fleeced
,
<EOS>
nothing
being
to
be
sold
but
at
the
Rates
they
impose
;
and
every
Thing
that
is
sold
paying
the
Corrigidore
an
Acknowledgment
in
specie
,
or
an
Equivalent
to
his
liking
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
was
here
,
News
came
of
the
Battle
of
Almanar
and
Saragosa
;
and
giving
the
Victory
to
that
Side
,
which
they
espous'd
(
that
of
King
Philip
)
<EOS>
they
made
very
great
Rejoycings
.
<EOS>
But
soon
,
alas
,
for
them
,
was
all
that
Joy
converted
into
Sorrow
:
<EOS>
The
next
Courier
evincing
,
that
the
Forces
of
King
Charles
had
been
victorious
in
both
Engagements
.
<EOS>
This
did
not
turn
to
my
present
Disadvantage
:
For
Convents
and
Nunneries
,
as
well
as
some
of
those
Dons
,
whom
afore
I
had
not
stood
so
well
with
,
strove
now
how
most
to
oblige
me
;
not
doubting
,
but
if
the
victorious
Army
should
march
that
way
,
it
might
be
in
my
Power
to
double
the
most
signal
of
their
Services
in
my
Friendship
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
an
Accident
fell
out
,
which
had
like
to
have
been
of
an
unhappy
Consequence
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
standing
in
Company
,
upon
the
Parade
,
when
a
most
surprizing
flock
of
Eagles
flew
over
our
Heads
,
where
they
hover'd
for
a
considerable
time
.
<EOS>
The
Novelty
struck
them
all
with
Admiration
,
as
well
as
my
self
.
<EOS>
But
I
,
less
accustomed
to
like
Spectacles
,
innocent
saying
,
that
in
my
Opinion
,
it
could
not
bode
any
good
to
King
Philip
,
because
the
Eagle
compos'd
the
Arms
of
Austria
;
some
busie
Body
,
in
hearing
,
went
and
inform'd
<EOS>
the
Corrigidore
of
it
.
<EOS>
Those
most
magisterial
Wretches
embrace
all
Occasions
of
squeezing
Money
;
and
more
especially
from
Strangers
.
<EOS>
However
finding
his
Expectations
disappointed
in
me
,
and
that
I
too
well
knew
the
length
of
his
Foot
,
to
let
my
Money
run
freely
;
he
sent
me
next
Day
to
Alercon
;
but
the
Governor
of
that
Place
having
had
before
Intelligence
,
that
the
English
Army
was
advancing
that
way
,
refus'd
to
receive
me
,
so
I
return'd
as
I
went
;
only
the
Gentlemen
of
the
Place
,
as
they
had
condol'd
<EOS>
the
first
,
congratulated
the
last
;
for
that
Corrigidore
stood
but
very
indifferently
in
their
Affections
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
a
warning
to
me
ever
after
,
how
I
made
use
of
English
Freedom
in
a
Spanish
Territory
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
had
attain'd
the
Acquaintance
of
most
of
the
Clergy
,
and
Religious
of
the
Place
;
so
particularly
I
had
my
aim
in
obtaining
that
of
the
Provincial
of
the
Carmelites
.
<EOS>
His
Convent
,
tho
'
small
,
was
exceeding
neat
;
but
what
to
me
was
much
more
agreeable
,
There
were
very
large
Gardens
belonging
to
it
,
which
often
furnished
me
with
Sallading
and
Fruit
,
and
much
oftner
with
Walks
of
Refreshment
,
the
most
satisfactory
Amusement
in
this
warm
Climate
.
<EOS>
This
Acquaintance
with
the
Provincial
was
by
a
little
Incident
soon
advanced
into
a
Friendship
;
which
was
thus
:
<EOS>
I
was
one
Day
walking
,
as
I
us'd
to
do
,
in
the
long
Gallery
of
the
Convent
,
when
observing
the
Images
of
the
Virgin
Mary
,
of
which
there
was
one
at
each
end
;
I
took
notice
that
one
had
an
Inscription
under
it
,
which
was
this
,
Ecce
,
Virgo
peperit
filium
:
but
the
other
had
no
Inscription
at
all
;
upon
which
,
I
took
out
my
Pencil
,
and
wrote
underneath
,
this
Line
:
  
Sponsa
Dei
,
patrisque
parens
,
&
filia
filii
.
  
<EOS>
The
Friars
,
who
at
a
little
distance
had
observed
me
,
as
soon
as
I
was
gone
,
came
up
and
read
what
I
had
writ
;
reporting
which
to
the
Provincial
,
he
order'd
them
to
be
writ
over
in
Letters
of
Gold
,
and
plac'd
just
as
I
had
put
'em
;
saying
,
doubtless
,
such
a
fine
Line
you
'd
proceed
from
nothing
less
than
Inspiration
.
<EOS>
This
secur'd
<EOS>
me
ever
after
his
and
their
Esteem
;
the
least
advantage
of
which
,
was
a
full
Liberty
of
their
Garden
for
all
manner
of
Fruit
,
Sallading
,
or
whatever
I
pleased
:
<EOS>
And
as
I
said
before
,
the
Gardens
were
too
fine
not
to
render
such
a
Freedom
acceptable
.
  
<EOS>
They
often
want
Rain
in
this
Country
:
To
supply
the
Defect
of
which
,
I
observed
in
this
Garden
,
as
well
as
others
,
an
Invention
not
unuseful
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
Well
in
the
Middle
of
the
Garden
,
and
over
that
a
Wheel
with
many
Pitchers
,
or
Buckets
,
one
under
another
,
which
Wheel
being
turned
round
by
an
Ass
,
the
Pitchers
scoop
up
the
Water
on
one
Side
,
and
throw
it
out
on
the
other
into
a
Trough
,
that
by
little
Channels
conveys
it
,
as
the
Gardiner
directs
,
into
every
part
of
the
Garden
.
<EOS>
By
this
Means
their
Flowers
and
their
Sallading
are
continually
refresh'd
,
and
preserved
from
the
otherwise
over
-
parching
Beams
of
the
Sun
.
  
<EOS>
The
Inquisition
,
in
almost
every
Town
in
Spain
(
and
more
especially
,
if
of
any
great
Account
)
has
its
Spies
,
or
Informers
,
for
treacherous
Intelligence
.
<EOS>
These
make
it
their
Business
to
ensnare
the
simple
and
unguarded
;
and
are
more
to
be
avoided
by
the
Stranger
,
than
the
Rattle
Snake
.
<EOS>
Nature
have
appointed
no
such
happy
Tokens
in
the
former
to
foreshew
the
Danger
.
<EOS>
I
had
Reason
to
believe
,
that
one
of
those
Vermin
once
made
his
Attack
upon
me
in
this
place
:
<EOS>
And
as
they
are
very
rarely
,
if
ever
known
to
the
Natives
themselves
,
I
being
a
Stranger
,
may
be
allowed
to
make
a
guess
by
Circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
walking
by
my
self
,
when
a
Person
,
wholly
unknown
to
me
,
giving
me
the
civil
Salute
of
the
Day
,
endeavour'd
to
draw
me
into
Conversation
.
<EOS>
After
Questions
had
passed
on
general
Heads
,
the
fellow
ensnaringly
asked
me
,
how
it
came
to
pass
,
that
<EOS>
I
show'd
<EOS>
so
little
Respect
to
the
Image
of
the
crucify'd
Jesus
,
as
I
pass'd
<EOS>
by
it
in
such
a
Street
,
naming
it
?
<EOS>
I
made
Answer
,
that
I
had
,
or
ought
to
have
him
always
in
my
Heart
crucified
.
<EOS>
To
that
he
made
no
Reply
:
But
proceeding
in
his
Interrogatories
,
question'd
me
next
,
whether
I
believ'd
a
Purgatory
?
<EOS>
I
evaded
the
Question
,
as
I
took
it
to
be
ensnaring
;
and
only
told
him
,
that
I
should
be
willing
to
hear
him
offer
any
Thing
that
might
convince
me
of
the
Truth
,
or
Probability
of
it
.
<EOS>
Truth
?
<EOS>
He
reply'd
in
a
Heat
<EOS>
:
There
never
yet
was
Man
<EOS>
so
Holy
as
to
enter
Heaven
without
first
passing
through
Purgatory
.
<EOS>
In
my
Opinion
,
said
I
,
there
will
be
no
Difficulty
in
convincing
a
reasonable
Man
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
What
mean
you
by
that
,
cry'd
the
Spy
?
<EOS>
I
mean
,
said
I
,
that
I
can
name
one
,
and
a
great
Sinner
too
,
who
went
into
Bliss
without
any
Visit
to
Purgatory
.
<EOS>
Name
him
,
if
you
can
,
reply'd
<EOS>
my
Querist
.
<EOS>
What
think
you
of
the
Thief
upon
the
Cross
,
said
I
?
<EOS>
to
whom
our
dying
Saviour
said
,
Hodie
eris
mecum
in
Paradiso
.
<EOS>
At
which
being
silenced
tho
'
not
convicted
,
he
turned
from
me
in
a
violent
Rage
,
and
left
me
to
my
self
.
  
<EOS>
What
increas'd
my
first
Suspicion
of
him
was
,
that
a
very
short
time
after
,
my
Friend
the
Provincial
sent
to
speak
with
me
;
and
repeating
all
Passages
between
the
holy
Spy
and
me
,
assur'd
<EOS>
me
that
he
had
been
forc'd
to
argue
in
my
Favour
,
and
tell
him
that
I
had
said
nothing
but
<EOS>
well
:
For
says
he
,
all
ought
to
have
the
Holy
Jesus
crucified
in
their
Hearts
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nevertheless
,
"
continu'd
he
,
"
it
is
a
commendable
and
good
Thing
to
have
him
represented
in
the
high
Ways
:
For
,
suppose
,
"
said
he
,
"
a
Man
was
going
upon
some
base
or
profligate
Design
,
the
very
Sight
of
a
cruficied
Saviour
may
happen
to
subvert
his
Resolution
,
and
deter
him
from
committing
Theft
,
Murder
,
or
any
other
of
the
deadly
Sins
.
"
<EOS>
And
thus
ended
that
Conference
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
upon
some
other
occasional
Conversation
after
,
the
Provincial
told
me
,
that
in
the
Carmelite
Nunnery
next
to
his
Convent
,
and
under
his
Care
,
there
was
a
Nun
,
that
was
Daughter
to
Don
Juan
of
Austria
;
if
so
,
her
Age
must
render
her
venerable
,
as
her
Quality
.
  
<EOS>
Taking
notice
one
Day
,
that
all
the
People
of
the
Place
fetch'd
<EOS>
their
Water
from
a
Well
without
the
Town
,
altho
'
they
had
many
seemingly
as
good
within
;
I
spoke
to
Don
Felix
of
it
,
who
gave
me
,
under
the
Seal
of
Secrecy
,
this
Reason
for
it
:
  
<EOS>
"
When
the
Seat
of
the
War
,
"
said
he
,
"
lay
in
these
Parts
,
the
French
Train
of
Artillery
was
commonly
quarter'd
<EOS>
in
this
Place
;
the
Officers
and
Soldiers
of
which
were
so
very
rampant
and
rude
,
in
attempting
to
debauch
our
Women
,
that
there
is
not
a
Well
within
the
Town
,
which
has
not
some
French
Mens
Bones
at
the
bottom
of
it
;
therefore
the
Natives
,
who
are
sensible
of
it
,
choose
rather
to
go
farther
a
field
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
<EOS>
Well
there
runs
a
little
Rivulet
,
which
gives
head
to
that
famous
River
call'd
the
Guadiana
;
which
running
for
some
Leagues
under
Ground
,
affords
a
pretence
for
the
Natives
to
boast
of
a
Bridge
on
which
they
feed
many
Thousands
of
Sheep
.
<EOS>
When
it
rises
again
,
it
is
a
fine
large
River
,
and
after
a
Currency
of
many
Leagues
,
empties
it
self
into
the
Atlantick
Ocean
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
military
Affairs
,
Almanar
and
Saragosa
were
Victories
so
compleat
,
that
no
Body
made
the
least
doubt
of
their
settling
the
Crown
of
Spain
upon
the
Head
of
Charles
the
Third
,
without
a
Rival
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
barely
the
Opinion
of
his
Friends
,
but
his
very
Enemies
resign'd
<EOS>
all
Hope
or
Expectation
in
favour
of
King
Philip
.
<EOS>
The
Castilians
,
his
most
faithful
Friends
,
entertain'd
no
other
Imagination
;
for
after
they
had
advis'd
,
and
prevail'd
that
the
Queen
with
the
Prince
of
Asturias
should
be
sent
to
Victoria
;
under
the
same
Despondency
,
and
a
full
Dispiritedness
,
they
gave
him
so
little
Encouragement
to
stay
in
Madrid
,
that
he
immediately
quitted
the
Place
,
with
a
Resolution
to
retire
into
his
Grandfather
's
Dominions
,
the
Place
of
his
Nativity
.
  
<EOS>
In
his
way
to
which
,
even
on
the
last
Day
's
Journey
,
it
was
his
great
good
Fortune
to
meet
the
Duke
of
Vendome
,
with
some
few
Troops
,
which
his
Grandfather
Lewis
XIV
.
<EOS>
of
France
had
order'd
to
his
Succour
,
under
that
Duke
's
Command
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
grievously
affected
at
such
an
unexpected
Catastrophe
;
nevertheless
,
he
left
nothing
unsaid
or
undone
,
that
might
induce
that
Prince
to
turn
back
;
and
at
length
prevailing
,
after
a
little
Rest
,
and
a
great
deal
of
Patience
,
by
the
Coming
in
of
his
scatter'd
Troops
,
and
some
few
he
could
raise
,
together
with
those
the
Duke
brought
with
him
,
he
once
more
saw
himself
at
the
Head
of
twenty
thousand
Men
.
  
<EOS>
While
Things
were
in
this
Manner
,
under
Motion
in
King
Philip
's
Favour
,
Charles
the
third
,
with
his
victorious
Army
,
advances
forward
,
and
enters
into
Madrid
,
of
which
he
made
General
Stanhope
Governor
.
<EOS>
And
even
here
the
Castilians
gave
full
Proof
of
their
Fidelity
to
their
Prince
;
even
at
the
Time
when
,
in
their
Opinion
,
his
Affairs
were
past
all
Hopes
of
Retrieve
,
they
themselves
having
,
by
their
Advice
,
contributed
to
his
Retreat
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
prudential
Acclamations
therefore
,
such
as
might
have
answered
the
Expectations
of
a
victorious
Prince
,
now
entering
into
their
Capital
,
their
Streets
were
all
in
a
profound
Silence
,
their
Balconies
unadorn'd
with
costly
Carpets
,
as
was
customary
on
like
Occasions
;
and
scarce
an
Inhabitant
to
be
seen
in
either
Shop
or
Window
.
  
<EOS>
This
doubtless
was
no
little
Mortification
to
a
conquering
Prince
;
however
his
Generals
were
wife
enough
to
keep
him
from
shewing
any
other
Tokens
of
Resentment
,
than
marching
through
the
City
with
Unconcern
,
and
taking
up
his
Quarters
at
Villa
-
verda
,
about
a
League
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
King
Charles
visited
,
in
his
March
,
the
Chapel
of
the
Lady
de
Atocha
,
where
finding
several
English
Colours
and
Standards
,
taken
in
the
Battle
of
Almanza
<EOS>
,
there
hung
up
;
he
ordered
'em
to
be
taken
down
,
and
restor'd
'em
to
the
English
General
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
current
Opinion
then
,
and
almost
universal
Consent
has
since
confirm'd
<EOS>
it
,
that
the
falsest
Step
in
that
whole
War
was
this
Advancement
of
King
Charles
to
Madrid
.
<EOS>
After
those
two
remarkable
Victories
at
Almanar
and
Saragosa
,
had
he
directed
his
March
to
Pampeluna
,
and
<EOS>
obtain'd
Possession
of
that
Place
,
or
some
other
near
it
,
he
had
not
only
stopt
all
Succours
from
coming
out
of
France
,
but
he
would
,
in
a
great
Measure
,
have
prevented
the
gathering
together
of
any
of
the
routed
and
dispers'd
Forces
of
King
Philip
:
<EOS>
And
it
was
the
general
Notion
of
the
Spaniards
,
I
convers'd
<EOS>
with
while
at
Madrid
,
that
had
King
Philip
once
again
set
his
Foot
upon
French
Land
,
Spain
would
never
have
been
brought
to
have
re
-
acknowledged
him
.
  
<EOS>
King
Charles
with
his
Army
having
<EOS>
stay'd
<EOS>
some
Time
about
Madrid
,
and
seeing
his
Expectations
of
the
Castilians
joining
him
not
at
all
answered
,
at
last
resolved
to
decamp
,
and
return
to
Saragosa
:
Accordingly
with
a
very
few
Troops
that
Prince
advanced
thither
;
while
the
main
Body
,
under
the
Command
of
the
Generals
Stanhope
and
Staremberg
,
passing
under
the
very
Walls
of
Madrid
,
held
on
their
March
towards
Aragon
.
  
<EOS>
After
about
three
Days
'
March
,
General
Stanhope
took
up
his
Quarters
at
Breuhiga
,
a
small
Town
half
wall'd
;
General
Staremberg
marching
three
Leagues
farther
,
to
Cisuentes
.
<EOS>
This
choice
of
Situation
of
the
two
several
Armies
not
a
little
puzzled
the
Politicians
of
those
Times
,
who
could
very
indifferently
account
for
the
English
General
's
lying
<EOS>
expos'd
in
an
open
Town
,
with
his
few
English
Forces
,
of
which
General
Harvey
's
Regiment
of
fine
Horse
might
be
deem'd
the
Main
;
and
General
Staremberg
encamping
three
Leagues
farther
off
the
Enemy
.
<EOS>
But
to
see
the
Vicissitudes
of
Fortune
,
to
which
the
Actions
of
the
bravest
,
by
an
untoward
Sort
of
Fatality
,
are
often
forced
to
contribute
!
<EOS>
None
,
who
had
been
Eye
-
witnesses
of
the
Bravery
of
either
of
those
Generals
at
the
Battles
of
Almanar
and
Saragosa
,
could
find
Room
to
call
in
question
either
their
Conduct
or
their
Courage
;
and
yet
in
this
March
,
and
this
Encampment
will
appear
a
visible
ill
Consequence
to
the
Affairs
of
the
Interest
they
fought
for
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Vendome
having
increas'd
<EOS>
the
Forces
which
he
brought
from
France
,
to
upwards
of
twenty
thousand
Men
,
marches
by
Madrid
directly
for
Breuhiga
,
where
his
Intelligence
inform'd
him
General
Stanhope
lay
,
and
that
so
secretly
as
well
as
swiftly
,
that
that
General
knew
nothing
of
it
,
nor
could
be
persuaded
to
believe
it
,
till
the
very
Moment
their
Bullets
from
the
Enemy
's
Cannon
convinc'd
<EOS>
him
of
the
Truth
.
<EOS>
Breuhiga
,
I
have
said
,
was
wall'd
only
on
one
Side
,
and
yet
on
that
very
side
the
Enemy
made
their
Attack
.
<EOS>
But
what
could
a
Handful
do
against
a
Force
so
much
superior
,
though
they
had
not
been
in
want
of
both
Powder
and
Ball
;
and
in
want
of
these
were
forc'd
to
make
use
of
Stones
against
all
Sorts
of
Ammunition
,
which
the
Enemy
ply'd
them
with
?
<EOS>
The
Consequence
answered
the
Deficiency
;
they
were
all
made
Prisoners
of
War
,
and
Harvey
's
Regiment
of
Horse
among
the
rest
;
which
,
to
augment
their
Calamity
,
was
immediately
remounted
by
the
Enemy
,
and
march'd
along
with
their
Army
to
attack
General
Staremberg
.
  
<EOS>
That
General
had
heard
somewhat
of
the
March
of
Vendome
;
and
waited
with
some
Impatience
to
have
the
Confirmation
of
it
from
General
Stanhope
,
who
lay
between
,
and
whom
he
lay
under
an
Expectation
of
being
joined
with
:
However
he
thought
it
not
improper
to
make
some
little
Advance
towards
him
;
and
accordingly
breaking
up
from
his
Camp
at
Cisuentes
,
he
came
back
to
Villa
viciosa
,
a
little
Town
between
Cisuentes
and
Breuhiga
;
there
he
found
Vendome
ready
to
attack
him
,
before
he
could
well
be
prepared
for
him
,
but
no
English
to
join
him
,
as
he
had
expected
;
nevertheless
,
the
Battle
was
hot
,
and
obstinately
fought
;
although
Staremberg
had
visibly
the
Advantage
,
having
beat
the
Enemy
at
least
a
League
from
their
Cannon
;
at
which
Time
hearing
of
the
Misfortune
of
Breuhiga
,
and
finding
himself
thereby
frustrated
of
those
expected
Succours
to
support
him
,
he
made
a
handsome
Retreat
to
Barcelona
,
which
in
common
Calculation
is
about
one
hundred
Leagues
,
without
any
Disturbance
of
an
Enemy
that
seem'd
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
his
Baggage
having
fallen
into
the
Hands
of
the
Enemy
,
at
the
Beginning
of
the
Fight
,
King
Philip
and
the
Duke
of
Vendome
generously
returned
it
unopen'd
,
and
untouched
,
in
acknowledgement
of
his
brave
Behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
like
to
have
omitted
one
material
Passage
,
which
I
was
very
credibly
informed
of
;
That
General
Carpenter
offered
to
have
gone
,
and
have
join'd
General
Staremberg
with
the
Horse
,
which
was
refus'd
him
.
<EOS>
This
was
certainly
an
Oversight
of
the
highest
Nature
;
since
his
going
would
have
strengthen'd
<EOS>
Staremberg
almost
to
the
Assurance
of
an
intire
Victory
;
whereas
his
Stay
was
of
no
manner
of
Service
,
but
quite
the
contrary
:
For
,
as
I
said
before
,
the
Enemy
,
by
re
-
mounting
the
English
Horse
(
which
perhaps
were
the
compleatest
of
any
Regiment
in
the
World
)
turn'd
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
the
Expression
,
the
Strength
of
our
Artillery
upon
our
Allies
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
Retreat
of
Staremberg
,
and
the
Surprize
at
Breuhiga
,
there
were
great
Rejoicings
at
Madrid
,
and
everywhere
else
,
where
King
Philip
's
Interest
prevailed
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
it
might
be
said
,
from
that
Day
the
Interest
of
King
Charles
look'd
<EOS>
with
a
very
lowering
Aspect
.
<EOS>
I
was
still
a
Prisoner
at
la
Mancha
,
when
this
News
arriv'd
;
and
very
sensibly
affected
at
that
strange
Turn
of
Fortune
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
bed
,
when
the
Express
pass'd
through
the
Town
,
in
order
to
convey
it
farther
;
and
in
the
Middle
of
the
Night
I
heard
a
certain
Spanish
Don
,
with
whom
,
a
little
before
,
I
had
had
some
little
Variance
,
thundering
at
my
Door
,
endeavouring
to
burst
it
open
,
with
,
as
I
had
Reason
to
suppose
,
no
very
favourable
Design
upon
me
.
<EOS>
But
my
Landlady
,
who
hitherto
had
always
been
kind
and
careful
,
calling
Don
Felix
,
and
some
others
of
my
Friends
together
,
sav'd
me
from
the
Fury
of
his
Designs
,
whatever
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
Among
other
Expressions
of
the
general
Joy
upon
this
Occasion
,
there
was
a
Bull
-
Feast
at
la
Mancha
;
which
being
much
beyond
what
I
saw
at
Valencia
,
I
shall
here
give
a
Description
of
.
<EOS>
These
Bull
-
Feasts
are
not
so
common
now
in
Spain
as
formerly
,
King
Philip
not
taking
much
Delight
in
them
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
as
soon
as
it
was
publish'd
here
,
that
there
was
to
be
one
,
no
other
Discourse
was
heard
;
and
in
the
Talk
of
the
Bulls
,
and
the
great
Preparations
for
the
Feast
,
Men
seem'd
to
have
lost
,
or
to
have
lay'd
aside
,
all
Thoughts
of
the
very
Occasion
.
<EOS>
A
Week
's
time
was
allow'd
<EOS>
for
the
Building
of
Stalls
for
the
Beasts
,
and
Scaffolds
for
the
Spectators
;
and
other
necessary
Preparations
for
the
setting
off
their
Joy
with
the
most
suitable
Splendour
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
Day
appointed
for
the
bringing
the
Bulls
into
Town
,
the
Cavalieroes
mounted
their
Horses
,
and
,
with
Spears
in
their
Hands
,
rode
out
of
Town
about
a
League
,
or
somewhat
more
to
meet
them
:
If
any
of
the
Bulls
break
from
the
Drove
,
and
make
an
Excursion
(
as
they
frequently
do
)
the
Cavaliero
that
can
make
him
return
again
to
his
Station
among
his
Companions
,
is
held
in
Honour
,
suitable
to
the
Dexterity
and
Address
<EOS>
he
performs
it
with
.
<EOS>
On
their
Entrance
into
the
Town
,
all
the
Windows
are
fill'd
with
Spectators
;
a
Pope
passing
in
grand
Procession
could
not
have
more
;
for
what
can
be
more
than
all
?
<EOS>
And
he
or
she
who
should
neglect
so
rare
a
Show
,
would
give
Occasion
to
have
his
or
her
Legitimacy
call'd
in
Question
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
come
to
the
Plaza
,
where
the
Stalls
and
Scaffolds
are
built
,
and
upon
which
the
Feats
of
Chivalry
are
to
be
performed
,
it
is
often
with
a
great
deal
of
Difficulty
that
the
Brutes
are
got
in
;
for
there
are
twelve
Stalls
,
one
for
every
Bull
,
and
as
their
Number
grows
less
by
the
enstalling
of
some
,
the
Remainder
often
prove
more
untractable
and
unruly
:
<EOS>
In
these
Stalls
they
are
kept
very
dark
,
to
render
them
fiercer
for
the
Day
of
Battle
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
first
of
the
Days
appointed
(
for
a
Bull
-
Feast
commonly
lasts
three
)
all
the
Gentry
of
the
Place
,
or
near
adjacent
,
resort
to
the
Plaza
in
their
most
gaudy
Apparel
,
every
one
vieing
in
making
the
most
glorious
Appearance
.
<EOS>
Those
in
the
lower
Ranks
provide
themselves
with
Spears
,
or
a
great
many
small
Darts
in
their
Hands
,
which
they
fail
not
to
cast
or
dart
,
whenever
the
Bull
by
his
Nearness
gives
them
an
Opportunity
.
<EOS>
So
that
the
poor
Creature
may
be
said
to
fight
,
not
only
with
the
Tauriro
(
or
Bullhunter
,
a
Person
always
hired
for
that
Purpose
)
but
with
the
whole
Multitude
in
the
lower
Class
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
All
being
seated
,
the
uppermost
Door
is
open'd
first
;
and
as
soon
as
ever
the
Bull
perceives
the
Light
,
out
<EOS>
he
comes
,
snuffing
up
the
Air
,
and
stareing
about
him
,
as
if
in
admiration
of
his
attendants
;
and
with
his
Tail
cock'd
up
,
he
spurns
the
Ground
with
his
Forefeet
,
as
if
he
intended
a
Challenge
to
his
yet
unappearing
Antagonist
.
<EOS>
Then
at
a
Door
appointed
for
that
purpose
,
enters
the
Tauriro
all
in
white
,
holding
a
Cloak
in
one
Hand
,
and
a
sharp
two
edged
Sword
in
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
Bull
no
sooner
sets
Eyes
upon
him
,
but
wildly
staring
,
he
moves
gently
towards
him
;
then
gradually
mends
his
pace
,
till
he
is
come
within
about
the
space
of
twenty
Yards
of
the
Tauriro
;
when
,
with
a
sort
of
Spring
,
he
makes
at
him
with
all
his
might
.
<EOS>
The
Tauriro
knowing
by
frequent
Experience
,
that
it
behoves
him
to
be
watchful
,
slips
aside
just
when
the
Bull
is
at
him
;
when
casting
his
Cloak
over
his
Horns
,
at
the
same
Moment
he
gives
him
a
slash
or
two
,
always
aiming
at
the
Neck
,
where
there
is
one
particular
Place
,
which
if
he
hit
,
he
knows
he
shall
easily
bring
him
to
the
Ground
.
<EOS>
I
my
Self
observ'd
<EOS>
the
truth
of
this
Experiment
made
upon
one
of
the
Bulls
,
who
receiv'd
no
more
than
one
Cut
,
which
happening
upon
the
fatal
Spot
,
<EOS>
so
stun'd
him
,
that
he
remain'd
<EOS>
perfectly
stupid
,
the
Blood
flowing
out
from
the
Wound
,
till
after
a
violent
Trembling
he
dropt
down
stone
dead
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
rarely
happens
,
and
the
poor
Creature
oftner
receives
many
Wounds
,
and
numberless
Darts
,
before
he
dies
.
<EOS>
Yet
whenever
he
feels
a
fresh
Wound
either
from
Dart
,
Spear
,
or
Sword
,
his
Rage
receives
addition
from
the
Wound
,
and
he
pursues
his
Tauriro
with
an
Increase
of
Fury
and
Violence
.
<EOS>
And
as
often
as
he
makes
at
his
Adversary
,
the
Tauriro
takes
care
with
the
utmost
of
his
Agility
to
avoid
him
,
and
reward
his
kind
Intention
with
a
new
Wound
.
  
<EOS>
Some
of
their
Bulls
will
play
their
Parts
much
better
than
others
:
But
the
best
must
die
.
<EOS>
For
when
they
have
behav'd
themselves
with
all
the
commendable
Fury
possible
;
if
the
Tauriro
is
spent
,
and
fail
of
doing
Execution
upon
him
,
they
set
Dogs
upon
him
:
<EOS>
Hough
him
and
stick
him
all
over
with
Darts
,
till
with
very
loss
of
Blood
he
puts
an
end
to
their
present
Cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
When
dead
,
a
Man
brings
in
two
Mules
dress'd
out
with
Bells
and
Feathers
,
and
fastening
a
Rope
about
his
Horns
,
draws
off
the
Bull
with
the
Shouts
and
Acclamations
of
the
Spectators
;
as
if
the
Infidels
had
been
drove
from
before
Ceuta
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
almost
forgot
another
very
common
piece
of
barbarous
Pleasure
at
these
Diversions
.
<EOS>
The
Tauriro
will
sometimes
stick
one
of
their
Bull
Spears
fast
in
the
Ground
,
aslant
,
but
levell'd
<EOS>
as
near
as
he
can
at
his
Chest
;
then
presenting
himself
to
the
Bull
,
just
before
the
point
of
the
Spear
,
on
his
taking
his
run
at
the
Tauriro
,
which
,
as
they
assur'd
<EOS>
me
,
he
always
does
with
<EOS>
his
Eyes
closed
<EOS>
,
the
Tauriro
slips
on
one
side
,
and
the
poor
Creature
runs
with
a
violence
often
to
stick
himself
,
and
sometimes
to
break
the
Spear
in
his
Chest
,
running
away
with
part
of
it
till
he
drop
.
  
<EOS>
This
Tauriro
was
accounted
one
of
the
best
in
Spain
;
and
indeed
I
saw
him
mount
the
back
of
one
of
the
Bulls
,
and
ride
on
him
,
slashing
and
cutting
,
till
he
had
quite
wearied
him
;
at
which
time
dismounting
,
he
kill'd
him
with
much
Ease
,
and
to
the
acclamatory
Satisfaction
of
the
whole
Concourse
<EOS>
:
For
variety
of
Cruelty
,
as
well
as
Dexterity
,
administers
to
their
Delight
.
  
<EOS>
The
Tauriroes
are
very
well
paid
;
and
in
Truth
so
they
ought
to
be
;
for
they
often
lose
their
Lives
in
the
Diversion
,
as
this
did
the
Year
after
in
the
way
of
his
Calling
.
<EOS>
Yet
is
it
a
Service
of
very
great
Profit
when
they
perform
dextrously
:
For
when
ever
they
do
any
Thing
remarkable
,
deserving
the
Notice
of
the
Spectators
,
they
never
fail
of
a
generous
Gratification
,
Money
being
thrown
down
to
'em
in
plenty
.
  
<EOS>
This
Feast
(
as
they
generally
do
)
lasted
three
Days
;
the
last
of
which
was
,
in
my
Opinion
,
much
before
either
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
On
this
,
a
young
Gentleman
,
whose
Name
was
Don
Pedro
Ortega
,
a
Person
of
great
Quality
,
perform'd
the
Exercise
on
Horseback
.
<EOS>
The
Seats
,
if
not
more
crowded
,
were
filled
with
People
of
better
Fashion
,
who
came
from
Places
at
a
distance
to
grace
the
noble
Tauriro
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
finely
mounted
,
and
made
a
very
graceful
Figure
;
but
as
when
the
Foot
Tauriro
engages
,
the
Bull
first
enters
,
so
in
the
Contest
the
Cavaliero
always
makes
his
Appearance
on
the
Plaza
before
the
Bull
.
<EOS>
His
Steed
was
a
manag'd
Horse
;
mounted
on
which
he
made
his
Entry
,
attended
by
four
Footmen
in
rich
Liveries
;
who
,
as
soon
as
their
Master
had
rid
round
,
and
paid
his
Devoirs
to
all
the
Spectators
,
withdrew
from
the
Dangers
they
left
him
expos'd
to
.
<EOS>
The
Cavaliero
having
thus
made
his
Bows
,
and
received
the
repeated
Vivas
of
that
vast
Concourse
,
march'd
with
a
very
stately
Air
to
the
very
middle
of
the
Plaza
,
there
standing
ready
to
receive
his
Enemy
at
coming
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
Door
being
open'd
,
the
Bull
appeared
;
and
as
I
thought
with
a
fiercer
and
more
threatning
Aspect
<EOS>
that
any
of
the
former
.
<EOS>
He
star'd
around
him
for
a
considerable
time
,
snuffing
up
the
Air
,
and
spurning
the
Ground
,
without
in
the
least
taking
notice
of
his
Antagonist
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
fixing
his
Eyes
upon
him
,
he
made
a
full
run
at
the
Cavaliero
,
which
he
most
dexterously
avoided
,
and
at
the
same
moment
of
time
,
passing
by
,
he
cast
a
Dart
that
stuck
in
his
Shoulders
.
<EOS>
At
this
the
Shouts
and
Vivas
were
repeated
;
and
I
observed
a
Handkerchief
wav'd
twice
or
thrice
,
which
,
as
I
afterwards
understood
,
was
a
Signal
from
the
Lady
of
his
Affections
,
that
she
had
beheld
him
with
Satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
took
notice
that
the
Cavaliero
endeavour'd
all
he
could
to
keep
aside
the
Bull
,
for
the
Advantage
of
the
Stroke
,
when
putting
his
Horse
on
a
full
Career
,
he
threw
another
Dart
,
which
fix'd
in
his
Side
,
and
so
enrag'd
<EOS>
the
Beast
,
that
he
seem'd
to
renew
his
Attacks
with
greater
Fury
.
<EOS>
The
Cavaliero
had
behav'd
himself
to
Admiration
,
and
<EOS>
escap'd
many
Dangers
;
with
the
often
repeated
Acclamations
of
Viva
,
Viva
;
when
at
last
the
enraged
Creature
getting
his
Horns
between
the
Horse
's
hinder
Legs
,
Man
and
Horse
came
both
together
to
the
Ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
expected
at
that
Moment
nothing
less
than
Death
could
be
the
Issue
;
when
to
the
general
Surprize
,
as
well
as
mine
,
the
very
civil
Brute
,
Author
of
all
the
Mischief
,
only
withdrew
to
the
other
Side
of
the
Plaza
,
where
he
stood
still
,
staring
about
him
as
if
he
knew
nothing
of
the
Matter
.
  
<EOS>
The
Cavaliero
was
carry'd
<EOS>
off
not
much
hurt
,
but
his
delicate
Beast
suffer'd
much
more
.
<EOS>
However
I
could
not
but
think
afterward
,
that
the
good
natur'd
Bull
came
short
of
fair
Play
.
<EOS>
If
I
may
be
pardon'd
<EOS>
the
Expression
,
he
had
<EOS>
us'd
his
Adversary
with
more
Humanity
than
he
met
with
;
at
least
,
since
,
after
he
had
the
Cavaliero
under
,
he
generously
forsook
him
;
I
think
he
might
have
pleaded
,
or
others
for
him
,
for
better
Treatment
than
he
after
met
with
.
  
<EOS>
For
as
the
Cavaliero
was
disabled
and
carry'd
<EOS>
off
,
the
Foot
Tauriro
enter'd
in
white
Accoutrements
,
as
before
;
but
he
flatter'd
himself
with
an
easier
Conquest
than
he
found
:
there
is
always
on
these
Occasions
,
when
he
apprehends
any
imminent
Danger
,
a
Place
of
Retreat
ready
for
the
Foot
Tauriro
;
and
well
for
him
there
was
so
;
this
Bull
oblig'd
him
over
and
over
to
make
Use
of
it
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
able
at
last
to
dispatch
him
,
without
a
general
Assistance
;
for
I
believe
I
speak
within
Compass
,
when
I
say
,
he
had
more
than
an
hundred
Darts
stuck
in
him
.
<EOS>
And
so
barbarously
was
he
mangled
,
and
flash'd
<EOS>
besides
,
that
,
in
my
Mind
,
I
could
not
but
think
King
Philip
in
the
Right
,
when
he
said
,
That
it
was
a
Custom
deserv'd
little
Encouragement
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
Tauridore
,
or
Bull
-
Feast
was
over
,
I
had
a
Mind
to
take
a
pleasant
Walk
to
a
little
Town
,
<EOS>
call'd
Minai
,
about
three
Leagues
off
;
but
I
was
scarce
got
out
of
la
Mancha
,
when
an
Acquaintance
meeting
me
,
ask'd
where
I
was
going
?
<EOS>
I
told
him
to
Minai
;
when
taking
me
by
the
Hand
,
Friend
Gorgio
,
says
he
in
Spanish
,
Come
back
with
me
;
you
shall
not
go
a
Stride
further
;
there
are
Picarons
that
Way
;
you
shall
not
go
.
<EOS>
Inquiring
,
as
we
went
back
,
into
his
Meaning
,
he
told
me
,
that
the
Day
before
,
a
Man
,
who
had
received
a
Sum
of
Money
in
Pistoles
at
la
Mancha
,
was
,
on
the
road
,
set
upon
by
some
,
who
had
got
notice
of
it
,
and
murdered
him
;
that
not
finding
the
Money
expected
about
him
(
for
he
had
cautiously
enough
left
it
in
a
Friend
's
Hands
at
la
Mancha
)
<EOS>
they
concluded
he
had
swallowed
it
;
and
therefore
they
ript
up
his
Belly
,
and
open'd
every
Gut
;
but
all
to
as
little
Purpose
.
<EOS>
This
diverted
my
Walk
for
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
But
some
little
Time
after
,
the
same
Person
inviting
me
over
to
the
same
Place
,
to
see
his
Melon
-
Grounds
,
which
in
that
Country
are
wonderful
fine
and
pleasant
;
I
accepted
his
Invitation
,
and
under
the
Advantage
of
his
Company
,
went
thither
.
<EOS>
On
the
Road
I
took
notice
of
a
Cross
newly
erected
,
and
a
Multitude
of
small
stones
around
the
Foot
of
it
:
Asking
the
Meaning
whereof
,
my
Friend
told
me
,
that
it
was
rais'd
for
a
Person
there
murder'd
(
as
is
the
Custom
throughout
Spain
)
and
that
every
good
Catholick
passing
by
,
held
it
his
Duty
to
cast
a
Stone
upon
the
Place
,
in
Detestation
of
the
Murder
.
<EOS>
I
had
often
before
taken
Notice
of
many
such
Crosses
:
but
never
till
then
knew
the
Meaning
of
their
Erection
,
or
the
Reason
of
the
Heaps
of
Stones
around
them
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
Place
in
all
Spain
more
famous
for
good
Wine
than
Sainte
Clemente
de
la
Mancha
;
nor
is
it
any
where
sold
cheaper
:
<EOS>
For
as
it
is
only
an
inland
Town
,
near
no
navigable
River
,
and
the
People
temperate
to
a
Proverb
,
great
Plenty
,
and
<EOS>
a
small
Vend
must
consequently
make
it
cheap
.
<EOS>
The
Wine
here
is
so
famous
,
that
,
when
I
came
to
Madrid
,
I
saw
wrote
over
the
Doors
of
host
Houses
that
sold
Wine
,
Vino
Sainte
Clemente
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
Temperance
of
the
People
,
I
must
say
,
that
notwithstanding
those
two
excellent
Qualities
of
good
and
cheap
,
I
never
saw
,
all
the
three
Years
I
was
Prisoner
there
,
any
one
Person
overcome
with
Drinking
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
there
may
be
a
Reason
,
and
a
political
one
,
assign'd
for
that
Abstemiousness
of
theirs
,
which
is
this
,
That
if
any
Man
,
upon
any
Occasion
,
should
be
brought
in
as
an
Evidence
against
you
,
if
you
can
prove
that
he
was
ever
drunk
,
it
will
invalidate
his
whole
Evidence
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
but
think
this
a
grand
Improvement
upon
the
Spartans
.
<EOS>
They
made
their
Slaves
purposely
drunk
,
to
shew
their
Youth
the
Folly
of
the
Vice
by
the
sottish
Behaviour
of
their
Servants
under
it
:
But
<EOS>
they
never
reach'd
to
that
noble
height
of
laying
a
Penalty
upon
the
Aggressor
,
or
of
discouraging
a
voluntary
Impotence
of
Reason
by
a
disreputable
Impotence
of
Interest
.
<EOS>
The
Spaniard
therefore
,
in
my
Opinion
,
in
this
exceeds
the
Spartan
,
as
much
as
a
natural
Beauty
exceeds
one
procured
by
Art
;
for
tho
'
Shame
may
somewhat
influence
some
few
,
Terrour
is
of
force
to
deter
all
.
<EOS>
A
Man
,
we
have
seen
it
,
may
shake
Hands
with
Shame
;
but
<EOS>
Interest
,
says
another
Proverb
,
will
never
lye
.
<EOS>
A
wise
Institution
therefore
doubtless
is
this
of
the
Spaniard
;
but
such
as
I
fear
will
never
take
Place
in
Germany
,
Holland
,
France
,
or
Great
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
But
though
I
commend
their
Temperance
,
I
would
not
be
thought
by
any
Means
to
approve
of
their
Bigotry
.
<EOS>
If
there
may
be
such
a
Thing
as
Intemperance
in
Religion
,
I
much
fear
their
Ebriety
in
that
will
be
found
to
be
over
-
measure
.
<EOS>
Under
the
notion
of
Devotion
,
I
have
seen
Men
among
'em
,
and
of
Sense
too
,
guilty
of
the
grossest
Intemperancies
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
common
to
be
a
rarity
to
see
their
Dons
of
the
prime
Quality
as
well
as
those
of
the
lower
Ranks
,
upon
meeting
a
Priest
in
the
open
Streets
,
condescend
to
take
up
the
lower
part
of
his
Vestment
,
and
salute
it
with
Eyes
erected
as
if
they
look'd
<EOS>
upon
it
as
the
Seal
of
Salvation
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
Ave
-
Bell
is
heard
,
the
Hearer
must
down
on
his
Knees
upon
the
very
Spot
;
nor
is
he
allowed
the
small
Indulgence
of
deferring
a
little
,
till
he
can
recover
a
clean
Place
;
<EOS>
Dirtiness
excuses
not
,
nor
will
dirty
Actions
by
any
means
exempt
.
<EOS>
This
is
so
notorious
,
that
even
at
the
Play
-
house
,
in
the
middle
of
a
Scene
,
on
the
first
sound
of
the
Bell
,
the
Actors
drop
their
Discourse
,
the
Auditors
supersede
the
indulging
of
their
unsanctified
Ears
,
and
all
on
their
Hearts
,
quite
a
different
way
,
to
what
they
just
before
had
been
employ'd
in
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
tho
<EOS>
'
they
pretend
in
all
this
to
an
extraordinary
Measure
of
Zeal
and
real
Devotion
;
no
Man
,
that
lives
among
them
any
time
,
can
be
a
Proselyte
to
them
without
immolating
his
Senses
and
his
Reason
:
Yet
I
must
confess
,
while
I
have
seen
them
thus
deludeing
themselves
with
Ave
Marias
,
I
<EOS>
you
'd
not
refrain
throwing
up
my
Eyes
to
the
only
proper
Object
of
Adoration
,
in
commiseration
of
such
Delusions
.
  
<EOS>
The
Hours
of
the
Ave
Bell
,
are
eight
and
twelve
in
the
Morning
,
and
six
in
the
Evening
.
<EOS>
They
pretend
at
the
first
to
fall
down
in
beg
that
God
would
be
pleas'd
to
prosper
them
in
all
things
they
go
about
that
Day
.
<EOS>
At
twelve
they
return
Thanks
for
their
Preservation
to
that
time
;
and
at
six
for
that
of
the
whole
Day
.
<EOS>
After
which
,
one
would
think
that
they
imagine
themselves
at
perfect
Liberty
;
and
their
open
Gallantries
perfectly
countenance
the
Imagination
:
for
tho
'
Adultery
is
look'd
upon
as
a
grievous
Crime
,
and
punish'd
accordingly
;
yet
Fornication
is
softened
with
the
title
of
a
Venial
Sin
,
and
they
seem
to
practise
it
under
that
Persuasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
here
,
what
Erasmus
ridicules
with
so
much
Wit
and
Delicacy
,
the
custom
of
burying
in
a
Franciscan
's
Habit
,
in
mighty
request
.
<EOS>
If
they
can
for
that
purpose
procure
an
old
one
at
the
price
of
a
new
one
;
the
Purchaser
wil
look
upon
himself
a
provident
Chap
,
that
has
secur'd
to
his
deceased
Friend
or
Relation
,
no
less
than
Heaven
by
that
wise
Bargain
.
  
<EOS>
The
Evening
being
almost
the
only
time
of
Enjoyment
of
Company
,
or
Conversation
,
every
body
in
Spain
then
greedily
seeks
it
;
and
the
Streets
are
at
that
time
crowded
like
our
finest
Gardens
or
most
private
Walks
.
<EOS>
On
one
of
those
Occasions
,
I
met
a
Don
of
my
Acquaintance
walking
out
with
his
Sisters
;
and
as
I
thought
it
became
an
English
Cavalier
,
I
saluted
him
:
<EOS>
But
to
my
Surprize
he
never
return'd
the
Civility
.
<EOS>
When
I
met
him
the
Day
after
,
instead
of
an
Apology
,
as
I
had
flattered
my
self
,
I
received
a
Reprimand
,
tho
'
a
very
civil
one
;
telling
me
it
was
the
Custom
in
Spain
,
nor
well
taken
of
any
one
,
that
took
Notice
of
any
who
were
walking
in
the
Company
of
Ladies
at
Night
.
  
<EOS>
But
a
Night
or
two
after
,
I
found
by
Experience
,
that
if
the
Men
were
by
Custom
prohibited
taking
Notice
,
Women
were
not
.
<EOS>
I
was
standing
at
the
Door
,
in
the
cool
of
the
Evening
,
when
a
Woman
seemingly
genteel
,
passing
by
,
<EOS>
call'd
me
by
my
Name
,
telling
me
she
wanted
to
speak
with
me
:
She
had
her
Mantilio
on
;
so
that
had
I
had
Day
-
light
<EOS>
,
I
could
have
only
seen
one
Eye
of
her
.
<EOS>
However
I
walk'd
<EOS>
with
her
a
good
while
,
without
being
able
to
discover
any
thing
of
her
Business
,
nor
pass'd
there
between
us
any
thing
more
than
a
Conversation
upon
indifferent
Matters
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
at
parting
she
told
me
she
should
pass
by
again
the
next
Evening
;
and
if
I
would
be
at
the
Door
,
she
would
give
me
the
same
Advantage
of
a
Conversation
,
That
seem'd
not
to
displease
me
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
the
next
Night
she
came
,
and
as
before
we
walk'd
together
in
the
privatest
parts
of
the
Town
:
For
tho
'
I
knew
her
not
,
her
Discourse
was
always
entertaining
and
full
of
Wit
,
and
her
Enquiries
not
often
improper
.
<EOS>
We
had
continu'd
<EOS>
this
Intercourse
many
Nights
together
,
when
my
Landlady
's
Daughter
having
taken
Notice
of
it
,
stopt
me
one
Evening
,
and
would
not
allow
me
to
stand
at
the
usual
Post
of
Intelligence
,
saying
,
with
a
good
deal
of
heat
,
Don
Gorgio
,
take
my
Advice
;
go
no
more
along
with
that
Woman
:
<EOS>
You
may
soon
be
brought
home
deprived
of
your
Life
if
you
do
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
,
whether
she
knew
her
;
but
this
I
must
say
,
she
was
very
agreeable
in
Wit
as
well
as
Person
.
<EOS>
However
my
Landlady
and
her
Daughter
took
that
Opportunity
of
giving
me
so
many
Instances
of
the
fatal
Issues
of
such
innocent
Conversations
,
(
for
I
could
not
call
it
an
Intrigue
)
<EOS>
that
apprehensive
enough
of
the
Danger
,
on
laying
Circumstances
together
<EOS>
,
I
took
their
Advice
,
and
never
went
into
her
Company
after
.
  
<EOS>
Sainte
Clemente
de
la
Mancha
,
where
I
so
long
remain'd
<EOS>
a
Prisoner
of
War
,
lies
in
the
Road
from
Madrid
to
Valencia
;
and
the
Duke
of
Vendome
being
ordered
to
the
latter
,
great
Preparations
were
made
for
his
Entertainment
,
as
he
pass'd
through
.
<EOS>
He
stay'd
here
<EOS>
only
one
Night
,
where
he
was
very
handsomely
treated
by
the
Corrigidore
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
fair
Person
,
and
very
fat
,
and
at
the
time
I
saw
him
wore
a
long
black
Patch
over
his
left
Eye
;
but
on
what
Occasion
I
could
not
learn
.
<EOS>
The
afterwards
famous
Alberoni
(
since
made
a
Cardinal
)
was
in
his
Attendance
;
as
indeed
the
Duke
was
very
rarely
without
him
.
<EOS>
I
remember
that
very
Day
three
Weeks
,
they
return'd
through
the
same
Place
;
the
Duke
in
his
Herse
,
and
Alberoni
in
a
Coach
,
paying
his
last
Duties
.
<EOS>
That
Duke
was
a
prodigious
Lover
of
Fish
,
of
which
having
eat
over
heartily
at
Veneros
,
in
the
Province
of
Valencia
,
he
took
a
Surfeit
,
and
died
in
three
Days
'
time
.
<EOS>
His
Corps
was
carrying
to
the
Escurial
,
there
to
be
buried
in
the
Panthaeon
among
their
Kings
.
  
<EOS>
The
Castilians
have
a
Privilege
by
Licence
from
the
Pope
,
which
,
if
it
could
have
been
converted
into
a
Prohibition
,
might
have
sav'd
that
Duke
's
Life
:
In
regard
their
Country
is
wholly
inland
,
and
the
River
Tagus
famous
for
its
Poverty
,
or
rather
Barrenness
;
their
Holy
Father
indulges
the
Natives
with
the
Liberty
,
in
lieu
of
that
dangerous
Eatable
,
of
eating
all
Lent
time
the
Inwards
of
Cattle
.
<EOS>
When
I
first
heard
this
related
,
I
imagin'd
,
that
the
Garbidge
had
been
intended
,
but
I
was
soon
after
this
rectify'd
,
by
Inwards
(
for
so
expressly
says
the
Licence
<EOS>
it
self
)
is
meant
the
Heart
,
the
Liver
,
and
the
Feet
.
  
<EOS>
They
have
here
as
well
as
in
most
other
Parts
of
Spain
,
Valencia
excepted
,
the
most
wretched
Musick
in
the
Universe
.
<EOS>
Their
Guitars
,
if
not
their
Sole
,
are
their
darling
Instruments
,
and
what
they
most
delight
in
:
Tho
'
in
my
Opinion
<EOS>
our
English
Sailors
are
not
much
amiss
in
giving
them
the
Title
of
Strum
Strums
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
little
better
than
our
Jews
-
harps
,
tho
'
hardly
half
<EOS>
so
Musical
.
<EOS>
Yet
are
they
perpetually
at
Nights
disturbing
their
Women
with
the
Noise
of
them
,
under
the
notion
and
name
of
Serenadoes
.
<EOS>
From
the
Barber
to
the
Grandee
the
Infection
spreads
,
and
very
often
with
the
same
Attendant
,
Danger
:
<EOS>
Night
Quarrels
and
Rencounters
being
the
frequent
Result
.
<EOS>
The
true
born
Spaniards
reckon
it
a
part
of
their
Glory
,
to
be
jealous
of
their
Mistresses
,
which
is
too
often
the
Forerunner
of
Murders
;
at
best
attended
with
many
other
very
dangerous
Inconveniences
.
<EOS>
And
yet
bad
as
their
Musick
is
,
their
Dancing
is
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
Country
Girl
manage
her
Castanets
with
the
graceful
Air
of
a
Dutchess
,
and
that
not
to
common
Musick
;
but
to
Peoples
beating
or
druming
a
Tune
with
their
Hands
on
a
Table
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
half
a
Dozen
couple
at
a
time
dance
to
the
like
in
excellent
order
.
  
<EOS>
I
just
now
distinguish'd
,
by
an
Exception
,
the
Music
of
Valencia
,
where
alone
I
experienced
the
use
of
the
Violin
;
which
tho
'
I
can
not
,
in
respect
to
other
Countries
,
call
good
;
yet
in
respect
to
the
other
parts
of
Spain
,
I
must
acknowledge
it
much
the
best
.
<EOS>
In
my
Account
of
that
City
,
I
omitted
to
speak
of
it
;
therefore
now
to
supply
that
Defect
,
I
will
speak
of
the
best
I
heard
,
which
was
on
this
unfortunate
Occasion
:
<EOS>
Several
Natives
of
that
Country
having
received
Sentence
of
Death
for
their
Adherence
to
King
Charles
,
were
accordingly
ordered
to
the
Place
of
Execution
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
Custom
there
,
on
all
such
Occasions
,
for
all
the
Musick
of
the
City
to
meet
near
the
Gallows
,
and
play
the
most
affecting
and
melancholy
Airs
,
to
the
very
approach
of
the
Condemn'd
;
and
really
the
Musick
was
so
moving
,
it
heightened
the
Scene
of
Sorrow
,
and
brought
Compassion
into
the
Eyes
of
even
Enemies
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
Condemn'd
,
they
came
stript
of
their
own
Cloaths
,
and
cover'd
with
black
Frocks
,
in
which
they
were
led
along
the
Streets
to
the
Place
of
Execution
,
the
Friars
praying
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
When
they
came
through
any
Street
,
were
any
public
Images
were
fix'd
,
they
stay'd
<EOS>
before
'em
some
reasonable
time
in
Prayer
with
the
Friars
.
<EOS>
When
they
are
arriv'd
at
the
fatal
Place
,
those
Fathers
leave
'em
not
,
but
continue
praying
and
giving
them
ghostly
Encouragement
,
standing
upon
the
rounds
of
the
Ladder
till
they
are
turn'd
off
.
<EOS>
The
Hangman
always
wears
a
silver
Badge
of
a
Ladder
to
distinguish
his
Profession
:
<EOS>
But
his
manner
of
executing
his
Office
had
somewhat
in
it
too
singular
to
allow
of
Silence
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
ty'd
fast
the
Hands
of
the
Criminal
,
he
rested
his
Knee
upon
them
,
and
with
one
Hand
on
the
Criminal
's
Nostrils
,
to
stop
his
Breath
the
sooner
,
threw
himself
off
the
Ladder
along
with
the
dying
Party
.
<EOS>
This
he
does
to
expedite
his
Fate
;
tho
"
considering
the
Force
,
I
wonder
it
does
not
tear
Head
and
Body
asunder
;
<EOS>
which
yet
I
never
heard
that
it
did
.
  
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
la
Mancha
;
I
had
been
there
now
upwards
of
two
Years
,
much
diverted
with
the
good
Humour
and
Kindness
of
the
Gentlemen
,
and
daily
pleased
with
the
Conversation
of
the
Nuns
of
the
Nunnery
opposite
to
my
Lodgings
<EOS>
;
when
walking
one
Day
alone
upon
the
Plaza
,
I
found
my
self
accosted
by
a
Clerico
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
Attack
,
he
told
me
his
Country
:
But
added
,
that
he
now
came
from
Madrid
with
a
Potent
,
that
was
his
Word
,
from
Pedro
de
Dios
,
Dean
of
the
Inquisition
,
to
endeavour
the
Conversion
of
any
of
the
English
Prisoners
;
that
being
an
Irish
-
man
,
as
a
sort
of
a
Brother
,
he
had
conceived
a
Love
for
the
English
,
and
therefore
more
eagerly
embraced
the
Opportunity
which
the
Holy
Inquisition
had
put
into
his
Hands
for
the
bringing
over
to
Mother
Church
as
many
Hereticks
as
he
could
;
that
having
heard
a
very
good
Character
of
me
,
he
should
think
himself
very
happy
,
if
he
could
be
instrumental
in
my
Salvation
;
  
"
It
is
very
true
,
<EOS>
continu'd
<EOS>
he
,
I
have
lately
had
the
good
Fortune
to
convert
many
;
and
besides
the
Candour
of
my
own
Disposition
,
I
must
tell
you
,
that
I
have
a
peculiar
knack
at
Conversion
,
which
very
few
,
if
any
,
ever
could
resist
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
upon
the
same
work
into
Murcia
;
but
your
good
Character
is
fix'd
me
in
my
Resolution
of
preferring
your
Salvation
to
that
of
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
very
long
,
and
no
less
surprising
Address
,
I
only
return'd
,
that
it
being
an
Affair
of
moment
,
it
would
require
some
Consideration
;
and
that
by
the
time
he
return'd
from
Murcia
,
I
might
be
able
to
return
him
a
proper
Answer
.
<EOS>
But
not
at
all
satisfy'd
with
this
Reply
;
  
"
Sir
,
"
says
he
,
"
God
Almighty
is
all
-
sufficient
:
<EOS>
This
moment
is
too
precious
to
be
lost
;
he
can
turn
the
Heart
in
the
twinkling
of
an
Eye
,
as
well
as
in
twenty
Years
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
then
;
mind
what
I
say
to
you
:
I
will
convince
you
immediately
.
<EOS>
You
Hereticks
do
not
believe
in
Transubstantiation
,
and
yet
did
not
our
Saviour
say
in
so
many
Words
,
Hoc
est
corpus
meum
?
<EOS>
And
if
you
do
n't
believe
him
,
do
n't
you
give
him
the
Lye
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
does
not
one
of
the
Fatherss
ay
,
Deus
,
qui
est
omnis
Veritas
,
non
potest
dicere
falsum
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
on
at
the
same
ridiculous
rate
;
which
soon
convinced
me
,
he
was
a
thorough
Rattle
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
a
Clerico
,
and
consequently
in
this
Country
,
a
Man
dangerous
to
disoblige
,
I
invited
him
home
to
Dinner
;
where
when
I
had
brought
him
,
I
found
I
had
no
way
done
an
unacceptable
thing
;
for
my
Landlady
and
her
Daughter
,
seeing
him
to
be
a
Clergyman
,
receiv'd
him
with
a
vast
deal
of
Respect
and
Pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
Dinner
being
over
<EOS>
,
he
began
to
entertain
me
with
a
Detail
of
the
many
wonderful
Conversions
he
had
made
upon
obstinate
Hereticks
;
that
he
had
convinced
the
most
Stubborn
,
and
had
such
a
Nostrum
,
that
he
would
undertake
to
convert
any
one
.
<EOS>
Here
he
began
his
old
round
,
intermixing
his
Harangue
with
such
scraps
and
raw
sentences
of
fustian
Latin
,
that
I
grew
weary
of
his
Conversation
;
so
pretending
some
Business
of
consequence
,
I
took
leave
,
and
left
him
and
my
Landlady
together
.
  
<EOS>
I
did
not
return
till
pretty
late
in
the
Evening
,
with
Intent
to
give
him
Time
enough
to
think
his
own
Visit
tedious
;
but
to
my
great
Surprize
,
I
found
my
Irish
Missionary
still
on
the
Spot
,
ready
to
dare
me
to
the
Encounter
,
and
resolv'd
,
like
a
true
Son
of
the
Church
militant
,
to
keep
last
on
the
Field
of
Battle
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
had
seated
my
self
,
he
began
again
to
tell
me
,
how
good
a
Character
my
Landlady
had
given
me
,
which
had
prodigiously
increased
his
Ardour
of
saving
my
Soul
;
that
he
could
not
answer
it
to
his
own
Character
,
as
well
as
mine
,
to
be
negligent
;
and
therefore
he
had
enter'd
into
a
Resolution
to
stay
my
Coming
,
though
it
had
been
later
.
<EOS>
To
all
which
,
I
return'd
<EOS>
him
Abundance
of
Thanks
for
his
good
Will
,
but
pleading
Indisposition
and
want
of
Rest
,
after
a
good
deal
of
civil
Impertinence
,
I
once
more
got
rid
of
him
;
at
least
,
I
took
my
Leave
,
and
went
to
Bed
,
leaving
him
again
Master
of
the
Field
;
for
I
understood
next
Morning
,
that
he
stay'd
some
Time
after
I
was
gone
,
with
my
good
Landlady
.
  
<EOS>
Next
Morning
the
Nuns
of
the
Nunnery
opposite
,
having
taken
Notice
of
the
Clerico
's
Ingress
,
long
Visit
,
and
late
Egress
,
sent
to
know
whether
he
was
my
Countryman
;
with
many
other
Questions
,
which
I
was
not
then
let
into
the
Secret
of
.
<EOS>
To
all
which
I
return'd
,
that
he
was
no
Countryman
of
mine
,
but
an
Irish
-
man
,
and
so
perfectly
a
Stranger
to
me
,
that
I
knew
no
more
of
him
than
what
I
had
from
his
own
Mouth
,
that
he
was
going
into
Murcia
.
<EOS>
What
the
Meaning
of
this
Enquiry
was
,
I
could
never
learn
;
but
I
could
not
doubt
,
but
it
proceeded
from
their
great
Care
of
their
Vicino
,
as
they
call'd
me
;
a
Mark
of
their
Esteem
,
and
of
which
I
was
not
a
little
proud
.
  
<EOS>
As
was
my
usual
Custom
,
I
had
been
taking
my
Morning
Walk
,
and
had
not
been
long
come
home
in
order
to
Dinner
,
when
in
again
drops
my
Irish
Clerico
;
I
was
confounded
,
and
vexed
,
and
he
could
not
avoid
taking
Notice
of
it
;
nevertheless
,
without
the
least
Alteration
of
Countenance
,
he
took
his
Seat
;
and
on
my
saying
,
in
a
cold
and
indifferent
Tone
,
<EOS>
that
I
imagin'd
<EOS>
he
had
been
got
to
Murcia
before
this
;
he
reply'd
,
with
a
natural
Fleer
,
that
truely
he
was
going
to
Murcia
,
but
his
Conscience
pricked
him
,
and
he
did
find
that
he
could
not
go
away
with
any
Satisfaction
,
or
Peace
of
Mind
,
without
making
me
a
perfect
Convert
;
that
he
had
plainly
discovered
in
me
a
good
Disposition
,
and
had
,
for
that
very
Reason
,
put
himself
to
the
Charge
of
Man
and
Mule
,
to
the
Bishop
of
Cuenca
for
a
Licence
,
under
his
Hand
,
for
my
Conversion
:
<EOS>
For
in
Spain
,
all
private
Missionaries
are
obliged
to
ask
Leave
of
the
next
Bishop
,
before
they
dare
enter
upon
any
Enterprize
of
this
Nature
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
more
confounded
at
this
last
Assurance
of
the
Man
than
at
all
before
;
and
it
put
me
directly
upon
reflecting
,
whether
any
,
and
what
Inconveniences
might
ensue
,
from
a
Rencounter
that
I
,
at
first
,
conceiv'd
ridiculous
,
but
might
now
reasonably
begin
to
have
more
dangerous
Apprehensions
of
.
<EOS>
I
knew
,
by
the
Articles
of
War
<EOS>
,
all
Persons
are
exempted
from
any
Power
of
the
Inquisition
;
but
whether
carrying
on
a
Part
in
such
a
Farce
,
might
not
admit
,
or
at
least
be
liable
to
some
dangerous
Construction
,
was
not
imprudently
now
to
be
considered
.
<EOS>
Though
I
was
not
fearful
,
yet
I
resolv'd
to
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
not
making
any
Answer
to
his
Declaration
about
the
Bishop
,
he
took
Notice
of
it
;
and
to
raise
a
Confidence
,
he
found
expiring
,
began
to
tell
me
,
that
his
Name
was
Murtough
Brennan
,
that
he
was
born
near
Kilkenny
,
of
a
very
considerable
Family
.
<EOS>
This
last
part
indeed
,
when
I
came
to
Madrid
,
I
found
pretty
well
confirm'd
in
a
considerable
Manner
.
<EOS>
However
,
taking
Notice
that
he
had
alter'd
<EOS>
his
Tone
of
leaving
the
Town
,
and
that
instead
of
it
,
he
was
advancing
somewhat
like
an
Invitation
of
himself
to
Dinner
the
next
Day
,
I
resolv'd
to
show
my
self
shy
of
him
;
and
thereupon
abruptly
,
and
without
taking
any
Leave
,
I
left
the
Room
,
and
my
Landlady
and
him
together
.
  
<EOS>
Three
or
four
Days
had
passed
,
every
one
of
which
,
he
never
fail'd
my
Lodgings
;
not
at
Dinner
Time
only
,
but
Night
and
Morning
too
;
from
all
which
I
began
to
suspect
,
that
instead
of
my
Conversion
,
he
had
fix'd
upon
a
Re
-
conversion
of
my
Landlady
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
young
,
yet
,
for
a
black
Woman
,
handsom
enough
;
and
her
Daughter
very
pretty
:
I
entered
into
a
Resolution
to
make
my
Observations
,
and
watch
them
all
at
a
Distance
;
nevertheless
carefully
concealing
my
Jealousy
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
must
confess
,
I
was
not
a
little
pleas'd
,
that
any
Thing
could
divert
my
own
Persecution
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
no
longer
my
Guest
,
but
my
Landlady
's
,
with
whom
I
found
him
so
much
taken
up
,
that
a
little
Care
might
frustrate
all
his
former
impertinent
Importunities
on
the
old
Topick
.
  
<EOS>
But
all
my
Suspicions
were
very
soon
after
turn'd
into
Certainties
,
in
this
Manner
:
I
had
been
abroad
,
and
returning
somewhat
weary
<EOS>
,
I
went
to
my
Chamber
,
to
take
,
what
in
that
Country
they
call
,
a
Cesto
,
upon
my
Bed
<EOS>
:
I
got
in
unseen
,
or
without
seeing
any
Body
,
but
had
scarce
laid
my
self
down
,
before
my
young
Landlady
,
as
I
jestingly
us'd
to
call
the
Daughter
,
rushing
into
my
Room
,
threw
her
self
down
on
the
Floor
,
bitterly
exclaiming
.
<EOS>
I
started
off
my
Bed
,
and
immediately
running
to
the
Door
,
who
should
I
meet
there
but
my
Irish
Clerico
,
without
his
Habit
,
and
in
his
Shirt
?
<EOS>
I
could
not
doubt
,
by
the
Dishabille
of
the
Clerico
,
but
the
young
Creature
had
Reason
enough
for
her
Passion
,
which
render'd
me
quite
unable
to
master
mine
;
<EOS>
wherefore
as
he
stood
with
his
Back
next
the
Door
,
I
thrust
him
in
that
ghostly
Plight
into
the
open
Street
.
  
<EOS>
I
might
,
with
leisure
enough
,
have
repented
that
precipitate
Piece
of
Indiscretion
;
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
bad
Character
,
and
the
favourable
Opinion
the
Town
had
conceived
of
me
;
for
he
inordinately
exclaim'd
<EOS>
against
me
,
calling
me
Heretick
,
and
telling
the
People
,
who
were
soon
gathered
round
him
,
that
coming
to
my
Lodgings
on
the
charitable
work
of
Conversion
,
I
had
thus
abus'd
him
,
stript
him
of
his
Habit
,
and
then
turn'd
him
out
of
Doors
.
<EOS>
The
Nuns
,
on
their
hearing
the
Outcries
he
made
,
came
running
to
their
Grates
,
to
enquire
into
the
Matter
,
and
when
they
understood
it
,
as
he
was
pleas'd
to
relate
it
;
though
they
condemn'd
<EOS>
my
Zeal
,
they
pity'd
<EOS>
my
Condition
.
<EOS>
Very
well
was
it
for
me
,
that
I
stood
more
than
a
little
well
in
the
good
Opinion
of
the
Town
;
among
the
Gentry
,
by
my
frequent
Conversation
,
and
the
inferior
Sort
by
my
charitable
Distributions
;
for
nothing
can
be
more
dangerous
,
or
a
nearer
Way
to
violent
Fate
,
than
to
insult
one
of
the
Clergy
in
Spain
,
and
especially
,
for
such
an
one
as
they
entitle
a
Heretick
.
  
<EOS>
My
old
Landlady
(
I
speak
in
respect
to
her
Daughter
)
however
formerly
my
seeming
Friend
,
came
in
a
violent
Passion
,
and
wrenching
the
Door
out
of
my
Hands
,
opened
it
,
and
pull'd
<EOS>
her
Clerico
in
;
and
so
soon
as
she
had
done
this
,
she
took
his
Part
,
and
railed
so
bitterly
at
me
,
that
I
had
no
Reason
longer
to
doubt
her
thorough
Conversion
,
under
the
full
Power
of
his
Mission
.
<EOS>
However
the
young
one
stood
her
Ground
,
and
by
all
her
Expressions
,
gave
her
many
Inquirers
Reason
enough
to
believe
,
all
was
not
Matter
of
Faith
that
the
Clerico
had
advanced
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
holding
it
adviseable
to
change
my
Lodgings
,
and
a
Friend
confirming
my
Resolutions
,
I
removed
that
Night
.
  
<EOS>
The
Clerico
having
put
on
his
upper
Garments
,
was
run
away
to
the
Corrigidor
,
in
a
violent
Fury
,
resolving
to
be
early
,
as
well
knowing
,
that
he
who
tells
his
Story
first
,
has
the
Prospect
of
telling
it
to
double
Advantage
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
there
,
he
told
that
Officer
a
thousand
idle
Stories
,
and
in
the
worst
Manner
;
repeating
how
I
had
abus'd
him
,
and
not
him
only
,
but
my
poor
Landlady
,
for
taking
his
Part
.
<EOS>
The
Corrigidor
was
glad
to
hear
it
all
,
and
with
an
officious
Ear
fish'd
for
a
great
deal
more
;
expecting
,
according
to
Usage
,
at
last
to
squeeze
a
Sum
of
Money
out
of
me
.
<EOS>
However
he
told
the
Clerico
,
that
,
as
I
was
a
Prisoner
of
War
,
he
had
no
direct
Power
over
me
;
but
if
he
would
immediately
write
to
the
President
Ronquillo
,
at
Madrid
,
he
would
not
fail
to
give
his
immediate
Orders
,
according
to
which
he
would
as
readily
act
against
me
.
  
<EOS>
The
Clerico
resolv'd
to
pursue
his
old
Maxim
and
cry
out
first
;
and
so
taking
the
Corrigidor
's
Advice
,
he
wrote
away
to
Madrid
directly
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
Time
the
People
in
the
Town
,
both
high
and
low
,
some
out
of
Curiosity
,
some
out
of
Friendship
,
pursu'd
their
Enquiries
into
the
Reality
of
the
Facts
.
<EOS>
The
old
Landlady
they
could
make
little
of
to
my
Advantage
;
but
whenever
the
young
one
came
to
the
Question
,
she
always
left
them
with
these
Words
in
her
Mouth
,
El
Diabolo
en
<EOS>
forma
del
Clerico
,
which
rendring
Things
more
than
a
little
cloudy
on
the
Clerico
's
Side
<EOS>
,
he
was
<EOS>
advis'd
and
press'd
by
his
few
Friends
,
as
fast
as
he
could
to
get
out
of
Town
;
Nuns
,
Clergy
,
and
every
Body
taking
Part
against
him
,
excepting
his
new
Convert
,
my
old
Landlady
.
  
<EOS>
The
Day
after
,
as
I
was
sitting
with
a
Friend
at
my
new
Quarters
,
Maria
(
for
that
was
the
Name
of
my
Landlady
's
Daughter
)
came
running
in
with
these
Words
in
her
Mouth
,
El
Clerico
,
el
Clerico
,
passa
la
Calle
.
<EOS>
We
hasten'd
to
the
Window
,
<EOS>
out
of
which
we
beheld
the
Clerico
,
Murtough
Brennan
,
pitifully
mounted
on
the
Back
of
a
very
poor
Ass
(
for
they
would
neither
let
,
nor
lend
him
a
Mule
through
all
the
Town
)
<EOS>
his
Legs
almost
rested
on
the
Ground
,
for
he
was
lusty
,
as
his
Ass
was
little
;
and
a
Fellow
with
a
large
Cudgel
march'd
a
-
foot
,
driving
his
Ass
along
.
<EOS>
Never
did
Sancha
Pancha
,
on
his
Embassage
to
Dulcinea
,
make
such
a
despicable
,
out
of
the
way
Figure
,
as
our
Clerico
did
at
this
Time
.
<EOS>
And
what
increas'd
our
Mirth
was
,
their
telling
me
,
that
our
Clerico
,
like
that
Squire
(
tho
'
upon
his
own
Priest
-
Errantry
)
was
actually
on
his
March
to
Toboso
,
a
Place
five
Leagues
off
,
famous
for
the
Nativity
of
Dulcinea
,
The
Object
of
the
Passion
of
that
celebrated
Hero
Don
Quixot
.
<EOS>
So
I
will
leave
our
Clerico
on
his
Journey
to
Murcia
,
to
relate
the
unhappy
Sequel
of
this
ridiculous
Affair
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
before
said
,
that
,
by
the
Advice
of
the
Corrigidor
,
our
Clerico
had
wrote
to
Don
Ronquillo
at
Madrid
.
<EOS>
About
a
Fortnight
after
his
Departure
from
la
Mancha
,
I
was
sitting
alone
in
my
new
Lodgings
,
when
two
Alguizils
(
Officers
under
the
Corrigidor
,
and
in
the
Nature
of
our
Bailiffs
)
came
into
my
Room
,
but
very
civilly
,
to
tell
me
,
that
they
had
Orders
to
carry
me
away
to
Prison
;
but
at
the
same
Moment
they
advis'd
me
,
not
to
be
afraid
;
for
they
had
observed
,
that
the
whole
Town
was
concern'd
at
what
the
Corrigidor
and
Clerico
had
done
;
adding
,
that
it
was
their
Opinion
,
that
I
should
find
so
general
<EOS>
a
Friendship
,
that
I
need
not
be
apprehensive
of
any
Danger
.
<EOS>
With
these
plausible
Speeches
,
though
I
afterwards
experienced
the
Truth
of
them
,
I
resign'd
my
self
,
and
went
with
them
to
a
much
closer
Confinement
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
there
above
a
Day
or
two
,
before
many
Gentlemen
of
the
Place
sent
to
me
,
to
assure
me
<EOS>
,
they
were
heartily
afflicted
at
my
Confinement
,
and
resolv'd
to
write
in
my
Favour
to
Madrid
;
but
as
it
was
not
safe
,
nor
the
Custom
in
Spain
,
to
visit
those
in
my
present
Circumstances
,
they
hoped
I
would
not
take
it
amiss
,
since
they
were
bent
to
act
all
in
their
Power
towards
my
Deliverance
;
concluding
however
with
their
Advice
,
that
I
would
not
give
one
Real
of
Plata
to
the
Corrigidor
,
whom
they
hated
,
but
confide
in
their
assiduous
Interposal
,
Don
Pedro
de
Ortega
in
particular
,
the
Person
that
perform'd
the
Part
of
the
Tauriro
on
Horseback
,
sometime
before
,
sent
me
Word
<EOS>
,
he
would
not
fail
to
write
to
a
Relation
of
his
,
of
the
first
Account
in
Madrid
,
and
so
represent
the
Affair
,
that
I
should
not
long
be
debarr'd
my
old
Acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
It
may
administer
,
perhaps
,
Matter
of
Wonder
,
that
Spaniards
,
Gentlemen
of
the
stanchest
Punctilio
,
should
make
a
Scruple
and
execute
themselves
from
visiting
Persons
under
Confinement
,
when
,
according
to
all
Christian
Acceptation
,
such
a
Circumstance
would
render
such
a
Visit
,
not
charitable
only
but
generous
.
<EOS>
But
though
Men
of
vulgar
Spirits
might
,
from
the
Narrowness
of
their
Views
,
form
such
insipid
Excuses
,
those
of
these
Gentlemen
,
I
very
well
knew
,
proceeded
from
much
more
excusable
Topicks
.
<EOS>
I
was
committed
under
the
Accusation
of
having
abus'd
a
sacred
Person
,
one
of
the
Clergy
;
and
though
,
as
a
Prisoner
of
War
,
I
might
deem
my
self
exempt
from
the
Power
of
the
Inquisition
;
yet
how
far
one
of
that
Country
,
visiting
a
Person
,
so
accused
,
might
be
esteemed
culpable
,
was
a
consideration
in
that
dangerous
Climate
,
far
from
deserving
to
be
slighted
.
<EOS>
To
me
therefore
,
who
well
knew
the
Customs
of
the
Country
,
and
the
Temper
of
its
Countrymen
,
their
Excuses
were
not
only
allowable
,
but
acceptable
also
;
for
,
without
calling
in
Question
their
Charity
,
I
verily
<EOS>
believ'd
<EOS>
I
might
falsely
confide
in
their
Honour
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
after
I
had
been
a
close
Prisoner
one
Month
to
a
Day
,
I
found
the
Benefit
of
these
Gentlemen
's
Promises
and
Solicitations
.
<EOS>
Pursuant
to
which
,
an
Order
was
brought
for
my
immediate
Discharge
;
notwithstanding
,
the
new
Convert
,
my
old
Landlady
,
did
all
she
could
to
make
her
appearing
against
me
effectual
,
to
the
Height
of
her
Prejudice
and
Malice
,
even
while
the
Daughter
,
as
sensible
of
my
Innocence
,
and
acting
with
a
much
better
Conscience
,
endeavoured
as
much
to
justify
me
,
against
both
the
Threats
and
Persuasions
of
the
Corrigidor
,
and
his
few
Accomplices
,
though
her
own
Mother
made
one
.
  
<EOS>
After
Receipt
of
this
Order
for
my
Enlargement
,
I
was
mightily
press'd
by
Don
Felix
,
and
others
of
my
Friends
,
to
go
to
Madrid
,
and
enter
my
Complaint
against
the
Corrigidor
and
the
Clerico
,
as
a
Thing
highly
essential
to
my
own
future
Security
.
<EOS>
Without
asking
Leave
therefore
of
the
Corrigidor
,
or
in
the
least
acquainting
him
with
it
,
I
set
out
from
la
Mancha
,
and
,
as
I
afterwards
understood
,
to
the
terrible
Alarm
of
that
griping
Officer
;
who
was
under
the
greatest
Consternation
,
when
he
heard
I
was
gone
;
for
as
he
knew
very
well
,
that
he
had
done
more
than
he
could
justify
,
he
was
very
apprehensive
of
any
Complaint
;
<EOS>
well
knowing
,
that
as
he
was
hated
as
much
as
I
was
beloved
,
he
might
assure
himself
of
the
Want
of
that
Assistance
from
the
Gentlemen
,
which
I
had
experienced
.
  
<EOS>
So
soon
as
I
arrived
at
Madrid
,
I
made
it
my
Business
to
enquire
out
,
and
wait
upon
Father
Fahy
,
Chief
of
the
Irish
College
.
<EOS>
He
received
me
very
courteously
;
but
when
I
acquainted
him
with
the
Treatment
I
had
met
with
from
Brennan
,
and
had
given
him
an
Account
of
his
other
scandalous
Behaviour
<EOS>
,
I
found
he
was
no
Stranger
to
the
Man
,
or
his
Character
;
<EOS>
for
he
soon
confirm'd
<EOS>
to
me
the
Honour
<EOS>
Brennan
first
boasted
of
,
his
considerable
Family
,
by
saying
,
that
scarce
an
Assize
passed
in
his
own
Country
,
without
two
or
three
of
that
Name
receiving
at
the
Gallows
the
just
Reward
of
their
Demerits
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
not
only
Father
Fahy
,
but
all
the
Clergy
of
that
Nation
at
Madrid
,
readily
subscribed
to
this
Character
of
him
,
That
he
was
a
Scandal
to
their
Country
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
I
had
nothing
more
to
do
,
but
to
get
that
Father
to
go
with
me
to
Pedro
de
Dios
,
who
was
the
Head
of
the
Dominican
Cloyster
,
and
Dean
of
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
He
readily
granted
my
Request
,
and
when
we
came
there
,
in
a
Manner
unexpected
,
represented
to
the
Dean
,
that
having
some
good
Dispositions
towards
Mother
-
Church
,
I
had
been
diverted
from
them
,
he
feared
,
by
the
evil
Practices
of
one
Murtough
Brennan
,
a
Countryman
of
his
,
tho
'
a
Scandal
to
his
Country
;
that
under
a
Pretence
of
seeking
my
Conversion
,
he
had
lay'd
himself
open
in
a
most
beastly
Manner
,
such
as
would
have
set
a
Catholick
into
a
vile
Opinion
of
their
Religion
,
and
much
more
one
that
was
yet
a
Heretick
.
<EOS>
The
Dean
had
hardly
Patience
to
hear
Particulars
;
but
as
soon
as
my
Friend
had
ended
his
Narration
,
he
immediately
gave
his
Orders
,
prohibiting
Murtough
's
saying
any
more
Masses
,
either
in
Madrid
,
or
any
other
Place
in
Spain
.
<EOS>
This
indeed
was
taking
away
the
poor
Wretches
sole
Subsistence
,
and
putting
him
just
upon
an
Equality
with
his
Demerits
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
the
same
Opportunity
to
make
my
Complaints
of
the
Corrigidor
;
but
his
Term
expiring
very
soon
,
and
a
Process
being
likely
to
be
chargeable
<EOS>
,
I
was
advised
to
let
it
drop
.
<EOS>
So
having
effected
what
I
came
for
,
I
returned
to
my
old
Station
at
la
Mancha
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
came
back
,
I
found
a
new
Corrigidor
,
as
I
had
been
told
there
would
,
by
the
Dean
of
the
Inquisition
,
who
,
at
the
same
Time
,
advised
me
to
wait
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
did
so
,
soon
after
my
Arrival
,
and
then
experienced
the
Advice
to
be
well
intended
;
the
Dean
having
wrote
a
Letter
to
him
,
to
order
him
to
treat
me
with
all
Manner
of
Civility
.
<EOS>
He
show'd
me
<EOS>
the
very
Letter
,
and
<EOS>
it
was
in
such
particular
and
obliging
Terms
,
that
I
could
not
but
perceive
he
had
taken
a
Resolution
,
if
possible
,
to
eradicate
all
the
evil
impressions
,
that
Murtough
's
Behaviour
might
have
given
too
great
Occasion
for
.
<EOS>
This
serv'd
to
confirm
me
in
an
Observation
that
I
had
long
before
made
,
That
a
Protestant
,
who
will
prudently
keep
his
Sentiments
in
his
own
Breast
,
may
command
any
Thing
in
Spain
;
where
their
stiff
Bigotry
leads
'em
naturally
into
that
other
Mistake
,
That
not
to
oppose
,
is
to
assent
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
is
generally
among
them
,
almost
a
work
of
Supererogation
to
be
even
instrumental
in
the
Conversion
of
one
they
call
a
Heretick
.
<EOS>
To
bring
any
such
back
to
what
they
call
Mother
Church
,
nothing
shall
be
spar'd
,
nothing
thought
too
much
:
<EOS>
And
if
you
have
Insincerity
enough
to
give
them
Hopes
,
you
shall
not
only
live
in
Ease
,
but
in
Pleasure
and
Plenty
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
entertain'd
some
thoughts
on
my
Journey
back
,
of
taking
up
my
old
Quarters
at
the
Widow
's
;
but
found
her
so
intirely
converted
by
her
Clerico
,
that
there
wou'd
be
no
room
to
expect
Peace
:
<EOS>
For
which
Reason
,
with
the
help
of
my
fair
Vicinos
,
and
Don
Felix
,
I
took
another
,
where
I
had
not
been
long
,
before
I
received
an
unhappy
Account
of
Murtough
's
Conduct
in
Murcia
.
<EOS>
It
seems
he
had
kept
his
Resolution
in
going
thither
;
where
meeting
with
some
of
his
own
Countrymen
,
though
he
found
'em
<EOS>
stanch
good
Catholics
<EOS>
,
he
so
far
inveigled
himself
into
'em
,
that
he
brought
them
all
into
a
foul
chance
for
their
Lives
.
<EOS>
There
were
three
of
'em
,
all
Soldiers
,
in
a
Spanish
Regiment
,
but
in
a
fit
of
ambitious
,
though
frantick
,
Zeal
:
<EOS>
Murtough
had
wheedled
them
to
go
along
with
him
to
Pedro
de
Dios
,
Dean
of
the
Inquisition
,
to
declare
and
acknowledge
before
him
,
that
they
were
converted
and
brought
over
to
Mother
Church
,
and
by
him
only
.
<EOS>
The
poor
Ignorants
,
thus
intic'd
,
had
left
their
Regiment
,
of
which
the
Colonel
,
having
notice
,
sent
after
them
,
and
they
were
overtaken
on
the
Road
,
their
Missionair
with
them
.
<EOS>
But
notwithstanding
all
his
Oratory
,
nay
,
even
the
Discovery
of
the
whole
Farce
,
one
of
them
was
hang'd
for
an
Example
to
the
other
two
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
after
my
Return
before
News
arriv'd
of
the
Peace
;
which
though
they
receiv'd
with
Joy
,
they
could
hardly
entertain
with
Belief
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
the
new
Corrigidor
,
with
whom
I
held
a
better
Correspondence
than
I
had
done
with
the
old
one
,
desired
me
to
produce
my
Letters
from
England
,
that
it
was
true
.
<EOS>
Never
did
People
give
greater
Demonstrations
of
Joy
,
than
they
upon
this
Occasion
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
common
cry
in
the
Streets
,
Paz
con
Angleterra
,
con
todo
Mundo
Guerra
;
And
my
Confirmation
did
them
as
much
Pleasure
as
it
did
Service
to
me
;
for
is
possible
,
they
treated
me
with
more
Civility
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
Peace
soon
after
being
proclaimed
,
I
received
Orders
to
repair
to
Madrid
,
where
the
rest
of
the
Prisoners
taken
at
Denia
had
been
carried
;
when
I
,
by
reason
of
my
Wounds
,
and
want
of
Health
,
had
been
left
behind
.
<EOS>
Others
I
understood
lay
ready
,
and
some
were
on
their
March
to
Bayone
in
France
;
where
Ships
were
ordered
for
their
Transportation
into
England
.
<EOS>
So
after
a
Residence
of
three
Years
and
three
Months
;
having
taken
leave
of
all
my
Acquaintance
,
I
left
a
Place
,
that
was
almost
become
natural
to
me
,
the
delicious
Sainte
Clemente
de
la
Mancha
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
of
Moment
,
or
worth
observing
,
met
I
with
,
till
I
came
near
Ocanna
;
and
there
occurred
a
Sight
ridiculous
enough
.
<EOS>
The
Knight
of
the
Town
,
I
last
came
from
,
the
ever
renown'd
Don
Quixot
,
never
made
such
a
Figure
as
a
Spaniard
,
I
there
met
on
the
Road
.
<EOS>
He
was
mounted
on
a
Mule
of
the
largest
size
,
and
yet
no
way
unsizeable
to
his
Person
:
He
had
two
Pistols
in
his
Holsters
,
and
one
on
each
side
stuck
in
his
Belt
;
a
sort
of
large
Blunderbuss
in
one
of
his
Hands
,
and
the
fellow
to
it
slung
over
his
Shoulders
<EOS>
hung
at
his
Back
.
<EOS>
All
these
were
accompany'd
with
a
right
Spanish
Spado
,
and
an
Attendant
Stiletto
,
in
their
customary
Position
.
<EOS>
The
Muletier
that
was
my
guide
,
calling
out
to
him
in
Spanish
,
told
him
he
was
very
well
arm'd
;
to
which
,
with
a
great
deal
of
Gravity
,
the
Don
returned
Answer
,
by
Saint
Jago
<EOS>
a
Man
can
not
be
too
well
arm'd
in
such
dangerous
Times
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
up
my
Quarters
that
Night
at
Ocanna
,
a
large
,
neat
,
and
well
built
Town
.
<EOS>
Houses
of
good
Reception
,
and
Entertainment
,
are
very
scarce
all
over
Spain
;
but
that
,
where
I
then
lay
,
might
have
pass'd
for
good
in
any
other
Country
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
gave
me
a
Notion
quite
different
to
what
I
found
:
for
I
imagined
it
to
proceed
from
my
near
Approach
to
the
Capital
.
<EOS>
But
instead
of
that
,
contrary
to
all
other
Countries
,
the
nearer
I
came
to
Madrid
,
the
Houses
of
Entertainment
grew
worse
and
worse
;
not
in
their
Rates
do
I
mean
(
for
that
with
Reason
enough
might
have
been
expected
)
but
even
in
their
Provision
,
and
Places
and
way
of
Reception
,
I
could
not
however
forbear
smiling
at
the
Reason
given
by
my
Muletier
,
that
it
proceeded
from
a
piece
of
Court
Policy
,
in
Order
to
oblige
all
Travellers
to
hasten
to
Madrid
.
  
<EOS>
Two
small
Leagues
from
Ocanna
<EOS>
we
arrived
at
Aranjuez
,
a
Seat
of
Pleasure
,
which
the
Kings
of
Spain
commonly
select
for
their
place
of
Residence
during
the
Months
of
April
and
<EOS>
May.
It
is
distant
from
Madrid
about
seven
Leagues
;
and
the
Country
round
is
the
pleasantest
in
all
Spain
,
Valencia
excepted
.
<EOS>
The
House
it
self
makes
but
a
very
indifferent
Appearance
;
I
have
seen
many
a
better
in
England
,
with
an
Owner
to
it
of
no
more
than
five
hundred
Pounds
per
Annum
;
yet
the
Gardens
are
large
and
fine
;
or
as
the
Spaniards
say
,
the
finest
in
all
Spain
,
which
with
them
is
all
the
World
.
<EOS>
They
tell
you
at
the
same
Time
,
that
those
of
Versailles
,
in
their
most
beautiful
Parts
,
took
their
Model
from
these
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
those
at
Versailles
:
<EOS>
But
in
my
Opinion
,
the
Walks
at
Aranjuez
,
tho
'
noble
in
their
length
,
lose
much
of
their
Beauty
by
their
Narrowness
.
  
<EOS>
The
Water
-
works
here
are
a
great
Curiosity
;
to
which
the
River
Tagus
running
along
close
by
,
does
mightily
contribute
.
<EOS>
That
River
is
let
into
the
Gardens
by
a
vast
number
of
little
Canals
,
which
with
their
pleasing
Maeanders
divert
the
Eye
with
inexpressible
Delight
.
<EOS>
These
pretty
Wanderers
by
Pipes
properly
plac'd
<EOS>
in
them
,
afford
Varieties
scarce
to
be
believ'd
or
imagin'd
;
and
which
would
be
grateful
in
any
Climate
;
but
much
more
,
where
the
Air
,
as
it
does
here
,
wants
in
the
Summer
Months
perpetual
cooling
.
  
<EOS>
To
see
a
spreading
Tree
,
as
growing
in
its
natural
Soil
,
distinguish'd
from
its
pineing
Neighbourhood
by
a
gentle
refreshing
Shower
,
which
appears
softly
distilling
from
every
Branch
and
Leaf
thereof
,
while
Nature
all
around
is
smiling
,
without
one
liquid
sign
of
Sorrow
,
to
me
appear'd
<EOS>
surprizingly
pleasing
.
<EOS>
And
the
more
when
I
observ'd
<EOS>
that
its
Neighbours
receiv'd
<EOS>
not
any
the
least
Benefit
of
that
plentiful
Effusion
;
And
yet
a
very
few
Trees
distant
,
you
should
find
a
dozen
together
under
the
same
healthful
Sudor
.
<EOS>
Where
art
imitates
Nature
well
,
Philosophers
hold
it
a
Perfection
:
Then
what
must
she
exact
of
us
,
where
we
find
her
transcendent
in
the
Perfections
of
Nature
?
  
<EOS>
The
watry
Arch
is
nothing
less
surprizing
;
where
Art
contending
with
Nature
,
acts
against
the
Laws
of
Nature
,
and
yet
is
beautiful
.
<EOS>
To
see
a
Liquid
Stream
vaulting
it
self
from
the
space
of
threescore
Yards
into
a
perfect
Semi
-
Orb
,
will
be
granted
by
the
Curious
to
be
rare
and
strange
:
<EOS>
But
sure
to
walk
beneath
that
Arch
,
and
see
the
Waters
flowing
over
your
Head
,
without
your
receiving
the
minutest
Drop
,
is
stranger
,
if
not
strange
enough
to
stagger
all
Belief
.
  
<EOS>
The
Story
of
Actaeon
,
pictur'd
<EOS>
in
Water
Colours
,
if
I
may
so
express
my
self
,
tho
'
pretty
,
seem'd
to
me
,
but
trifling
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Those
seem'd
to
be
like
Nature
miraculously
displayed
;
this
only
Fable
in
Grotesque
.
<EOS>
The
Figures
indeed
were
not
only
fine
,
but
extraordinary
;
yet
their
various
Shapes
were
not
at
all
so
entertaining
to
the
Mind
,
however
refreshing
they
might
be
found
to
the
Body
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
notice
before
of
the
straitness
of
their
Walks
:
<EOS>
But
tho
'
to
me
it
might
seem
a
Diminution
of
their
Beauty
<EOS>
:
I
am
apt
to
believe
to
the
Spaniard
,
for
and
by
whom
they
were
laid
out
,
it
may
seem
otherwise
.
<EOS>
They
,
of
both
Sexes
,
give
themselves
so
intolerably
up
to
Amouring
,
that
on
that
Account
the
Closeness
of
the
Walks
may
be
look'd
<EOS>
upon
as
an
Advantage
rather
than
a
Defect
.
<EOS>
The
grand
Avenue
to
the
House
is
much
more
stately
,
and
compos'd
as
they
are
,
of
Rows
of
Trees
,
somewhat
larger
than
our
largest
Limes
,
whose
Leaves
are
all
of
a
perfect
Pea
bloom
Colour
,
together
with
their
Grandeur
,
they
strike
the
Eye
with
a
pleasing
Beauty
.
<EOS>
At
the
Entrance
of
the
Grand
Court
we
see
the
Statue
of
Philip
the
Second
;
to
intimate
to
the
Spectators
,
I
suppose
,

the
Founder

<EOS>
Among
other
Parks
about
Aranjuez
there
is
one
intirely
preserved
for
Dromedaries
;
an
useful
Creature
for
Fatigue
,
Burden
,
and
Dispatch
;
but
the
nearest
of
kin
to
Deformity
of
any
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
There
are
several
other
enclosures
for
several
sorts
of
strange
and
wild
Beasts
,
which
are
sometimes
baited
in
a
very
large
Pond
<EOS>
,
that
was
shown
me
about
half
a
League
from
hence
.
<EOS>
This
is
no
ordinary
Diversion
:
but
when
the
Court
is
disposed
that
way
,
the
Beast
,
or
Beasts
,
whether
Bear
,
Lyon
,
or
Tyger
,
are
convey'd
into
a
House
prepar'd
for
that
purpose
;
whence
he
can
no
other
way
issue
than
by
a
Door
over
the
Water
,
through
,
or
over
,
which
forcing
or
flinging
himself
,
he
gradually
finds
himself
descend
into
the
very
depth
of
the
Pond
by
a
wooden
Declivity
.
<EOS>
The
Dogs
stand
ready
on
the
Banks
,
and
so
soon
as
ever
they
spye
their
Enemy
,
rush
all
at
once
into
the
Water
,
and
engage
him
.
<EOS>
A
Diversion
less
to
be
complain'd
of
than
their
Tauridores
;
because
attended
with
less
Cruelty
to
the
Beast
,
as
well
as
Danger
to
the
Spectators
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
at
Madrid
,
a
Town
much
spoken
of
by
Natives
,
as
well
as
Strangers
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
had
seen
it
before
,
I
could
hardly
restrain
my
self
from
being
surprized
to
find
it
<EOS>
only
environ'd
with
Mud
Walls
.
<EOS>
It
may
very
easily
be
imagin'd
,
they
were
never
intended
for
Defence
,
and
yet
it
was
a
long
time
before
I
could
find
any
other
use
,
or
rather
any
use
at
all
in
'em
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
was
at
last
convinc'd
of
my
Error
by
a
sensible
Increase
of
Expence
.
<EOS>
Without
the
Gates
,
to
half
a
League
without
the
Town
,
you
have
Wine
for
two
Pence
the
Quart
;
but
within
the
Place
,
you
drink
it
little
cheaper
than
you
may
in
London
.
<EOS>
The
Mud
Walls
therefore
well
enough
answer
their
Intent
of
forcing
People
to
reside
there
,
under
pretence
of
Security
;
but
in
reality
to
be
tax'd
,
for
other
Things
are
taxable
,
as
well
as
Wine
,
tho
"
not
in
like
Proportion
.
  
<EOS>
All
Embassadors
have
a
Claim
or
Privilege
,
of
bringing
in
what
Wine
<EOS>
they
please
Tax
-
free
;
and
the
King
,
to
wave
it
,
<EOS>
will
at
any
Time
purchase
that
Exemption
of
Duty
at
the
price
of
five
hundred
Pistoles
per
Annum
.
<EOS>
The
Convents
and
Nunneries
are
allowed
a
like
Licence
of
free
Importation
;
and
it
is
one
of
the
first
Advantages
they
can
boast
of
;
for
,
under
that
Licence
having
a
liberty
of
setting
up
a
Tavern
near
them
,
they
make
a
prodigious
Advantage
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
Wine
drank
and
sold
in
this
Place
,
is
for
the
most
part
a
sort
of
white
Wine
.
  
<EOS>
But
if
the
Mud
Walls
gave
me
at
first
but
a
faint
Idea
of
the
Place
;
I
was
pleasingly
disappointed
,
as
soon
as
I
enter'd
the
Gates
.
<EOS>
The
Town
then
show'd
<EOS>
itself
well
built
,
and
of
Brick
,
and
the
Streets
wide
,
long
,
and
spacious
.
<EOS>
Those
of
Atocha
,
and
Alcala
,
are
as
fine
as
any
I
ever
saw
;
yet
is
it
situated
but
very
indifferently
:
For
tho
'
they
have
what
they
call
a
River
,
to
which
they
give
the
very
fair
Name
of
la
Mansuera
,
and
over
which
they
have
built
a
curious
,
long
,
and
large
Stone
Bridge
;
yet
is
the
Course
of
it
,
in
Summer
time
especially
,
mostly
dry
.
<EOS>
This
gave
occasion
to
that
piece
of
Railery
of
a
Foreign
Embassador
,
That
the
King
would
have
don
wisely
to
have
bought
a
River
,
before
he
built
the
Bridge
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
that
little
Stream
of
a
River
which
they
boast
of
,
they
improve
as
much
as
possible
;
since
down
the
Sides
,
as
far
as
you
can
see
,
there
are
Coops
,
or
little
Places
hooped
in
,
for
People
to
wash
their
Linen
(
for
they
very
rarely
wash
in
their
own
Houses
)
nor
is
it
really
an
unpleasing
Sight
,
to
view
the
regular
Rows
of
them
at
that
cleanly
Operation
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
has
here
two
Palaces
;
one
within
the
Town
,
the
other
near
adjoining
.
<EOS>
That
in
the
Town
is
built
of
Stone
,
the
other
which
is
called
Bueno
Retiro
,
is
all
of
Brick
.
<EOS>
From
the
Town
to
this
last
,
in
Summer
time
,
there
is
a
large
covering
of
Canvas
,
propt
up
with
tall
Poles
;
under
which
People
walk
to
avoid
the
scorching
heats
of
the
Sun
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
was
passing
by
the
Chapel
of
the
Carmelites
,
I
saw
several
blind
Men
,
some
led
,
some
groping
the
Way
with
their
Sticks
,
going
into
the
Chapel
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
curiosity
to
know
the
Reason
;
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
enter'd
the
Door
,
but
was
surprized
to
see
such
a
number
of
those
unfortunate
People
,
all
kneeling
before
the
Altar
,
some
kissing
the
Ground
,
others
holding
up
their
Heads
,
crying
out
Misericordia
.
<EOS>
I
was
informed
'
twas
Saint
Lucy
's
Day
,
the
Patroness
of
the
Blind
;
therefore
all
who
were
able
,
came
upon
that
Day
to
pay
their
Devotion
:
<EOS>
So
I
left
them
,
and
directed
my
Course
towards
the
King
's
Palace
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
came
to
the
outward
Court
,
I
met
with
a
Spanish
Gentleman
of
my
Acquaintance
,
and
we
went
into
the
Piazza
's
;
whilst
we
were
talking
there
,
I
saw
several
Gentlemen
passing
by
having
Badges
on
their
Breasts
;
some
white
,
some
red
,
and
others
green
:
<EOS>
My
Friend
informed
me
that
there
were
five
Orders
of
Knighthood
in
Spain
.
<EOS>
That
of
the
Golden
Fleece
was
only
given
to
great
Princes
,
but
the
other
four
to
private
Gentlemen
,
viz
.
<EOS>
That
of
Saint
Jago
,
Alacantara
,
Saint
Salvador
de
Montreal
,
and
Monteza
.
  
<EOS>
He
likewise
told
me
,
that
there
were
above
ninety
Places
of
Grandees
,
but
never
filled
up
;
who
have
the
Privilege
of
being
cover'd
in
the
Presence
of
the
King
,
and
are
distinguished
into
three
Ranks
.
<EOS>
The
first
is
of
those
who
cover
themselves
before
they
speak
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
The
second
are
those
who
put
on
their
Hats
after
they
have
begun
to
speak
.
<EOS>
The
third
are
those
who
only
put
on
their
Hats
,
having
spoke
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
Ladies
of
the
Grandees
have
also
great
Respect
show'd
them
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
rises
up
when
they
enter
the
Chamber
,
and
offers
them
Cushions
.
  
<EOS>
No
married
Man
except
the
King
lies
in
the
Palace
,
for
all
the
Women
who
live
there
<EOS>
are
Widows
,
or
Maids
of
Honour
to
the
Queen
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
Prince
of
Asturia
's
Dinner
carried
through
the
Court
up
to
him
,
being
guarded
by
four
Gentlemen
of
the
Guards
,
one
before
,
another
behind
,
and
one
on
each
Side
,
with
their
Carbines
shoulder'd
;
the
Queen
's
came
next
,
and
the
King
's
the
last
,
guarded
as
before
,
for
they
always
dine
separately
.
<EOS>
I
observed
that
the
Gentlemen
of
the
Guards
,
though
not
on
Duty
,
yet
they
are
obliged
to
wear
their
Carbine
Belts
.

SAINT
Isodore
,
who
from
a
poor
labouring
Man
,
by
his
Sanctity
of
Life
arrived
to
the
Title
of
Saint
,
is
the
Patron
of
Madrid

has
a

dedicated

The
Sovereign
Court
of
the
Inquisition
is
held

the
President
whereof
is
called

Inquisitor
General

<EOS>
They
judge

allowing
any
Appeal
for
four
Sorts
of
Crimes
,
viz
.
<EOS>
Heresy
,
Polygamy
,
Sodomy
and
Witchcraft
,
and
when
any
are
convicted
,
'

called
the
Act

<EOS>
Most
People
believe
that
the
King
's
greatest
Revenue
consists
in
the
Gold
and
Silver
brought
from
the
West
Indies
(
which
is
a
mistake
)
for
most
Part
of
that
Wealth
belongs
to
Merchants
and
others
,
that
pay
the
Workmen
at
the
Golden
Mines
of
Potosi
,
and
the
Silver
Mines
at
Mexico
;
yet
the
King
,
as
I
have
been
informed
,
receives
about
a
Million
and
a
half
of
Gold
.
  
<EOS>
The
Spaniards
have
a
Saying
,
that
the
finest
Garden
of
Fruit
in
Spain
is
in
the
middle
of
Madrid
,
which
is
the
Plaza
or
Market
Place
,
and
truly
the
Stalls
there
are
set
forth
with
such
variety
of
delicious
fruit
,
<EOS>
that
I
must
confess
I
never
saw
any
Place
comparable
to
it
;
and
which
adds
to
my
Admiration
,
there
are
no
Gardens
or
Orchards
of
Fruit
within
some
Leagues
.
  
<EOS>
They
seldom
eat
Hares
in
Spain
but
whilst
the
Grapes
are
growing
,
and
then
they
are
so
exceeding
fat
,
they
are
knocked
down
with
Sticks
.
<EOS>
Their
Rabits
are
not
so
good
as
ours
in
England
;
they
have
great
plenty
of
Patridges
,
which
are
larger
and
finer
feather'd
than
ours
.
<EOS>
They
have
but
little
Beef
in
Spain
,
because
there
is
no
Grass
,
but
they
have
plenty
of
Mutton
,
and
exceeding
good
,
because
their
Sheep
feed
only
upon
wild
Potherbs
;
their
Pork
is
delicious
,
<EOS>
their
Hogs
feeding
only
upon
Chestnuts
and
Acorns
.

MADRID
and
Valladolid
,
though
Great
,
yet
are
only
accounted
Villages
:
<EOS>
In
the
latter
Philip
the
Second
,
by
the
persuasion
of
Parsons
an
English
Jesuit
,
erected
an
English
Seminary
;
and
Philip
the
Fourth
built
a
most
noble
Palace
,
with
extraordinary
fine
Gardens
.
<EOS>
They
say
that
Christopher
Columbus
,
who
first
discover'd
<EOS>
the
West
Indies
,
dyed
there
,
tho
'
I
have
heard
he
lies
buried
,
and
has
a
Monument
at
Sevil
.
  
<EOS>
The
Palace
in
the
Town
stands
upon
eleven
Arches
,
under
every
one
of
which
there
are
Shops
,
which
degrade
it
to
a
meer
Exchange
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
Stairs
by
which
you
ascend
up
to
the
Guard
Room
(
which
is
very
spacious
too
)
are
stately
,
large
,
and
curious
.
<EOS>
So
soon
as
you
have
pass'd
the
Guard
Room
,
you
enter
into
a
long
and
noble
Gallery
,
the
right
Hand
whereof
leads
to
the
King
's
Apartment
,
the
left
to
the
Queen
's
.
<EOS>
Entring
into
the
King
's
Apartment
you
soon
arrive
at
a
large
Room
,
where
he
keeps
his
Levee
;
on
one
side
whereof
(
for
it
takes
up
the
whole
Side
)
is
painted
the
fatal
Battle
of
Almanza
.
<EOS>
I
confess
the
View
somewhat
affected
me
,
tho
'
so
long
after
;
and
brought
to
Mind
many
old
Passages
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
Reflection
concluded
thus
in
favour
of
the
Spaniard
,
that
we
ought
to
excuse
their
Vanity
in
so
exposing
under
a
French
General
,
a
Victory
,
which
was
the
only
material
one
the
Spaniards
could
ever
boast
of
over
an
English
Army
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
State
Room
,
when
the
King
first
appears
,
every
Person
present
,
receives
him
with
a
profound
Homage
:
After
which
turning
from
the
Company
to
a
large
Velvet
Chair
,
by
which
stands
the
Father
Confessor
,
he
kneels
down
,
and
remains
some
Time
at
his
Devotion
;
which
being
over
,
<EOS>
he
rising
crosses
himself
,
and
his
Father
Confessor
having
with
the
motion
of
his
Hand
intimated
his
Benediction
,
he
then
gives
Audience
to
all
that
attend
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
receives
every
Body
with
a
seeming
Complaisance
;
and
with
an
Air
more
resembling
the
French
than
the
Spanish
Ceremony
.
<EOS>
Petitions
to
the
King
,
as
with
us
,
are
delivered
into
the
Hands
of
the
Secretary
of
State
:
<EOS>
Yet
in
one
Particular
they
are
,
in
my
Opinion
,
worthy
the
Imitation
of
other
Courts
;
the
Petitioner
is
directly
told
,
what
Day
he
must
come
for
an
Answer
to
the
Office
;
at
which
Time
he
is
sure
,
without
any
further
fruitless
Attendance
,
not
to
fail
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
Audience
being
over
,
the
King
returns
through
the
Gallery
to
his
own
Apartment
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
here
omit
an
accidental
Conversation
,
that
pass'd
between
General
Mahoni
and
my
self
in
this
Place
.
<EOS>
After
some
talk
of
the
Bravery
of
the
English
Nation
,
he
made
mention
of
General
Stanhope
,
with
a
very
peculiar
Emphasis
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
says
he
,
"
I
never
was
so
put
to
the
Nonplus
in
all
my
Days
,
as
that
General
once
put
me
in
.
<EOS>
I
was
on
the
road
from
Paris
to
Madrid
,
and
having
notice
,
that
that
General
was
going
just
the
Reverse
,
and
that
in
all
likelyhood
we
should
meet
the
next
day
:
Before
my
setting
out
in
the
Morning
,
I
took
care
to
order
my
gayest
Regimental
Apparel
,
resolving
to
make
the
best
Appearance
I
could
to
receive
so
great
a
Man
.
<EOS>
I
had
<EOS>
not
travell'd
above
four
Hours
before
I
saw
two
Gentlemen
,
who
appearing
to
be
English
,
it
induc'd
<EOS>
me
to
imagine
they
were
Forerunners
,
and
<EOS>
some
of
his
Retinue
.
<EOS>
But
how
abash'd
and
confounded
was
I
?
<EOS>
when
putting
the
Question
to
one
of
'em
,
he
made
answer
,
Sir
,
I
am
the
Person
.
<EOS>
Never
did
Moderation
put
Vanity
more
out
of
Countenance
:
<EOS>
Tho
"
to
say
Truth
,
I
cou'd
not
but
think
his
Dress
as
much
too
plain
for
General
Stanhope
,
as
I
at
that
juncture
thought
my
own
too
gay
for
Mahoni
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
added
he
,
"
that
great
Man
had
too
many
inward
great
Endowments
to
stand
in
need
of
any
outside
Decoration
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Of
all
Diversions
the
King
takes
most
delight
in
that
of
Shooting
,
which
he
performs
with
great
Exactness
and
Dexterity
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
divert
himself
at
Swallow
shooting
(
by
all
,
I
think
allow'd
to
be
the
most
difficult
)
and
exceeding
all
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
The
last
time
I
had
the
Honour
to
see
him
,
was
on
his
Return
from
that
Exercise
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
abroad
with
the
Duke
of
Medina
Sidonia
,
and
alighted
out
of
his
Coach
at
a
back
Door
of
the
Palace
,
with
three
or
four
Birds
in
his
Hand
,
which
according
to
his
usual
Custom
,
he
carried
up
to
the
Queen
with
his
own
Hands
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
two
Play
-
houses
in
Madrid
,
at
both
which
they
act
every
Day
;
but
their
Actors
,
and
their
Music
,
are
almost
too
indifferent
to
be
mentioned
.
<EOS>
The
Theatre
at
the
Bueno
Retiro
is
much
the
best
;
but
as
much
inferior
to
ours
at
London
,
as
those
at
Madrid
are
to
that
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
one
Play
,
when
both
King
and
Queen
were
present
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
splendid
Audience
,
and
a
great
Concourse
of
Ladies
;
but
the
latter
,
as
is
the
Custom
there
,
having
Lattices
before
them
,
the
Appearance
lost
most
of
its
Lustre
.
<EOS>
One
very
remarkable
Thing
happen'd
,
while
I
was
there
;
the
Ave
-
Bell
rung
in
the
Middle
of
an
Act
,
when
down
on
their
Knees
fell
every
Body
,
even
the
Players
on
the
Stage
,
in
the
Middle
of
their
Harangue
.
<EOS>
They
remained
for
some
Time
at
their
Devotion
;
then
up
they
rose
,
and
returned
to
the
Business
they
were
before
engag'd
in
,
beginning
where
they
left
off
.
  
<EOS>
The
Ladies
of
Quality
make
their
Visits
in
grand
State
and
Decorum
.
<EOS>
The
Lady
Visitant
is
carry'd
in
a
Chair
by
four
Men
;
the
two
first
,
in
all
Weathers
,
always
bare
.
<EOS>
Two
others
walk
as
a
Guard
,
one
on
each
Side
;
another
carrying
a
large
Lanthorn
for
fear
of
being
benighted
;
then
follows
a
Coach
drawn
by
six
Mules
,
with
her
Women
,
and
after
that
another
with
her
Gentlemen
;
several
Servants
walking
after
,
more
or
less
,
according
to
the
Quality
of
the
Person
.
<EOS>
They
never
suffer
their
Servants
to
over
load
a
Coach
,
as
is
frequently
seen
with
us
,
neither
do
Coachmen
or
Chairmen
go
or
drive
as
if
they
carried
Midwives
in
lieu
of
Ladies
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
they
affect
a
Motion
so
slow
and
so
stately
,
that
you
would
rather
imagine
the
Ladies
were
every
one
of
them
near
their
Time
,
and
very
apprehensive
of
a
Miscarriage
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
not
to
have
seen
here
any
Horses
in
any
Coach
,
but
in
the
King
's
,
or
an
Embassador
's
;
which
can
only
proceed
from
Custom
;
for
certainly
finer
Horses
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
World
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
Time
of
my
being
here
,
Cardinal
Giudici
was
at
Madrid
;
he
was
a
tall
,
proper
,
comely
Man
,
and
one
that
made
the
best
Appearance
.
<EOS>
Alberoni
was
there
at
the
same
Time
,
who
,
upon
the
Death
of
the
Duke
of
Vendome
,
had
the
good
Fortune
to
find
the
Princess
Ursini
his
Patroness
.
<EOS>
An
Instance
of
whose
Ingratitude
will
plead
Pardon
for
this
little
Digression
.
<EOS>
That
Princess
first
brought
Alberoni
into
Favour
at
Court
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
of
Italy
,
and
that
might
be
one
Reason
of
that
Lady
's
espousing
his
Interest
:
tho
'
<EOS>
some
there
are
,
that
assign
it
to
the
Recommendation
of
the
Duke
of
Vendome
;
with
whom
Alberoni
had
the
Honour
to
be
very
intimate
,
as
the
other
was
always
distinguish'd
<EOS>
by
that
Princess
.
<EOS>
Be
which
it
will
,
certain
it
is
,
she
was
Alberoni
's
first
,
and
sole
Patroness
;
which
gave
many
People
afterwards
a
very
smart
Occasion
of
reflecting
upon
him
,
both
as
to
his
Integrity
and
Gratitude
.
<EOS>
For
,
when
Alberoni
,
upon
the
Death
of
King
Philip
's
first
Queen
,
had
recommended
this
present
Lady
,
who
was
his
Countrywoman
,
(
she
of
Parma
,
and
he
of
Placentia
,
both
in
the
same
Dukedom
)
and
had
forwarded
her
Match
with
the
King
,
with
all
possible
Assiduity
;
and
when
that
Princess
,
pursuant
to
the
Orders
she
had
received
from
the
King
,
passed
over
into
Italy
to
accompany
the
Queen
Elect
into
her
own
Dominions
;
Alberoni
,
forgetful
of
the
Hand
that
first
advanced
him
,
sent
a
Letter
to
the
present
Queen
,
just
before
her
Landing
,
that
if
she
resolved
to
be
Queen
of
Spain
,
she
must
banish
the
Princess
Ursini
,
her
Companion
,
and
never
let
her
come
to
Court
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
that
Lady
,
to
evince
the
Extent
of
her
Power
,
and
the
Strength
of
her
Resolution
,
dipatch'd
<EOS>
that
Princess
away
,
on
her
very
Landing
,
and
before
she
had
seen
the
King
,
under
a
Detachment
of
her
own
Guards
,
into
France
;
and
all
this
without
either
allowing
her
an
Opportunity
of
justifying
her
self
,
or
assigning
the
least
Reason
for
so
uncommon
an
Action
.
<EOS>
But
the
same
Alberoni
(
though
afterwards
created
Cardinal
,
and
for
some
Time
King
Philip
's
Prime
Minion
)
soon
saw
that
Ingratitude
of
his
rewarded
in
his
own
Disgrace
,
at
the
very
same
Court
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
,
when
at
la
Mancha
,
Don
Felix
Pachero
,
in
a
Conversation
there
,
maintain'd
,
that
three
Women
,
at
that
Time
,
rul'd
the
World
,
viz
.
<EOS>
Queen
Anne
,
Madam
Mantenon
,
and
this
Princess
Ursini
.
  
<EOS>
Father
Fahy
's
Civilities
,
when
last
at
Madrid
,
exacting
of
me
some
suitable
Acknowledgment
,
I
went
to
pay
him
a
Visit
;
as
to
render
him
due
Thanks
for
the
past
,
so
to
give
him
a
further
Account
of
his
Countryman
Brennan
;
but
I
soon
found
he
did
not
much
incline
to
hear
any
Thing
more
of
Murtough
,
not
expecting
to
hear
any
Good
of
him
;
for
which
Reason
,
as
soon
as
I
well
could
,
I
changed
the
Conversation
to
another
Topick
.
<EOS>
In
which
some
Word
dropping
of
the
Count
de
Montery
,
I
told
him
,
that
I
heard
he
had
taken
Orders
,
and
officiated
at
Mass
:
<EOS>
He
made
answer
,
it
was
all
very
true
.
<EOS>
And
upon
my
intimating
,
that
I
had
the
Honour
to
serve
under
him
in
Flanders
,
on
my
first
entring
into
Service
,
and
when
he
commanded
the
Spanish
Forces
at
the
famous
Battle
of
Seneff
;
and
adding
,
that
I
could
not
but
be
surprized
,
that
he
,
who
was
then
one
of
the
brightest
Cavalieroes
of
the
Age
,
should
now
be
in
Orders
;
and
that
I
should
look
upon
it
as
a
mighty
Favour
barely
to
have
,
if
it
might
be
,
a
View
of
him
;
he
very
obligingly
told
me
,
that
he
was
very
well
acquainted
with
him
,
and
that
if
I
would
come
the
next
Day
,
he
would
not
fail
to
accompany
me
to
the
Count
's
House
.
  
<EOS>
Punctually
at
the
Time
appointed
,
I
waited
on
Father
Fahy
,
who
,
as
he
promised
,
carry'd
me
to
the
Count
's
House
:
He
was
stepping
into
his
Coach
just
as
we
got
there
;
but
seeing
Father
Fahy
,
he
advanced
towards
us
.
<EOS>
The
Father
deliver'd
<EOS>
my
Desire
in
as
handsom
a
Manner
as
could
be
,
and
concluding
with
the
Reason
of
it
,
from
my
having
been
in
that
Service
under
him
;
he
seem'd
<EOS>
very
well
pleas'd
,
but
added
,
that
there
were
not
many
beside
my
self
living
,
who
had
been
in
that
Service
with
him
.
<EOS>
After
some
other
Conversation
,
he
call'd
his
Gentleman
to
him
,
and
gave
him
particular
Orders
to
give
us
a
Frescari
,
or
in
English
,
an
Entertainment
;
so
<EOS>
taking
leave
,
he
went
into
his
Coach
,
and
we
to
our
Frescari
.
  
<EOS>
Coming
from
which
,
Father
Fahi
made
me
observe
,
in
the
open
Street
,
a
Stone
,
on
which
was
a
visible
great
Stain
of
somewhat
reddish
and
like
Blood
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
he
,
"
was
occasion'd
<EOS>
by
the
Death
of
a
Countryman
of
mine
,
who
had
the
Misfortune
to
overset
a
Child
,
coming
out
of
that
House
(
pointing
to
one
opposite
to
us
)
<EOS>
the
Child
frighted
,
though
not
hurt
,
as
is
natural
,
made
a
terrible
Outcry
;
upon
which
its
Father
coming
out
in
a
violent
Rage
(
notwithstanding
my
Countryman
beg'd
Pardon
,
and
pleaded
Sorrow
as
being
only
an
Accident
)
<EOS>
stabb'd
him
to
the
Heart
,
and
down
he
fell
upon
that
Stone
,
which
to
this
Day
retains
the
Mark
of
innocent
Blood
,
so
rashly
shed
"
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
on
,
and
told
me
,
the
Spaniard
immediately
took
Sanctuary
in
the
Church
,
whence
some
Time
after
he
made
his
Escape
.
<EOS>
But
Escapes
of
that
Nature
are
so
common
in
Spain
,
that
they
are
not
worth
wondering
at
.
<EOS>
For
even
though
it
were
for
wilful
and
premeditated
Murder
,
if
the
Murderer
have
taken
Sanctuary
,
it
was
never
known
,
that
he
was
delivered
up
to
Justice
,
though
demanded
;
but
in
some
Disguise
he
makes
his
Escape
,
or
some
Way
is
secured
against
all
the
Clamours
of
Power
or
Equity
.
<EOS>
I
have
observed
,
that
some
of
the
greatest
Quality
stop
their
Coaches
over
a
stinking
nasty
Puddle
,
which
they
often
find
in
the
Streets
,
and
holding
their
Heads
over
the
Door
,
snuff
up
the
nasty
Scent
which
ascends
,
believing
that
'
tis
extream
healthful
;
when
I
was
forced
to
hold
my
Nose
,
passing
by
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
not
convenient
to
walk
out
early
in
the
Morning
,
they
having
no
necessary
Houses
,
throw
out
their
Nastiness
in
the
Middle
of
the
Street
.
  
<EOS>
After
I
had
taken
Leave
of
Father
Fahy
,
and
return'd
<EOS>
my
Thanks
for
all
Civilities
,
I
went
to
pay
a
Visit
to
Mr.
Salter
,
who
was
Secretary
to
General
Stanhope
,
when
the
English
Forces
were
made
Prisoners
of
War
at
Breuhiga
;
going
up
Stairs
<EOS>
,
I
found
the
Door
of
his
Lodgings
a
-
jar
;
and
knocking
,
a
Person
came
to
the
Door
,
who
appeared
under
some
Surprize
at
Sight
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
know
him
,
but
inquiring
if
Mr.
Salter
was
within
;
He
answered
,
as
I
fancy'd
,
with
some
Hesitation
,
that
he
was
but
was
busy
in
an
inner
Room
.
<EOS>
However
,
though
unask'd
,
I
went
in
,
resolving
,
since
I
had
found
him
at
home
,
to
wait
his
Leisure
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
Time
Mr.
Salter
enter'd
the
Room
;
and
after
customary
Ceremonies
,
asking
my
Patience
a
little
longer
,
he
desired
I
would
sit
down
and
bear
Ensign
Fanshaw
Company
(
for
so
he
call'd
him
)
adding
at
going
out
,
he
had
a
little
Business
that
required
Dispatch
;
which
being
over
,
he
would
return
,
and
join
Company
.
  
<EOS>
The
Ensign
,
as
he
call'd
him
,
appear'd
to
me
under
a
Dishabilee
;
and
the
first
Question
he
ask'd
me
,
was
,
if
I
would
drink
a
Glass
of
English
Beer
?
<EOS>
Misled
by
his
Appearance
,
though
I
assented
,
it
was
with
a
Design
to
treat
;
which
he
would
be
no
Means
permit
;
but
calling
to
a
Servant
,
ordered
some
in
.
<EOS>
We
sat
drinking
that
Liquor
,
which
to
me
was
a
greater
Rarity
than
all
the
Wine
in
Spain
;
when
in
dropt
an
old
Acquaintance
of
mine
,
Mr.
Le
Noy
,
Secretary
to
Colonel
Nevil
.
<EOS>
He
sat
down
with
us
,
and
before
the
Glass
could
go
twice
round
,
told
Ensign
Fanshaw
,
That
his
Colonel
gave
his
humble
Service
to
him
,
and
ordered
him
to
let
him
know
,
that
he
had
but
threescore
Pistoles
by
him
,
which
he
had
sent
,
and
which
were
at
his
Service
,
as
what
he
<EOS>
pleas'd
more
should
be
,
as
soon
as
it
came
to
his
Hands
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
I
began
to
look
upon
my
Ensign
as
another
guess
Person
than
I
had
taken
him
for
;
and
Le
Noy
imagining
,
by
our
setting
cheek
by
joul
together
,
that
I
must
be
in
the
Secret
,
soon
after
gave
him
the
Title
of
Captain
.
<EOS>
This
soon
convinc'd
me
,
that
there
was
more
in
the
Matter
than
I
was
yet
Master
of
;
for
laying
Things
together
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
but
argue
within
my
self
,
that
as
it
seem'd
<EOS>
at
first
,
a
most
incredible
Thing
,
that
a
Person
of
his
Appearance
should
have
so
large
Credit
,
with
such
a
Complement
at
the
End
of
it
,
without
some
Disguise
,
and
as
from
an
Ensign
he
was
risen
to
be
a
Captain
,
in
the
taking
of
one
Bottle
of
English
Beer
;
a
little
Patience
would
let
me
into
a
Farce
,
in
which
,
at
present
,
I
had
not
the
Honour
to
bear
any
Part
but
that
of
a
Mute
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Le
Noy
took
his
leave
,
and
as
soon
as
he
had
left
us
,
and
the
other
Bottle
was
brought
in
,
Ensign
Fanshaw
began
to
open
his
Heart
,
and
tell
me
,
who
he
was
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
necessitated
,
"
said
he
,
"
to
be
under
this
Disguise
,
to
conceal
my
self
,
especially
in
this
Place
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
you
must
know
,
"
continued
he
,
"
that
when
our
Forces
were
Lords
of
this
Town
,
as
we
were
for
a
little
while
,
I
fell
under
an
Intrigue
with
another
Man
's
Wife
;
Her
Husband
was
a
Person
of
considerable
Account
;
nevertheless
the
Wife
<EOS>
show'd
me
<EOS>
all
the
Favours
that
a
Soldier
,
under
a
long
and
hard
Campaigne
,
could
be
imagined
to
ask
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
her
Relations
got
acquainted
with
our
Amour
,
and
knowing
that
I
was
among
the
Prisoners
taken
at
Breuhiga
,
are
now
upon
the
Scout
and
Enquiry
,
to
make
a
Discovery
that
may
be
of
fatal
Consequence
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
Reason
of
my
Disguise
;
this
the
unfortunate
Occasion
of
my
taking
upon
me
a
Name
that
does
not
belong
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
all
this
with
such
an
Openness
of
Heart
,
that
in
return
of
so
much
Confidence
,
I
confess'd
to
him
,
that
I
had
heard
of
the
Affair
,
for
that
it
had
made
no
little
Noise
all
over
the
Country
;
that
it
highly
behoved
him
to
take
great
Care
of
himself
,
since
as
the
Relations
on
both
Sides
were
considerable
,
he
must
consequently
be
in
great
Danger
;
That
in
Cases
of
that
Nature
,
no
People
in
the
World
carry
Things
to
greater
Extremities
,
than
the
Spaniards
.
<EOS>
He
return'd
me
<EOS>
Thanks
for
my
good
Advice
,
which
I
understood
,
in
a
few
Days
after
,
he
,
with
the
Assistance
of
his
Friends
,
had
taken
Care
to
put
in
Practice
;
for
he
was
convey'd
away
secretly
,
and
afterwards
had
the
Honour
to
be
made
a
Peer
of
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
My
Passport
being
at
last
sign'd
by
the
Count
de
las
Torres
,
I
prepared
for
a
Journey
,
I
had
long
and
ardently
wish'd
for
,
and
set
out
from
Madrid
,
in
the
Beginning
of
September
,
1712
,
in
Order
to
return
to
my
native
Country
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
I
set
forward
upon
my
Journey
,
but
having
heard
,
both
before
and
since
my
being
in
Spain
,
very
famous
Things
spoken
of
the
Escurial
;
though
it
was
a
League
out
of
my
Road
,
I
resolved
to
make
it
a
Visit
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
confess
,
when
I
came
there
,
I
was
so
far
from
condemning
my
Curiosity
,
that
I
chose
to
congratulate
my
good
Fortune
,
that
had
,
at
half
a
Day
's
Expence
,
feasted
my
Eyes
with
Extraordinaries
,
which
would
have
justify'd
a
Twelve
-
months
'
Journey
on
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
The
Structure
is
intirely
magnificent
,
beyond
any
Thing
I
ever
saw
,
or
any
Thing
my
Imagination
could
frame
.
<EOS>
It
is
composed
of
eleven
several
Quadrangles
,
with
noble
Cloisters
round
every
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
The
Front
to
the
West
is
adorn'd
with
three
stately
Gates
;
every
one
of
a
different
Model
,
yet
every
one
the
Model
of
nicest
Architecture
.
<EOS>
The
Middlemost
of
the
three
leads
into
a
fine
Chapel
of
the
Hieronomites
,
as
they
call
them
;
in
which
are
entertain'd
one
hundred
and
fifty
Monks
.
<EOS>
At
every
of
the
four
Corners
of
this
august
Fabrick
,
there
is
a
Turret
of
excellent
Workmanship
,
which
yields
to
the
Whole
an
extraordinary
Air
of
Grandure
.
<EOS>
The
King
's
Palace
is
on
the
North
,
nearest
that
Mountain
,
whence
the
Stone
it
is
built
of
was
hew'n
;
and
all
the
South
Part
is
set
off
with
many
Galleries
,
both
beautiful
and
sumptuous
.
  
<EOS>
This
prodigious
Pile
,
which
,
as
I
have
said
,
exceeds
all
that
I
ever
saw
;
and
which
would
ask
,
of
it
self
,
a
Volume
to
particularize
,
was
built
by
Philip
the
Second
.
<EOS>
He
lay'd
the
first
Stone
,
yet
liv'd
to
see
it
finished
;
and
lies
buryed
in
the
Panthaeon
,
a
Part
of
it
,
set
apart
for
the
Burial
-
place
of
succeeding
Princes
,
as
well
as
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
dedicated
to
Saint
Laurence
,
in
the
very
Foundation
;
and
therefore
built
in
the
Shape
of
a
Gridiron
,
the
Instrument
of
that
Martyr
's
Execution
;
and
in
Memory
of
a
great
Victory
obtained
on
that
Saint
's
Day
.
<EOS>
The
Stone
of
which
it
is
built
,
contrary
to
the
common
Course
,
grows
whiter
by
Age
;
and
the
Quarry
,
whence
<EOS>
it
was
dug
,
lies
near
enough
,
if
it
had
Sense
or
Ambition
,
to
grow
enamour'd
of
its
own
wonderful
Production
.
<EOS>
Some
there
are
,
who
stick
not
to
assign
this
Convenience
,
as
the
main
Cause
of
its
Situation
;
and
for
my
Part
,
I
must
agree
,
that
I
have
seen
many
other
Parts
of
Spain
,
where
that
glorious
Building
would
have
shone
with
yet
far
greater
Splendour
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
Town
of
any
Consequence
presented
it
self
in
my
Way
to
Burgos
.
<EOS>
Here
I
took
up
my
Quarters
that
Night
;
where
I
met
with
an
Irish
Priest
,
whose
Name
was
White
.
<EOS>
As
is
natural
on
such
Rencounters
,
having
answered
his
Enquiry
,
whither
I
was
going
;
he
very
kindly
told
me
,
he
should
be
very
glad
of
my
Company
as
far
as
Victoria
,
which
lay
in
my
Road
;
and
I
with
equal
Frankness
<EOS>
embrac'd
the
Offer
.
  
<EOS>
Next
Morning
,
when
we
had
mounted
our
Mules
,
and
were
got
a
little
Distance
from
Burgos
;
he
began
to
relate
to
me
a
great
many
impious
Pranks
of
an
English
Officer
,
who
had
been
a
Prisoner
there
a
little
before
I
came
;
concluding
all
,
with
some
Vehemence
,
that
he
had
given
greater
Occasion
of
Scandal
and
Infamy
to
his
native
Country
,
than
would
easily
be
wiped
off
,
or
in
a
little
Time
.
<EOS>
The
Truth
of
it
is
,
many
Particularly
,
which
he
related
to
me
,
were
too
monstrously
vile
to
admit
of
any
Repetition
here
;
and
highly
meriting
that
unfortunate
End
,
which
that
Officer
met
with
some
time
after
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
the
just
Reflection
made
by
that
Father
,
plainly
manifested
to
me
the
Folly
of
those
Gentlemen
,
who
,
by
such
Inadvertencies
,
to
say
no
worse
,
cause
the
Honour
of
the
Land
of
their
Nativity
to
be
called
in
question
.
<EOS>
For
tho
'
,
no
doubt
,
it
is
a
very
false
Conclusion
,
from
a
singular
,
to
conceive
a
general
Character
;
yet
in
a
strange
Country
,
nothing
is
more
common
,
A
Man
therefore
,
of
common
Sense
,
would
carefully
avoid
all
Occasions
of
Censure
,
if
not
in
respect
to
himself
,
yet
out
of
a
human
Regard
to
such
of
his
Countrymen
as
may
have
the
Fortune
to
come
after
him
;
and
,
it
's
more
than
probable
,
may
desire
to
hear
a
better
and
juster
Character
of
their
Country
,
and
Countrymen
,
than
he
perhaps
might
incline
to
leave
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
travelled
along
,
Father
White
told
me
,
that
near
the
Place
of
our
Quartering
that
Night
,
there
was
a
Convent
of
the
Carthusian
Order
,
which
would
be
well
worth
my
seeing
.
<EOS>
I
was
doubly
glad
to
hear
it
,
as
it
was
an
Order
most
a
Stranger
to
me
;
and
as
I
had
often
heard
from
many
others
,
most
unaccountable
Relations
of
the
Severity
of
their
Way
of
Life
,
and
the
very
odd
Original
of
their
Institution
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
Morning
therefore
,
being
Sunday
,
we
took
a
Walk
to
the
Convent
.
<EOS>
It
was
situated
at
the
Foot
of
a
great
Hill
,
having
a
pretty
little
River
running
before
it
.
<EOS>
The
Hill
was
naturally
cover'd
with
Evergreens
of
various
Sorts
;
but
the
very
Summit
of
the
Rock
was
so
impending
,
that
one
would
at
first
Sight
be
led
to
apprehend
the
Destruction
of
the
Convent
,
from
the
Fall
of
it
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
which
,
they
have
very
curious
and
well
ordered
Gardens
;
which
led
me
to
observe
,
that
,
what
ever
Men
may
pretend
,
Pleasure
was
not
incompatible
with
the
most
austere
Life
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
,
if
I
may
guess
of
others
by
this
,
no
Order
in
that
Church
can
boast
of
finer
Convents
.
<EOS>
Their
Chapel
was
completely
neat
,
the
Altar
of
it
set
out
with
the
utmost
Magnificence
,
both
as
to
fine
Paintings
,
and
other
rich
Adornments
.
<EOS>
The
Building
was
answerable
to
the
rest
;
and
,
in
short
,
nothing
seem'd
omitted
,
that
might
render
it
beautiful
or
pleasant
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
had
taken
a
full
Survey
of
all
;
we
,
not
without
some
Regret
,
return'd
to
our
very
indifferent
Inn
;
Where
the
better
to
pass
away
the
Time
,
Father
White
gave
me
an
ample
Detail
of
the
Original
of
that
Order
.
<EOS>
I
had
before
-
hand
heard
somewhat
of
it
;
nevertheless
,
I
did
not
care
to
interrupt
him
,
because
I
had
a
Mind
to
hear
how
his
Account
would
agree
with
what
I
had
already
heard
.
       
<EOS>
"
Bruno
,
"
said
the
Father
,
"
the
Author
or
Founder
of
this
     
Order
,
was
not
originally
of
this
,
but
of
another
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
     
holy
Brother
of
the
same
Order
,
that
was
his
Cell
-
mate
,
or
     
Chamber
-
fellow
,
who
was
reputed
by
all
that
ever
saw
or
knew
     
him
,
for
a
Person
of
exalted
Piety
,
and
of
a
most
exact
holy
     
Life
.
<EOS>
This
man
,
Bruno
had
intimately
known
for
many
years
;
     
and
agreed
in
his
Character
,
that
general
Consent
did
him
no
     
more
than
Justice
,
having
never
observed
any
Thing
in
any
of
     
his
Actions
,
that
,
in
his
Opinion
,
could
be
offensive
to
God
     
or
Man
.
<EOS>
He
was
perpetually
at
his
Devotions
;
and
     
distinguishably
remarkable
,
for
never
permitting
any
Thing
but
     
pious
Ejaculations
to
proceed
out
of
his
Mouth
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
     
was
reputed
a
Saint
upon
Earth
.
       
<EOS>
"
This
Man
at
last
dies
,
and
,
according
to
Custom
,
is
removed
     
into
the
Chapel
of
the
Convent
,
and
there
plac'd
with
a
Cross
     
fix'd
in
his
Hands
:
Soon
after
which
,
saying
the
proper
Masses
     
for
his
Soul
,
in
the
Middle
of
their
Devotion
,
the
dead
Man
     
lifts
up
his
Head
,
and
with
an
audible
Voice
,
cry'd
out
,
     
Vocatus
sum

<EOS>
The
pious
Brethren
,
as
any
one
will
easily
     
imagine
,
were
most
prodigiously
surprised
at
such
an
Accident
,
     
and
therefore
they
earnestly
redoubled
their
Prayers
;
when
     
hfting
up
his
Head
a
second
Time
,
the
dead
Man
cried
aloud
,
     
Judicatus
sum
.
<EOS>
Knowing
his
former
Piety
,
the
pious
     
Fraternity
could
not
then
entertain
the
least
doubt
of
his
     
Felicity
;
when
,
to
their
great
Consternation
and
Confusion
,
he
     
lifted
up
his
Head
a
third
Time
,
crying
out
in
a
terrible
     
Tone
,
Damnatus
sum
;
upon
which
they
incontinently
removed
     
the
Corps
out
of
the
Chapel
,
and
threw
it
upon
the
Dunghill
.
       
<EOS>
"
Good
Bruno
,
pondering
upon
these
Passages
,
could
not
fail
     
of
drawing
this
Conclusion
;
That
if
a
Person
to
all
Appearance
     
so
holy
and
devout
,
should
miss
of
Salvation
,
it
behov'd
<EOS>
a
     
wise
Man
to
contrive
some
Way
more
certain
to
make
his
Calling
     
and
Election
sure
.
<EOS>
To
that
Purpose
he
instituted
this
strict
     
and
severe
Order
,
with
an
Injunction
to
them
sacred
as
any
     
Part
,
that
every
Professor
should
always
wear
Hair
Cloth
next
     
<EOS>
his
Skin
,
never
eat
any
Flesh
;
nor
speak
to
one
another
,
only
     
as
passing
by
,
to
say
,
Memento
mori

<EOS>
This
Account
I
found
to
agree
pretty
well
with
what
I
had
before
heard
;
but
at
the
same
Time
,
I
found
the
Redouble
of
it
made
but
<EOS>
just
the
same
Impression
,
it
had
at
first
made
upon
my
Heart
.
<EOS>
However
having
made
it
my
Observation
,
that
a
Spirit
the
least
contradictory
,
best
carries
a
Man
through
Spain
;
I
kept
Father
White
Company
,
and
in
Humour
,
'
till
we
arrived
at
Victoria
.
<EOS>
Where
he
added
one
Thing
,
by
Way
of
Appendix
,
in
Relation
to
the
Carthusians
,
That
every
Person
of
the
Society
,
is
oblig'd
<EOS>
every
Day
to
go
into
their
Place
of
Burial
,
and
take
up
as
much
Earth
,
as
he
can
hold
at
a
Grasp
with
one
Hand
,
in
order
to
prepare
his
Grave
.
  
<EOS>
Next
Day
we
set
out
for
Victoria
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sweet
,
delicious
,
and
pleasant
Town
.
<EOS>
It
received
that
Name
in
Memory
of
a
considerable
Victory
there
obtained
over
the
Moors
.
<EOS>
Leaving
this
Place
,
I
parted
with
Father
White
;
he
going
where
his
Affairs
led
him
;
and
I
to
make
the
best
of
my
Way
to
Bilboa
.
  
<EOS>
Entring
into
Biscay
,
soon
after
I
left
Victoria
,
I
was
at
a
Loss
almost
to
imagine
,
what
Country
I
was
got
into
.
<EOS>
By
my
long
Stay
in
Spain
,
I
thought
my
self
a
tolerable
Master
of
the
Tongue
;
yet
here
I
found
my
self
at
the
utmost
Loss
to
understand
Landlord
,
Landlady
,
or
any
of
the
Family
.
<EOS>
I
was
told
by
my
Muletier
,
that
they
pretend
their
Language
,
as
they
call
it
,
has
continued
uncorrupted
from
the
very
Confusion
of
Babel
;
though
if
I
might
freely
give
my
Opinion
in
the
Matter
,
I
should
rather
take
it
to
be
the
very
Corruption
of
all
that
Confusion
.
<EOS>
Another
Rhodomontado
they
have
,
(
for
in
this
they
are
perfect
Spaniards
)
that
neither
Romans
,
Carthaginians
,
Vandals
,
Goths
,
or
Moors
,
ever
totally
subdued
them
.
<EOS>
And
yet
any
Man
that
has
ever
seen
their
Country
,
might
cut
this
Knot
without
a
Hatchet
,
by
saying
truly
,
that
neither
Roman
,
Carthaginian
,
nor
any
victorious
People
,
thought
it
worth
while
to
make
a
Conquest
of
a
Country
,
so
mountainous
and
so
barren
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
Bilboa
must
be
allowed
,
tho
'
not
very
large
,
to
be
a
pretty
,
clean
and
neat
Town
.
<EOS>
Here
,
as
in
Amsterdam
,
they
allow
neither
Cart
,
nor
Coach
,
to
enter
;
but
every
Thing
of
Merchandize
is
drawn
,
and
carried
upon
Sledges
:
<EOS>
And
yet
it
is
a
Place
of
no
small
Account
,
as
to
Trade
;
and
especially
for
Iron
and
Wooll
.
<EOS>
Here
I
hop'd
to
have
met
with
an
opportunity
of
Embarking
for
England
;
but
to
my
Sorrow
I
found
my
self
disappointed
,
and
under
that
Disappointment
,
obliged
to
make
the
best
of
my
Way
to
Bayonne
.
  
<EOS>
Setting
out
for
which
Place
,
the
first
Town
of
Note
that
I
came
to
,
was
Saint
Sebastian
.
<EOS>
A
very
clean
Town
,
and
neatly
pay'd
;
which
is
no
little
Rarity
in
Spain
.
<EOS>
It
has
a
very
good
Wall
about
it
,
and
a
pretty
Citadel
.
<EOS>
At
this
Place
I
met
with
two
English
Officers
,
who
were
under
the
same
state
with
my
self
;
one
of
them
being
a
Prisoner
of
War
with
me
at
Denia
.
<EOS>
They
were
going
to
Bayonne
to
embark
for
England
as
well
as
my
self
;
so
we
agreed
to
set
out
together
for
Port
Passage
.
<EOS>
The
Road
from
St.
Sebastian
is
all
over
a
well
pav'd
Stone
Causeway
;
almost
at
the
end
whereof
,
there
accosted
us
a
great
number
of
young
Lasses
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
prettily
dress'd
,
their
long
Hair
flowing
in
a
decent
manner
over
their
Shoulders
,
and
here
and
there
decorated
with
Ribbons
of
various
Colours
,
which
wantonly
play'd
on
their
Backs
with
the
Wind
.
<EOS>
The
Sight
surpriz'd
my
Fellow
Travellers
no
less
than
me
;
and
the
more
,
as
they
advanced
directly
up
to
us
,
and
seiz'd
our
Hands
.
<EOS>
But
a
little
time
undeceiv'd
us
,
and
we
found
what
they
came
for
;
and
that
their
Contest
,
tho
'
not
so
robust
as
our
Oars
on
the
Thames
,
was
much
of
the
same
Nature
;
each
contending
who
should
have
us
for
their
Fare
.
<EOS>
For
'
tis
here
a
Custom
of
Time
out
of
mind
,
that
none
but
young
Women
should
have
the
management
and
profit
of
that
Ferry
.
<EOS>
And
tho
"
the
Ferry
is
over
an
Arm
of
the
Sea
,
very
broad
,
and
sometimes
very
rough
,
those
fair
Ferriers
manage
themselves
with
that
Dexterity
,
that
the
Passage
is
very
little
dangerous
,
and
in
calm
Weather
,
very
pleasant
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
we
made
choice
of
those
that
best
pleased
us
;
who
in
a
grateful
Return
,
led
us
down
to
their
Boat
under
a
sort
of
Music
,
which
they
,
walking
along
,
made
with
their
Oars
,
and
which
we
all
thought
far
from
being
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Thus
were
we
transported
over
to
Port
Passage
;
not
undeservedly
accounted
the
best
Harbour
in
all
the
Bay
of
Biscay
.
  
<EOS>
We
stay'd
not
long
here
after
Landing
,
resolving
,
if
possible
,
to
reach
Fonterabia
before
Night
;
but
all
the
Expedition
we
could
use
,
little
avail'd
;
for
before
we
could
reach
thither
the
Gates
were
shut
,
and
good
Nature
and
Humanity
were
so
lock'd
up
with
them
,
that
all
the
Rhetorick
we
were
Masters
of
could
not
prevail
upon
the
Governor
to
order
their
being
opened
;
for
which
Reason
we
were
obliged
to
take
up
our
Quarters
at
the
Ferry
House
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
got
up
the
next
Morning
,
we
found
the
Waters
so
broad
,
as
well
as
rough
,
that
we
began
to
enquire
after
another
Passage
;
and
were
answer'd
,
that
at
the
Isle
of
Conference
,
but
a
short
League
upwards
,
the
Passage
was
much
shorter
,
and
exposed
to
less
Danger
.
<EOS>
Such
good
Reasons
soon
determind
's
us
:
<EOS>
So
,
setting
out
we
got
there
in
a
very
little
Time
;
and
very
soon
after
were
landed
in
France
.
<EOS>
Here
we
found
a
House
of
very
good
Entertainment
,
a
Thing
we
had
long
wanted
,
and
much
lamented
the
want
of
.
  
<EOS>
We
were
hardly
well
seated
in
the
House
before
we
were
made
sensible
,
that
it
was
the
Custom
,
which
had
made
it
the
business
of
our
Host
,
to
entertain
all
his
Guests
at
first
coming
in
,
with
a
prolix
Account
of
that
remarkable
Interview
between
the
two
Kings
of
France
and
Spain
.
<EOS>
I
speak
safely
now
,
as
being
got
on
French
Ground
:
For
the
Spaniard
in
his
own
Country
would
have
made
me
to
know
,
that
putting
Spain
after
France
had
there
been
look'd
upon
as
a
meer
Solecism
in
Speech
.
<EOS>
However
,
having
refiresh'd
our
selves
,
to
show
our
deference
to
our
Host
's
Relation
,
we
agreed
to
pay
our
Respects
to
that
famous
little
Isle
he
mention'd
;
which
indeed
,
was
the
whole
burden
of
the
Design
of
our
crafty
Landlord
's
Relation
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
came
there
,
we
found
it
a
little
oval
Island
,
over
-
run
with
Weeds
,
and
surrounded
with
Reeds
and
Rushes
.
       
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
"
said
our
Landlord
(
for
he
went
with
us
)
<EOS>
"
upon
this
     
little
Spot
,
were
at
that
juncture
seen
the
two
greatest
     
Monarchs
in
the
Universe
.
<EOS>
A
noble
Pavilion
was
erected
in
the
     
very
middle
of
it
,
and
in
the
middle
of
that
was
placed
a
very
     
large
oval
Table
;
at
which
was
the
Conference
,
from
which
the
     
Place
receiv'd
its
Title
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
Bridges
rais'd
;
one
     
on
the
Spanish
side
,
the
Passage
to
which
was
a
little
upon
     
a
Descent
by
reason
of
the
Hills
adjacent
;
and
the
other
upon
     
the
French
side
,
which
as
you
see
,
was
all
upon
a
Level
.
<EOS>
The
     
Musick
playing
,
and
Trumpets
sounding
,
the
two
Kings
,
upon
a
     
Signal
agreed
upon
,
set
forward
at
the
same
time
;
the
     
Spanish
Monarch
handing
the
Infanta
his
Daughter
to
the
     
Place
of
Interview
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
enter'd
<EOS>
the
Pavilion
,
     
on
each
Side
,
all
the
Artillery
fired
,
and
both
Annies
after
     
that
made
their
several
Vollies
.
<EOS>
Then
the
King
of
Spain
     
advancing
on
his
side
the
Table
with
the
Infanta
,
the
King
     
of
France
advanced
at
the
same
Moment
on
the
other
;
till
     
meeting
,
he
received
the
Infanta
at
the
Hands
of
her
Father
,
     
as
his
Queen
;
upon
which
,
both
the
Artillery
and
small
Arms
     
fir'd
as
before
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
was
a
most
splendid
and
sumptuous
     
Entertainment
;
which
being
over
,
both
Kings
retir'd
<EOS>
into
their
     
several
Dominions
;
the
King
of
France
conducting
his
new
     
Queen
to
Saint
Jean
de
Luz
,
where
the
Marriage
was
     
consummated
;
and
the
King
of
Spain
returning
to
Port
     
Passage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
Relation
so
very
inconsistent
with
the
present
State
of
the
Place
;
we
took
Horse
(
for
Mule
-
mounting
was
now
out
of
Fashion
)
and
rode
to
Saint
Jean
de
Luz
,
where
we
found
as
great
a
difference
in
our
Eating
and
Drinking
,
as
we
had
before
done
in
our
Riding
.
<EOS>
Here
they
might
be
properly
call'd
<EOS>
Houses
of
Entertainment
;
tho
'
generally
speaking
,
till
we
came
to
this
Place
,
we
met
with
very
mean
Fare
,
and
were
poorly
accommodated
in
the
Houses
where
we
lodged
.
  
<EOS>
A
Person
that
travels
this
way
,
would
be
esteem'd
<EOS>
a
Man
of
a
narrow
Curiosity
,
who
should
not
desire
to
see
the
Chamber
where
Louis
le
grand
took
his
first
Night
's
Lodging
with
his
Queen
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
it
was
put
into
my
Head
,
out
of
an
Ambition
to
evince
my
self
a
Person
of
Taste
,
I
asked
the
Question
,
and
the
Favour
was
granted
me
,
with
a
great
deal
of
French
Civility
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
found
any
Thing
here
,
more
than
in
the
Isle
of
Conference
,
but
what
Tradition
only
had
rendered
remarkable
.
  
<EOS>
Saint
Jean
de
Luz
is
esteem'd
<EOS>
one
of
the
greatest
Village
Towns
in
all
France
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
great
Church
of
this
Place
,
that
Lewis
XIV
according
to
Marriage
Articles
,
took
before
the
high
Altar
the
Oath
of
Renunciation
to
the
Crown
of
Spain
,
by
which
all
the
Issue
of
that
Marriage
were
debarred
Inheritance
,
if
Oaths
had
been
obligatory
with
Princes
.
<EOS>
The
Natives
here
are
reckon'd
expert
Seamen
;
especially
in
Whale
fishing
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
fine
Bridge
of
Wood
;
in
the
middle
of
which
is
a
Descent
,
by
Steps
,
into
a
pretty
little
Island
;
where
is
a
Chapel
,
and
a
Palace
belonging
to
the
Bishop
of
Bayonne
.
<EOS>
Here
the
Queen
Dowager
of
Spain
often
walks
to
divert
herself
;
and
on
this
Bridge
,
and
in
the
Walks
on
the
Island
,
I
had
the
Honour
to
see
that
Princess
more
than
once
.
  
<EOS>
This
Villa
not
being
above
four
Leagues
from
Bayonne
,
we
got
there
by
Dinner
time
,
where
at
an
Ordinary
of
twenty
Sous
,
we
eat
and
drank
in
Plenty
,
and
with
a
gusto
,
much
better
than
in
any
part
of
Spain
;
where
for
eating
much
worse
,
we
paid
very
much
more
.
  
<EOS>
BAYONNE
is
a
Town
strong
by
Nature
;
yet
the
Fortifications
have
been
very
much
neglected
,
since
the
building
of
the
Citadel
,
on
the
other
Side
the
River
;
which
not
only
commands
the
Town
,
but
the
Harbour
too
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
noble
Fabrick
;
fair
and
strong
,
and
rais'd
on
the
side
of
a
Hill
,
wanting
nothing
that
Art
could
furnish
,
to
render
it
impregnable
.
<EOS>
The
Marshal
Bouflers
had
the
Care
of
it
in
its
erection
;
and
there
is
a
fine
Walk
near
it
,
from
which
he
us'd
to
survey
the
Workmen
,
which
still
carries
his
Name
.
<EOS>
There
are
two
noble
Bridges
here
<EOS>
,
tho
'
both
of
Wood
,
one
over
that
River
which
runs
on
one
side
the
Town
;
the
other
over
that
,
which
divides
it
in
the
middle
,
the
Tide
runs
thro
'
both
with
vast
Rapidity
;
notwithstanding
which
,
Ships
of
Burden
come
up
,
and
paying
for
it
,
are
often
fasten'd
<EOS>
to
the
Bridge
,
while
loading
or
unloading
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
here
,
there
came
in
four
or
five
English
Ships
laden
with
Corn
,
the
first
,
as
they
told
me
,
that
had
come
in
to
unlade
there
,
since
the
beginning
of
the
War
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
Side
of
the
River
where
the
new
Citadel
is
built
,
at
a
very
little
distance
lies
Pont
d
'
<EOS>
Esprit
,
a
Place
mostly
inhabited
by
Jews
,
who
drive
a
great
Trade
there
,
and
are
esteemed
very
rich
,
tho
'
as
in
all
other
Countries
mostly
very
rogueish
.
<EOS>
Here
the
Queen
Dowager
of
Spain
has
kept
her
Court
ever
since
the
Jealousy
of
the
present
King
reclus'd
her
from
Madrid
.
<EOS>
As
Aunt
to
his
Competitor
Charles
(
now
Emperor
)
<EOS>
he
apprehended
her
Intrigueing
;
for
which
Reason
giving
her
an
Option
of
Retreat
,
that
Princess
made
choice
of
this
City
,
much
to
the
Advantage
of
the
Place
,
and
in
all
Appearance
much
to
her
own
Satisfaction
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
Lady
not
of
the
lesser
Size
;
and
lives
here
in
suitable
Splendour
,
and
not
without
the
Respect
due
to
a
Person
of
her
high
Quality
:
<EOS>
Every
time
she
goes
to
take
the
Air
,
the
Cannon
of
the
Citadel
saluting
her
,
as
she
passes
over
the
Bridge
;
and
to
say
Truth
,
the
Country
round
is
extremely
pleasant
,
and
abounds
in
plenty
of
all
Provisions
;
especially
in
wild
Fowl
.
<EOS>
Bayonne
Hams
are
,
to
a
Proverb
,
celebrated
all
over
France
.
  
<EOS>
We
waited
here
near
five
Months
before
the
expected
Transports
arrived
from
England
,
without
any
other
Amusements
,
than
such
as
are
common
to
People
under
Suspence
.
<EOS>
Short
Tours
will
not
admit
of
great
Varieties
;
and
much
Acquaintance
could
not
be
any
way
suitable
to
People
,
that
had
long
been
in
a
strange
Country
,
and
earnestly
desired
to
return
to
our
own
.
<EOS>
Yet
one
Accident
befell
me
here
,
that
was
nearer
costing
me
my
Life
,
than
all
I
had
before
encounter'd
,
either
in
Battle
or
Siege
.
  
<EOS>
Going
to
my
Lodgings
one
Evening
,
I
unfortunately
met
with
an
Officer
,
who
would
needs
have
me
along
with
him
,
aboard
one
of
the
English
Ships
,
to
drink
a
Bottle
of
English
Beer
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
often
invited
,
he
said
;
and
I
am
afraid
<EOS>
our
Countryman
,
continued
he
,
will
hold
himself
slighted
,
if
I
delay
it
longer
.
<EOS>
English
Beer
was
a
great
rarity
,
and
the
Vessel
lay
not
at
any
great
distance
from
my
Lodgings
;
so
without
any
further
Persuasion
I
consented
.
<EOS>
When
we
came
upon
the
Bridge
,
to
which
the
Ship
we
were
to
go
aboard
was
fastened
,
we
found
,
as
was
customary
,
as
well
as
necessary
,
a
Plank
laid
over
from
the
Ship
,
and
a
Rope
to
hold
by
,
for
safe
Passage
.
<EOS>
The
Night
was
very
dark
;
and
I
had
cautiously
enough
taken
care
to
provide
a
Man
with
a
Lanthorn
to
prevent
Casualties
.
<EOS>
The
Man
with
the
Light
went
first
,
and
out
of
his
abundant
Complaisance
,
my
Friend
,
the
Officer
,
would
have
me
follow
the
Light
:
<EOS>
But
I
was
no
sooner
stept
upon
the
Plank
after
my
Guide
,
but
Rope
and
Plank
gave
way
,
and
Guide
<EOS>
and
I
tumbled
both
together
into
the
Water
.
  
<EOS>
The
Tide
was
then
running
in
pretty
strong
:
<EOS>
However
,
my
Feet
in
the
Fall
touching
Ground
,
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
recover
my
self
a
little
;
at
which
Time
<EOS>
I
catch'd
fast
hold
of
a
Buoy
,
which
was
plac'd
over
an
Anchor
on
one
of
the
Ships
there
riding
:
I
held
fast
,
till
the
Tide
rising
stronger
and
stronger
threw
me
off
my
Feet
;
which
gave
an
Opportunity
to
the
poor
Fellow
,
our
Lanthorn
-
bearer
,
to
lay
hold
of
one
of
my
Legs
,
by
which
he
held
as
fast
as
I
by
the
Buoy
.
<EOS>
We
had
lain
thus
lovingly
at
Hull
together
,
strugling
with
the
increasing
Tide
,
which
,
well
for
us
,
did
not
break
my
hold
(
for
if
it
had
,
the
Ships
which
lay
breast
a
breast
had
certainly
sucked
us
under
)
<EOS>
when
several
on
the
Bridge
,
who
saw
us
fall
,
brought
others
with
Ropes
and
Lights
to
our
Assistance
;
and
especially
my
Brother
Officer
,
who
had
been
Accessary
as
well
as
Spectator
of
our
Calamity
;
tho
'
at
last
a
very
small
Portion
of
our
Deliverance
fell
to
his
share
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
could
feel
a
Rope
,
I
quitted
my
hold
of
the
Buoy
;
but
my
poor
Drag
at
my
Heels
would
not
on
any
account
quit
his
hold
of
my
Leg
.
<EOS>
And
as
it
was
next
to
an
Impossibility
,
in
that
Posture
to
draw
us
up
the
Bridge
to
save
both
,
if
either
of
us
,
we
must
still
have
perished
,
had
not
the
Alarm
brought
off
a
Boat
or
two
to
our
Succour
,
who
took
us
in
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
carry'd
as
fast
as
possible
,
to
a
neighbouring
House
hard
by
,
where
they
took
immediate
care
to
make
a
good
Fire
;
and
where
I
had
not
been
long
before
our
intended
Host
,
the
Master
of
the
Ship
,
came
in
very
much
concern'd
,
and
blaming
us
for
not
hailing
the
Vessel
,
before
we
made
an
Attempt
to
enter
.
<EOS>
For
,
says
he
,
the
very
Night
before
,
my
Vessel
was
robb'd
;
and
that
Plank
and
Rope
were
a
Trap
design'd
for
the
Thieves
,
if
they
came
again
;
not
imagining
that
Men
in
an
honest
way
would
have
come
on
board
without
asking
Questions
.
<EOS>
Like
the
wise
Men
of
this
World
,
I
hereupon
began
to
form
Resolutions
against
a
Thing
,
which
was
never
again
likely
to
happen
;
and
to
draw
inferences
of
Instruction
from
an
Accident
,
that
had
not
so
much
as
a
Moral
for
its
Foundation
.
  
<EOS>
One
Day
after
this
,
partly
out
of
Business
,
and
partly
out
of
Curiosity
,
I
went
to
see
the
Mint
here
,
and
having
taken
notice
to
one
of
the
Officers
,
that
there
was
a
difference
in
the
Impress
of
their
Crown
Pieces
,
one
having
at
the
bottom
the
Impress
of
a
Cow
,
and
the
other
none
:
       
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
reply'd
that
Officer
,
"
you
are
much
in
the
right
in
     
your
Observation
.
<EOS>
Those
that
have
the
Cow
,
were
not
coin'd
     
here
,
but
at
Paw
,
the
chief
City
of
Navarr
;
where
they
     
enjoy
the
Privilege
of
a
Mint
,
as
well
as
we
.
<EOS>
And
Tradition
     
tells
,
"
says
he
,
"
that
the
Reason
of
that
Addition
to
the
     
Impress
was
this
:
A
certain
King
of
Navarr
<EOS>
(
when
it
was
a
     
Kingdom
distinct
from
that
of
France
)
looking
out
of
a
     
Window
of
the
Palace
,
spy'd
<EOS>
a
Cow
,
with
her
Calf
standing
     
aside
her
,
attack'd
<EOS>
by
a
Lyon
,
which
had
got
loose
out
of
his
     
Menagery
.
<EOS>
The
Lyon
strove
to
get
the
young
Calf
into
his
Paw
;
     
the
Cow
bravely
defended
her
Charge
;
and
so
well
,
that
the
     
Lyon
at
last
,
tir'd
and
weary
,
withdrew
,
and
left
her
Mistress
     
of
the
Field
of
Battle
;
and
her
young
one
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
which
,
     
concluded
that
Officer
,
by
Order
of
that
King
,
the
Cow
is
     
<EOS>
plac'd
<EOS>
at
the
bottom
of
the
Impress
of
all
the
Money
there
     
coined
.
"
  
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
my
Relator
guess'd
<EOS>
at
the
Moral
,
or
whether
it
was
Fact
,
I
dare
not
determine
;
But
to
me
it
<EOS>
seem'd
<EOS>
apparent
,
that
it
was
no
otherways
intended
,
than
as
an
emblematical
Fable
to
cover
,
and
preserve
the
Memory
of
the
Deliverance
of
Henry
the
Fourth
,
then
the
young
King
of
Navarr
,
at
that
eternally
ignominious
Slaughter
,
the
Massacre
of
Paris
.
<EOS>
Many
Historians
,
their
own
as
well
as
others
,
agree
,
that
the
House
of
Guise
had
levell'd
<EOS>
the
Malice
of
their
Design
at
that
great
Prince
.
<EOS>
They
knew
him
to
be
the
lawful
Heir
;
but
as
they
knew
him
bred
,
what
they
call'd
<EOS>
a
Hugonot
<EOS>
,
Barbarity
and
Injustice
was
easily
conceal'd
under
the
Cloak
of
Religion
,
and
the
Good
of
Mother
Church
,
under
the
veil
of
Ambition
,
was
held
sufficient
to
postpone
the
Laws
of
God
and
Man
.
<EOS>
Some
of
those
Historians
have
deliver'd
it
as
Matter
of
Fact
,
that
the
Conspirators
,
in
searching
after
that
young
King
,
press'd
into
the
very
Apartments
of
the
Queen
his
Mother
;
who
having
,
at
the
Toll
of
the
Bell
,
and
Cries
of
the
Murder'd
,
taken
the
Alarm
,
on
hearing
'em
coming
,
plac'd
<EOS>
her
self
in
her
Chair
,
and
cover'd
<EOS>
the
young
King
her
Son
with
her
Farthingale
,
till
they
were
gone
.
<EOS>
By
which
means
she
found
an
opportunity
to
convey
him
to
a
Place
of
more
Safety
;
and
so
preserv'd
him
from
those
bloody
Murderers
,
and
in
them
from
the
Paw
of
the
Lyon
.
<EOS>
This
was
only
a
private
Reflection
of
my
own
at
that
Time
;
but
I
think
carries
so
great
<EOS>
a
Face
of
Probability
,
that
I
can
see
no
present
Reason
to
reject
it
.
<EOS>
And
to
have
sought
after
better
Information
from
the
Officer
of
the
Mint
,
had
been
to
sacrifice
my
Discretion
to
my
Curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
stay'd
at
Bayonne
,
the
Princess
Ursini
came
thither
,
attended
by
some
of
the
King
of
Spain
's
Guards
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
to
drink
the
Waters
of
some
famous
Spaw
in
the
Neighbourhood
,
the
Name
of
which
has
now
slipt
my
Memory
.
<EOS>
She
was
most
splendidly
entertain'd
by
the
Queen
Dowager
of
Spain
;
and
the
Mareschal
de
Montrevel
no
less
signaliz'd
himself
in
his
Reception
of
that
great
Lady
,
who
was
at
that
Instant
the
greatest
Favourite
in
the
Spanish
Court
;
tho
'
as
I
have
before
related
,
she
was
some
Time
after
basely
undermined
by
a
Creature
of
her
own
advancing
.
  
<EOS>
BAYONNE
is
esteem'd
the
third
Emporium
of
Trade
in
all
France
.
<EOS>
It
was
once
,
and
remain'd
long
so
,
in
the
Possession
of
the
English
;
of
which
had
History
been
silent
,
the
Cathedral
Church
had
afforded
evident
Demonstration
;
being
in
every
respect
of
the
English
Model
,
and
quite
different
to
any
of
their
own
way
of
Building
in
France
.
  
<EOS>
PAMPELONA
is
the
Capital
City
of
the
Spanish
Navarr
,
supposed
to
have
been
built
by
Pompey
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
situated
in
a
pleasant
Valley
,
surrounded
by
lofty
Hills
.
<EOS>
This
Town
,
whether
famous
or
infamous
,
was
the
Cause
of
the
first
Institution
of
the
Order
of
the
Jesuits
.
<EOS>
For
at
the
Siege
of
this
Place
Ignatius
Loyola
being
only
a
private
Soldier
,
receiv'd
a
shot
on
his
Thigh
,
which
made
him
uncapable
of
following
that
Profession
any
longer
;
upon
which
he
set
his
Brains
to
work
,
being
a
subtle
Man
,
and
invented
the
Order
of
the
Jesuits
,
which
has
been
so
troublesome
to
the
World
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
At
Saint
Stephen
near
Lerida
,
an
Action
happened
between
the
English
and
Spaniards
,
in
which
Major
General
Cunningham
bravely
fighting
at
the
Head
of
his
Men
,
lost
his
Life
,
being
extreamly
much
lamented
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
Gentleman
of
a
great
Estate
,
yet
left
it
,
to
serve
his
Country
;
Dulce
est
pro
Patria
Mori
.
  
<EOS>
About
two
Leagues
from
Victoria
,
there
is
a
very
pleasant
Hermitage
plac'd
upon
a
small
rising
Ground
,
a
murmuring
Rivulet
running
at
the
bottom
,
and
a
pretty
neat
Chapel
standing
near
it
,
in
which
I
saw
Saint
Christopher
in
a
Gigantick
Shape
,
having
a
Christo
on
his
Shoulders
.
<EOS>
The
Hermit
was
there
at
his
Devotion
,
I
ask'd
him
<EOS>
(
tho
'
<EOS>
I
knew
it
before
)
<EOS>
the
reason
why
he
was
represented
in
so
large
a
Shape
:
The
Hermit
answered
with
great
Civility
,
and
told
me
,
he
had
his
Name
from
Christo
Ferendo
,
for
when
our
Saviour
was
young
,
he
had
an
inclination
to
pass
a
River
,
so
Saint
Christopher
took
him
on
his
Shoulders
in
order
to
carry
him
over
,
and
as
the
Water
grew
deeper
and
deeper
,
so
he
grew
higher
and
higher
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
we
received
News
,
that
the
Gloucester
Man
of
War
,
with
two
Transports
,
was
arrived
at
Port
Passage
,
in
order
for
the
Transporting
of
all
the
remaining
Prisoners
of
War
into
England
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
<EOS>
march'd
<EOS>
next
Day
,
and
there
<EOS>
embark'd
.
<EOS>
But
I
having
before
agreed
with
a
Master
of
a
Vessel
,
which
was
loaded
with
Wine
for
Amsterdam
,
to
set
me
ashoar
at
Dover
,
stay'd
<EOS>
behind
,
waiting
for
that
Ship
,
as
did
that
for
a
fair
Wind
.
  
<EOS>
In
three
or
four
Days
'
Time
,
a
fine
and
fair
Gale
presented
;
of
which
the
Master
taking
due
Advantage
,
we
sail'd
over
the
Bar
into
the
Bay
of
Biscay
.
<EOS>
This
is
with
Sailors
,
to
a
Proverb
,
reckon'd
the
roughest
of
Seas
;
and
yet
on
our
Entrance
into
it
,
nothing
appear'd
<EOS>
like
it
.
'
<EOS>
Twas
smooth
as
Glass
;
a
Lady
's
Face
might
pass
for
young
,
and
in
its
Bloom
,
that
discover'd
no
more
Wrinkles
;
Yet
scarce
had
we
sail'd
three
<EOS>
Leagues
,
before
a
prodigious
Fish
presented
it
self
to
our
View
.
<EOS>
As
near
as
we
could
guess
,
it
might
be
twenty
Yards
in
Length
;
and
it
lay
sporting
it
self
on
the
surface
of
the
Sea
,
a
great
Part
appearing
out
of
the
Water
.
<EOS>
The
Sailors
,
one
and
all
,
as
soon
as
they
saw
it
,
declar'd
<EOS>
it
the
certain
Forerunner
of
a
Storm
.
<EOS>
However
,
our
Ship
kept
on
its
Course
,
before
a
fine
Gale
,
till
we
had
near
passed
over
half
the
Bay
;
when
,
all
on
a
sudden
,
there
was
such
a
hideous
Alteration
,
as
makes
Nature
recoil
on
the
very
Reflection
.
<EOS>
Those
Seas
<EOS>
that
seem'd
<EOS>
before
to
smile
upon
us
,
with
the
Aspect
of
a
Friend
,
now
in
a
Moment
chang'd
<EOS>
their
flattering
Countenance
into
that
of
an
open
Enemy
;
and
Frowns
,
the
certain
Indexes
of
Wrath
,
presented
us
with
apparent
Danger
,
of
which
little
on
this
Side
Death
could
be
the
Sequel
.
<EOS>
The
angry
Waves
cast
themselves
up
into
Mountains
,
and
scourg'd
<EOS>
the
Ship
on
every
Side
from
Poop
to
Prow
:
<EOS>
Such
Shocks
from
the
contending
Wind
and
Surges
!
<EOS>
Such
Falls
from
Precipices
of
Water
,
to
dismal
Caverns
of
the
same
uncertain
Element
!
<EOS>
Although
the
latter
seem'd
to
receive
us
in
Order
to
skreen
us
from
the
Riot
of
the
former
,
Imagination
could
offer
no
other
Advantage
than
that
of
a
Winding
-
Sheet
,
presented
and
prepared
for
our
approaching
Fate
.
<EOS>
But
why
mention
<EOS>
I
Imagination
?
<EOS>
In
me
'
twas
wholly
dormant
.
<EOS>
And
yet
those
Sons
of
stormy
Weather
,
the
Sailors
,
had
theirs
about
them
in
full
Stretch
;
for
seeing
the
Wind
and
Seas
so
very
boisterous
,
they
<EOS>
lash'd
<EOS>
the
Rudder
of
the
Ship
,
<EOS>
resolv'd
to
let
her
drive
,
and
steer
herself
;
since
it
was
past
their
Skill
to
steer
her
.
<EOS>
This
was
our
Way
of
sojourning
most
Part
of
that
tedious
Night
;
driven
where
the
Winds
and
Waves
thought
fit
to
drive
us
,
with
all
our
Sails
quite
lower'd
<EOS>
and
flat
upon
the
Deck
.
<EOS>
If
Ovid
,
in
the
little
Archipelagian
Sea
,
could
whine
out
his
jam
jam
jacturus
,
&
c.
in
this
more
dismal
Scene
,
and
much
more
dangerous
Sea
(
the
Pitch
-
like
Darkness
of
the
Night
adding
to
all
our
sad
Variety
of
Woes
)
<EOS>
what
Words
in
Verse
or
Prose
could
serve
to
paint
our
Passions
,
or
our
Expectations
?
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
our
only
Expectation
was
in
the
Return
of
Morning
;
It
came
at
last
;
yet
even
slowly
as
it
came
,
when
come
,
we
thought
it
come
too
soon
,
a
new
Scene
of
sudden
Death
being
all
the
Advantage
of
its
first
Appearance
.
<EOS>
Our
Ship
was
driving
full
Speed
,
towards
the
Breakers
on
the
Cabritton
Shore
,
between
Burdeaux
and
Bayonne
;
which
filled
us
with
Ideas
more
terrible
than
all
before
,
since
those
were
past
,
and
these
seemingly
as
certain
.
<EOS>
Beside
,
to
add
to
our
Distress
,
the
Tide
was
driving
in
,
and
consequently
must
drive
us
fast
to
visible
Destruction
.
<EOS>
A
State
so
evident
,
that
one
of
our
Sailors
,
whom
great
Experience
had
render'd
more
sensible
of
our
present
Danger
,
was
preparing
to
save
one
,
by
lashing
himself
to
the
main
Mast
,
against
the
expected
Minute
of
Desolation
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
that
melancholy
Work
,
in
utter
Despair
of
any
better
Fortune
,
when
,
as
loud
as
ever
he
could
bawl
,
he
cry'd
out
,
a
Point
,
a
Point
of
Wind
.
<EOS>
To
me
,
who
had
had
too
much
of
it
,
it
appear'd
<EOS>
like
the
Sound
of
the
last
Trump
;
but
to
the
more
intelligent
Crew
,
it
had
a
different
Sound
.
<EOS>
With
Vigour
and
Alacrity
they
started
from
their
Prayers
,
or
their
Despair
,
and
with
all
imaginable
Speed
,
unlash'd
<EOS>
the
Rudder
,
and
hoisted
all
their
Sails
.
<EOS>
Never
sure
in
Nature
did
one
Minute
produce
a
greater
Scene
of
Contraries
.
<EOS>
The
more
skilful
Sailors
took
Courage
at
this
happy
Presage
of
Deliverance
.
<EOS>
And
according
to
their
Expectation
did
it
happen
;
that
heavenly
Point
of
Wind
deliver'd
<EOS>
us
from
the
Jaws
of
those
Breakers
,
ready
open
to
devour
us
;
and
carrying
us
out
to
the
much
more
wellcome
wide
Sea
,
furnished
every
one
in
the
Ship
with
Thoughts
,
as
distant
as
we
thought
our
Danger
.
  
<EOS>
We
endeavoured
to
make
Port
Passage
;
but
our
Ship
became
unruly
,
and
would
not
answer
her
Helm
;
for
which
Reason
we
were
glad
to
go
before
the
Wind
,
and
make
for
the
Harbour
of
Saint
Jean
de
Luz
.
<EOS>
This
we
attain'd
without
any
great
Difficulty
,
and
to
the
Satisfaction
of
all
,
Sailors
as
well
as
Passengers
,
we
there
cast
Anchor
,
after
the
most
terrible
Storm
(
as
all
the
oldest
Sailors
agreed
)
and
as
much
Danger
as
ever
People
escap'd
.
  
<EOS>
Here
I
took
notice
,
that
the
Sailors
buoy'd
up
their
Cables
with
Hogsheads
;
enquiring
into
the
Reason
of
which
,
they
told
me
,
that
the
Rocks
at
the
Bottom
of
the
Harbour
were
by
Experience
found
to
be
so
very
sharp
,
that
they
would
otherwise
cut
their
Cables
asunder
.
<EOS>
Our
Ship
was
obliged
to
be
drawn
up
into
the
Dock
to
be
refitted
;
during
which
,
I
lay
in
the
Town
,
where
nothing
of
Moment
,
or
worth
reciting
,
happen'd
.
  
<EOS>
I
beg
Pardon
for
my
Errors
;
the
very
Movements
of
Princes
must
always
be
considerable
,
and
consequently
worth
Recital
.
<EOS>
While
the
Ship
lay
in
the
Dock
,
I
was
one
Evening
walking
upon
the
Bridge
,
with
the
little
Island
near
it
,
(
which
I
have
before
spoke
of
)
and
had
a
little
Spanish
Dog
along
with
me
,
when
at
the
further
End
I
spy'd
a
Lady
,
and
three
or
four
Gentlemen
in
Company
;
I
kept
on
my
Pace
of
Leisure
,
and
so
did
they
;
but
when
I
came
nearer
,
I
found
they
as
much
out
number'd
<EOS>
me
in
the
Dog
,
as
they
did
in
the
human
Kind
.
<EOS>
And
I
soon
experienced
to
my
Sorrow
,
that
their
Dogs
,
by
their
Fierceness
and
Ill
-
humour
,
were
Dogs
of
Quality
;
having
,
without
Warning
,
or
the
least
Declaration
of
War
,
fallen
upon
my
little
Dog
,
according
to
pristine
Custom
,
without
any
honourable
Regard
to
Size
,
Interest
or
Number
.
<EOS>
However
the
good
Lady
,
who
,
by
the
Privilege
of
her
Sex
,
must
be
allow'd
<EOS>
the
most
competent
Judge
of
Inequalities
,
out
of
an
Excess
of
Condescension
and
Goodness
,
came
running
to
the
Relief
of
oppressed
poor
Tony
;
and
,
in
courtly
Language
,
rated
her
own
oppressive
Dogs
for
their
great
Incivility
to
Strangers
.
<EOS>
The
Dogs
,
in
the
Middle
of
their
insulting
Wrath
,
obey'd
<EOS>
the
Lady
with
a
vast
deal
of
profound
Submission
;
which
I
could
not
much
wonder
at
,
when
I
understood
,
that
it
was
a
Queen
Dowager
of
Spain
,
who
had
chid
them
.
  
<EOS>
Our
Ship
being
now
repaired
,
and
made
fit
to
go
out
again
to
Sea
,
we
left
the
Harbour
of
Saint
Jean
de
Luz
,
and
with
a
much
better
Passage
,
as
the
last
Tempest
was
still
dancing
in
my
Imagination
,
in
ten
Days
'
Sail
we
<EOS>
reach'd
Dover
.
<EOS>
Here
I
landed
on
the
last
Day
of
March
,
1713
having
not
,
till
then
,
seen
or
touch'd
<EOS>
English
Shoar
from
the
Beginning
of
May
,
1705
.
  
<EOS>
I
took
Coach
directly
for
London
,
where
,
when
I
arriv'd
,
I
thought
my
self
transported
into
a
Country
more
foreign
,
than
any
I
had
either
fought
or
pilgrimag'd
in
.
<EOS>
Not
foreign
,
do
I
mean
,
in
respect
to
others
,
so
much
as
to
it
self
.
<EOS>
I
left
it
,
seemingly
,
under
a
perfect
Unanimity
:
<EOS>
The
fatal
Distinctions
of
Whig
and
Tory
were
then
esteemed
meerly
nominal
;
and
of
no
more
ill
Consequence
or
Danger
,
than
a
Bee
robb'd
of
its
Sting
.
<EOS>
The
national
Concern
went
on
with
Vigour
,
and
the
prodigious
Success
of
the
Queen
's
Arms
,
left
every
Soul
without
the
least
Pretence
to
a
Murmur
.
<EOS>
But
now
on
my
Return
,
I
found
them
on
their
old
Establishment
,
perfect
Contraries
,
and
as
unlikely
to
be
brought
to
meet
as
direct
Angles
.
<EOS>
Some
arraigning
,
some
extolling
of
a
Peace
;
in
which
Time
has
shown
both
were
wrong
,
and
consequently
neither
could
be
right
in
their
Notions
of
it
,
however
an
over
prejudic'd
Way
of
thinking
might
draw
them
into
one
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
Whig
and
Tory
are
,
in
my
Mind
,
the
compleatest
Paradox
in
Nature
,
and
yet
like
other
Paradoxes
,
old
as
I
am
,
I
live
in
Hope
to
see
,
before
I
die
,
those
seeming
Contraries
perfectly
reconcil'd
,
and
reduc'd
<EOS>
into
one
happy
Certainty
,
the
Publick
Good
.

Whilst
I
stay'd
at
Madrid
,
I
made
several
Visits
to
my
old
Acquaintance
General
Mahoni
.
<EOS>
I
remember
that
he
told
me
,
when
the
Earl
of
Peterborow
and
he
held
a
Conference
at
Morvidro
,
his
Lordship
used
many
Arguments
to
induce
him
to
leave
the
Spanish
Service
.
<EOS>
Mahoni
made
several
Excuses
,
especially
that
none
of
his
Religion
was
suffer'd
to
serve
in
the
English
Army
.
<EOS>
My
Lord
reply'd
,
That
he
would
undertake
to
get
him
excepted
by
an
Act
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
heard
him
speak
with
great
Respect
of
his
Lordship
,
and
was
strangely
surprized
,
that
after
so
many
glorious
Successes
he
should
be
sent
away
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
likewise
pleased
to
inform
me
,
that
at
the
Battle
of
Saragoza
,
'
twas
his
Fortune
to
make
some
of
our
Horse
to
give
way
,
and
he
pursued
them
for
a
considerable
time
;
but
at
his
Return
,
he
saw
the
Spanish
Army
in
great
Confusion
:
<EOS>
But
it
gave
him
the
Opportunity
of
attacking
our
Battery
of
Guns
;
which
he
performed
with
great
Slaughter
,
both
of
Gunners
and
Matrosses
:
<EOS>
He
at
the
same
time
inquired
,
who
'
twas
that
commanded
there
in
chief
.
<EOS>
I
informed
him
'
twas
Col
.
Bourguard
,
one
that
understood
the
Oeconomy
of
the
Train
exceeding
well
.
<EOS>
As
for
that
,
he
knew
nothing
of
;
but
that
he
would
vouch
,
he
behaved
himself
with
extraordinary
Courage
,
and
defended
the
Battery
to
the
utmost
extremity
,
receiving
several
Wounds
,
and
deserved
the
Post
in
which
he
acted
.
<EOS>
A
Gentleman
who
was
a
Prisoner
at
Gualaxara
,
informed
me
,
that
he
saw
King
Philip
riding
through
that
Town
,
being
only
attended
with
one
of
his
Guards
.
  
<EOS>
Saragoza
,
or
Caesar
Augusta
,
lies
upon
the
River
Ebro
,
being
the
Capital
of
Arragon
;
'
tis
a
very
ancient
City
,
and
contains
fourteen
great
Churches
,
and
twelve
Convents
.
<EOS>
The
Church
of
the
Lady
of
the
Pillar
is
frequented
by
Pilgrims
,
almost
from
all
Countries
;

twas
anciently
a
