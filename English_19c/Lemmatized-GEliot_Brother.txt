among
the
many
fatality
attend|attending
the
bloom
of
young
desire
,
that
of
blindly
take|taking
to
the
confectionery
line
have
not
,
perhaps
,
be
sufficiently
consider|considered
.
how
be
the
son
of
a
british
yeoman
,
who
have
be
feed
principally
on
salt
pork
and
yeast
dumpling
,
to
know
that
there
be
satiety
for
the
human
stomach
even
in
a
paradise
of
glass
jar
full
of
sugared|sugare
almond
and
pink
lozenge
,
and
that
the
tedium
of
life
can
reach
a
pitch
where
plum-buns
at
discretion
cease
to
offer
the
slight
excitement
?
or
how
,
at
the
tender
age
when
a
confectioner
seem
to
he
a
very
prince
whom
all
the
world
must
envy
who
breakfast
on
macaroon
,
dine
on
meringue
,
sup
on
twelfth-cake
,
and
fill
up
the
intermediate
hour
with
sugar-candy
or
peppermint
how
be
he
to
foresee
the
day
of
sad
wisdom
,
when
he
will
discern
that
the
confectioner
's
calling|call
be
not
socially
influential
,
or
favourable
to
a
soaring|soar
ambition
?
i
have
know|known
a
man
who
turn|turned
out
to
have
a
metaphysical
genius
,
incautiously
,
in
the
period
of
youthful
buoyancy
,
commence
he
career
as
a
dancing-master
;
and
you
may
imagine
the
use
that
be
make
of
this
initial
mistake
by
opponent
who
feel
themselves
bind|bound
to
warn
the
public
against
he
doctrine
of
the
inconceivable
.
he
could
not
give
up
he
dancing-lessons
,
because
he
make
he
bread
by
they
,
and
metaphysic
would
not
have
find
he
in
so
much
as
salt
to
he
bread
.
it
be
really
the
same
with
mr
david
Faux
and
the
confectionery
business
.
he
uncle
,
the
butler
at
the
great
house
close
by
Brigford
,
have
make
a
pet
of
he
in
he
early
boyhood
,
and
it
be
on
a
visit
to
this
uncle
that
the
confectioner
'
shop
in
that
brilliant
town
have
,
on
a
single
day
,
fire|fired
he
tender
imagination
.
he
carry
home
the
pleasing|please
illusion
that
a
confectioner
must
be
at
once
the
happy
and
the
foremost
of
man
,
since
the
thing
he
make
be
not
only
the
most
beautiful
to
behold
,
but
the
very
good
eating|eat
,
and
such
as
the
lord
mayor
must
always
order
largely
for
he
private
recreation
;
so
that
when
he
father
declare|declared
he
must
be
put
to
a
trade
,
david
choose
he
line
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
;
and
,
with
a
rashness
inspire|inspired
by
a
sweet
tooth
,
wed|wedded
himself
irrevocably
to
confectionery
.
soon
,
however
,
the
tooth
lose|lost
it
relish
and
fall|fell
into
blank
indifference
;
and
all
the
while
,
he
mind
expand|expanded
,
he
ambition
take
new
shape
,
which
could
hardly
be
satisfy|satisfied
within
the
sphere
he
youthful
ardour
have
choose|chosen
.
but
what
be
he
to
do
?
he
be
a
young
man
of
much
mental
activity
,
and
,
above
all
,
gifted|gift
with
a
spirit
of
contrivance
;
but
then
,
he
faculty
would
not
tell
with
great
effect
in
any
other
medium
than
that
of
candied|candy
sugar
,
conserve
,
and
pastry
.
say
what
you
will
about
the
identity
of
the
reasoning|reason
process
in
all
branch
of
thought
,
or
about
the
advantage
of
come|coming
to
subject
with
a
fresh
mind
,
the
adjustment
of
butter
to
flour
,
and
of
heat
to
pastry
,
be
not
the
good
preparation
for
the
office
of
prime
minister
;
besides
,
in
the
present
imperfectly-organized
state
of
society
,
there
be
social
barrier
.
david
could
invent
delightful
thing
in
the
way
of
drop-cakes
,
and
he
have
the
wide
view
of
the
sugar
department
;
but
in
other
direction
he
certainly
feel
hamper
by
the
want
of
knowledge
and
practical
skill
;
and
the
world
be
so
inconveniently
constitute|constituted
,
that
the
vague
consciousness
of
be
a
fine
fellow
be
no
guarantee
of
success
in
any
line
of
business
.
this
difficulty
press|pressed
with
some
severity
on
mr
david
Faux
,
even
before
he
apprenticeship
be
end
.
he
soul
swell
with
an
impatient
sense
that
he
ought
to
become
something
very
remarkable
that
it
be
quite
out
of
the
question
for
he
to
put
up
with
a
narrow
lot
as
other
man
do
:
he
scorn|scorned
the
idea
that
he
could
accept
an
average
.
he
be
sure
there
be
nothing
average
about
he
:
even
such
a
person
as
mrs
Tibbits
,
the
washer-woman
,
perceive
it
,
and
probably
have
a
preference
for
he
linen
.
at
that
particular
period
he
be
weigh|weighing
out
gingerbread
nut
;
but
such
an
anomaly
could
not
continue
.
no
position
could
be
suit|suited
to
mr
david
Faux
that
be
not
in
the
high
degree
easy
to
the
flesh
and
flattering|flatter
to
the
spirit
.
if
he
have
fall|fallen
on
the
present
time
,
and
enjoy
the
advantage
of
a
mechanic
's
institute
,
he
would
certainly
have
take|taken
to
literature
and
have
write|written
review
;
but
he
education
have
not
be
liberal
.
he
have
read
some
novel
from
the
adjoining|adjoin
circulating|circulate
library
,
and
have
even
buy
the
story
of
Inkle
and
Yarico
,
which
have
make
he
feel
very
sorry
for
poor
mr
Inkle
;
so
that
he
idea
might
not
have
be
below
a
certain
mark
of
the
literary
calling|call
;
but
he
spelling|spell
and
diction
be
too
unconventional
.
when
a
man
be
not
adequately
appreciate
or
comfortably
place
in
he
own
country
,
he
thought
naturally
turn
towards
foreign
clime
;
and
david
's
imagination
circle
round
and
round
the
utmost
limit
of
he
geographical
knowledge
,
in
search
of
a
country
where
a
young
gentleman
of
pasty
visage
,
lipless
mouth
,
and
stumpy
hair
,
would
be
likely
to
be
receive|received
with
the
hospitable
enthusiasm
which
he
have
a
right
to
expect
.
have
a
general
idea
of
america
as
a
country
where
the
population
be
chiefly
black
,
it
appear
to
he
the
most
propitious
destination
for
an
emigrant
who
,
to
begin
with
,
have
the
broad
and
easily
recognizable
merit
of
whiteness
;
and
this
idea
gradually
take
such
strong
possession
of
he
that
satan
seize
the
opportunity
of
suggest
to
he
that
he
might
emigrate
under
easy
circumstance
,
if
he
supply
himself
with
a
little
money
from
he
master
's
till
.
but
that
evil
spirit
,
whose
understanding|understand
,
i
be
convinced|convince
,
have
be
much
overrated|overrate
,
quite
waste|wasted
he
time
on
this
occasion
.
david
would
certainly
have
like
well
to
have
some
of
he
master
's
money
in
he
pocket
,
if
he
have
be
sure
he
master
would
have
be
the
only
man
to
suffer
for
it
;
but
he
be
a
cautious
youth
,
and
quite
determine|determined
to
run
no
risk
on
he
own
account
.
so
he
stay
out
he
apprenticeship
,
and
commit|committed
no
act
of
dishonesty
that
be
at
all
likely
to
be
discover
,
reserve|reserving
he
plan
of
emigration
for
a
future
opportunity
.
and
the
circumstance
under
which
he
carry
it
out
be
in
this
wise
.
have
be
at
home
a
week
or
two
partaking
of
the
family
bean
,
he
have
use|used
he
leisure
in
ascertain
a
fact
which
be
of
considerable
importance
to
he
,
namely
,
that
he
mother
have
a
small
sum
in
guinea
painfully
save|saved
from
she
maiden
perquisite
,
and
keep
in
the
corner
of
a
drawer
where
she
baby-linen
have
repose
for
the
last
twenty
year
ever
since
she
son
david
have
take|taken
to
he
foot
,
with
a
slight
promise
of
bow-legs
which
have
not
be
altogether
unfulfilled
.
mr
Faux
,
senior
,
have
tell
he
son
very
frankly
,
that
he
must
not
look
to
be
set
up
in
business
by
he
:
with
seven
son
,
and
one
of
they
a
very
healthy
and
well-developed
idiot
,
who
consume
a
dumpling
about
eight
inch
in
diameter
every
day
,
it
be
pretty
well
if
they
get
a
hundred
apiece
at
he
death
.
under
these
circumstance
,
what
be
david
to
do
?
it
be
certainly
hard
that
he
should
take
he
mother
's
money
;
but
he
see
no
other
ready
means
of
get
any
,
and
it
be
not
to
be
expect|expected
that
a
young
man
of
he
merit
should
put
up
with
inconvenience
that
could
be
avoid
.
besides
,
it
be
not
robbery
to
take
property
belong|belonging
to
you
mother
:
she
do
not
prosecute
you
.
and
david
be
very
well
behave
to
he
mother
;
he
comfort
she
by
speak|speaking
highly
of
himself
to
she
,
and
assure
she
that
he
never
fall|fell
into
the
vice
he
see
practise|practised
by
other
youth
of
he
own
age
,
and
that
he
be
particularly
fond
of
honesty
.
if
he
mother
would
have
give|given
he
she
twenty
guinea
as
a
reward
of
this
noble
disposition
,
he
really
would
not
have
steal|stolen
they
from
she
,
and
it
would
have
be
more
agreeable
to
he
feeling
.
nevertheless
,
to
an
active
mind
like
david
's
,
ingenuity
be
not
without
it
pleasure
:
it
be
rather
an
interesting
occupation
to
become
stealthily
acquaint
with
the
ward
of
he
mother
's
simple
key
(
not
in
the
least
like
chubb
's
patent
)
,
and
to
get
one
that
would
do
it
work
equally
well
;
and
also
to
arrange
a
little
drama
by
which
he
would
escape
suspicion
,
and
run
no
risk
of
forfeit
the
prospective
hundred
at
he
father
's
death
,
which
would
be
convenient
in
the
improbable
case
of
he
not
make|making
a
large
fortune
in
the
"
indies
.
"
first
,
he
speak
freely
of
he
intention
to
start
shortly
for
liverpool
and
take
ship
for
america
;
a
resolution
which
cost
he
good
mother
some
pain
,
for
,
after
jacob
the
idiot
,
there
be
not
one
of
she
son
to
whom
she
heart
cling
more
than
to
she
youngest-born
,
david
.
next
,
it
appear
to
he
that
sunday
afternoon
,
when
everybody
be
go
to
church
except
jacob
and
the
cowboy
,
be
so
singularly
favourable
an
opportunity
for
son
who
want|wanted
to
appropriate
they
mother
'
guinea
,
that
he
half
think
it
must
have
be
kindly
intend|intended
by
providence
for
such
purpose
.
especially
the
third
sunday
in
lent
;
because
jacob
have
be
out
on
one
of
he
occasional
wandering
for
the
last
two
day
;
and
david
,
be
a
timid
young
man
,
have
a
considerable
dread
and
hatred
of
jacob
,
as
of
a
large
personage
who
go
about
habitually
with
a
pitchfork
in
he
hand
.
nothing
could
be
easy
,
then
,
than
for
david
on
this
sunday
afternoon
to
decline
go|going
to
church
,
on
the
ground
that
he
be
go|going
to
tea
at
mr
lunn
's
,
whose
pretty
daughter
sally
have
be
an
early
flame
of
he
,
and
,
when
the
church-goer
be
at
a
safe
distance
,
to
abstract
the
guinea
from
they
wooden
box
and
slip
they
into
a
small
canvas
bag
nothing
easy
than
to
call
to
the
cowboy
that
he
be
go|going
,
and
tell
he
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
house
for
fear
of
sunday
tramp
.
david
think
it
would
be
easy
,
too
,
to
get
to
a
small
thicket
and
bury
he
bag
in
a
hole
he
have
already
make
and
cover|covered
up
under
the
root
of
an
old
hollow
ash
,
and
he
have
,
in
fact
,
find
the
hole
without
a
moment
's
difficulty
,
have
uncover|uncovered
it
,
and
be
about
gently
to
drop
the
bag
into
it
,
when
the
sound
of
a
large
body
rustle|rustling
towards
he
with
something
like
a
bellow
be
such
a
surprise
to
david
,
who
,
as
a
gentleman
gifted|gift
with
much
contrivance
,
be
naturally
only
prepare|prepared
for
what
he
expected|expect
,
that
instead
of
drop|dropping
the
bag
gently
he
let
it
fall
so
as
to
make
it
untwist
and
vomit
forth
the
shining|shine
guinea
.
in
the
same
moment
he
look
up
and
see
he
dear
brother
jacob
close
upon
he
,
hold|holding
the
pitchfork
so
that
the
bright
smooth
prong
be
a
yard
in
advance
of
he
own
body
,
and
about
a
foot
off
david
's
.
(
a
learned|learn
friend
,
to
whom
i
once
narrate
this
history
,
observe
that
it
be
david
's
guilt
which
make
these
prong
formidable
,
and
that
the
"
men
nil
conscia
sibi
"
strip
a
pitchfork
of
all
terror
.
i
think
this
idea
so
valuable
,
that
i
obtain
he
leave
to
use
it
on
condition
of
suppress
he
name
.
)
nevertheless
,
david
do
not
entirely
lose
he
presence
of
mind
;
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
sink|sunk
on
the
earth
or
start
backward
;
whereas
he
keep
he
ground
and
smile
at
jacob
,
who
nod
he
head
up
and
down
,
and
say|said
,
"
Hoich
,
Zavy
!
"
in
a
painfully
equivocal
manner
.
david
's
heart
be
beat|beating
audibly
,
and
if
he
have
have
any
lip
they
would
have
be
pale
;
but
he
mental
activity
,
instead
of
be
paralysed|paralyse
,
be
stimulate|stimulated
.
while
he
be
inwardly
pray|praying
(
he
always
pray
when
he
be
much
frightened|frighten
)
"
oh
,
save
i
this
once
,
and
i
will
never
get
into
danger
again
!
"
he
be
thrust|thrusting
he
hand
into
he
pocket
in
search
of
a
box
of
yellow
lozenge
,
which
he
have
bring
with
he
from
Brigford
among
other
delicacy
of
the
same
portable
kind
,
as
a
means
of
conciliate
proud
beauty
,
and
more
particularly
the
beauty
of
miss
sarah
lunn
.
not
one
of
these
delicacy
have
he
ever
offer|offered
to
poor
jacob
,
for
david
be
not
a
young
man
to
waste
he
jujubes
and
barley-sugar
in
give|giving
pleasure
to
people
from
whom
he
expected|expect
nothing
.
but
an
idiot
with
equivocal
intention
and
a
pitchfork
be
as
well
worth
flatter|flattering
and
cajole
as
if
he
be
louis
napoleon
.
so
david
,
with
a
promptitude
equal
to
the
occasion
,
draw
out
he
box
of
yellow
lozenge
,
lift
the
lid
,
and
perform
a
pantomime
with
he
mouth
and
finger
,
which
be
mean
to
imply
that
he
be
delighted|delight
to
see
he
dear
brother
jacob
,
and
seize
the
opportunity
of
make|making
he
a
small
present
,
which
he
would
find
particularly
agreeable
to
the
taste
.
jacob
,
you
understand
,
be
not
an
intense
idiot
,
but
within
a
certain
limited|limit
range
know
how
to
choose
the
good
and
reject
the
evil
:
he
take
one
lozenge
,
by
way
of
test
,
and
suck
it
as
if
he
have
be
a
philosopher
;
then
,
in
as
great
an
ecstacy
at
it
new
and
complex
savour
as
caliban
at
the
taste
of
trinculo
's
wine
,
chuckle
and
stroke
this
suddenly
beneficent
brother
,
and
hold|held
out
he
hand
for
more
;
for
,
except
in
fit
of
anger
,
jacob
be
not
ferocious
or
needlessly
predatory
.
david
's
courage
half
return
,
and
he
leave|left
off
pray|praying
;
pour|pouring
a
dozen
lozenge
into
jacob
's
palm
,
and
try|trying
to
look
very
fond
of
he
.
he
congratulate
himself
that
he
have
form
the
plan
of
go|going
to
see
miss
sally
lunn
this
afternoon
,
and
that
,
as
a
consequence
,
he
have

with

he

a

indeed
,
it

always
likely
providence
should
be
fond
of
he
than
of
other

,
and
since
he
be
to

why
,
an
idiot
be
preferable
to
any

for
the
first
time
in

life
,
david
think
he
see
the
advantage
of
idiot

as
for
jacob
,
he
have
thrust
he
pitchfork
into
the
ground
,
and
have
throw
himself
down
beside
it
,
in
thorough
abandonment
to
the

pleasure
of
have
five
lozenge
in

mouth
at

if

occupy|occupied
with
the

as
not

the

before
david
could

that
be
david
's
good
hope

;
for

it

among

jacob

this
be
likely
to
be
the
most
memorable
.
"

but
the
moment
must
come
when
jacob
would
move
he
right
hand
to
draw
off
the
lid
of
the
tin
box
,
and
then
david
would
sweep
the

into
the
hole
with
the
utmost
address
and
swiftness
,
and
immediately
seat
himself
upon

.
ah
,
no
!
it
be

when

jacob

be
give|given
to

;
it
suddenly
clutch
the

and
be
raise|raised

attitude
which
promise|promised

,
descend
to

slowly
under

inspection
of

eye

david
begin
to
pray
again
,

desist

occur
to

"

david
,
summon
all

take
the
tin

from

of

the

"
gently
sweep|sweeping
they
from
jacob
's
palm
into
the
box
.
this
procedure
be
not
objectionable
to
jacob
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
guinea
clink
so
pleasantly
as
they
fall|fell
,
that
he
wish|wished
for

at

away
the

as

,
in

!
put

"
to
make
the
lesson

complete
,
he
take
a
guinea
,
and
lower|lowering
it
into
the
hole
,
say|said
,
"
put

,
as

he

,

"

put

.
jacob
turn|turned
he

on

side
,

first
at

at

,
put
on

it

with

out
tomorrow
,

all
for

!
"
jacob
,
to
whom
this
once
indifferent
brother
have
all
at
once
become
a
sort
of
sweet-tasted
fetish
,
stroke
david
's
good
coat
with
he
adhesive
finger
,
and
then
hug
he
with
an
accompaniment
of
that
mingle|mingled
chuckle
and
gurgle|gurgling
by
which
he
be
accustomed|accustom
to
express
the
mild
passion
.
but
if
he
have
choose|chosen
to
bite
a
small
morsel
out
of
he
beneficent
brother
's
cheek
,
david
would
have
be
obliged|oblige
to
bear
it
.
and
here
i
must
pause
,
to
point
out
to
you
the
short-sightedness
of
human
contrivance
.
this
ingenious
young
man
,
mr
david
Faux
,
think
he
have
achieve
a
triumph
of
cunning
when
he
have
associate|associated
himself
in
he
brother
's
rudimentary
mind
with
the
flavour
of
yellow
lozenge
.
but
he
have
yet
to
learn
that
it
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
make
an
idiot
fond
of
you
,
when
you
yourself
be
not
of
an
affectionate
disposition
:
especially
an
idiot
with
a
pitchfork
obviously
a
difficult
friend
to
shake
off
by
rough
usage
.
it
may
seem
to
you
rather
a
blundering|blunder
contrivance
for
a
clever
young
man
to
bury
the
guinea
.
but
,
if
everything
have
turn
out
as
david
have
calculate|calculated
,
you
would
have
see
that
he
plan
be
worthy
of
he
talent
.
the
guinea
would
have
lie
safely
in
the
earth
while
the
theft
be
discover
,
and
david
,
with
the
calm
of
conscious
innocence
,
would
have
linger
at
home
,
reluctant
to
say
good-bye
to
he
dear
mother
while
she
be
in
grief
about
she
guinea
;
till
at
length
,
on
the
eve
of
he
departure
,
he
would
have
disinter
they
in
the
strict
privacy
,
and
carry
they
on
he
own
person
without
inconvenience
.
but
david
,
you
perceive
,
have
reckon
without
he
host
,
or
,
to
speak
more
precisely
,
without
he
idiot
brother
an
item
of
so
uncertain
and
fluctuating|fluctuate
a
character
,
that
i
doubt
whether
he
would
not
have
puzzle
the
astute
hero
of
m.
de
balzac
,
whose
foresight
be
so
remarkably
at
home
in
the
future
.
it
be
clear
to
david
now
that
he
have
only
one
alternative
before
he
:
he
must
either
renounce
the
guinea
,
by
quietly
put|putting
they
back
in
he
mother
's
drawer
(
a
course
not
unattended
with
difficulty
)
;
or
he
must
leave
more
than
a
suspicion
behind
he
,
by
depart
early
the
next
morning
without
give|giving
notice
,
and
with
the
guinea
in
he
pocket
.
for
if
he
give
notice
that
he
be
go|going
,
he
mother
,
he
know
,
would
insist
on
fetch|fetching
from
she
box
of
guinea
the
three
she
have
always
promise
he
as
he
share
;
indeed
,
in
he
original
plan
,
he
have
count
on
this
as
a
means
by
which
the
theft
would
be
discover
under
circumstance
that
would
themselves
speak
for
he
innocence
;
but
now
,
as
i
need
hardly
explain
,
that
well-combined
plan
be
completely
frustrate|frustrated
.
even
if
david
could
have
bribe
jacob
with
perpetual
lozenge
,
an
idiot
's
secrecy
be
itself
betrayal
.
he
dare
not
even
go
to
tea
at
mr
lunn
's
,
for
in
that
case
he
would
have
lose|lost
sight
of
jacob
,
who
,
in
he
impatience
for
the
crop
of
lozenge
,
might
scratch
up
the
box
again
while
he
be
absent
,
and
carry
it
home
deprive
he
at
once
of
reputation
and
guinea
.
no
!
he
must
think
of
nothing
all
the
rest
of
this
day
,
but
of
coax|coaxing
jacob
and
keep|keeping
he
out
of
mischief
.
it
be
a
fatigue|fatiguing
and
anxious
evening
to
david
;
nevertheless
,
he
dare
not
go
to
sleep
without
tie|tying
a
piece
of
string
to
he
thumb
and
great
toe
,
to
secure
he
frequent
waking|wake
;
for
he
mean
to
be
up
with
the
first
peep
of
dawn
,
and
be
far
out
of
reach
before
breakfast-time
.
he
father
,
he
think
,
would
certainly
cut
he
off
with
a
shilling
;
but
what
then
?
such
a
striking|strike
young
man
as
he
would
be
sure
to
be
well
receive|received
in
the
west
indies
:
in
foreign
country
there
be
always
opening
even
for
cat
.
it
be
probable
that
some
princess
Yarico
would
want
he
to
marry
she
,
and
make
he
present
of
very
large
jewel
beforehand
;
after
which
,
he
need
not
marry
she
unless
he
like|liked
.
david
have
make
up
he
mind
not
to
steal
any
more
,
even
from
people
who
be
fond
of
he
:
it
be
an
unpleasant
way
of
make|making
you
fortune
in
a
world
where
you
be
likely
to
surprised|surprise
in
the
act
by
brother
.
such
alarm
do
not
agree
with
david
's
constitution
,
and
he
have
feel
so
much
nausea
this
evening
that
no
doubt
he
liver
be
affect|affected
.
besides
,
he
would
have
be
greatly
hurt
not
to
be
think
well
of
in
the
world
:
he
always
mean
to
make
a
figure
,
and
be
think
worthy
of
the
good
seat
and
the
good
morsel
.
ruminate
to
this
effect
on
the
brilliant
future
in
reserve
for
he
,
david
by
the
help
of
he
check-string
keep
himself
on
the
alert
to
seize
the
time
of
early
dawn
for
he
rising|rise
and
departure
.
he
brother
,
of
course
,
be
early
riser
,
but
he
should
anticipate
they
by
at
least
an
hour
and
a
half
,
and
the
little
room
which
he
have
to
himself
as
only
an
occasional
visitor
,
have
it
window
over
the
horse-block
,
so
that
he
could
slip
out
through
the
window
without
the
least
difficulty
.
jacob
,
the
horrible
jacob
,
have
an
awkward
trick
of
get
up
before
everybody
else
,
to
stem
he
hunger
by
empty|emptying
the
milk-bowl
that
be
"
duly
set
"
for
he
;
but
of
late
he
have
take|taken
to
sleep|sleeping
in
the
hay-loft
,
and
if
he
come
into
the
house
,
it
would
be
on
the
opposite
side
to
that
from
which
david
be
make|making
he
exit
.
there
be
no
need
to
think
of
jacob
;
yet
david
be
liberal
enough
to
bestow
a
curse
on
he
it
be
the
only
thing
he
ever
do
bestow
gratuitously
.
he
small
bundle
of
clothes
be
ready
pack|packed
,
and
he
be
soon
tread
lightly
on
the
step
of
the
horse-block
,
soon
walk|walking
at
a
smart
pace
across
the
field
towards
the
thicket
.
it
would
take
he
no
more
than
two
minute
to
get
out
the
box
;
he
could
make
out
the
tree
it
be
under
by
the
pale
strip
where
the
bark
be
off
,
although
the
dawning|dawn
light
be
rather
dim
in
the
thicket
.
but
what
,
in
the
name
of
burnt|burn
pastry
be
that
large
body
with
a
staff
plant|planted
beside
it
,
close
at
the
foot
of
the
ash-tree
?
david
pause
,
not
to
make
up
he
mind
as
to
the
nature
of
the
apparition
he
have
not
the
happiness
of
doubt|doubting
for
a
moment
that
the
staff
be
jacob
's
pitchfork
but
to
gather
the
self-command
necessary
for
address
he
brother
with
a
sufficiently
honeyed
accent
.
jacob
be
absorb|absorbed
in
scratch|scratching
up
the
earth
,
and
have
not
hear
david
's
approach
.
"
i
say
,
jacob
,
"
say|said
david
in
a
loud
whisper
,
just
as
the
tin
box
be
lift
out
of
the
hole
.
jacob
look
up
,
and
discern|discerning
he
sweet-flavoured
brother
,
nod
and
grin
in
the
dim
light
in
a
way
that
make
he
seem
to
david
like
a
triumphant
demon
.
if
he
have
be
of
an
impetuous
disposition
,
he
would
have
snatch
the
pitchfork
from
the
ground
and
impale
this
fraternal
demon
.
but
david
be
by
no
means
impetuous
;
he
be
a
young
man
greatly
give|given
to
calculate
consequence
,
a
habit
which
have
be
hold
to
be
the
foundation
of
virtue
.
but
somehow
it
have
not
precisely
that
effect
in
david
:
he
calculate
whether
an
action
would
harm
himself
,
or
whether
it
would
only
harm
other
people
.
in
the
former
case
he
be
very
timid
about
satisfy|satisfying
he
immediate
desire
,
but
in
the
latter
he
would
risk
the
result
with
much
courage
.
"
give
it
i
,
jacob
,
"
he
say|said
,
stoop
down
and
pat|patting
he
brother
.
"
let
we
see
.
"
jacob
,
find|finding
the
lid
rather
tight
,
give
the
box
to
he
brother
in
perfect
faith
.
david
raise|raised
the
lid
and
shake
he
head
,
while
jacob
put
he
finger
in
and
take
out
a
guinea
to
taste
whether
the
metamorphosis
into
lozenge
be
complete
and
satisfactory
.
"
no
,
jacob
;
too
soon
,
too
soon
,
"
say|said
david
,
when
the
guinea
have
be
taste
.
"
give
it
i
;
we
will
go
and
bury
it
somewhere
else
;
we
will
put
it
in
yonder
,
"
he
add|added
,
point|pointing
vaguely
toward
the
distance
.
david
screw
on
the
lid
,
while
jacob
,
look|looking
grave
,
rise|rose
and
grasp
he
pitchfork
.
then
,
see|seeing
david
's
bundle
,
he
snatch|snatched
it
,
like
a
too
officious
newfoundland
,
stick
he
pitchfork
into
it
and
carry
it
over
he
shoulder
in
triumph
as
he
accompany
david
and
the
box
out
of
the
thicket
.
what
on
earth
be
david
to
do
?
it
would
have
be
easy
to
frown
at
jacob
,
and
kick
he
,
and
order
he
to
get
away
;
but
david
dare
as
soon
have
kick
the
bull
.
jacob
be
quiet

with

change|changed

it
be

jacob

,
at

could

if
they
could
once
get
to
the

,
a

,
david
would
mount
it
,
have
previously
by

secure|secured

and
then

as

meanwhile
he
be
under
the

necessity
of
be
very
kind
to
this

,
and
of
provide
a
large
breakfast
for
he
when
they
stop|stopped
at

it

since
they

and
david

would
no

be
come|coming
up
soon
?
he
inquire
.
no

for
the

but
there
be
a
carrier
's
cart
to
come
immediately
,
on

to
the
next
town
.
if
he
could
slip
out
,
even
leave|leaving
he
bundle
behind
,
and
get
into
the
cart
without
jacob
!
but
there
be
a
new
obstacle
.
jacob
have
recently
discover
a
remnant
of
sugar-candy
in
one
of
he
brother
's
tail-pockets
;
and
,
since
then
,
have
cautiously
keep
he
hold
on
that
limb
of
the
garment
,
perhaps
with
an
expectation
that
there
would
be
a
far
development
of
sugar-candy
after
a
long
or
short
interval
.
now
every
one
who
have
wear|worn
a
coat
will
understand
the
sensibility
that
must
keep
a
man
from
start|starting
away
in
a
hurry
when
there
be
a
grasp
on
he
coat-tail
.
david
look
forward
to
be
well
receive|received
among
stranger
,
but
it
might
make
a
difference
if
he
have
only
one
tail
to
he
coat
.
he
feel
himself
in
a
cold
perspiration
.
he
could
walk
no
more
:
he
must
get
into
the
cart
and
let
jacob
get
in
with
he
.
presently
a
cheer|cheering
idea
occur
to
he
:
after
so
large
a
breakfast
,
jacob
would
be
sure
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
cart
;
you
see
at
once
that
david
mean
to
seize
he
bundle
,
jump
out
,
and
be
free
.
he
expectation
be
partly
fulfil|fulfilled
:
jacob
do
go
to
sleep
in
the
cart
,
but
it
be
in
a
peculiar
attitude
it
be
with
he
arm
tightly
fasten
round
he
dear
brother
's
body
;
and
if
ever
david
attempt|attempted
to
move
,
the
grasp
tighten
with
the
force
of
an
affectionate
boa-constrictor
.
"

the
carrier
,
thinking|think

david
be

and

pay

david

the

of
thieving
be
not

oh
,
why

he

he
would
show

that

he
must

it

he

with

they

naturally
give

if

it

they

that
she
could
only
think
with

of

he
would

about

when

they

towards

with

that

unconscious

and
it
be

that
,
when
business
permit

mr

think
a

of

he
think

prettiness
comparable
to
the

he
judge
she
to

on

he
think
she
worthy
to

all
the
more
so
,
because
it
would
probably
require
some
ingenuity

mr

be
capable

horse-whipping
a

rash
pretender
to
he

;
and
,
moreover
,
he
have
three

it
be

that

with

,
unless

give|given

and
the
first
idea
that
occur

in

,
that
mr

would
object
less
if
he
know
that

it

mr

the

it

and
X-shire
be
a

not

to
mr

,
he
feel

curiosity
to

,
and
especially
over
the

a
slight
flush
come
over

as
he

it
be
produce|produced
by
the
following|follow

:
"
if

"

!
"
exclaim
mr
freely
,
involuntarily
.
"
can
he
have
leave|left
i
a
legacy
?
"
perhaps
it
be
a
result
quite
different
from
you
expectation
,
that
mr
david
Faux
should
have
return
from
the
west
indies
only
a
few
year
after
he
arrival
there
,
and
have
set
up
in
he
old
business
,
like
any
plain
man
who
have
never
travel
.
but
these
case
do
occur
in
life
.
since
,
as
we
know
,
man
change
they
sky
and
see
new
constellation
without
change|changing
they
soul
,
it
will
follow
sometimes
that
they
do
not
change
they
business
under
those
novel
circumstance
.
certainly
,
this
result
be
contrary
to
david
's
own
expectation
.
he
have
look
forward
,
you
be
aware
,
to
a
brilliant
career
among
"
the
black
"
;
but
,
either
because
they
have
already
see
too
many
white
man
,
or
for
some
other
reason
,
they
do
not
at
once
recognize
he
as
a
superior
order
of
human
being
;
besides
,
there
be
no
princess
among
they
.
nobody
in
jamaica
be
anxious
to
maintain
david
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
he
society
;
and
those
hidden|hide
merit
of
a
man
which
be
so
well
know|known
to
himself
be
as
little
recognize|recognized
there
as
they
notoriously
be
in
the
effete
society
of
the
old
world
.
so
that
in
the

hint
that
david
throw|threw
out
at
the
oyster
club
about
that
life
of
Sultanic
self-indulgence
spend|spent
by

in

i

in

,
take

,

,
the

he
could

he
have
form
several
ingenious
plan
by
which
he
mean
to
circumvent
people
of
large
fortune
and
small
faculty
;
but
then
he
never
meet
with
exactly
the
right
circumstance
.
david
's
device
for
get
rich
without
work
have
apparently
no
direct
relation
with
the
world
outside
he
,
as
he
confectionery
receipt
have
.
it
be
possible
to
pass
a
great
many
bad
half
penny
and
bad
half-crown
,
but
i
believe
there
have
no
instance
be
know|known
of
pass|passing
a
halfpenny
or
a
half-crown
as
a
sovereign
.
a
sharpe
can
drive
a
brisk
trade
in
this
world
:
it
be
undeniable
that
there
may
be
a
fine
career
for
he
,
if
he
will
dare
consequence
;
but
david
be
too
timid
to
be
a
sharpe
,
or
venture
in
any
way
among
the
mantrap
of
the
law
.
he
dare
rob
nobody
but
he
mother
.
and
so
he
have
to
fall
back
on
the
genuine
value
there
be
in
he
to
be
content
to
pass
as
a
good
halfpenny
,
or
,
to
speak
more
accurately
,
as
a
good
confectioner
.
for
in
spite
of
some
additional
reading|read
and
observation
,
there
be
nothing
else
he
could
make
so
much
money
by
;
nay
,
he
find
in
himself
even
a
capability
of
extend
he
skill
in
this
direction
,
and
embrace|embracing
all
form
of
cookery
;
while
,
in
other
branch
of

labour
,
he
begin
to
see
that
it
be
not
possible
for
he
to

.
fate
be
too
strong
for
he
;
he
have
think
to

have

over

;

if

as

it
might
bring

he

he

but
for

he

and
the

,
who

often

it

that

he

the

that

he
absence

would
either
cause
