This new corpus for complexity with text in Spanish from Spain contains 60 texts, 30 of high brow, 30 of low brow.

The high brow category has been defined following the indications in a comprehensive manual of Spanish Literature: MdLE. The low brow category is composed by popular literary genres: erotic, adventure and phantasy novels.

The texts were annotated linguistically with Freeling. The differentiation between direct speech and narrative part was made with a rule-based approach using only typographic characters, which for this period is probably the best strategy.
